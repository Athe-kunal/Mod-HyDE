We investigated whether a current psychiatric disorder (1) affected the time to initiation of HAART, (2) predicted the likelihood of being prescribed HAART for at least 6 months, and (3) affected survival in urban AIDS patients.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of AIDS patients with no prior history of HAART who were enrolled and followed at the Johns Hopkins University HIV clinic between January 1996 and January 2002. Patients were stratified based on the presence of a psychiatric disorder. Cox proportional hazards regression models estimated the relative risk of receiving HAART and survival, whereas multivariate logistic regression models estimated the relative odds of remaining on HAART.
RESULTS: During the study period, 549 patients with AIDS and no prior antiretroviral treatment were enrolled in the clinic. Eighteen percent (n = 100) were defined as having a current psychiatric disorder, 39% (n = 215) were defined as having no psychiatric disorder, and 43% (n = 34) were indeterminate. Patients with a psychiatric disorder were 37% more likely to receive HAART (Cox adjusted hazard ratio [95% confidence interval (CI)]: 1.37 [1.01-1.87]), had greater than twice the odds of being prescribed HAART for at least 6 months (adjusted odds ratio [95% CI]: 2.14 [1.24-3.69]), and were 40% more likely to survive (Cox adjusted hazard ratio [95% CI]: 0.61[0.37-0.99]) as compared with those without a psychiatric disorder.
CONCLUSION: Patients with psychiatric disorders are receiving HAART and are able to reap the survival benefit by remaining on it."

METHODS: Stochastic modeling of the transmission of HIV and 6 STDs was used with parameters fitted to demographic, sexual behavior, and epidemiological data from the trials and general review of STD/HIV biology.
RESULTS: The baseline trial populations could be simulated by assuming higher risk behavior in Uganda compared with Mwanza in the 1980s, followed by reductions in risk behavior in Uganda preceding the trials. In line with trial observations, the projected HIV impacts were larger for the ST intervention in Mwanza than for the MT intervention in Rakai or the IEC and IEC + ST interventions in Masaka. All 4 simulated intervention strategies were more effective in reducing incidence of HIV infection in Mwanza than in either Rakai or Masaka.
CONCLUSIONS: Population differences in sexual behavior, curable STD rates, and HIV epidemic stage can explain most of the contrast in HIV impact observed between the 3 trials. This study supports the hypothesis that STD management is an effective HIV prevention strategy in populations with a high prevalence of curable STDs, particularly in an early HIV epidemic."
