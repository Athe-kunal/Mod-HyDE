21241647,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21241647/,"BACKGROUND: The history of auditory prosthesis has generally concentrated on bottom-up processing, that is, on audibility. However, a growing interest in top-down processing has focused on correlations between success with a hearing aid and such higher order processing as the patient's intelligence, problem solving and language skills, and the perceived effort of day-to-day listening.
PURPOSE: Examination of two cases of cognitive effects in hearing that illustrate less-often-studied issues: (1) Individual subjects in a study use different listening strategies, a fact that, if not known to the experimenter, can lead to errors in interpretation; (2) A measure of shared attention can point to otherwise unknown functional effects of an algorithm used in hearing aids.
RESEARCH DESIGN: In the two examples described above: (1) Patients with cochlear implants served in a study of the binaural precedence effect, that is, echo suppression. (2) Individuals identifying speech-in-noise benefit from noise reduction (NR) when the criterion was improved performance in simultaneous tests of verbal memory or visual reaction times.
CONCLUSIONS: Studies of hearing impairment, either in the laboratory or in a fitting session, should include study of the complex stimuli that make up the natural environment, conditions where the thinking auditory brain adopts strategies for dealing with large amounts of input data. In addition to well-known factors that must be included in communication, such things as familiarity, syntax, and semantics, the work here shows that strategic listening can affect even how we deal with seemingly simpler requirements, localizing sounds in a reverberant auditory scene and listening for speech in noise when busy with other cognitive tasks."
21241951,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21241951/,"OBJECTIVE: There is increasing interest regarding the risk and overlap of executive function deficits (EFDs) in stable cigarette smoking and substance use disorders (SUD). Therefore, we examined whether earlier EFD was a risk factor for subsequent cigarette smoking and SUD and further explored the relationship between EFD and SUD.
METHOD: We assessed 435 subjects at the 5-year follow-up (232 subjects with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD], mean age ± SD: 15.4 ± 3.43 years; and 203 controls: 16.3 ± 3.42 years) and again 4 to 5 years later as part of a prospective family study of youth with ADHD. Individuals were assessed by structured psychiatric interview for psychopathology and SUD. EFD was categorically defined in an individual who had abnormal results on at least two of six neuropsychological tests of executive functioning.
RESULTS: At the final follow-up period, ADHD was found to be a significant predictor of stable cigarette smoking (p < .01) and SUD into late adolescence and young adult years (p < .01). However, EFDs were not associated with an increase in subsequent substance use outcomes. New-onset stable cigarette smoking, but not SUD, was associated with subsequent EFD (p < .01).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results do not support the hypothesis that EFDs predicts later stable cigarette smoking or SUD in children with ADHD growing up. However, stable cigarette smoking is associated with subsequent EFD."
21242060,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21242060/,"OBJECTIVE: Studies in first episode psychosis samples about status of cardiovascular risk factors have shown discordant results. We aimed to determine the 10-year risk of developing coronary heart disease in a sample of first episode psychosis patients referred to an early intervention clinic and compared the same with age, gender, and race matched controls from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).
METHOD: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data of 56 subjects enrolled in first episode psychosis clinic from April 2006 to January 2010. This sample was compared with age, gender, and race matched 145 individuals drawn from NHANES 2005-2006 database. Sociodemographic and clinical variables were collected. Physical examination including laboratory evaluation was used to screen for common medical illnesses. The 10-year risk of developing coronary heart disease was calculated by using a tool developed by the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP-ATP III).
RESULTS: There were elevated rates of smoking (46%) and hypertension (11%) albeit statistically significant differences from the control could not be demonstrated for these measures or weight, body mass index, or total or HDL cholesterol, fasting plasma glucose, status of diabetes and impaired fasting plasma glucose, HbA1C level. The 10-year median (range) risk of developing coronary heart disease in patients and controls was 1 (0-5)% and 0 (0-9)% respectively. The difference was not statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: First episode psychosis patients do not present with significantly higher cardiovascular risk than age and race-matched controls despite clinically significant prevalence of individual risk factors. This sample presents an opportunity for early intervention for the primary prevention of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality."
21242094,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21242094/,"OBJECTIVE: The introduction of modern staging systems such as computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography/CT (PET/CT) with fluorodeoxyglucose ([(18)F]FDG) has increased the detection of small peripheral lung cancers at an early stage. We analyzed the behavior of pathological T1 non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to identify criteria predictive of nodal involvement, and the role of cancer size in lymph node metastases.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 219 patients with pathological T1 NSCLC. All patients were staged by high-resolution CT and PET as stage I, and underwent anatomical resection and radical lymphadenectomy. Our data were collected based on pathological nodule size (0-10 mm; 11-20 mm; and 21-30 mm); morphological features of lung nodule and FDG uptake of the tumor measured by standardized uptake value (SUV).
RESULTS: A total of 190 patients (87%) were pN0, 14 (6%) pN1, and 15 (7%) pN2. No nodal involvement was observed in any of the 62 patients with nodule size less than 10 mm, in 20 out of 120 patients (17%) with nodule size 11-20 mm, and in nine out of 37 tumors (28%) 21-30 mm in size (p=0.0007). All 55 patients with nodule SUV<2.0 and all 26 non-solid lesions were pN0 (respectively, p=0.0001 and p=0.03). All nodal metastases occurred among the group of 132 patients with size larger than 10 mm and SUV higher than 2.0 with a 22% rate of nodal involvement of (29 patients) (p<0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: The low probability of lymph node involvement in NSCLC <1 cm or showing glucose uptake <2 suggests lymphadenectomy could be avoided. A randomized trial should be performed to validate our data."
21242161,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21242161/,"OBJECTIVE: In 2004, the Taiwan Department of Health set the national patient safety goals. To date, however, there has been no evaluation of these goals. This study aimed to develop a method to evaluate the status of the national patient safety goals in Taiwan.
DESIGN: A cross-sectional questionnaire surveys to measure achievements on Taiwan's national patient safety goals. This survey was also followed up with an onsite audit to ensure accuracy.
SETTING: All hospitals in Taiwan.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 361 hospitals in Taiwan respond to questionnaire survey and 80 randomly selected hospitals for onsite audit.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Average scores on achievements of the national patient safety goals.
RESULTS: Among the 516 hospitals to which the questionnaire was sent, 361 (70%) responded. A total of 80 hospitals were randomly selected according to geographic location and size for onsite audit. The results show that the longer the period of implementation, the higher the average scores on achievements of the goals. After stratified analysis by hospital size, the large hospitals were found to have a higher average score in every goal, especially in the new goals. Furthermore, in terms of the difference between self-report results and the onsite audit, the score in the self-report was higher than the score given by experts upon onsite audit; however, they were similar. Most items were approximately the same in the self-report score and the onsite judgment, and those that differed were merely either one rank higher or lower.
CONCLUSION: The self-report questionnaire combined with an onsite audit appears to be a promising approach for measuring scores on achievements of the national patient safety goals. The Department of Health could conduct this program annually to evaluate the progress and propose coping strategies."
21242236,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21242236/,"OBJECTIVES: Patients can fulfil clinical criteria for remission, yet still have evidence of synovitis detectable clinically and by ultrasound, and this is associated with structural damage. Stricter remission criteria may more accurately reflect true remission (no synovitis). This hypothesis was examined by studying patients using more stringent thresholds for clinical remission and determining their levels of ultrasound synovitis.
METHODS: Rheumatoid arthritis patients with a disease activity score in 28 joints (DAS28) ≤2.6 for at least 6 months were classified using standard and more stringent DAS28 and simplified disease activity index (SDAI) remission thresholds and the corresponding clinical and ultrasound imaging measures of synovitis recorded.
RESULTS: 128 patients (all DAS28 <2.6, median DAS28 1.70) receiving either disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs alone (n=66) or with a tumour necrosis factor blocker (n=62) were recruited. Of the 640 imaged joints, 5% had moderate or severe power Doppler (PD) activity, 8% were clinically swollen and 1% tender. In patients fulfilling DAS28, American College of Rheumatology or SDAI remission criteria, moderate or severe PD activity was present in 21%, 15% and 19%, respectively. More stringent DAS28 and SDAI criteria reduced the mean number of swollen and tender joints (p<0.001) but not the percentage of patients with PD activity: 32 patients had a DAS28 <1.17 but eight (25%) had significant PD activity.
CONCLUSION: Using more stringent remission criteria resulted in reduced signs and symptoms of inflammation, but the percentage of joints with PD activity was not reduced, even in those without signs or symptoms. These data suggest that clinical criteria are sufficiently insensitive to detect low but clinically relevant levels of inflammation accurately."
21242240,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21242240/,"BACKGROUND: Preterm infants have reduced liver stores of vitamin A at birth compared to term born infants. Current guidelines recommend an intake of 700-1500 IU/kg/day vitamin A, and there is evidence to support higher doses for infants with significant lung disease. The importance of appropriate early nutrition for preterm infants is increasingly becoming apparent.
OBJECTIVES: To examine whether preterm infants admitted to a UK neonatal unit received the currently recommended amounts of vitamin A during the first 4 weeks of life, and to identify the feeding patterns associated with optimal vitamin A intake.
DESIGN: Retrospective case note review.
SETTING: UK tertiary neonatal unit.
POPULATION: 36 preterm infants with a median gestation of 30 weeks (range 26-33 weeks) and median birth weight of 1305 g (range 880-1800 g).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Mean daily total intake of vitamin A in each of the first 4 weeks of life.
RESULTS: Despite a policy of introducing intravenous lipid supplemented with fat soluble vitamins on day 2, only four infants (11%) consistently met the recommended daily intake of vitamin A during the first 2 weeks of life. Adequacy of vitamin A intake in the first 2 weeks of life was not predicted by gestation or pattern of feeding.
CONCLUSION: Recommendations for intravenous vitamin A supplementation in parenterally fed preterm infants require revision. Intravenous lipid with added fat soluble vitamins should be started as soon as possible after birth, and consideration given to early oral vitamin A supplementation in those infants tolerant of enteral feeds."
21242668,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21242668/,"BACKGROUND: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients are at risk for additional autoimmune diseases (AID).
OBJECTIVE: To compare the characteristics of associated autoimmunity among familial (parent-offspring and sib-pair) subgroups and sporadic T1D patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data regarding AID in T1D patients and their nuclear family members were extracted from medical files of 121 multiplex T1D families (58 parent-offspring, 63 sib-pairs) and 226 sporadic controls followed between 1979 and 2008.
RESULTS: The prevalence of associated autoimmunity was similar in familial and sporadic cases (33.6 vs. 32.7%). The frequency of additional AID and percentage of patients with two or more coexistent AID were significantly higher among sib-pairs than parent-offspring (p = 0.05 and p = 0.04, respectively). The median time elapsed between diagnosis of T1D and occurrence of additional autoimmunity tended to be shorter in the sib-pairs. Only in familial cases did a positive autoimmune family background predict the development of coexistent autoimmunity (OR = 2.11, CI [1.0, 4.49] p = 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Among sib-pairs with T1D, the higher prevalence of additional AID, the increased number of diseases per person, and the relatively earlier appearance of associated AID suggest an increased susceptibility for coexistent autoimmunity in this subgroup. Positive family history for autoimmunity in multiplex T1D families increased their risk for co-occurrence of AID."
21242690,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21242690/,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Conversion rates to dementia are known to be high for patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), but the diagnosis of MCI is very time-consuming. Since the Clock Drawing Test (CDT) is quick to administer, it will be of interest to compare the predictive validity of the CDT and of an MCI diagnosis for the diagnosis of dementia.
METHODS: In a sample of 384 individuals, CDT scores and the presence of MCI were assessed at baseline and then compared between individuals with an incident dementia diagnosis at follow-up and those without. Multivariate analyses, receiver operating characteristic analyses and values of sensitivity and specificity of the CDT were performed.
RESULTS: Individuals with incident dementia had significantly higher CDT scores at baseline than those without dementia. CDT was a significant predictor of incident dementia after adjusting for other factors. CDT reached a sensitivity of 68% and specificity of 65%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of CDT was 0.70 and therefore slightly lower than for MCI diagnosis (0.78).
CONCLUSIONS: Because of the only slightly lower predictive value of the CDT, its quick application and scoring compared to the MCI concept applied, it will be worthwhile to improve the CDT scoring system in order to increase the predictive validity in dementia."
21242797,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21242797/,"OBJECTIVES: Pralidoxime is an organic cation used as an antidote in addition to atropine to treat organophosphate poisoning. Pralidoxime is rapidly eliminated by the renal route and thus has limited action. The objectives of this work were as follows. 1) Study the role of organic cation transporters in the renal secretion of pralidoxime using organic cation transporter substrates (tetraethylammonium) and knockout mice (Oct1/2⁻/⁻; Oct3⁻/⁻). 2) Assess whether sustained high plasma concentrations increase pralidoxime antidotal activity toward paraoxon-induced respiratory toxicity.
SETTING: INSERM U705, Faculté de Pharmacie, Université Paris Descartes, 4 Avenue de l'Observatoire, 75006 Paris, France.
SUBJECTS: Rodents: Knockout mice (Oct1/2⁻/⁻; Oct3⁻/⁻) and Sprague-Dawley rats.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In rats, the renal clearance of pralidoxime was 3.6-fold higher than the creatinine clearance. Pretreatment with tetraethylammonium (75 mg/kg) in rats or deficiencies in organic cation transporters 1 and 2 in mice (Oct1/2⁻/⁻) resulted in a significant increase in plasma pralidoxime concentrations. Lack of Oct3 did not alter plasma pralidoxime concentrations. The antidotal activity of pralidoxime (50 mg/kg intramuscularly) was longer and with greater effect, resulting in a return to normal values when administered to rats pretreated with tetraethylammonium.
CONCLUSIONS: Pralidoxime is secreted in rats and mice by renal Oct1 and/or Oct2 but not by Oct3. Modulation of organic cation transporter activity increased the plasma pralidoxime concentrations and the antidotal effect of pralidoxime with sustained return within the normal range of respiratory variables in paraoxon-poisoned rats. These results suggest a promising approach in an animal model toward the increase in efficiency of pralidoxime. However, further studies are needed before these results are extended to human poisoning."
21242822,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21242822/,"BACKGROUND: If a self-expanding stent has been placed during endovascular treatment of an aneurysm and subsequently an open aneurysm surgery becomes necessary in the same or an adjacent area, is it possible and safe to obtain proximal control by placing a temporary clip on the artery at a point where it contains the stent?
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of temporary clip application to 3 separate stent systems in an in vitro flow model with the stated hypothesis that clip application to these stents will result in permanent stent deformation.
METHODS: This is an in vitro flow model study using an accepted synthetic blood vessel substitute. The Neuroform(3) (Boston Scientific), Enterprise (Cordis/Codman), and Pipeline (ev3) stents were deployed within the flow model; temporary clips were applied; and angiographic measurements subsequently made.
RESULTS: Two 4 × 30-mm Neuroform(3) stents, two 4.5 × 28-mm Enterprise stents, and two 3.75 × 20-mm Pipeline stents were successfully deployed and clipped repeatedly (4 iterations). Two- and 3-dimensional angiograms were obtained. After repeated clip occlusion, the Neuroform(3) and Enterprise stents returned to their original configuration and diameter. Clip application to both also resulted in immediate flow arrest. In contrast, initial clip application to the Pipeline stents did not result in flow arrest, but the second single clip application did. The Pipeline stents were also irreversibly deformed after the experimental protocol, with an average luminal diameter reduction of 26.85% (P < .05).
CONCLUSION: The Neuroform(3) and Enterprise stents responded favorably to temporary clip application, returning to their original diameter after clip removal and showing no sign of permanent structural modification. The Pipeline flow-diverting stent, however, was irreversibly deformed by clip application. These data indicate that temporary clip application to certain stents is possible. Further in vivo study is required."
21243279,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21243279/,"INTRODUCTION: Minor histocompatibility antigen HA-1 (MiHAg-HA-1) disparity between a patient and his or her human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genoidentical donor has been widely associated with an increased risk of graft-versus-host disease following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of HA-1 disparity on the incidence of both acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease in Tunisian recipients of hematopoietic stem cells.
METHODS: A total of 60 patients and their 60 respective sibling hematopoietic stem cell donors were enrolled in this study. All patients prophylactically received cyclosporine A and/or methotrexate for graft-versus-host disease. An HA-1 genotyping assay was performed with the SSP-PCR method, and HLA-A*0201- and/or HLA-A*0206-positive samples were identified using the Luminex HLA typing method.
RESULTS: The Luminex HLA typing assay showed that 54 patients were positive for either the HLA-A*0201 or HLA-A*0206 alleles. Among these cases, six pairs were mismatched for MiHAg-HA-1. Both acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease occurred in four mismatched patients (Fisher's p-values were 0.044 and 0.170, respectively). A univariate logistic regression model analysis showed that only acute graft-versus-host disease may be affected by recipient MiHAg-HA-1 disparity (p: 0.041, OR: 6.727), while chronic graft-versus-host disease correlates with both age and recipient/donor sex mismatch (p: 0.014, OR: 8.556 and p: 0.033, OR: 8.664, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Our findings support previously reported data suggesting a significant association between HA-1 disparity and the risk of acute graft-versus-host disease following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation."
21243290,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21243290/,"INTRODUCTION: Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension is a disease affecting approximately 4,000 people per year in the United States. The incidence rate in Brazil, however, is unknown. The estimated survival for patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension without treatment is approximately three years. Pulmonary thromboendarterectomy for select patients is a potentially curative procedure when correctly applied. In Brazil, the clinical and hemodynamic profiles of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension patients have yet to be described.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical and hemodynamic characteristics of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension patients scheduled for pulmonary thromboendarterectomy in a referral center for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension treatment in Brazil.
METHODS: From December 2006 to November 2009, patients were evaluated and scheduled for pulmonary thromboendarterectomy. The subjects were classified according to gender, age and functional class and were tested for thrombofilia and brain natriuretic peptide levels.
RESULTS: Thirty-five consecutive chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension patients were evaluated. Two patients tested positive for schistosomiasis, and 31 were enrolled in the study (19 female, 12 male). The majority of patients were categorized in functional classes III and IV. Hemodynamic data showed a mean pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) of 970.8 ± 494.36 dynas·s·cm-5 and a low cardiac output of 3.378 ± 1.13 L/min. Linear regression revealed a direct relation between cardiac output and pulmonary vascular resistance. Paradoxical septal movement was strongly correlated with pulmonary vascular resistance and cardiac output (p=0.001). Brain natriuretic peptide serum levels were elevated in 19 of 27 patients.
CONCLUSIONS: In a referral center for pulmonary hypertension in Brazil, chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension patients evaluated for pulmonary thromboendarterectomy had a hemodynamically severe status and had elevated brain natriuretic peptide serum levels. There was a predominance of females in our cohort, and the prevalence of hematological disorders and schistosomiasis was low (less than 10%)."
21243590,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21243590/,"AIM: The Internet provides additional and nearly endless health-related information material for the patient. On the other hand, previous studies reported on the lack of quality for health-related websites, especially for message boards. A direct analysis of treatment recommendations from message board members and spine experts has not yet been published in the medical literature. The aim of this study is to evaluate the quality of information regarding treatment of scoliosis one can receive from message board members compared to experts in this field.
METHOD: All members of one of Germany's biggest scoliosis-related message boards were invited to fill out an online questionnaire. This questionnaire included questions regarding demographic data, questions commenting on the influence of the Internet regarding their own decision finding, and six imaginary cases with four answer options each. The attendees were asked to provide the best treatment option. The answers of experts in the treatment of spinal disorders who commented on the same cases were used as control.
RESULTS: 31 complete questionnaires from Internet patients were included in the analysis and compared to 36 answers from spine experts. In four of six cases an excellent agreement could be found. There was a good agreement in one case and a poor agreement in another. The disagreement would unlikely have led to harm for the patient. One third of the patients claimed that information received from the Internet has had a major impact on their own decision finding.
CONCLUSION: The data show that treatment recommendations from members of a scoliosis-related message board have good to excellent agreement with treatment recommendations from experts in the majority of cases. The use of a message board can potentially be helpful in the care of scoliosis patients. Additional studies will evaluate whether or not the results of our study are representative for other message boards as well."
21244193,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21244193/,"INTRODUCTION: As medical education becomes more decentralised, and greater use is made of rural clinical schools and other dispersed sites, attention is being paid to the quality of the learning experiences across these sites. This article explores this issue by analysing the performance data of 4 cohorts of students in a dispersed clinical school model across 4 sites. The study is set in a newly established medical school in a regional area with a model of dispersed education, using data from the second to fifth cohorts to graduate from this school.
METHODS: Summative assessment results of 4 graduating cohorts were examined over the final 2 years of the course. Two analyses were conducted: an analysis of variance of mean scores in both years across the 4 sites; and an analysis of the effect of moving to different clinical schools on the students' rank order of performance by use of the Kruskal-Wallis test.
RESULTS: Analysis revealed no significant difference in the mean scores of the students studying at each site, and no significant differences overall in the median ranking across the years. Some small changes in the relative ranking of students were noticed, and workplace-based assessment scores in the final year were higher than the examination-based scores in the previous year.
CONCLUSIONS: The choice of clinical school site for the final 2 years of an undergraduate rural medical school appears to have no effect on mean assessment scores and only a minor effect on the rank order of student scores. Workplace-based assessment produces higher scores but also has little effect on student rank order. Further studies are necessary to replicate these findings in other settings and demonstrate that student learning experiences in rural sites, while popular with students, translate into required learning outcomes, as measured by summative assessments."
21244483,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21244483/,"AIM: A screening tool for psychosocial functioning of adolescents with diabetes is unavailable. We investigated whether one question using a Visual Analogue Scale that indicates a rating from the worst (0) to the best possible life (10) is related to standardized indices of psychosocial functioning and well-being in adolescents with diabetes mellitus type 1 (T1DM).
METHOD: One hundred and fifty-one adolescents with T1DM and 122 healthy peers between 12 and 18 years of age were asked to rate their life on a scale, varying from 0 to 10. Behaviour problems and depressive symptoms were measured with the Youth Self-Report (YSR) and the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI).
RESULTS: Adolescents with T1DM rated their life less positive in comparison with their healthy peers (F(1,269) = 14.01, p = 0.000). Adolescents with T1DM who rated their life with a 6 or lower reported more depressive symptoms and behaviour problems (F(2,131) = 24.19, p = 0.00) compared to those with higher scores (7 or up).
CONCLUSION: One question the 'rate your life scale' identified most of the adolescents at risk of internalizing behaviour problems, especially depression. The results of this first step in exploring the validity of this question as a screening tool for psychological functioning are promising."

METHODS: To investigate serum IL-18 concentrations in PCOS patients and focus on its relationship between obesity and insulin resistance (IR). Sixty consecutive women with PCOS and thirty controls were recruited. Serum level of IL-18 and fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone (T) were measured.
RESULTS: Serum levels of IL-18 was significantly higher in the PCOS group than in the control group. Serum level of IL-18 was higher in the PCOS group with IR than in the PCOS group without IR. Serum level of IL-18 was higher in obese PCOS patients than in lean PCOS patients. Serum level of IL-18 was higher in lean PCOS patients than in the lean control group. Serum level of IL-18 in the PCOS group was positively related to BMI, IR index and T.
CONCLUSION: IL-18 level was increased in PCOS patients, and correlated with insulin resistance, obesity and hyperandrogenism."
21245473,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21245473/,"OBJECTIVE: A principal reason to order a head CT scan for dizziness patients is to exclude stroke. As CT imaging is substantially limited in assessing for any acute lesions other than haemorrhage, the most important stroke syndrome adequately evaluated by CT is intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH). A population based stroke database was used to assess the frequency with which ICH might mimic a benign dizziness presentation.
METHODS: The Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi project was used to identify cases of ICH from 1 January 2000 to 26 December 2007. The hospital records of ICH cases with a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale of <2 were abstracted for more detailed information. Cases were classified as benign dizziness presentations when isolated dizziness and a normal general neurological examination were documented.
RESULTS: Of 595 ICH cases, only 2.2% (13 of 595) had dizziness as the primary presenting symptom and a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale of <2. No case mimicked a benign dizziness presentation. Only one case had isolated dizziness symptoms but this patient had dysmetria documented on the examination. All other cases had either focal or global neurological symptoms or examination abnormalities.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides further support for the notion that ICH is highly unlikely to mimic a benign dizziness presentation. Coupled with the limitations of CT to show acute ischaemia in the posterior fossa, these results suggest that screening for ICH may not be necessary in benign appearing dizziness presentations although more research is needed."
21245475,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21245475/,"OBJECTIVE: The applause sign, originally reported as a specific sign of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), has recently been found in several parkinsonian disorders. Its nature is still uncertain. It has been interpreted as a motor perseveration or a form of apraxia. The present study aims to: (a) verify the specificity of the applause sign for parkinsonian disorders, examining the presence of the applause sign in cortical dementias which should be error free and (b) clarify the nature of the applause sign (resulting or not from apraxia).
METHODS: 77 subjects were included: 10 PSP, 15 frontotemporal dementia (FTD), 29 Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 23 normal controls. The presence of apraxia was an exclusion criterion. All patients underwent a detailed neuropsychological examination, and cognitive performance was correlated to the applause sign.
RESULTS: All patient groups showed the applause sign and differed significantly from normal subjects who were error free. No difference was found when comparing PSP with FTD and FTD with AD. AD differed significantly from PSP but they were not error free (31% of patients with AD showed the applause sign). The only correlation with background neuropsychology was found for measures of executive functions.
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of the applause sign in cortical dementia does not confirm the specificity of the applause sign for parkinsonian disorders. The applause sign should be interpreted as a sign of frontal lobe dysfunction rather than a form of apraxia, and can likely be detected in any kind of disease which involves frontal lobe structures to some extent."
21245787,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21245787/,"STUDY DESIGN: Synthesis and analysis of presentation and discussion highlights, with a focus on emerging trends and promising new directions in primary care research on low back pain (LBP).
OBJECTIVE: To present a summary of findings, themes, and insights from the Tenth International Forum on Primary Care Research on Low Back Pain, a meeting of researchers designed to share the latest concepts, methods, and results of research on LBP diagnosis, treatment, and disability prevention.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Earlier Forum meetings have developed several common themes and general conclusions. These are contrasted with the presentations and discussions at the 10th International Forum.
RESULTS: Major themes included concerns about the epidemic of chronic, disabling LBP, associated treatments, iatrogenesis, and the ""LBP medical industrial complex""; the variability and complexity of outcomes and how their importance differed across patients in defining recovery and recurrence; the power of nonspecific effects, expectations, and therapeutic alliance; and the challenges of identifying important therapeutic subgroups. New research addressed early risk factor screening and linked intervention, nonmedical approaches to reframe the LBP problem and avoid unnecessary care, cognitive and behavioral aspects of LBP, and ways to train clinicians to implement these innovations. More appropriate use of longitudinal designs and a greater focus on implementation research was called for.
CONCLUSION: Although the field of primary care LBP research often seems to progress slowly, the Forum highlighted several important, promising developments that could substantially improve LBP research and primary care practice."

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Selective fusion of the thoracic curve can improve the lumbar curve inpatients with idiopathic thoracic scoliosis and a compensatory lumbar curve. Predicting improvement is controversial and determining whether to perform a selective fusion or nonselective fusion can be difficult.
METHODS: Patients had undergone either nonselective or selective spinal fusion for adolescent or juvenile idiopathic scoliosis (Lenke 1B/3B/1C/3C). Outcome measures were: coronal and sagittal thoracic Cobb angle, TL/L Cobb angles, lumbar apical vertebral translation, LSTOA and coronal decompensation. Analyses compared relationships between preoperative and postoperative radiographic measures.
RESULTS: Positive, significant correlations were found between preoperative LSTOA and preoperative TL/L Cobb angle in the nonselective (r=0.7; P<0.001) and selective (r=0.5; P<0.001) fusion groups. Mean two-year postoperative coronal TL/L Cobb angles were significantly improved in nonselective and selective fusion groups (32° and 20°, respectively, P<0.001). In the nonselective fusion group, LSTOA significantly decreased by 11° (P<0.001), and in the selective group, the LSTOA had a modest but significant decrease of 2° (P<0.001). The nonselective fusion also resulted in more lordosis between T10 and L2 (7.5° of lordosis) than the selective approach (2.7° kyphosis, P<0.001). For both groups, upper thoracic kyphosis increased after surgery (P<0.001, P<0.001). For nonselective fusions, regression modeling predicted TL/L Cobb angle at two-year follow-up based on preoperative TL/L Cobb angle and preoperative LSTOA (r=0.4, P<0.001).
CONCLUSION: Collectively, these data demonstrate the preoperative TL/L Cobb angle and LSTOA can be useful predictors of postoperative TL/L Cobb angle after a selective instrumented fusion. Analyses of distal fixation levels demonstrated that to appreciably change the LSTOA using a posterior instrumented fusion, the distal level of fixation must be beyond the lumbar apex."

OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of spinal manipulation therapy (SMT) for the management of chronic nonspecific low back pain (LBP) and to determine the effectiveness of maintenance SMT in long-term reduction of pain and disability levels associated with chronic low back conditions after an initial phase of treatments.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: SMT is a common treatment option for LBP. Numerous clinical trials have attempted to evaluate its effectiveness for different subgroups of acute and chronic LBP but the efficacy of maintenance SMT in chronic nonspecific LBP has not been studied.
METHODS: Sixty patients, with chronic, nonspecific LBP lasting at least 6 months, were randomized to receive either (1) 12 treatments of sham SMT over a 1-month period, (2) 12 treatments, consisting of SMT over a 1-month period, but no treatments for the subsequent 9 months, or (3) 12 treatments over a 1-month period, along with ""maintenance spinal manipulation"" every 2 weeks for the following 9 months. To determine any difference among therapies, we measured pain and disability scores, generic health status, and back-specific patient satisfaction at baseline and at 1-, 4-, 7-, and 10-month intervals.
RESULTS: Patients in second and third groups experienced significantly lower pain and disability scores than first group at the end of 1-month period (P = 0.0027 and 0.0029, respectively). However, only the third group that was given spinal manipulations (SM) during the follow-up period showed more improvement in pain and disability scores at the 10-month evaluation. In the nonmaintained SMT group, however, the mean pain and disability scores returned back near to their pretreatment level.
CONCLUSION: SMT is effective for the treatment of chronic nonspecific LBP. To obtain long-term benefit, this study suggests maintenance SM after the initial intensive manipulative therapy."

METHODS: This study was a retrospective review of 157 patients treated with acute diverticulitis between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2007. Diverticulitis was stratified according to the Hinchey classification. Patients were divided into 2 populations: group A ≤ 50 years (n = 31); group B > 50 years (n = 126). Mean patient follow-up was 15 mo.
RESULTS: The median age was 60 years. A significantly higher proportion of patients in group B presented with complicated diverticulitis (36.5% vs 12.9%, P = 0.01). Recurrence was more frequent in group A (25.8% vs 11.1%, P = 0.03) and the mean time-to-recurrence was shorter (12 mo vs 28 mo, P = 0.26). The most severe recurrent episodes of acute diverticulitis were classified as Hinchey stage I and none of the patients required emergency surgery. In multivariate analysis, only age (P = 0.024) was identified as an independent prognostic factor for recurrence.
CONCLUSION: Based on the results of this study, the authors recommend that diverticulitis management should be based on the severity of the disease and not on the age of the patient."
21246162,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21246162/,"UNLABELLED: The AIM of this study was to evaluate the prognostic significance of maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of primary cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) lesions by (18)F-FDG positron emission tomography/computerized tomography (PET/CT) in terms of recurrence.
PATIENTS, METHODS: 37 CMM patients (17 men, mean age: 61.7 ± 13.6 years) that underwent PET/CT at presentation were enrolled in this study. Recurrence was determined by histological confirmation or by radiological and clinical follow-up for at least 8 months after curative surgery. Clinical variables such as age, sex, clinical stage, and primary lesion location, thickness, and ulceration, and SUVmax values were analyzed with respect to their usefulness for predicting recurrence.
RESULTS: SUVmax was found to be significantly higher in patients with ulceration of primary lesion of CMM (p = 0.004) and in patients with a stage ≥ III (p < 0.000). Patients that experience recurrence had a significantly higher mean SUVmax value (4.9 ± 2.9) than patients who did not (2.1 ± 1.5, p = 0.024). ROC analysis showed that a SUVmax cut-off value 2.2 had high sensitivity (88.9%) and specificity (67.9%) for predicting recurrence. Kaplan-Meier analysis identified ulceration of primary lesion (p = 0.034), stage ≥ III (p = 0.019) and SUVmax ≥ 2.2 (p = 0.002) as predictors of recurrence. However, Cox proportional-hazards analysis showed that only SUVmax (p = 0.025, relative risk 11.063) significantly predicted recurrence.
CONCLUSION: Preoperative SUVmax of primary lesion was found to be the most potent predictor of recurrence in CMM patient. Patients with high SUV max of primary lesion should be followed meticulously for recurrence."
21246536,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21246536/,"BACKGROUND: Dapsone, used for Pneumocystis jiroveci (PCP) prophylaxis, is associated with increased risk of methemoglobinemia. Absence of cytochrome b5 reductase enzyme activity causes congenital methemoglobinemia, but its role in dapsone-associated methemoglobinemia is unknown. The authors sought to elucidate drug-related risk factors for dapsone-associated methemoglobinemia in pediatric oncology patients, including contribution of cytochrome b5 reductase enzyme activity.
METHODS: Among 167 pediatric patients treated for hematologic malignancies or aplastic anemia who received dapsone for PCP prophylaxis, demographic and dapsone treatment data were retrospectively collected. Drug-related risk factors were evaluated by Cox proportional hazards, and in a cross-sectional subgroup of 40 patients, cytochrome b5 reductase enzyme activity was assessed.
RESULTS: Methemoglobinemia (median methemoglobin level = 9.0% [3.5-22.4]) was documented in 32 (19.8%) patients. There was a 73% risk reduction in methemoglobinemia with dosing ≥20% below the target dose of 2 mg/kg/d (hazard ratio [HR], 0.27; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.09-0.78; P = .016), whereas methemoglobinemia risk was increased with dosing ≥20% above the target dose (HR, 6.25; 95% CI, 2.45-15.93; P < .001). Sex, body mass index, and age were not associated with increased risk. Cytochrome b5 reductase enzyme activity did not differ by methemoglobinemia status (median 8.6 IU/g hemoglobin [Hb]; [5.5-12.1] vs 9.1 IU/g Hb; [6.7-12.7]). No patient developed PCP on dapsone.
CONCLUSIONS: Methemoglobinemia occurred in almost 20% of pediatric oncology patients receiving dapsone for PCP prophylaxis. Higher dapsone dosing is associated with increased risk. A cross-sectionally acquired cytochrome b5 reductase enzyme activity level was not associated with methemoglobinemia risk. Studies are needed to define biologic correlates of methemoglobinemia and evaluate lower dapsone doses for PCP prophylaxis."
21246579,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21246579/,"BACKGROUND: Transmyocardial laser revascularization (TMR) is currently clinically performed with either a CO(2) or Ho:YAG laser for the treatment of severe angina. While both lasers provide symptomatic relief, there are significant differences in the laser-tissue interactions specific to each device that may impact their ability to enhance the perfusion of myocardium and thereby improve contractile function of the ischemic heart.
METHODS: A porcine model of chronic myocardial ischemia was employed. After collecting baseline functional data with cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and dobutamine stress echo (DSE), 14 animals underwent TMR with either a CO(2) or Ho:YAG laser. Transmural channels were created with each laser in a distribution of 1/cm(2) in the ischemic zone. Six weeks post-treatment repeat MRI as well as DSE were obtained after which the animals were sacrificed. Histology was preformed to characterize the laser-tissue interaction.
RESULTS: CO(2) TMR led to improvement in wall thickening in the ischemic area as seen with cine MRI (40.3% vs. baseline, P < 0.05) and DSE (20.2% increase vs. baseline, P < 0.05). Ho:YAG treated animals had no improvement in wall thickening by MRI (-11.6% vs. baseline, P = .67) and DSE (-16.7% vs. baseline, P = 0.08). Correlative semi-quantitative histology revealed a significantly higher fibrosis index in Ho:YAG treated myocardium versus CO(2) (1.81 vs. 0.083, P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: In a side-by-side comparison CO(2) TMR resulted in improved function of ischemic myocardium as assessed by MRI and echocardiography. Ho:YAG TMR led to no improvement in regional function likely due to concomitant increase in fibrosis in the lasered area."

21246758,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21246758/,"PURPOSE: Few reports have compared chronic obstructive lung diseases (OLDs) starting in childhood.
AIMS: To describe functional, radiological, and biological features of obliterative bronchiolitis (OB) and further discriminate to problematic severe asthma (PSA) or to diagnose a group with overlapping features.
RESULTS: Patients with OB showed a greater degree of obstructive lung defect and higher hyperinflation (P < 0.001). The most frequent high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) features (increased lung volume, inspiratory decreased attenuation, mosaic pattern, and expiratory air trapping) showed significantly greater scores in OB patients. Patients with PSA have shown a higher frequency of atopy (P < 0.05). ROC curve analysis demonstrated discriminative power for the LF variables, HRCT findings and for atopy between diagnoses. Further analysis released five final variables more accurate for the identification of a third diagnostic group (FVC%t, post-bronchodilator ΔFEV(1) in ml, HRCT mosaic pattern, SPT, and D. pteronyssinus-specific IgE).
CONCLUSIONS: We found that OB and PSA possess identifiable characteristic features but overlapping values may turn them undistinguishable."
21247231,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21247231/,"OBJECTIVE: To compare pregnancy complications, obstetrical and neonatal outcome of twin pregnancies reduced to singleton, with both non-reduced twin pregnancies and singleton pregnancies.
METHODS: A retrospective case-control study was performed at the Obstetrics and Gynecology Ultrasound unit of a tertiary referral medical center. Patient's population included 32 bi-chorionic bi-amniotic twin pregnancies reduced to singleton and 35 non-reduced twin pregnancies. Thirty-six patients with singleton pregnancies comprised the second control group. Main outcome measures were rates of pregnancy complications, preterm delivery (both before 37 weeks of gestation and before 34 weeks of gestation), late abortions, intra-uterine growth retardation, cesarean section, mean birth weights, and mean gestational age at delivery.
RESULTS: The reduced twin pregnancies group had similar rates of total pregnancy complications, preterm deliveries, and cesarean section as non-reduced twins. Gestational age at delivery and mean birth weight were also similar to non-reduced twins and significantly different compared with singletons. Preterm delivery and late abortion incidences were significantly higher when reduction was beyond 15 weeks gestation.
CONCLUSIONS: Reduction of twin pregnancy to singleton does not change significantly pregnancy course and outcome. Favorable obstetrical and neonatal outcomes could be achieved by performing early, first trimester reductions."

METHODS: From January 2003 through June 2009, all consecutive pregnant women who presented to Baskent University were screened for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Patients with one abnormal value based on findings of the OGTT were grouped according to increased levels of glucose at 0, 1, 2, and 3 h (Group 1  >  95 mg/dl for fasting glucose concentration, Group 2  >  180 mg/dl for the serum glucose concentration in the first hour, Group 3  >  155 mg/dl for the serum glucose concentration in the second hour, Group 4  >  140 mg/dl for serum glucose concentration in the third hour). The four groups were compared for classic GDM risk factors. The primary outcome measures were large for gestational age (LGA) (birthweight  > 95th percentile for gestational age using population birth weight centile charts) and macrosomia.
RESULTS: The incidence of LGA baby (Group 1, 10%; Group 2, 3.8%; Group 3 20.3%; Group 4, 13.2%; p = 0.008) was significantly highest in Group 3 and macrosomia (Group 1, 30%; Group 2, 5.1%; Group 3, 18.6%; Group 4, 15.8%; p = 0.039) was significantly higher in Groups 1 and 3.

We hypothesized that metformin due to its metabolic, endocrine, vascular, and anti-inflammatory effects may reduce the incidence of GDM in PCOS women.
PATIENT AND METHOD: We carried out a prospective cohort study to determine the beneficial effects of metformin on PCOS patients during pregnancy. Three-hundred and sixty non-diabetic PCOS patients were included who were conceived on metformin by different treatment modalities. Two-hundred pregnant women continued on metformin at a dose of 1000-2000 mg daily throughout pregnancy (study group) and 160 women discontinued metformin use at the time of conception (control group).
RESULTS: There is a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of GDM in favor of metformin group (OR: 0.17, 95% CI: 0.07-0.37). There is a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of pre-eclampsia in favor of metformin group (OR: 0.35, 95% CI: 0.13-0.94).
CONCLUSION: Metformin is a promising medication for the prevention or reduction of the incidence of GDM and pre-eclampsia in PCOS women."
21247262,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21247262/,"PURPOSE: We retrospectively compared the maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax) of FDG PET in four different sites to evaluate whether a common diagnostic SUVmax threshold may exist in these tumor locations. We further postulate that the SUVmax thresholds are higher in thoracic lesions than in extrathoracic lesions.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: N = 143 patients in four subgroups underwent a FDG PET/CT: a) 42 patients for solitary pulmonary nodules (SPNs) characterization with b) respective mediastinal lymph nodes (LNs), c) 65 patients for LN staging of head and neck cancer, and d) 36 cancer patients diagnosed with adrenal lesions. Receiver operating characteristics of SUVmax values were evaluated.
RESULTS: The SUVmax were statistically significantly greater in malignant than in benign lesions. For SPNs and mediastinal LNs, a SUVmax > 3.6 each resulted in a sensitivity of 81% and 87%, and a specificity of 94% and 89%. For cervical LNs and adrenal glands, a SUVmax > 2.2 each showed a sensitivity of 98% and 100%, and a specificity of 83% and 93%.
CONCLUSION: A common SUVmax threshold did not exist in the four studied subgroups. The variable FDG uptake in SPNs and mediastinal LNs are associated with the high prevalence of inflammation/infection within the chest. Similar SUVmax thresholds however may exist for extrathoracic regions where the prevalence of inflammation/infection is low."

METHOD: In this cross-sectional study, 337 healthy adults (108 males and 229 females, mean age 40.7 ± 14.2 years) participated. The subjects were randomly selected in Lyari Town in Karachi using a geographical imaging system (GIS). Their demographic, anthropometric [body mass index (BMI), hip and waist circumferences, waist-to-hip circumference ratio (W-HR), and biochemical (fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin, fasting lipid profile, and hsCRP)] parameters were recorded. Insulin resistance was calculated by the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR). Metabolic syndrome was diagnosed according to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) criteria. Correlation of CRP and fasting insulin levels with various parameters of metabolic syndrome were calculated using Pearson correlation.
RESULTS: Median CRP levels were found to be higher in females 0.81 (0.20-1.38) compared with males 0.77 (0.19-1.35). Metabolic syndrome was diagnosed in 108 (31.12%) subjects. No significant difference between CRP levels in the metabolic syndrome-positive and metabolic syndrome-negative groups was observed. Similarly, no correlation was observed between hsCRP and fasting insulin levels, insulin resistance, and other parameters of MS.
CONCLUSION: There is lack of correlation between hsCRP levels and various risk factors for metabolic syndrome in our urban population. Further large-scale prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings."
21247272,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21247272/,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether radical nephrectomy (RN) and nephron-sparing surgery (NSS) for T1 renal cell carcinoma influence renal function, oncological outcome or survival rate.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective study was performed, including 290 nephrectomies for tumours of a diameter of less than 7 cm; 174 radical nephrectomies were compared to 116 nephron-sparing surgeries. Preoperative and pathological data were compared between the two groups. The glomerular filtration rate was estimated using the abbreviated Modification of Diet and Renal Disease (MDRD4) study equation. The evolution of renal function was analysed from 6 months to 4 years after surgery, and the oncological outcomes were evaluated by means of cancer and non-cancer survival curves.
RESULTS: The results showed a major impairment in renal function in the RN group compared to those who underwent NSS (25 vs 7 ml/min/1.73 m², 6 months after surgery), a difference that was maintained over time. Moreover, patients undergoing RN had a greater chance of developing renal failure. Overall, the survival curves showed a higher mortality rate for the RN group (p = 0.034), although the cancer-specific mortality rate did not show any statistically significant differences (p = 0.079).
CONCLUSIONS: For stage T1 renal cortical tumours, NSS should, whenever possible, be regarded as the primary therapeutic option, given that it obtains similar oncological outcomes to RN and preserves renal function, which seems to translate into a lower overall mortality rate."
21247292,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21247292/,"PURPOSE: Increasing diagnosis of small renal masses (SRMs) necessitates trainees to be familiar with available therapies. We hypothesized that involvement in conservative treatments (ablation and/or active surveillance) occurs infrequently. Therefore, we evaluated resident exposure and participation in treatments as well as proposed management for SRMs.
METHODS: A survey was distributed to residents of the American Urologic Association and queried exposure to ablation and surveillance for SRMs. Three case scenarios (SRM in a healthy 55-year-old, healthy 75-year-old, and comorbid 75-year-old patient) were presented for management.
RESULTS: Two hundred fifty-seven residents responded to the survey. Two hundred thirty-four (91%) reported ablation was offered at their institution, although only 140 (54%) ever participated in this procedure. Of these, 80 (57%) were involved in fewer than five procedures. Experience with ablation did not increase at higher levels of training (U3-61%, U4-66%, and U5-63%). Two hundred twenty-four (87%) residents noted exposure to surveillance for managing SRMs, increasing from 70% in U1 to 94% in U5. When considering case scenarios, management strategy shifted significantly from extirpation to ablation or surveillance as patient age and comorbidity profile increased. In particular, almost 50% of respondents advocated ablation for SRMs in a comorbid 75-year-old patient.
CONCLUSIONS: Although most residents are adequately exposed to surveillance strategies for SRMs, only 54% participated in an ablative procedure. Nonetheless, almost 50% of residents recommended ablation to manage SRMs in the aging, comorbid patient. This suggests a disconnect between training and future practice pattern."
21247302,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21247302/,"BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is the gold standard for the surgical treatment of cholelithiasis. However, the use of drainage after elective LC in literature remains controversial.
METHODS: A randomized study was performed in Larnaka General Hospital. The purpose of the study was to evaluate drainage of the gallbladder bed after elective LC. One hundred sixteen patients were randomly allocated in two groups, sustained an uneventful LC, and were included in the study after an informed consent was obtained. Sixty-three patients were included in drainage group (YD) and 53 patients in nondrainage group (ND). Drain tubes, made of polyethylene, were placed at the end of the procedure in the patients of YD group. Postoperative pain was assessed using two scales: a 10-point visual analog scale and a 5-point verbal response scale. The two groups were evaluated and compared regarding postoperative pain, the time needed for surgery, length of postoperative hospital stay, the postoperative collection of fluid in the subhepatic space, and the incidence of postoperative complications. Chi-square and t-tests were used to evaluate the data, and statistical significance was established at P < .05.
RESULTS: The mean operative time in YD patients was 6.9 minutes longer compared with ND patients (P = .056). The postoperative pain was higher in the YD group by more than one point on the average in the visual analog scale both at 6 and 24 hours (P = .01 and <.001, respectively). When measured with the verbal response scale, the difference in the reported pain was very significant at 24 hours (mean level for YD 1.24 and for ND 0.75). The proportion of patients staying in hospital for >2 days was higher in the YD group: 28.6% of the patients versus 13.2% in the ND group (P = .05). Subhepatic fluid was more often observed in the YD group (47% versus 34% in the ND), but the difference was not statistically significant. There was no statistical difference in the rate of wound infections, shoulder pain, nausea, vomiting, and respiratory infections between the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that routine drainage of gallbladder bed after elective LC may not be justified. Drainage causes more postoperative pain, prolongs the operative time and hospital stay, increases the occurrence of fluid in the subhepatic space, and does not protect from other complications."
21247303,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21247303/,"BACKGROUND: Complete reduction of an indirect inguinal hernia sac during laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal (TEP) repair is not always possible when the sac extends to the scrotum or adheres to adjacent tissues. Laparoscopic TEP repair would be much easier to perform in such cases by transecting the hernia sac. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of transection of the hernia sac during laparoscopic TEP.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five hundred twenty laparoscopic TEP repairs were performed on 498 patients by a single surgeon from July 2003 to December 2008. The patients were classified into two groups: the transected sac (TS) group with 269 patients (275 cases) and the completely reduced sac (RS) group with 230 patients (245 cases).
RESULTS: Statistical analysis between the TS and RS groups showed no significant differences in postoperative pain, length of hospital stay, and recurrence, except for postoperative seromas, which were more frequent in the TS group (24 of 275) than the RS group (6 of 245; P = .002). And the mean operative time was longer in the TS group (23.62 ± 10.25 minutes) than the RS group (21.49 ± 8.17 minutes; P = .010).
CONCLUSION: Although transection of the hernia sac during laparoscopic TEP repair may cause seromas, our study demonstrated that transection of the hernia sac did not cause significant postoperative complications, including recurrence. Transection of the hernia sac is an alternative technique for laparoscopic TEP repair in cases with difficult hernia sac reduction."
21247603,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21247603/,"PURPOSE: Obese women (body mass index 30 kg/m2 or greater) are considered to be at risk for postoperative complications and failure after stress incontinence surgery. We compare the outcomes in this population with nonobese women (body mass index less than 30 kg/m2) undergoing rectus fascia, porcine dermis and polypropylene sling procedures.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively identified 412 women with a body mass index less than 30 kg/m2 (94 autologous rectus fascia, 157 acellular porcine dermis, 161 transobturator polypropylene mid urethral sling) and 297 with a body mass index of 30 kg/m2 or greater (66 autologous rectus fascia, 114 acellular porcine dermis, 117 transobturator polypropylene mid urethral sling) who underwent sling procedures and other pelvic surgery. Evaluation included SEAPI assessment and quality of life questionnaires. Global cure equaled subjective SEAPI composite=0 and subjective satisfaction. Stress urinary incontinence cure equaled SEAPI (S)=0 and negative cough stress test. Chart review for perioperative data was conducted. Groups and outcomes were statistically compared.
RESULTS: All women had a minimum followup of 12 months. After controlling for body mass index preoperative demographics, SEAPI scores and quality of life indices were not statistically different within each sling group. Global cure and stress urinary incontinence cure rates were significantly higher for nonobese women in each sling group. Statistically significant improvement in SEAPI scores and quality of life indices was achieved for all groups, and there were no statistical differences within each sling group. Overall obese women had no increase in complications compared with nonobese women. The incidence of obstructive sequelae was statistically higher in nonobese women undergoing autologous rectus fascia and transobturator polypropylene mid urethral sling procedures.
CONCLUSIONS: Although cure rates are lower, obese women have significant improvements in quality of life after surgery for stress urinary incontinence. Obesity does not appear to be a risk factor for additional complications during sling and prolapse surgery."

These patients often have a prolonged postoperative stay in the intensive care unit with an uncertain outcome. In this study, we aimed to develop a predictive risk score for perioperative mortality and to examine long-term follow-up of patients with acute ischemic colitis.
METHODS: All patients (n = 177) undergoing surgical treatment for acute ischemic colitis in our institution from 2002 to 2008 were prospectively included in this study. Independent predictors of perioperative mortality and poor long-term survival were assessed by uni- and multivariate analysis.
RESULTS: A risk score including various perioperative variables (nonocclusive ischemic colitis, acute renal failure, extent of bowel ischemia, serum lactate, and duration of catecholamine therapy) was defined being highly predictive for postoperative mortality of patients having undergone an operation for acute ischemic colitis. Mesenteric atherosclerosis in the surgical specimen is an independent prognostic factor for poor long-term survival (52 vs 40 months with mesenteric atherosclerosis; P = .027).
CONCLUSION: This study for the first time presents a risk score highly predictive of postoperative mortality of patients undergoing an operation for ischemic colitis. Our score may help to further select and modify therapeutic management in patients with acute ischemic colitis on the basis of validated data. Furthermore, we could demonstrate a significant influence of mesenteric atherosclerosis on long-term survival of patients with acute ischemic colitis."

METHODS: In this double-blind study, 30 subjects each had two seborrheic keratoses removed from their trunk or abdomen; one wound was treated with AHO and one with Poly/Bac twice daily. Clinical grading of wound healing and subjective irritation was assessed at days 7, 14, and 28 postwounding. Adverse events were recorded.
RESULTS: Clinical grading assessment showed no differences between wounds treated with AHO versus Poly/Bac for erythema, edema, epithelial confluence, crusting, and scabbing at any time point. Subjective irritation assessment showed wounds treated with Poly/Bac had a significant increase in burning at week 1, whereas no differences were seen between treatments for stinging, itching, tightness, tingling, or pain. One case of allergic contact dermatitis was reported after Poly/Bac treatment.
LIMITATIONS: This was a relatively small study.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that the petrolatum-based skin protectant ointment AHO provided equivalent efficacy for wound healing as a combination antibiotic first-aid ointment. Antibiotics may not be necessary to achieve satisfactory wound healing and may cause allergic contact dermatitis."
21247685,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21247685/,"OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to look for a probable relationship between cerebral vasomotor reactivity (VMR) and orthostatic hypotension (OH) in Parkinson's disease (PD).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was conducted on 44 patients with PD. Assessment of cerebral VMR was performed by means of transcranial Doppler (TCD) of middle cerebral artery (MCA) before and after a vasodilatory stimulus, carbon dioxide test. Moreover, orthostatic hypotension was evaluated.
RESULTS: OH was presented in 12 (27.3%) Parkinson's patients. The average resting blood flow velocity (BFV) in the MCA was 30.20 (SD=9.58)cms(-1) which significantly increased to 46.25 (SD=16.23)cms(-1) after carbon dioxide test (P<0.001). Impaired VMR was observed in 15 (34.1%) of the subjects, while it was not associated with the presence of OH (P=0.770).
CONCLUSION: Evaluation of VMR in patients affected by PD, could assist in early diagnosis of cerebral autonomic dysfunction and prevent its serious consequences prior and more valid to OH."
21248174,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21248174/,"BACKGROUND: The John Marsh Cancer Center is an ambulatory oncology clinic located in Hagerstown, MD. In 2004, a clinical oncology pharmacist was hired to help manage therapies and control cost. The objective was to evaluate clinical interventions, consultations and cost savings by the clinical oncology pharmacist.
METHODS: This was a retrospective descriptive analysis of clinical interventions by the clinical oncology pharmacist from September 4, 2004 to October 27, 2006. Interventions were categorized as either drug-related or consultative. Drug-related interventions included medication reconciliation, dosing, and adverse effect management and prevention. Consultations incorporated drug information questions, patient visits, and patient education sessions. Information was extracted from an online documentation program linked to medical charts.
RESULTS: A total of 583 clinical interventions were documented among 199 patients. Average time spent per intervention was 10 minutes. Drug-related and consultative interventions accounted for 35% and 65%, respectively. Included among the drug-related interventions were adverse events (131), medication reconciliation (52) and dosing (22). Consultation services consisted of patient education (143), patient visits (124) and drug information (25). The on-site pharmacist saved $210,000 by admixing chemotherapy. Patient and colleague surveys evaluated pharmacist services with positive ratings of 95% and 98%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Analysis of clinical interventions, cost-savings, and feedback from patients and colleagues confirmed beneficial services provided by a clinical pharmacist in this outpatient oncology center."
21248651,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21248651/,"BACKGROUND: A distal femur nail with fixed-angle locking screws intends to combine the advantages of angular stability and intramedullary stabilization in extraarticular distal femur fractures. The goal of this study was to analyze whether the locked compression distal femur nail (LCN) was biomechanically more stable than a conventional standard distal femur nail (CN).
METHODS: Both nails were compared on a series of 10 matched pairs of human femora. After setting a distal femur defect fracture, the intramedullary stabilized femur was axially loaded starting from 100 N, increasing in steps of 100 N after every 200 cycles with a triangular frequency of 1 Hz, until a predefined point of failure was reached.
RESULTS: The two types of nails showed no significant difference in terms of maximum tolerated load, maximum number of cycles repeated, or axial deformation of the bone-implant construct. The mean load at failure was 2,954 N for the CN and 2,483 N for the LCN. The mean axial deformation for the conventional (14.8 mm) and locked compression nail (15.3 mm) did not differ significantly. Mode of failure was a bony fracture in all specimens predominantly involving the proximal femur.
CONCLUSIONS: No significant difference in stability between the two compared implants could be demonstrated. The LCN showed comparable characteristics under cyclic axial loading as the conventional distal femur nail. No migration into the articular space or implant failure was observed."
21249529,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21249529/,"BACKGROUND: Poor oral hygiene has been associated with ventilator-acquired pneumonia. Yet providing oral care for intubated patients is problematic. Furthermore, concerns that oral care could raise intracranial pressure (ICP) may cause nurses to use foam swabs to provide oral hygiene rather than tooth brushing as recommended by the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses. Evidence is needed to support the safety of toothbrushing during oral care. We therefore evaluated ICP and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) during oral care with a manual or electric toothbrush in intubated patients in a neuroscience intensive care unit (ICU).
METHODS: As part of a larger 2-year, prospective, randomized clinical trial, 47 adult neuroscience ICU patients with an ICP monitor received oral care with a manual or electric toothbrush. ICP and CPP were recorded before, during, and after oral care over the first 72 h of admission.
RESULTS: Groups did not differ significantly in age, gender, or severity of injury. Of 807 ICP and CPP measurements obtained before, during, and after oral care, there were no significant differences in ICP (P = 0.72) or CPP (P = 0.68) between toothbrush methods. Analysis of pooled data from both groups revealed a significant difference across the three time points (Wilks' lambda, 12.56; P < 0.001; partial η(2), 0.36). ICP increased significantly (mean difference, 1.7 mm Hg) from before to during oral care (P = 0.001) and decreased significantly (mean difference, 2.1 mm Hg) from during to after oral care (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of preexisting intracranial hypertension during oral care, tooth brushing, regardless of method, was safely performed in intubated neuroscience ICU patients."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional, clinical survey was initiated whereby stroke patients were invited to complete The WHO-Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5) and a LUTS instrument, the Danish Prostatic Symptom Score (DAN-PSS-1) questionnaire. Of 519 stroke patients invited, 482 subjects were eligible and 407 (84%) respondents answered the questionnaires.
RESULTS: Poor well-being (sum score <13) was reported by 22% of all stroke patients, for women 29% and for men 14%. Depression (sum score <8) was reported by 10%, for women 11% and for men 8%. Poor well-being was significantly (p < 0.01) associated with severity and bother of LUTS. Likewise, poor well-being was significantly (p < 0.001) associated with the prevalence of four different symptom groups of LUTS.
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that poor well-being is present in stroke patients with LUTS, especially in women. Likewise, the data showed significant association between poor well-being and LUTS. Screening for well-being and LUTS in stroke patients is strongly recommended."
21250966,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21250966/,"BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is not clearly understood. The nomenclature suggests an important role for the apocrine glands but recent evidence implicates the pilosebaceous unit as a more likely candidate to play a central role in the pathogenesis.
OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to estimate the volume of the follicular epithelium, the follicular lumen and the sebaceous glands of patients with HS and healthy controls by means of stereology.
METHODS: Four-millimetre punch biopsies were taken from 21 patients with HS and nine healthy controls, fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin and stained with haematoxylin and eosin prior to volume estimation using the Cavalieri principle.
RESULTS: Sebaceous gland tissue could be visualized in only 10 of 15 suitable hair follicle biopsies from patients with HS but was present in all biopsies from healthy controls (P = 0·05) and the mean sebaceous gland volume per follicle was one-seventh of that of healthy controls (P = 0·03). There was no significant difference between patients with HS and healthy controls with regard to follicular epithelium and follicle lumen volume.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the absence or reduced volume of the sebaceous gland may play a role in the pathogenesis of HS. The presence of fibrosis suggests that sebaceous glands are obliterated early in the pathogenesis of HS."
21251084,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21251084/,"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Sensitive skin is a vague, subjective and difficult to characterize affliction. It affects a large part of the population and is accompanied with great interest by the cosmetic industry. Some studies have suggested that sensitive skin is the result of impaired barrier function, which leads to the exposure of immune system cells and sensitive nerves, resulting in marked cutaneous responses to otherwise harmless stimuli. This study aimed to investigate the cutaneous barrier integrity of individuals with sensitive skin by a novel approach: a plastic occlusion stress test followed by measurement of transepidermal water loss (TEWL) desorption curves.
METHODS: The study was conducted in volunteers with sensitive skin in the hands and a control group with no sensitivity complaints. A previously developed mathematical model was adjusted to the TEWL data points and two parameters were calculated: dynamic water mass and the evaporation half-life period.
RESULTS: Statistically significant differences have been detected in the parameters obtained in the sensitive skin group, which supports the thesis that individuals with an increased skin susceptibility have impaired barrier function.
CONCLUSION: Whereas in the studies based in basal TEWL measurements only discrete differences were reported, the dynamic approach followed in this study provided unequivocal evidence of barrier impairment. The methodology enabled a more objective characterization of sensitive skin and can potentially be applied to the diagnosis/prediction of sensitivity; as well as the efficacy assessment of cosmetic products that are specifically designed to fulfill the needs of consumers with this skin condition."
21251138,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21251138/,"BACKGROUND: Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapy improves survival of patients with systolic heart failure. We assessed whether physicians' recommendation for ICD therapy varies as a function of patient age, gender, race, and physician's specialty.
METHODS: We surveyed a random sample (n = 9969) of U.S. physicians who are active members of the American College of Cardiology (ACC). We asked participants about their likelihood to recommend ICD therapy in 4 clinical scenarios that randomly varied patient age, gender, race, and ICD indication (guideline Class I, Class IIa, Class III, and Class I in a noncompliant patient).
RESULTS: Responses were received from 1210 physicians (response rate 12%), of whom 1127 met the study inclusion criteria. Responders and nonresponders had similar demographics. In responding to hypothetical clinical scenarios, physicians were less likely to recommend an ICD to older patients (≥80 vs 50 years) (P < 0.01) but were unaffected by gender or race for all class indications. Compared with non-electrophysiologists (EPs), EPs were significantly more likely to recommend an ICD for a Class I indication (92.4% vs 81.4%; P < 0.01), but they were not more likely to offer an ICD for a Class III indication (0.4% vs 0.6%; P = 0.95).
CONCLUSIONS: Based on survey responses, physicians were equally willing to offer an ICD to men and women and to whites and blacks, but were less likely to offer an ICD to an older patient even when indicated by practice guidelines. Electrophysiologists (EPs) more often adhered to practice guideline recommendations on ICD therapy compared with non-EPs."

METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 98 preterm infants who underwent a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) ligation in one NICU between 2001 and 2007. The primary outcome was the need for cardiotropic support within 24 hrs of ligation.
RESULTS: Twenty-seven infants (28%) required post-operative cardiotropic support. The amount of intra-operative fluids varied between 0 and 50.4 mL/kg (median: 10.2 mL/kg). No intra-operative fluid was recorded in 26 patients. Fluids were not associated with the need for post-operative cardiotropic support (P=0.10). Using a multivariate logistic regression model, age at ligation, weight at ligation and pre-operative FiO2 were significant predictors of post-operative cardiotropic support.
CONCLUSIONS: Intra-operative fluids do not appear to be associated with the need for post-operative cardiotropic support. A prospective cohort study may help identify modifiable risk factors and improve outcomes in this population."
21251786,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21251786/,"BACKGROUND: Hypersensitivity (allergic or non-allergic) reactions that occur after contrast medium (CM) injection are usually related to the CM. Recent studies, and case reports lack the analysis of alternate causes that could be also responsible in individual cases.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated the individual relevant factor/causative agent of adult patients with hypersensitivity reactions that occurred in radiological units during CM-enhanced procedures (CT, angiography, urography, or MR-examinations). Both immediate and non-immediate (delayed) reactions were included. To find out the relevant agent a detailed patients' history was carefully analyzed. In addition, the records were retrospectively reviewed, and if indicated and possible laboratory (e.g. basophil activation test) and skin tests (e.g. prick) and/or provocations with CM-injections under routine conditions were performed.
RESULTS: 38 patients (men n=21) suspected for CM-hypersensitivity reactions were identified. These reactions were in most cases mild (n=21), moderate reactions occurred in 13 cases, and four patients had severe reactions. In 28 patients the reactions were induced by the CM (iodinated CM in 25 cases). Four patients had reactions that were not CM-related (latex allergy, adenosine reaction, vasovagal reaction, unknown cause) and in six cases the reaction was partly CM-related (immunological activation was present due to the patients' diseases).
CONCLUSION: Our data support the hypothesis that in CM-enhanced procedures not only contrast materials but also a broad range of other factors may also induce hypersensitivity reactions. Therefore, the number of CM-induced hypersensitivity is smaller than initially suspected. The knowledge of the cause of a reaction is essential to effectively prevent its recurrence and to improve safety aspects in patients undergoing CM-injection. Larger trials should be performed to more specifically assess alternate causes in patients who acquire hypersensitivity reactions in CM-enhanced diagnostic procedures."
21251808,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21251808/,"INTRODUCTION: In a normal clinical environment, foot function and treatment efficacy is evaluated using static foot posture assessment. Whilst there are several methods of static assessment, the longitudinal arch angle (LAA) has been validated as a repeatable and reliable static measure that represents foot posture during midstance whilst walking and running. The main aim of this study was to assess if static LAA is representative of dynamic LAA with the use of orthoses.
METHOD: 17 male subjects with a mean age of 33.4 (SD 12.3) years, mean height of 169.88 (SD 9.2) mm and a mean weight of 72.71 (SD 11.36)kg, who provided an informed consent were included in the study. Orthotic prescription was produced using measurements from a weightbearing goniometer. An optoelectronic movement analysis system was employed to record and analyse the LAA in barefoot, shoe and shoe with orthoses conditions. This data was collected in a static standing condition and then repeated whilst walking.
RESULTS: No significant differences were observed between right static and right dynamic barefoot condition t=1.329 (p=0.05). Same results were observed for right static and right dynamic orthotic condition t=-.233 (p=0.05). Similarly, no significant differences were recorded for left static and left dynamic barefoot condition and orthotic condition t=.303 (p=0.05) and t=.049 (p=0.05) respectively. However, differences were observed within the shoe only condition.
CONCLUSION: LAA is been shown to be a good static measure for dynamic foot function and can reliably be implemented in a normal clinical environment to evaluate and assess the efficacy of the prescribed foot orthoses."

METHODS: nine hundred and seventy-six questionnaires were sent by mail to a sample of healthy and voluntary French pensioners. Successful ageing was defined through health status and well-being. Cognitive abilities had been assessed 6 years earlier according to an objective method (Free and Cued Selective Recall Reminding Test (FCSRT), the Benton visual retention test and the similarities subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised) and a subjective one (Goldberg's anxiety scale, Mac Nair's scale and a Visual Analogue Scale to evaluate memory abilities change in the last 5 years).
RESULTS: six hundred and eighty-six questionnaires could be analysed. The mean age was 72.9 ± 1.2 years old with 59% of women and 99% lived at home. Well-being was negatively correlated with the FCSRT (r = -0.08, P = 0.0318) but positively related with the Benton (r = 0.09, P = 0.0125) and the similarities tests (r = 0.09, P = 0.0118). There is a negative correlation between anxious and cognitive complaints measured at baseline, and successful ageing indicators 6 years later.

METHODS: We reviewed the charts of 35 children and adolescents with a thyroid nodule who had had an US and a FNAB, and for whom final pathology was available.
RESULTS: The global accuracy of FNAB was 83%, with a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 94%. 14 FNABs suggested malignancy (40%), only 1 of which was a false positive (7%). By contrast, 5 of the 21 FNABs suggesting benign lesions were false negatives (24%). These 5 cases had US findings suggestive of malignancy. When FNAB suggested a benign lesion, US had a good sensitivity (80%) but a poor specificity and accuracy (50 and 57%, respectively); its negative predictive value was 90% and its positive predictive value 36%.
CONCLUSIONS: US complements FNAB in the evaluation of thyroid nodules in children. A more aggressive approach is warranted in children with a thyroid nodule and a benign FNAB if US findings suggest malignancy."

METHODS: Four groups of professionals in the delivery room clinically estimated the fetal weight in 236 parturients in active labor. Obstetric parameters such as gravidity, parity, gestational age, body mass index, amniotomy, station and cervical dilatation were recorded. Fetal weight estimations were compared with the actual birth weight after delivery.
RESULTS: The mean error rate of fetal weight estimation by attending obstetricians, residents, experienced and junior midwives was 7.9 ± 8.8, 8.0 ± 8.4, 7.8 ± 6.3 and 8.5 ± 6.8%, respectively. Error rates of the 4 groups of examiners were similar, although it was increased in all subgroups when estimating birth weights <2,500 and >4,000 g. Major discrepancies of fetal weight estimation (>10% of the actual fetal birth weight) occurred in 27.2, 28.9, 31.9 and 34.7% by attending obstetricians, residents, experienced and junior midwives, respectively.

METHODS: Totally 33 patients (18 females) who were operated for hyperkyphosis and, were reached at the latest follow-up were included in the study. Age at operation, gender, date of operation, etiology and level of the deformities, instrumentation, and graft types were noted in detail. The kyphosis angles were measured by the Cobb method. The preoperative and postoperative spinopelvic parameters (pelvic incidence, sacral slope, and pelvic tilt) were recorded.
RESULTS: The average follow-up was 4 years (range 3-8 years). The mean age at operation was 21 years (range 14-40 years). Scheuermann kyphosis was diagnosed as the etiological factor in 18 patients (53%). The mean preoperative kyphosis angle was 76° (range 55-98°), which decreased postoperatively to 38° (range 20-55°) (p<0.05). The mean kyphosis angle two years postoperatively was 41° (p>0.05). Preoperative and latest follow-up spinopelvic parameters were also not significantly different. Furthermore, no correlation could be found between the age at operation, instrumentation level, spinopelvic parameters, and correction loss.

METHODS: We studied 674 women with GDM who were treated with glyburide and diagnosed from 2000 to 2009. Glucose data were downloaded from memory-based meters at each visit and analyzed to estimate the incidence of recorded episodes of hypoglycemia and the association with concurrent dose of glyburide therapy (2.5, 5, 10, 15, or 20 mg). Hypoglycemia was defined as a blood glucose of less than 50 mg/dL, further classified as ""severe hypoglycemia"" if the event required the assistance of another person for resuscitation, ""symptomatic hypoglycemia"" if it was associated with typical neurogenic symptoms, or ""asymptomatic hypoglycemia"" if the biochemical reading was less than 50 mg/dL with no symptoms or accompanied by mild symptoms that did not impair the patient's ability to function.
RESULTS: Patients recorded a mean of 272 glucose values. Sixty-seven percent of the patients experienced no blood glucose values in the hypoglycemic range. 33% had 1-7% of their total blood glucose values within the hypoglycemic range. All recordings of hypoglycemic episodes were asymptomatic; no patient reported a severe or symptomatic hypoglycemic episode. A significant association was found between the incidence of asymptomatic hypoglycemia and mean blood glucose (P<.001). No association was found between glyburide dose and incidence of asymptomatic hypoglycemia. No association between glyburide dose or mean blood glucose value and the incidence of neonatal hypoglycemia was found.
CONCLUSION: Incremental increases in glyburide dose are not associated with an increase in the incidence of hypoglycemic episodes.

21252816,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21252816/,"OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine whether North Carolina legislation pertaining to all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) has affected the frequency, distribution, or severity of injury in children.
METHODS: This retrospective study reviewed the Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center Trauma Registry from 2003 to 2008 along with North Carolina Medical Examiner's child fatality data for all children injured on an ATV. Patients were excluded if the accident did not occur in North Carolina, incomplete data, or if the vehicle was not an ATV. We evaluated the use of helmets, the extent of injury, and the mechanism of injury, comparing the patterns before the laws went into effect (2003-2005) with those after the law was enacted (2006-2008).
RESULTS: Eighty-eight patients were included for analysis, predominantly white boys with a mean age of 12.1 ± 4.1 years. Children not wearing helmets were 5-fold more likely to have a significant head/neck injury (odds ratio [OR], 5.1; confidence interval [CI], 1.61-15.88; P = 0.01) and 3.7-fold more likely to have a significant chest injury (OR, 3.73; CI, 1.01-13.86; P = 0.05). Passengers were 5-fold more likely to die or require inpatient rehabilitation (OR, 5.0; CI, 1.2-20.8; P = 0.03) and 13.7 times as likely to have a significant injury to their head/neck (OR, 13.7; CI, 3.07-60.93; P = 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: There were no significant changes seen in the children injured without and then with legislation, which may be significant if ATV use indeed is increasing. A child's vehicular position was the most significant predictor of morbidity and mortality. Helmet use was not increased once mandated by law. Further efforts to implement such legislation and educate the public are necessary to make a significant change in injuries."

OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the aorta safety in placement of a right pedicle screw in scoliotic patients.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Past reports emphasized the aorta risk in placing pedicle screws on the concave left side in right thoracic scoliosis. However, risk on the right side has drawn limited interest.
METHODS: Thirty-four scoliotic patients with an average age of 18.0 years were evaluated. The Cobb angle averaged 59.0° ± 14.0°. From computed tomographic data, we evaluated the aorta location relative to the spine at each level from T4 to L4 and simulated placement of a right pedicle screw with a direction different from the ideal trajectory. Sensitivity analysis was performed independently by variable direction errors and screw length: the maximum error of trajectory was set to 5° in the medial direction and to 5°, 10°, or 20° in the lateral direction, and a screw length was set at 40, 45 or 50 mm. We defined ""aorta-at-risk"" when a patient has some level where a simulated pedicle screw involves the aorta, and compared the curve characteristics (the apical vertebral translation, the Cobb angle and the Nash-Moe grade) between the aorta-at-risk cases and the aorta-no-risk cases.
RESULTS: In left thoracic or lumbar curves, the aorta often resided in front of right pedicles at the periapical level. In a scenario of a simulated pedicle screw with a maximum error of 20° in the lateral direction and a screw length of 50 mm, the aorta was at risk in 7 (33%) of 21 left lumbar curves. Curve characteristics of the aorta-at-risk cases at L1 were a larger apical vertebral translation (P = 0.003), a larger Cobb angle (P = 0.006), and a larger Nash-Moe grade (P = 0.017) compared with those of the aorta-no-risk cases.
CONCLUSION: Surgeons need to pay attention to the position of the aorta in placing a pedicle screw on the right at the periapical level of a left curve either in thoracic or lumbar spine."

We assessed the effects of the implementation of standards of postoperative analgesia, according to the guidelines of the ""Pain-free hospital"" project, and PROSPECT group recommendations, in the daily practice of a general surgical hospital ward.
METHODS: One hundred adult patients, scheduled for elective inguinal or umbilical hernia surgery, were included in the study and allocated to two groups, to receive analgesics on demand (control), or postoperative analgesia according to the introduced programs. The number of additional interventions and patients' satisfaction were chosen as primary end points to assess the clinical value of the introduced standards. Additionally, the type and dose of analgesics, and duration of hospital stay were noted.
RESULTS: One additional intervention (2%) was required in the treated group, and 9 (18%) - in the control group (p=0.023). In the treated group, the patient satisfaction (0 to 10) score was rated 9 by 39 patients (78%) and 10 by 11 patients (22%). The duration of hospitalisation was similar in both groups.
CONCLUSION: We confirmed the success of introducing the standards of pain treatment into the daily practice of a surgical ward."
21252864,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21252864/,"BACKGROUND: Recently, positive consent has been required for dental surveys in some parts of the UK. Concerns have been raised that when positive consent is used participation is reduced in deprived areas and reported caries levels are biased as a consequence. This paper analyses caries data collected under positive and negative consent arrangements to explore this issue further.
METHOD: Retrospective analysis of response rates by deprivation fifth and by caries experience of participating children in NHS coordinated dental surveys in Wales undertaken from 2001/2 until 2005/6 using negative consent and in 2007/8 using positive consent.
RESULTS: Across Wales, the change from negative to positive consent was associated with greatly decreased participation. In comparison with previous surveys there was a large increase in children sampled but not examined. The decrease in the proportion of children sampled, who were examined and found to have no decay was similar across all deprivation fifths, with no obvious deprivation-related trend. There was a much larger reduction in the number of children with decay who participated across all quintiles of deprivation.
CONCLUSION: Caries status could be a more important factor than deprivation regarding opting out of the survey. It appears that children with caries are more likely to be opted out of the survey than similarly deprived peers without caries. Parents appear to be more likely to opt children with caries out of dental surveys when positive consent is used. These findings have significant implications for targets aimed at improving oral health which were set before the change in consent procedures, but reported upon after."

Robotic surgery has drawn attention as a potentially safe and effective method for treating thyroid cancer. The aim of the present study was to determine whether robotic surgery is superior to endoscopic and open surgery through comparing technical aspects and surgical outcomes.
METHODS: From October 2008 to December 2009, 302 patients had total thyroidectomies and CND with cancer less than 1 cm. Patients were divided into three groups according to operation methods (open group; n = 138), (endo group; n = 95), (robot group; n = 69).
RESULTS: Young patients preferred the robotic and endoscopic surgery. The number of retrieved lymph nodes in the open group (4.8 ± 2.8) was not different from the robot group (4.7 ± 2.7) and the endo group (4.6 ± 3.7). The operative time of the robot group was longer than the open and the endo group. The total drain amount in the robot group was more than the open and endo groups; however, there was no difference in the length of hospitalization and complication rates. There were no differences between the open (0.8 ± 2.0) and robot groups (0.8 ± 1.4), but the endo group (2.4 ± 6.3) showed higher postoperative serum thyroglobulin off thyroid hormone (Off-Tg) when compared to the open and robot groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Robotic surgery was equal to open surgery except with respect to operative time and was superior to endoscopic surgery in Off-Tg levels presenting completeness of the operation in thyroid cancer surgery. Because it has excellent cosmetic results and various technical advantages, it should be considered in young, low-risk patients with thyroid carcinoma less than 1 cm."
21254286,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21254286/,"PURPOSE: True epidemiologic data on hypersensitivity reactions to drugs are scarce. More accurate data may be obtained in more specific clinical settings. Considering their educational background, medical students may be an appropriate target audience for evaluating prevalence of drug hypersensitivity. This study is designed to determine the prevalence of self-reported drug hypersensitivity alongside related factors among young adults.
METHODS: A structured questionnaire was administered to the students.
RESULTS: A total of 1267 students (mean age: 21.71+1.90 years, F/M: 648/619) from all grades responded to the survey. The mean prevalence of self-reported drug hypersensitivity was 4.7% (60/1267). The most frequently involved drugs were beta-lactam antibiotics (55%) followed by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (28%). The most commonly reported clinical presentations were cutaneous (43.3%), followed by systemic (36.8%), cardiovascular (8.3%) and respiratory (8.3%) symptoms. Factors related with reported reactions were higher grades (p=0.015, OR: 2.09), female gender (p=0.006, OR: 2.13), personal history of allergic diseases (p=0.001, OR: 2.64), and family history of drug hypersensitivity (p<0.001, OR: 5.78). Half of the students sought medical help during the acute stage of their reaction. Only 3.2% of the cases have been referred to an allergist for further evaluation.
CONCLUSION: This study, the first of its kind in Turkey, with medical students showed that self-reported hypersensitivity reactions to drugs is highly prevalent and its prevalence seems to be affected by awareness of the individuals in addition to previously reported risk factors. The education of both patients and physicians on the management of drug hypersensitivity seems to be necessary."
21254290,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21254290/,"PURPOSE: Generic substitution (GS) is an important way to decrease medical costs. We aimed to study the opinions and attitudes of Finnish people about GS five years after it was introduced, the reasons for substituting and what people think about generic medicines.
METHODS: We sent a postal survey to a random stratified population sample of 3000 Finnish people aged at least 18 years in 2008. The random sample was drawn from five mainland counties. The sampling was conducted by the Finnish Population Register Centre. The response rate was 62% (n=1844) after exclusion of unobtainable addressees (n=34).
RESULTS: Most of the respondents (70.9%) considered GS a good law reform. However, there were many respondents who were unsure about their opinion (26.9%). The respondents also held the opinion that cheaper medicines are effective (80.9%) and that GS does not cause any risk to drug safety (84.9%). Most of the respondents (88.4%) who had substituted their medicines had not noticed any difference between the previously used and substituted medicines. Two main reasons for substituting were a desire to save money and recommendation by pharmacists. Of the respondents, 16.3% had experience with both substituting and refusing it. The percentage of the respondents who only had experience with refusing GS was 8.6%. Female gender, older age and use of prescription drugs were associated with refusing.
CONCLUSIONS: Finnish people consider GS a good reform. They also have confidence in the effect of cheaper medicines. Savings are the main reason for accepting GS."

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of isotretinoin on the cardiovascular system.
METHODS: Seventy patients with acne vulgaris were enrolled in the study. The patients were treated with a dose of 0.5-1.0 mg/kg per day of isotretinoin. Screening for biochemical and hematologic parameters, heart rate, blood pressure and electrocardiographic parameters were done before treatment and after 3 months of isotretinoin treatment.
RESULTS: Heart rate, systolic/diastolic tension and electrocardiographic parameters (P-wave duration and QTc duration) were not statistically different before compared with after treatment.
CONCLUSION: As far as we know, there is no study researching the effect of isotretinoin on P- and QT-wave measurements in the literature. We found that isotretinoin did not affect P- and QT-wave measurement. Further studies with longer periods of follow-up are needed to understand the effect of isotretinoin on the cardiovascular system."
21255538,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21255538/,"BACKGROUND: The FOXP3 (forkhead Box p3) transcription factor is a marker for T regulatory cells (Treg). During cellular immune responses, Treg are expected to increase in number to ultimately control and limit this response. In renal transplants massive infiltration by T cells is often seen during rejection crises. This prompted us to examine changes in the numbers of FOXP3 positive T cells accompanying acute cellular rejection events.
METHODS: A total of 32 transplant biopsies from 23 patients were studied retrospectively, these 16 protocol biopsies and 16 biopsies taken during rejection episodes included 9 serial pairs (protocol-rejection). To quantify FOXP3 positive T cells, frozen sections were double immunostained with anti-CD3 and anti-FOXP3 antibodies. Areas revealing T cell infiltrates were measured morphometrically and the number of FOXP3 positive cells per 1,000 µm2 of CD3 positive cells was taken as an FOXP3 index.
RESULTS: This index was 0.46 (median, range 0.00-1.00) in the 16 protocol biopsies and 0.48 (median, range 0.16-2.31) in rejection episode biopsies. The highest values were seen during rejection crises, exceeding 1.00 in 6/16 biopsies, whereas no protocol biopsies had values greater than 1.00 (0/16) (difference significant p<0.02). In serial biopsies no consistent behavior was observed; the FOXP3 index remained unchanged, fell slightly or rose to a maximum of 13 fold. Expression levels of FOXP3 could vary within weeks. No correlations were found between donor type, initial therapy, therapy at biopsy, serum creatinine at the time of biopsy, at 3 months or 1 year later, and any of the morphometric parameters (CD3 and FOXP3) studied.
CONCLUSIONS: During rejection of renal allografts the fraction of FOXP3+ Treg cells within the infiltrating T-cell population can increase transiently. This phenomenon was not consistently seen in acute cellular rejection and the information does not appear to be of value for individual patient management in such cases."
21255771,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21255771/,"INTRODUCTION: Transanal endoscopic surgery with conventional laparotomy materials may be an alternative to transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) for the excision of rectal lesions susceptible to local resection.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: We prospectively analysed 27 patients included consecutively between 1999 and 2009, on whom a Transanal endoscopic operation (TEO) was performed by total resection of the rectal wall. All procedures were performed with a 40mm rectoscope, initially designed by us and later with the Storz rectoscope, using conventional laparoscopic tools and material.
RESULTS: We operated on 27 patients with a mean age of 69.4 years: 23 due to benign lesions and 4 malignant. The medium distance of the tumour to the anal margins was 8.2cm (range 5-15) and a mean tumour diameter of 3.38 ± 1.2cm. There were 4 postoperative complications, 3 due to bleeding and one case of perforation. The mean hospital stay was 6 ± 3.75 days. There was no perioperative mortality or recurrences..
CONCLUSION: Performing transanal endoscopic surgery with conventional laparoscopy material is feasible, with a reduction in costs and accessible to laparoscopy surgeons."
21255797,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21255797/,"OBJECTIVE: Since 1988, approximately 1100 pediatric lung transplants have been performed worldwide with consistent improvement in survival. Similarly, survival for pediatric heart transplant has increased over the years; however, in this cohort improvement in survival is exclusively a result of increased early (1-year) survival. To observe if this same phenomenon exists in pediatric lung transplants, the United Network for Organ Sharing database was analyzed to evaluate and characterize how pediatric lung transplant survival has changed in the past 2 decades.
METHODS: The United Network for Organ Sharing database was queried for patients aged 18 years or less who underwent lung transplantation from May 1988 to May 2008. Analysis included 959 pediatric lung transplants.
RESULTS: Age groups were infants (≤1 years) (n = 106 [11%]), children (2-12 years) (n = 299 [31%]), and adolescents (≥13 years) (n = 554 [58%]). A total of 546 (57%) were girls. Kaplan-Meier survival was significantly better in the late era (2002-2008) than in all other eras (1988-1994 and 1995-2001) (P < .05). The half-life for graft has increased significantly over the eras (early, 2.2 years; mid, 3.3 years; and late, 3.8 years). Conditional 1-year survival (ie, mid to late survival) was not significantly different (P = .3) among the eras. Gender, age, diagnosis, prolonged ischemic time, and cytomegalovirus mismatch did not significantly affect overall patient or graft survival. Chronic preoperative steroid dependence (P = .02), preoperative ventilatory dependence (P < .001), and retransplantation (P = .02) were associated with decreased survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Survival in pediatric lung transplant has increased significantly over the years, but this improvement primarily reflects improvement in early survival. Survival in pediatric lung transplant after the first posttransplant year has not changed in more than 2 decades."
21255949,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21255949/,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the appropriate management of cervical lymph node metastasis in patients with tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).
METHODS: The medical records of 49 patients that were surgically treated for tonsillar SCC were evaluated. Preoperative and postoperative stages, clinical factors affecting the nodal metastasis, and its relationship with survival were examined.
RESULTS: Among 49 ipsilateral neck dissection (ND) specimens, 34 neck specimens (69%) were pN+. Out of 17 cases that underwent ipsilateral elective NDs, 4 cases (24%) were found to have pN+ necks. The disease-specific survival of the 34 patients with pN+ necks and 4 patients with occult metastases was worse than that of the remaining patients with pN0 necks and without occult metastasis, respectively (p=0.049 and p=0.023, respectively). All cases (100%) that underwent contralateral therapeutic NDs had pN+ findings. Two out of the 21 cases (less than 10%) that underwent contralateral elective NDs turned out to have pN+ necks and did not show any difference in survival compared to the 19 cases with pN0 necks. The degree of differentiation was associated with contralateral nodal metastasis.
CONCLUSION: Patients with tonsillar SCC require thorough ipsilateral neck treatment because of the high probability of nodal metastasis and the close association between lymph node metastasis and survival. The contralateral cN+ neck should also be treated; however, the contralateral cN0 neck might be preserved with caution on the cases with poorly differentiated primary tumors and/or ipsilateral cN+ necks."
21256092,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21256092/,"BACKGROUND: The amount of excess weight loss (EWL) achieved after bariatric surgery has varied considerably. Reliable preoperative predictors of the postoperative %EWL do not exist. Patient compliance with the physician recommendations has generally been believed to be important for long-term success after bariatric surgery, especially after gastric banding. We hypothesized that poor preoperative patient compliance with office visits, a likely indicator of overall compliance, would be associated with lower %EWL after bariatric surgery at a teaching hospital in the United States.
METHODS: We performed an institutional review board-approved review of prospectively collected data from all patients undergoing bariatric surgery from 2007 to 2009. The patients were categorized into 2 groups: those who had missed <25% of all preoperative appointments at our bariatric center and those who had missed >25%. The average %EWL at 12 months between the 2 groups was compared using the unpaired t test separately for the gastric bypass and gastric banding patients.
RESULTS: The gastric band patients with >25% missed appointments had lost 23% EWL at 12 months compared with 32% EWL for the gastric band patients who had missed <25% of their appointments (P = .01). No difference was found in the %EWL for the gastric bypass patients according to the missed preoperative appointments. The postoperative compliance was significantly poorer than preoperatively.
CONCLUSION: The patients with a greater percentage of missed preoperative appointments had a lower postoperative %EWL at 1 year after gastric banding but not after gastric bypass. This information could prove useful during patient selection or when counseling patients about the type of bariatric surgery to pursue."
21256100,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21256100/,"AIM: Evaluate the need for integrated teaching on normal and pathological gait at medical school.
METHOD: A questionnaire filled out by 91 French general practitioners (GPs, 130 of whom were contacted) with an average of 19 years of practice and 56 sixth-year medical students. Assessment of the students' knowledge of normal and pathological gait.
RESULTS: Seventy-two percent of the GPs and 82% of the students considered gait to be a frequent reason for consultation. Eighty-nine percent of the GPs and 98% of the students stated that they had difficulty analysing a gait disorder. Eighty percent of the GPs and 50% of the students considered that the teaching on gait and gait disorders at medical school was insufficient. The responses notably highlighted the poor coordination between teachers from the various disciplines involved. The students' knowledge of gait was poor (only 20% of their answers were correct). This was especially true for semiological questions, which were correctly answered by less than one student in 10.
CONCLUSION: The results of the present study demonstrate that French medical schools need to provide better teaching on gait. We, therefore, propose the implementation of an integrated teaching programme with a sufficient focus on functional and semiological approaches."
21256389,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21256389/,"INTRODUCTION: Prostate specific antigen (PSA) and digital rectal examination (DRE) are the main tests for initial prostate investigation; there is no consensus about the best criterion for prostate biopsies. We aim to check the accuracy of different criteria in this context including PSA derivatives to detect prostate cancer.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Four different criteria for indication of prostate biopsy were compared: (A) PSA-density (>15 ng/ ml/ cc); (B) PSA > 2,5 ng/ml; (C) PSA-velocity (> 0.7 ng/ ml/ year); (D) free/total PSA ratio (<15%). All biopsies and histopathological examinations were performed by the same urologist and pathologist, respectively.
RESULTS: The study was performed on 180 consecutive biopsies with 37.7% overall cancer detection rate: 29 (16.1%) performed following criterion A, 42 (23.3%) criterion B, 65 (36.1%) criterion C and 44 (24.4%) criterion D. Based on PSA criteria alone, the predictive positive value (PPV) was 37.9% for criterion A, 33.3% for B, 32.3% for C and 50.0% for criterion D, respectively, (p > 0.05). Associating positive DRE with changed PSA, the PPV increased to 50%, 50%, 43.9% and 68.2% for criteria A, B, C and D, respectively (p>0.05). In univariate analysis, DRE (positive versus negative), PSA level (>10 ng/ ml versus <4.0 ng/ ml), free/total PSA ratio (<10% versus >15%) and age were associated with PC. In multivariate analysis only positive DRE was associated with prostate cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: All the criteria of PSA derivatives are complementary and useful predictors of cancer risk. However, a positive DRE increased the PPV of PSA derivatives. New tools are needed to improve the accuracy of prostate cancer detection."
21256689,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21256689/,"BACKGROUND: Despite the expanded range of contraceptive options and the fact that the first acts of intercourse are well protected, abortion rates among young women in France have increased in the last 15 years. These contraceptive failures could result from the lower effectiveness of the condom compared with the pill, and/or the occurrence of contraceptive gaps when switching from the condom to the pill. Adding to the existing literature, this paper explores the conditions by which women and men discontinue using the condom.
METHODS: The study sample was comprised of 1552 men and 1849 women under the age of 30, who participated in the National Survey on Sexual Health in France. Respondents answered questions on contraceptive use, duration of condom use, condom discontinuation and the switch to another method of contraception at the time of condom discontinuation in the context of their first and last sexual relationships.
RESULTS: Condoms, used by a large majority of respondents during the first acts of intercourse, were rapidly discontinued in favor of other methods, particular the pill, for continuing relationships. However, one in ten respondents (women and men alike) had unprotected intercourse after condom discontinuation, when condom use was discontinued in the first trimester of their relationship. Abortions were more frequent among respondents who reported they did not use a condom at the start of a relationship or among women who did not switch to another form of contraception after discontinuing condom use.
CONCLUSION: While condoms are widely used during the first acts of intercourse, the rising abortion rates among young people suggests frequent contraceptive failures, which partly result from unprotected intercourse following condom discontinuation. These results question the dichotomy between HIV campaigns based on condom use and campaigns to reduce unintended pregnancies, which promote use of other forms of contraception, such as the pill. To reduce the incidence of unprotected intercourse, it would be important to promote the use of condoms at sexual debut, both as a contraceptive and preventive method against STIs, and provide counseling about all available contraceptive options, including the use of emergency contraception as a backup option in case of errors of use of the condom."
21256796,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21256796/,"OBJECTIVE: To test if simple motor imagery, like thumb abduction, preferentially influences the excitability of the spinal or cortical motoneurons.
METHODS: Ten healthy subjects underwent two separate experiments, each consisting of recording F waves and MEPs from abductor pollicis brevis (APB) in three consecutive sessions: (1) baseline, (2) after immobilizing APB for 3 h, and (3) after brief muscle exercise. During the immobilization, the subjects were instructed to volitionally relax APB in experiment 1 (relaxation task), and mentally simulate thumb abduction without actual movement in experiment 2 (imagery task).
RESULTS: Relaxation task suppressed both MEPs and F waves. Motor imagery reduced this suppression, restoring F waves nearly completely (94%) and MEPs only partially (77%). Hence, the rest-induced decline of MEPs in part results from cortical modulation. In contrast, statistical analysis revealed no differences in imagery-induced recovery of motoneuron excitabilities whether assessed by F wave or MEP. Thus, increased excitability of spinal motoneurons responsible for F-wave changes also accounts for recovery of MEPs.
CONCLUSIONS: Volitional relaxation depresses the spinal and cortical motoneurons, whereas mental simulation counters rest-induced suppression primarily by restoring spinal excitability.
SIGNIFICANCE: The present findings help elucidate physiologic mechanisms underlying motor imagery."

DESIGN: A descriptive between-subjects study.
SETTING: Multicenter: 4 Veterans Affairs Brain Injury Rehabilitation Centers within the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center network.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 210 patients (active duty, veteran, or military dependent) with moderate-to-severe nonpenetrating TBI who consented during acute rehabilitation for data collection and completed relevant baseline and 12-month follow-up evaluations.
METHODS: Multivariate analysis on neurologic examination predictor variables (upper extremity paresis, lower extremity paresis, Romberg test, and Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS]) was performed with block logistic regression modeling that controlled for duration of PTA.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Glasgow Outcome Score at 1 year.
RESULTS: Glasgow Outcome Score prediction accuracy by using PTA duration was modestly improved with the included neurologic examination measurements. The most influential predictor among them was EDSS, a composite measurement of neurologic impairment. When EDSS was excluded, the simple measurements of upper limb paresis and the Romberg test also provided independent prognostic value.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that simple clinical measurements of neurologic impairment (limb paresis, imbalance, other neurologic deficits) are of value in refining the prediction of long-term global outcome from TBI. These measurements may serve as markers of focal injury not captured by PTA duration, a severity marker weighted toward diffuse injury."
21257131,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21257131/,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the predictive utility of the pattern of low back pain (LBP) in detecting the source of LBP as internal disk disruption (IDD), facet joint pain (FJP), or sacroiliac joint pain (SIJP).
DESIGN: Retrospective chart review.
SETTING: University spine center.
PATIENT SAMPLE: A total of 170 cases from 156 patients presenting with LBP whose low back disorder was definitively diagnosed. The mean age was 54.4 years (SD, 16.2) and median duration of LBP was 12 months (interquartile ranges, 6-32).
METHODS: Charts of consecutive LBP patients who underwent definitive diagnostic spinal procedures including provocation diskography, facet joint blocks, and sacroiliac joint blocks were retrospectively reviewed. Each patient with LBP was queried as to the exact location of their LBP: midline, defined as in-line with the spinous processes, and/or paramidline, defined as lateral to 1 fingerbreadth adjacent to the midline.
OUTCOME MEASURES: In patients with a definitive diagnosis for the source of LBP, the proportion of each diagnosed source of pain was calculated. χ(2) tests were used to identify differences in the percentages of midline and paramidline LBP among the groups of patients testing positive for IDD, FJP, or SIJP. Diagnostic measures of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, diagnostic accuracy, and likelihood ratios of positive and negative tests using the presence/absence of midline and paramidline pain for the diagnosis of IDD, FJP, and SIJP were estimated.
RESULTS: With cases of IDD, significantly greater percentages of patients reported midline LBP (95.8%; χ(2) = 101.4, df = 2, P < .0001) as compared with cases of FJP (15.4%) or SIJP (12.9%). In cases of IDD, significantly lower percentages of patients reported paramidline pain (67.3%; χ(2) = 16.1, df = 2, P = .0003) as compared with cases of FJP (95.0%) or SIJ (96.0%). In cases of IDD, significantly greater percentages of patients reported midline LBP (95.8%; χ(2) = 101.4, df = 2, P < .0001) as compared with cases of FJP (15.4%) or SIJP (12.9%). The specificity of midline LBP for IDD, FJP, and SIJP was 74.8% (95% CI = 65.0%-82.9%), 28.0% (20.1%-37.0%), and 36.0% (28.0%-44.5%), respectively. The negative predictive value of paramidline LBP for IDD, FJP, and SIJP was 29.2% (95% CI = 12.6%-51.1%), 91.7% (73.0%-99.0%), and 95.8% (78.9%-99.9%). The diagnostic accuracy of midline LBP for IDD, FJP, and SIJP was 83.5%, 24.1%, and 31.8%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of midline LBP increases the probability of lumbar IDD and reduces the probability of symptomatic FJ and SIJ dysfunction. The presence of isolated paramidline LBP increases the probability of symptomatic FJ or SIJ but mildly reduces the likelihood of lumbar IDD."
21257316,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21257316/,"OBJECTIVE: It is well accepted that patients with severe mitral regurgitation (MR) benefit from mitral valve repair; however, the management of those with less than severe leakage is controversial. Watchful waiting is often advocated and considered safe, but the risk of developing left ventricular (LV) dysfunction under medical management is unknown.
METHODS: Using a population-based County-wide study database, we analyzed echocardiograms during clinical follow-up and medical management of 204 patients with mitral valve prolapse and less-than-severe MR. LV dysfunction was defined per American Heart Association guidelines as an ejection fraction (EF) <60% or LV end-systolic dimension > 40 mm.
RESULTS: At index examination, mean age was 57 years and 121 (59%) were women. The mean EF was 62%, and 62 (30%) had evidence of LV dysfunction. MR severity was mild in 121 (59%), mild-moderate in 23 (11%), moderate in 36 (18%) and moderate-severe in 24 (12%). During follow-up (mean 8.6 years), 79 patients (39%) demonstrated progression of MR by at least one grade. Greater degrees of regurgitation at index echocardiogram were associated with greater progression during follow-up (P=0.0001). After adjusting for age, sex, body surface area (BSA), and baseline regurgitation grade, multivariable modeling revealed that larger LV end-diastolic dimension (odds ratio (OR)=1.14; P=0.0018) and greater diastolic septal thickness (OR=1.40; P=0.0211) predicted greater progression of MR with time. From initial diagnosis to follow-up echocardiography, EF declined, while left-heart dimensions and pulmonary arterial pressure increased. Of the 142 patients with normal baseline LV function, 52% developed either worsening MR or de novo LV dysfunction. Importantly, even in the 87 patients with stable regurgitation, 18 (21%) developed new LV dysfunction during follow-up. Fifty-two patients (25%) eventually underwent mitral valve repair. Following surgery, there were significant decreases in EF, LV end-diastolic dimensions and LV mass; while 11 developed de novo LV dysfunction.
CONCLUSIONS: Over half of patients with chronic persistent, but sub-severe MR due to mitral leaflet prolapse develop LV dysfunction or worsening regurgitation despite optimal medical management. LV deterioration can occur even in the absence of MR progression. These data advocate for the development of detailed guidelines supporting frequent echocardiographic monitoring and the identification of earlier triggers for surgical consideration prior to the development of LV dysfunction in this patient population."
21257648,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21257648/,"AIM: To identify the effects of local recommendations of pharmacogenetic testing in psychiatry with respect to treatment costs.
METHODS: Based on Danish patient registers, individual treatment costs within a 365-day period at three psychiatric hospitals recommending and using pharmacogenetic testing is compared retrospectively with treatment costs at other Danish psychiatric hospitals using alternate treatment strategies. Primary outcome of interest is total direct costs analyzed by multilevel modelling. Secondary outcome measures are healthcare consumption within specific sectors analyzed by Tobitregressions.
RESULTS: Costs among patients treated at hospitals recommending and using pharmacogenetic testing were not found to be statistically significantly different from costs among patients treated at sites using alternate treatment strategies. In spite of recommendations to test all patients the uptake of the test was, however, low (26-31 %). Treatment practice using routine therapeutic drug monitoring (in Ãrhus) shows a trend towards lower costs.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on this natural experiment we were not able to document statistically significant differences in total costs between treatment sites that had guidelines recommending pharmacogenetic testing, relative to sites without such guidelines, over a period of one year. However, guidelines of pharmacogenetic testing and possibly also therapeutic drug monitoring seem to lead to reductions in costs for primary care services. In the case of the former, reductions do, however, seem to be outweighed by increases in costs for psychiatric and non-psychiatric inpatient stays. In conclusion, no statistically significant differences in total direct costs across sites with different treatment strategies were found."
21257844,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21257844/,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies indicate that isolated posterior cruciate ligament injuries demonstrate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical evidence of healing when treated nonoperatively; however, the authors are unaware of any other study that has looked at whether initial MRI can predict posterior cruciate ligament stability at the time of surgery in patients with knee dislocation.
HYPOTHESIS: An MRI grading system will predict laxity on posterior drawer testing at the time of surgery in patients with knee dislocations.
STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study (prognosis); Level of evidence, 2.
METHODS: Forty-two consecutive patients with knee dislocation or multiple-ligament knee injury evaluated by MRI were included in the study. An assignment of grade 0 (intact), grade I (injured/fibers intact), grade II (partial tearing of ligament), or grade III (complete tear) was made after each reading on 2 separate occasions by 3 surgeons. Posterior laxity of the knee was graded by the magnitude of excursion on the posterior drawer test by the senior author at the time of surgery. Interobserver and intraobserver reliability of the MRI grading scheme expressed by the kappa statistic κ, as well as the predictive value of MRI grade in determining stability of the posterior cruciate ligament at the time of surgery, was assessed.
RESULTS: The posterior cruciate ligament injury grading scheme tested demonstrated moderate to substantial intraobserver agreement (κ = 0.66, κ = 0.53, and κ = 0.52, respectively, for all raters). Interobserver reliability demonstrated only moderate agreement (κ = 0.49). If the grading scheme was changed to group both grades 0 and I (intact) and grades II and III (disrupted), intraobserver reliability demonstrated substantial to almost perfect agreement (κ = 0.83, κ = 0.80, and κ = 0.75), and interobserver reliability demonstrated substantial agreement (κ = 0.70). If the posterior cruciate ligament was classified as intact (grade 0 [intact] or grade I [injured]) on initial MRI, the injured knee was judged clinically stable (tibia anterior to or flush with the femoral condyles on posterior drawer testing) at the time of surgery 98.5% (95% confidence interval, 93%-100%) of the time. When the posterior cruciate ligament was classified as disrupted (grade II [partial tear] or grade III [complete tear]), the injured knee was judged unstable (tibia posterior to the femoral condyles on posterior drawer testing) 57.5% (95% confidence interval, 40%-73%) of the time.
CONCLUSION: The presented system of grading posterior cruciate ligament injury in patients with knee dislocation on initial MRI demonstrates moderate to substantial interobserver and intraobserver reliability that increases if the grading scheme is modified. An initial MRI scan read as grade I may predict stability to posterior drawer at the time of surgery. Even with MRI evidence of disruption in the posterior cruciate ligament (grade II and grade III injuries), posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction may not be clinically indicated at the time of reconstruction and/or repair of other associated injuries."
21257976,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21257976/,"OBJECTIVE: To examine whether sleep problems in infancy and early toddlerhood precede symptoms of anxiety or depression at 3 years.
METHODS: Data on specific sleep problems at 2 months and 24 months were available for 4,782 children participating in a population-based cohort in The Netherlands. The Child Behavior Checklist for toddlers containing the Anxious/Depressed syndrome scale was assessed at 36 months. We adjusted the logistic regression analyses for several confounding factors; the analyses with sleep problems at 24 months were additionally adjusted for preexisting anxiety or depressive symptoms (at 18 months).
RESULTS: Dyssomnia and parental presence during sleep onset at 2 months and 24 months were associated with anxiety or depressive symptoms at 3 years (e.g., parental presence: odds ratio(2 months), 1.22; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.44; odds ratio(24 months), 1.58; 95% confidence interval, 1.30-1.92). Parasomnia, short sleep duration, and absence of set bedtime at 24 months, but not at 2 months, also preceded anxiety or depressive symptoms. These significant associations were not due to children's anxiety or depressive symptoms at 18 months. Rhythmicity and co-sleeping were not associated with later anxiety or depressive symptoms. Additional analyses provided little evidence for a bidirectional association with anxiety or depressive symptoms preceding later sleep problems.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the importance of sleep problems early in life, because different sleep problems are associated with the frequency of anxiety or depressive symptoms. Therefore, healthcare practitioners must be particularly attentive to these problems in young children. Future research should address possible mechanisms underlying the association between disturbed sleeping and anxiety or depressive symptoms."
21258074,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21258074/,"BACKGROUND: This study evaluated whether an objective tool would provide a more reliable and valid assessment of perioperative risk compared with the ASA-physical status (ASA-PS) in children.
METHODS: A system-based risk assessment tool was developed using these categories: Neurological, Airway, Respiratory, Cardiovascular, and Other (NARCO) with a subcomponent grading surgical severity (SS). Anaesthesiologists reviewed the preoperative assessments and assigned NARCO, SS, and ASA-PS scores independently. Perioperative outcomes were recorded by trained observers. Validity and reliability of the tools were evaluated.
RESULTS: NARCO correlated with ASA-PS (ρ=0.664; P<0.01) supporting its criterion validity. Inter-rater reliability of the measures was supported (intraclass correlation coefficients 0.71-0.96; κ 0.43-0.87) except for the Airway category. Measures of exact agreement were slightly better for NARCO compared with ASA-PS. NARCO, SS, and ASA-PS scores correlated significantly with perioperative escalation of care, adverse events (AE), hospital length of stay, and admission status. Correlations between NARCO and ASA-PS and outcomes improved when SS was factored into their coding. There were significant, but low, correlations between all measures and mortality. The odds of having escalation of care, AE, and mortality were 5-47 times greater among children with higher risk scores.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that all measures of outcome have acceptable to excellent reliability with a slight improvement in agreement for the NARCO compared with the ASA-PS. This study supports the validity of both the NARCO and the ASA-PS in predicting perioperative risk in children with a slight improvement in correlations when combined with the SS score."
21258128,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21258128/,"OBJECTIVES: Italy was the first European nation to offer free vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18. The vaccination is actively encouraged and is available free of charge to 11-year-old girls. The introduction of new technologies such as HPV DNA testing and HPV vaccination requires cost-effectiveness analysis of cervical cancer strategies in Italy for both vaccinated and unvaccinated women.
METHODS: A calibrated Markov model was developed to describe the natural history of HPV infection and cervical carcinogenesis. We performed a microsimulation generating the life histories of 10 million women. Changes in these life histories occur as consequences of prevention strategies. We estimated costs of screening activities using an activity-based costing analysis. We assessed lifetime risk due to cervical cancer, lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-expectancy (QALE) for 18 scenarios. Strategies varied by screening interval (three and five years), primary and triage test (Pap test and HPV DNA test), and HPV 16 and 18 vaccination.
RESULTS: The current screening policy (Pap test every three years) is more costly and less effective than HPV DNA test and Pap test triage every five years. For unvaccinated women an HPV DNA test every five years with a Pap test triage was cost-effective (ICER €5753/QALE). Vaccination followed by the same screening strategy was cost-effective (ICER €23,951/QALE) for women who are eligible to be vaccinated.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings strongly support changing the Pap screening policy to the use of HPV DNA as a primary test with Pap test triage for both vaccinated and unvaccinated women."
21258234,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21258234/,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have reported a greater frequency of sensitization to latex in the female population and a higher incidence of anaphylactic reactions to latex during cesarean section. In this study, the authors investigated the prevalence of latex sensitization in obstetric patients compared with nonpregnant subjects.
METHODS: Two hundred ninety-four healthy pregnant women who were at term with a singleton fetus and scheduled for caesarean section (group A) were compared with 294 healthy nulliparous women with childbirth potential undergoing gynecologic surgery (group B). Before surgery, patients completed a questionnaire, and venous blood samples were collected to measure specific immunoglobulin E serum concentrations with a fluorescent enzyme immunoassay test. Skin-prick tests were performed if adverse reactions occurred during surgery. Latex allergy was diagnosed on the basis of immunoglobulin E results and/or positive skin-prick tests.
RESULTS: The prevalence of latex sensitization was higher in group A than in group B (15/294, 5.1% vs. 5/294, 1.7%; P < 0.05). A significant difference in specific immunoglobulin E serum concentration was noted between pregnant and nonpregnant patients who had a positive fluorescent enzyme immunoassay test (median serum concentration: 1.93 kilounits/l; interquartile range = 2.28 vs. 0.78 kilounits/l; interquartile range = 1.07; P less than 0.05). Two patients in group A experienced an anaphylactic reaction to latex. Statistical analysis disclosed no association between latex sensitization and accepted risk factor for latex allergy.
CONCLUSIONS: The authors report a higher prevalence of latex sensitization in the obstetric population than in nonpregnant subjects undergoing gynecologic surgery."
21258271,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21258271/,"STUDY DESIGN: We compared the sizes of the dural sac among conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), axial loaded MRI, and upright myelography in patients with lumbar spinal canal stenosis (LSCS).
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether axial loaded MRI can demonstrate similar positional changes of the dural sac size as were detected by upright myelography in LSCS.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: In patients with LSCS, constriction of the dural sac is worsened and symptoms are aggravated during standing or walking. To disclose such positional changes, upright myelography has been widely used. Recently, axial loaded MRI, which can simulate a standing position, has been developed. However, there has been no study to compare the dural sac size between axial loaded MRI and upright myelography.
METHODS: Forty-four patients underwent conventional MRI, axial loaded MRI, and myelography. Transverse and anteroposterior diameters and the cross-sectional areas of the dural sac from L2-L3 to L5-S1 were compared. Pearson correlations of the diameters between the MRIs and the myelograms were analyzed. On the basis of the myelograms, all disc levels were divided into severe and nonsevere constriction groups. In each group, the diameters and the cross-sectional areas were compared. Sensitivity and specificity to detect severe constriction were calculated for the conventional and axial loaded MRI.
RESULTS: Transverse and anteroposterior diameters at L4-L5 in the axial loaded MRI and myelogram were significantly smaller than those observed in the conventional MRI (P < 0.001). Cross-sectional areas in the axial loaded MRI were significantly smaller than those in the conventional MRI at L2-L3, L3-L4, and L4-L5 (P < 0.001). Between the axial loaded MRI and the myelography, Pearson correlation coefficients of the transverse and anteroposterior diameters were 0.85 and 0.87, respectively (P < 0.001), which were higher than those for conventional MRI. Reductions of the dural sac sizes in the axial loaded MRI were more evident in the severe constriction group. The axial loaded MRI detected severe constriction with a higher sensitivity (96.4%) and specificity (98.2%) than the conventional MRI.
CONCLUSION: The axial loaded MRI demonstrated a significant reduction in the dural sac size and significant correlations of the dural sac diameters with the upright myelogram. Furthermore, the axial loaded MRI had higher sensitivity and specificity than the conventional MRI for detecting the severe constriction observed in the myelogram. Therefore, the axial loaded MRI can be used to represent positional changes of the dural sac size detected by the upright myelography in patients with LSCS."
21259012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21259012/,"PURPOSE: Intussusception is the most common cause of acute abdomen in infants and preschool children. Nonoperative reduction using air enema is an established treatment in children with intussusception. The aim of this study was to determine whether length of the history influences the outcome of pneumatic reduction of intussusception in children?
METHODS: The medical records of 256 consecutive children with intussusception between July 1998 and June 2010, who underwent air enema reduction regardless of the length of the history were reviewed. In all 256 patients, intussusception was confirmed by ultrasound before proceeding to air enema.
RESULTS: The length of history ranged from 2 to 240 h with median time of 18.5 h. The median age in 256 patients was 7 months (range 1 day to 12 years). The presenting clinical features included irritability/abdominal pain (77%), vomiting (80%), bleeding per rectum (36%) and palpable abdominal mass (50%). Air enema reduction was successful in 234 (91.5%) of the 256 patients. In 22 (8.5%) patients, air enema failed to reduce the intussusception and 3 (1.1%) of these patients had colonic perforation during the procedure. All 22 patients required surgery. The duration of symptoms did not influence the outcome of pneumatic reduction. 37 (14%) patients developed recurrence after successful pneumatic reduction of intussusception, with 58% presenting within 48 h of the initial procedure.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that pneumatic reduction should be first-line treatment in all children with intussusception regardless of the length of the history."
21259017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21259017/,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the prevalence of factor V Leiden (FVL) and prothrombin (PT) G20210A mutations in Portuguese women with unexplained recurrent miscarriage (RM) and a control group of parous women.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: FVL and PT G20210A analysis were carried out in 100 women with three or more consecutive miscarriages and 100 controls with no history of pregnancy losses. Secondary analysis was made regarding gestational age at miscarriage (embryonic and fetal losses).
RESULTS: Overall, the prevalence of FVL and PT G20210A was similar in women with RM (5 and 3%) compared with controls (5 and 1%) OR 1.36 (CI 95% 0.45-4.08). In RM embryonic subgroup, PT G20210A was observed in 1.3% of women and FVL prevalence (2.6%) was inclusively lesser than that of controls. Both polymorphisms were more prevalent in women with fetal losses than in controls, although statistical significance was not reached due to the small size of the >10 weeks' subgroup.
CONCLUSION: These data indicate that neither FVL nor PT G20210A is associated with RM prior to 10 weeks of gestation. Therefore, its screening is not indicated as an initial approach in Portuguese women with embryonic RM and negative personal thromboembolic history."
21259242,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21259242/,"BACKGROUND: Locally recurrent rectal cancer involving the upper sacrum is generally considered a contra-indication to curative surgery. The aim of this study was to determine if a survival benefit was seen in patients undergoing high sacrectomy.
METHODS: All patients with locally recurrent rectal cancer involving the sacrum above the 3rd sacral body between 1999 and 2007 were retrospectively reviewed. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed.
RESULTS: Nine patients were identified with a median age of 63 years. The proximal extent of sacral resection was through S2 (n = 6), S1 (n = 2), and L5-S1 (n = 1). All patients had R0 negative-margin resection. Median operative time was 13.7 hr, and median operative blood transfusion was 3.7 L. Thirty-day mortality was nil. Postoperative complications requiring surgical intervention occurred in three patients. Local re-recurrence in the pelvis occurred in one patient. The overall median survival was 31 months (range, 2-39 months). Three patients still alive are free of disease after 40, 76, and 101 months, respectively. Ultimately, all deaths were due to metastatic disease.
CONCLUSIONS: High sacrectomy that achieves clear margins in patients with recurrent rectal cancer is safe and feasible. A majority will die of metastatic disease, but long-term survival may be possible in some patients."

OBJECTIVE: To compare clinical outcomes between patients admitted to a resident-run MICU and a PA-run MICU.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected MICU data was performed for 5,346 patients admitted to an MICU from January 2004 through January 2007; 3,971 patients were admitted to a resident-run MICU (resident group) and 1,375 to a PA-run MICU (PA group).
RESULTS: The groups were relatively similar, though the resident group had a higher rate of renal insufficiency (25% vs. 22%, P = .05) and the PA group had a higher rate of cerebrovascular accidents (5.6% vs. 4%, P = .02). Hospital length of stay (LOS) was similar, with a median of 9 days in the PA group and 8 days in the resident group (P = .59). MICU LOS was slightly longer for the PA group: a median of 2.58 days (1.55-4.86) vs. 2.33 days (1.39-4.16) in the resident group. After matching by propensity score, we could not confirm this increased LOS. There was no difference in hospital mortality or in ICU mortality between the two groups either in uncontrolled or controlled analyses. Survival analyses showed no difference in 28-day survival between the two groups.
CONCLUSION: A PA-run MICU has similar outcomes when compared to a resident-run MICU."

METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of 13,789 women who received the GCT and did not have a diagnosis of GDM at the University of California, San Francisco UCSF. GCT values were categorized and examined as predictors of perinatal morbidity using chi-square test and multivariable logistic regression analyses adjusting for maternal characteristics.
RESULTS: In women with an elevated GCT but without GDM, the odds of preeclampsia, cesarean delivery, and elevated birth weight were increased. The odds of large-for-gestational age status were increased with aOR 2.0 (95% CI 1.38-2.90) in the 160-179 mg/dl group. The odds of shoulder dystocia was increased with aOR 3.35 (CI 1.03-10.88) in the ≥180 mg/dl group.
CONCLUSION: In women without GDM, elevated 50-gram GCT values were associated with higher odds of perinatal morbidity. These findings further support evidence that impaired glucose tolerance is a continuum with possible associated adverse outcomes even at mild ranges; additional research is required to investigate appropriate interventions for women with abnormal screens for GDM."
21261484,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21261484/,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of fluoride and casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP) containing topical agents on shear bond strength (SBS) and fracture mode of orthodontic brackets bonded to demineralized enamel.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty freshly extracted human premolar teeth were randomly divided into four equal groups. The first group was the control, and no pretreatment was performed on this group. In the remaining three groups, demineralization process was performed and teeth were stored in artificial saliva. In group II, bonding was performed after demineralization. Pretreatment with fluoride and CPP-ACP gels was performed in groups III and IV, respectively. Brackets were bonded using a conventional system. The SBS of these brackets was measured and recorded in MPa. Adhesive remnant index (ARI) scores were determined after the brackets failed. Data were analyzed with analysis of variance (ANOVA), Tukey, and G-tests at the P < .05 level.
RESULTS: ANOVA comparison of four groups revealed statistically significant differences. No significant differences were found between control and CPP-ACP-treated groups. However, lower SBS values were recorded for group II (6.6 ± 3.9 MPa) and group III (17.1 ± 2.9 MPa). ARI scores were significantly different among the four groups (P < .001). No enamel detachment was found in the control group, and enamel detachment measured 75% for group II.
CONCLUSIONS: Fluoride and CPP-ACP gel applications showed higher debonding forces compared to bonding in untreated demineralized samples. CPP-ACP pretreatment resulted in comparable SBS values compared with the control group."
21261572,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21261572/,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the frequency of after-hours discharges of patients from the intensive care unit and its effect on in-hospital mortality.
DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Observational cohort study conducted in the ICU of Westmead Hospital, a tertiary care teaching hospital in Sydney. All adult patients admitted to the ICU between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2006 were included in the study cohort. Patients were grouped into two categories based on the time of discharge from the ICU: during work hours (08:00-17:59 hours) or after-hours (18:00-07:59 hours).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Mortality after discharge from the ICU according to time of discharge.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: 2300 patients accounted for 2451 admission episodes during the study period. There were 151 readmissions, involving 133 patients (5.8%). Excluded from the study cohort were 36 patients (1.6%) who were discharged home, 39 (1.7%) who were transferred to other hospitals, and 354 (15.4%) who died during their first stay in the ICU. Data on the remaining 1871 patients who were discharged alive at the end of their first ICU admission were included in our analysis. Of these patients, 1221 (65.3%) were discharged from the ICU during work-hours and 650 (34.7%) after-hours. Crude mortality for patients discharged after-hours was 13.7%, compared with 10.1% for those discharged during work hours. After adjustment for age, APACHE II score and discharge destination, the risk of mortality among patients discharged after-hours was statistically significant (adjusted odds ratio, 1.38 [95% CI, 1.01-1.88]; P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: A high proportion of patients (34.7%) were discharged from the ICU after-hours. Discharge after-hours was associated with a higher risk of in-hospital mortality than discharge during work hours."
21261713,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21261713/,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: There is scarcity of data about children on a combination of endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) and endoscopic sclerotherapy (EST). We assessed the efficacy of EVL followed by EST and EST alone in children with extrahepatic portal venous obstruction (EHPVO).
METHODS: From January 2000 to March 2007, 186 consecutive children (mean age 6.3 ± 4.2 years, 82% boys) with EHPVO with variceal bleeding were included. EVL followed by EST (Group I, n = 101) or EST alone (Group II, n = 60) was carried out at 3-weekly intervals until eradication. Surveillance endoscopy was done at 3 to 6-monthly intervals. In all cases, the number of sessions required to eradicate the esophageal varices, the volume of sclerosant, the complications and the endoscopic outcome on follow up were recorded.
RESULTS: Eradication was achieved in 158 of 161 (98%) children and 25 were lost to follow up. Group I required significantly fewer sessions (5.2 ± 1.8 vs 6.8 ± 2.8, P < 0.005), less sclerosant (13 ± 8.2 mL vs 30 ± 20 mL, P < 0.001) and had fewer complications (7% vs 28%, P < 0.001) as compared with Group II. On follow up (33 ± 17.6 months in Group I and 43 ± 16.7 months in Group II), there was a significant increase in the prevalence of portal hypertensive gastropathy as well as isolated gastric varices in both the groups. However, the prevalence of gastroesophageal varices decreased.
CONCLUSIONS: EVL followed by EST is better than EST alone in children with EHPVO as it requires fewer sessions and has fewer complications. However, following eradication, evolution of gastric varices and portal hypertensive gastropathy was similar in the two groups."

METHODS: Eight different treatment groups were formed: group 1, 60 patients receiving Saccharomyces boulardii; group 2, 60 patients receiving zinc; group 3, 60 patients receiving lactose-free formula; group 4, 60 patients receiving S. boulardii plus zinc; group 5, 60 patients receiving S. boulardii plus lactose-free formula; group 6, 60 patients receiving zinc plus lactose-free formula; group 7, 60 patients receiving S. boulardii plus zinc plus lactose-free formula; group 8, 60 patients receiving only oral and/or parenteral rehydration solutions.
RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were found in the time to resolution of fever after intervention between the treatment groups and the control group. The time to resolution of vomiting was significantly lower in group 4 compared with groups 1 and 5. The duration of diarrhea was significantly reduced in groups 2 and 4 compared to control. A statistically significant difference in the duration of hospitalization was observed for the groups 2 and 4 in comparison to the control group.
CONCLUSIONS: A different combination of adjunct therapies did not seem to bring additional value to rehydration therapy in children with rotavirus diarrhea except for in those receiving only zinc and zinc plus S. boulardii.

21261951,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21261951/,"BACKGROUND: Therapeutic adherence of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is poor. It is therefore necessary to determine the magnitude of non-adherence to develop strategies to correct this behaviour. The purpose of this study was to analyse the diagnostic validity of indirect adherence methods.
SAMPLE: 195 COPD patients undergoing scheduled inhaled treatment attending 5 Primary Care Centres of Malaga, Spain.
VARIABLES: Sociodemographic profile, illness data, spirometry, quality of life (St. George Respiratory Questionnaire: SGRQ), and inhaled medication counting (count of dose/pill or electronic monitoring) were collected. The patient's knowledge of COPD (Batalla test:BT),their attitude towards treatment (Morisky-Green test: MGT) and their self-reported therapeutic adherence (Haynes-Sackett test: HST) were used as methods of evaluating adherence. The follow-up consisted four visits over one year (the recruitment visit: V0; and after 1 month:V1; 6 months:V2; and 1 year:V3).
RESULTS: The mean age was 69.59 (95% CI, 68.29-70.89) years old and 93.8% were male. Other findings included: 85.4% had a low educational level, 23.6% were smokers, 71.5% mild-moderate COPD stage with a FEV1 = 56.86 (SD = 18.85); exacerbations per year = 1.41(95% CI, 1-1.8). The total SGRQ score was 44.96 (95% CI, 42.46-47.46), showing a mild self-perceived impairment in health. The prevalence of adherence (dose/pill count) was 68.1% (95% CI, 60.9-75.3) at V1, 80% (95% CI, 73-87) at V2 and 84% (95% CI, 77.9) at V3. The MGT showed a specificity of 67.34% at V1, 76.19% at V2 and 69.62% at V3. The sensitivity was 53.33% at V1, 66.66% at V2 and 33.33% at V3.The BT showed a specificity of 55.1% at V1, 70.23% at V2 and 67.09% at V3. The sensitivity was 68.88% at V1, 71.43% at V2 and 46.66% at V3. Considering both tests together, the specificity was 86.73% at V1, 94.04% at V2 and 92.49% at V3 and the sensitivity was 37.77% at V1, 47.62% at V2 and 13.3% at V3.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of treatment adherence changes over time. Indirect methods (dose/pill count and self-reported) can be useful to detect non-adherence in COPD patients. The combination of MGT and BT is the best approach to test self-reported adherence."
21262590,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21262590/,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate continuous (CON) compared with cyclic (CYC) administration of combined oral estroprogestins for 6 months after laparoscopic excision of ovarian endometriomas associated with pain.
DESIGN: Multicenter, prospective, randomized trial (Canadian Task Force classification I).
SETTING: Tertiary care university hospitals.
PATIENTS: Fifty-seven women aged 18 to 40 years with ovarian endometriomas associated with moderate to severe pelvic pain who underwent laparoscopic excision of the disease.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to receive postoperative estroprogestins for 6 months, administered as either a CON or CYC regimen.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At 3, 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively, patients were evaluated for recurrence of endometriomas (defined as cysts >3 cm in greatest diameter) using ultrasonography, for recurrence of pain using a visual analog scale, and for patient satisfaction. After a minimum follow-up of 12 months (mean, 22 months), at intent-to-treat analysis, no endometrioma recurrence was observed in the CON group, whereas there was recurrence in 1 patient (4%) in the CYC group. Pain recurred in 5 and 9 patients, respectively (17% vs 32%; p = .23). Compared with pretreatment values, pain scores improved in both groups, with no significant difference between the 2 groups. Most patients in both groups were either satisfied or very satisfied, with no significant difference between treatment groups. However, compared with the CYC group, significantly more patients in the CON group experienced moderate to severe adverse effects, and therapy was discontinued (41% vs 14%; p = .03).
CONCLUSIONS: Although both regimens were equally effective insofar as postoperative pain and recurrence of endometrioma, when compared with the CYC regimen, the CON regimen seems to be associated with significantly more adverse effects and discontinuation rates."
21262882,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21262882/,"OBJECTIVES: To (1) analyze the financial returns of fellowship training in pediatrics and to compare them with those generated from a career in general pediatrics and (2) evaluate the effects of including the newly enacted federal loan-repayment program and of changing the length of fellowship training.
BACKGROUND: Although the choice to enter fellowship is based on many factors, economic considerations are important. We are not aware of any study that has focused on the financial impact of fellowship training in pediatrics.
METHODS: Using standard financial techniques, we estimated the financial returns that a graduating pediatric resident might anticipate from additional fellowship training followed by a career as a pediatric subspecialist and compared them with the returns that might be expected from starting a career as a general pediatrician immediately after residency.
RESULTS: The financial returns of pediatric fellowship training varied greatly depending on which subspecialty fellowship was chosen. Pursuing a fellowship in most pediatric subspecialties was a negative financial decision when compared with pursuing no fellowship at all and practicing as a general pediatrician. Incorporating the federal loan-repayment program targeted toward pediatric subspecialists and decreasing the length of fellowship training from 3 to 2 years would substantially increase the financial returns of the pediatric subspecialties.
CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric subspecialization yielded variable financial returns. The results from this study can be helpful to current pediatric residents as they contemplate their career options. In addition, our study may be valuable to policy makers evaluating health care reform and pediatric workforce-allocation issues."
21262907,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21262907/,"UNLABELLED: Objective. Peritoneal protein clearance (PrC) is recognized as a new marker of systemic endothelial dysfunction and predictor of mortality in patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD). Given that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI)/angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) could improve endothelial dysfunction in the general population, we aim to explore whether this benefit is present in the PD population.
METHODS: We analysed data from a PD cohort with data prospectively collected. The PrC, defined daily doses (DDDs) of ACEI/ARBs, as well as other clinical variables were recorded at baseline and then repeatedly measured at 3- to 6-month intervals till to death or censoring. A total of 156 patients were treated with ACEI/ARBs with 0.60 of median time-averaged DDDs, the untreated group consisted of 149 patients who received none of the above drugs during the follow-up.
RESULTS: The baseline and time-averaged PrC were 69.9 ± 34.7 mL/day and 75.2 ± 28.3 mL/day, respectively. Time-averaged PrC was an independent predictor of mortality adjusted for recognized confounders in a multivariate Cox regression model (P = 0.037). There were no significant differences in the time course of PrC (P = 0.82) and peritoneal protein loss (P = 0.83) between the ACEI/ARBs group and the untreated group after adjustment for age, gender, diabetes, baseline C-reactive protein, mean blood pressure and baseline PrC or baseline peritoneal protein loss in the generalized linear mixed model.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that ACEI/ARBs did not correlate with a decreased PrC in this observational study. The effect of higher doses of ACEI/ARBs needs to be determined in future interventional studys."
12141320,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12141320/,"PURPOSE: The earliest awareness of new evidence should beat the trial sites that first generated the evidence. We hypothesized that sites that had taken part in the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE) trial, which demonstrated that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors were beneficial following myocardial infarction, would be more likely to adopt their use in this group of patients.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of data collected for the 25,886 North American patients with myocardial infarction enrolled in the Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO-1) study from 1990 to 1993. Patients were treated at 659 hospitals, 22 of which had also taken part in SAVE. One third of patients were enrolled after SAVE was published in 1992. The primary outcome was use of an ACE inhibitor at discharge. We analyzed the data using hierarchical models and multivariate regression.
RESULTS: Patients treated at sites that had taken part in SAVE were not more likely to receive an ACE inhibitor at discharge than were patients treated at non-SAVE sites (226/1415 [16%] vs. 3671/24,471 [15%]; odds ratio [OR] = 1.1; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.8 to 1.4; P = 0.67). Although patients with heart failure were more likely to receive ACE inhibitors than were those without heart failure, there was no difference between SAVE and non-SAVE sites (90/297 [30%] vs. 1322/4405 [30%]; P = 0.75). Use of ACE inhibitors increased following the publication of the SAVE trial, but again there was no significant difference in adoption of the drug between SAVE and non-SAVE sites.
CONCLUSION: Sites that had taken part in SAVE were no more likely to adopt ACE inhibitors for patients with myocardial infarction than were sites that had not taken part. If those who generated the evidence are slow to translate it into practice, it is unlikely that passive forms of dissemination can improve the quality of care. To accelerate adoption of new evidence, we need to understand factors other than knowledge and awareness that influence practice."
12141580,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12141580/,"BACKGROUND: There is substantial national interest in the widening gap in socio-economic inequalities. The aim of this study was to examine time trends in age-specific mortality in Trent Region comparing rates by socio-economic deprivation from 1988 to 1998.
METHODS: Mortality rates from 1988 to 1998 were calculated for each of five deprivation categories (derived using 1991-based enumeration district level Townsend scores) for men and women aged 45-54, 55-64, 65-74 and 75-84 years. Rate ratios (95 per cent confidence intervals) were calculated for the years 1988-1990 and 1996-1998, comparing the most deprived with the least deprived categories.
RESULTS: For men aged 45-54, the rate ratio for the most deprived relative to the least deprived category was 2.42 (2.2-2.67) in 1988-1990 and 2.4 (2.17-2.65) in 1996-1998. Amongst women the ratio fell from 2.14 (1.88-2.42) to 1.67 (1.47-1.88). For men aged 55-64, the rate ratio fell from 2.07 (1.95-2.19) to 1.79 (1.67-1.91). For women the fall was from 1.99 (1.84-2.14) to 1.59 (1.46-1.73). For those aged 65-74, the fall was from 1.65 (1.58-1.72) to 1.33 (1.28-1.39) for men and from 1.55 (1.47-1.63) to 1.37 (1.30-1.45) for women. For people aged 75-84, no clear convergence in rates was seen.
CONCLUSION: There appear to be decreases in socio-economic inequalities in mortality between 1988 and 1998 in Trent Region. These trends run counter to those described in the majority of recent literature."
12141591,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12141591/,"BACKGROUND: There are several alternatives for providing ultrasound scanning, besides traditional hospital-based services. One such alternative is for general practitioners (GPs) to perform scanning in the community. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of GP ultrasound scanning on the use of National Health Service (NHS) resources in the United Kingdom (UK), and elicit patients' preferences for having an ultrasound scan.
METHODS: A cost analysis and an assessment of quality of GP scans, based on a clinical audit and a postal survey of patients' preferences, were carried out. The setting was a rural general practice and urban teaching hospital in the Grampian region of Scotland. The analysis of costs and assessment of the quality of GP scans were based on 131 patients scanned at the practice in a 6 month clinical audit period. The survey of patients' preferences was undertaken on a random sample of 500 patients from the GPs' list and 250 consecutive patients scanned at the practice.
RESULTS: The assessment of the management of patients during audit revealed that the scanner at the practice reduced the number of hospital scans, number of out-patient and in-patient visits, and emergency admissions. The unit cost of a scan was higher in the practice than at the hospital. However, when all the costs for a scanning episode were considered, the total and average costs were lower in the practice because of the avoidance of hospital visits. The results showed that the quality of GP scanning, subject to further training, was considered to be sufficient to continue scanning at the practice. Patients preferred to be scanned at the practice, and were prepared to wait up to an extra 5 days, and accept a reduction in the accuracy of scanning of up to 3.5 per cent for their choice. Who carried out the scan was not important to patients.
CONCLUSION: Although the results of the study provide some evidence to support GP scanning in this setting, further research on diagnostic accuracy and alternative models of care need to be conducted."
12141625,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12141625/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether sterilising procedures - hysterectomies, endometrial ablations or tubal ligations - are being performed in minors for non-therapeutic reasons, without Family Law Court approval.
METHODS: Victorian Admitted Episode Dataset 1996-99 was used to identify all young women < 18 who had a sterilising procedure. Associated codes for indications and pathology were reviewed to exclude malignancies, congenital anomalies, potential miscoding and misleading codes associated with endometriosis.
RESULTS: Although 40 procedures were identified from the dataset, the majority of these can be excluded after review of the associated codes. In two cases sterilising procedures were performed without clear therapeutic indications and it is likely they were done in young women with disabilities. No Family Law Court applications were heard in this time period, thus it is likely they represent unlawful sterilisations.
CONCLUSIONS: It would appear that sterilisations without Family Law Court approval are probably occurring at very low rates in Victoria."
12141715,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12141715/,"BACKGROUND: There is no unanimous agreement on the use of a diluent step to preface methacholine challenge testing. The ""pros"" for this step are that it allows a better training of the patient; the ""cons"" are that it requires additional time and effort.
OBJECTIVE: We examined if there were any systematic effects when either the baseline or postdiluent (saline) forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) was used to define the reactivity status.
METHODS: All methacholine challenge tests performed during a 1-year period by a group of occupationally exposed workers (n = 183) were examined.
RESULTS: The mean percentage change in FEV1 from baseline to postsaline was -1.44 (+/- 3.47)% and the mean absolute change was -0.043 (+/- 0.11) L (P < 0.0001 for both comparisons). The maximum decrease and increase in FEV1 from baseline were -12.7% and +10.9%, respectively. Three subjects had a fall in FEV1 after saline of 10% or more and were not given methacholine. From the remaining 180 subjects, 172 were equally classified as reactors (n = 67) or nonreactors (n = 105), both by baseline FEV1 and postsaline FEV1. Eight subjects were classified as reactors by baseline FEV1 but as nonreactors by saline FEV1. In these subjects, the average FEV1 dropped 4.9% from baseline to saline and 17.3% from saline to end-test; thus, the total FEV1 drop (22.5%) exceeded the 20% required for the test to be positive. Among reactors, no relationship was found between the response to saline and the subsequent response to methacholine (r = 0.13).
CONCLUSIONS: Our data did not provide evidence to support the compulsory use of a diluent step when measuring bronchial responsiveness in populations. In general, the diluent step added time and expense to the test and, on occasion, forced a greater absolute drop in FEV1 than is needed to demonstrate bronchial hyperresponsiveness."
12142090,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12142090/,"PURPOSE: To examine the outcome of radiotherapy (RT) alone in patients with advanced nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) and to compare the results with those reported by the Intergroup study 0099 (IGS) comparing RT to combined modality therapy (CMT).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: During the period 1985-1992, 198 NPC patients presenting without distant metastatic disease were treated for cure. Of these, 172 had stage III/IV (UICC 1987, 1992). Planned RT was 2 Gy/day fraction to 60-66 Gy to the primary tumor, with 50 and 60 Gy to the node negative and to palpable nodes, respectively. Outcomes included overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS), defined from the time of registration at our institution.
RESULTS: The TNM categories and other prognostic factors were similar to the IGS, though 80% had stage IV compared to 91% in IGS. The 5 year OS and DFS for the 172 patients with stage III/IV disease were 62 and 48%, respectively, as compared to the IGS results of OS 37% and DFS 29% for RT alone, and OS 67% and DFS 58% for the CMT arm of IGS. When the distribution of adverse prognostic factors was balanced between both studies the comparative results were unchanged.
CONCLUSIONS: The early results for RT alone of this single institution experience are superior to those of the IGS control arm (RT), while somewhat inferior to those reported in the chemo-radiotherapy arm. The surprisingly poor outcome of the IGS/RT control arm may have resulted by chance, suggesting the need for a confirmatory randomized trial to fully establish the role of combined chemotherapy and radiation, as used in the IGS."
12142975,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12142975/,"PURPOSE: To compare the value of MRI sequences with dynamic MRI measurements (d-MRT) for the assessment of risk of lumbar vertebral fractures in patients with multiple myeloma.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In 10 patients with multiple myeloma a sagittal T 1 -, T 2 -weighted spin-echo and an inversion-recovery sequence were performed. For dynamic measurements a fast gradient-echo sequence (turbo fast low angle shot 2 D) with machine-controlled Gd-DTPA administration was used. The presence of bone marrow abnormalities was determined and additionally the value of the highest signal increase (amplitude Alpha) was calculated for each of the 50 vertebral bodies. The subsequent development of vertebral fractures was assessed by MRI at a mean time interval of 6.2 months after the initial d-MRI. The pattern of marrow involvement and the amplitudes of the vertebral bodies that collapsed in the observation period were statistically compared with those of the vertebral bodies that did not collapse.
RESULTS: During the follow-up period newly or progressive fractures occurred in 6 of 10 patients (7 of 50 vertebral bodies). The degree of pathological signal changes that preceded fractures was not significantly different (p > 0.05) from that of the other contemporary lesions identified in vertebral bodies that did not collapse in follow-up. In contrast, the amplitude of vertebrae that collapsed (A: 33.1 +/- 8.2) was significantly higher (p < 0.0001) than the amplitude of vertebrae that did not collapse (A: 16.7 +/- 4.2). The amplitude was a reliable predictor of vertebrae that collapsed in all cases.
CONCLUSION: In contrast to the analysis of marrow lesions detected with non-dynamic MRI, this study suggests that the perfusion-parameter amplitude in dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI is a potentially relevant value to predict the risk of vertebral fractures in patients with multiple myeloma."
12144983,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12144983/,"OBJECTIVES: In this study, we examined racial separation in long-term care.
METHODS: We used a survey of a stratified sample of 181 residential care/assisted living (RC/AL) facilities and 39 nursing homes in 4 states.
RESULTS: Most African Americans resided in nursing homes and smaller RC/AL facilities and tended to be concentrated in a few predominantly African American facilities, whereas the vast majority of Whites resided in predominantly White facilities. Facilities housing African Americans tended to be located in rural, nonpoor, African American communities, to admit individuals with mental retardation and difficulty in ambulating, and to have lower ratings of cleanliness/maintenance and lighting.
CONCLUSIONS: These racial disparities may result from economic factors, exclusionary practices, or resident choice. Whether separation relates to inequities in care is undetermined."
12145245,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12145245/,"OBJECTIVE: A J-shaped association has been demonstrated between alcohol consumption and atherosclerosis. Insulin resistance, also a risk factor for atherosclerosis, has been shown to have a similar J-shaped association with alcohol intake. This raises the question of whether insulin sensitivity (S(I)) is a causal intermediate in the alcohol-atherosclerosis relationship.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study was a multicenter cohort study designed to investigate relationships among S(I), risk factors for cardiovascular disease, and carotid artery atherosclerosis. Using regression analysis, we tested whether adjustment for S(I) attenuated the alcohol-atherosclerosis relationship observed at baseline.
RESULTS: A J-shaped association was observed between alcohol consumption and common carotid artery intimal medial thickness. The protective aspect of the alcohol-atherosclerosis relationship was attenuated by 25% after the adjustment for S(I). However, an interaction was observed between alcohol consumption and glucose tolerance (GT) status. In comparison with never drinkers, all levels of alcohol consumption were associated with less atherosclerosis in participants with normal GT status. Participants with impaired GT status (but not diabetes) demonstrated a J-shaped alcohol-atherosclerosis association. All levels of alcohol consumption were associated with more atherosclerosis in participants with diabetes.
CONCLUSIONS: S(I) may be a causal intermediate at protective levels of alcohol intake, but an alcohol-GT interaction precluded a definitive conclusion. Moderate alcohol consumption may increase the risk of atherosclerosis in people with diabetes. These findings contrast with previous reports and do not support current recommendations regarding moderate alcohol consumption in people with diabetes. More research is needed to clarify this issue."
12146580,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12146580/,"OBJECTIVE: To assess if the self-perceived risk of oral problems is related to reported dental service usage in university entrants.
DESIGN: Self-completed questionnaire.
SAMPLE: 1,180 university entrants with an average age of 19.1 years. Fifty-six per cent of the sample were female, 44% males; 16% were medical undergraduates, 27% arts students, and 52% science undergraduates.
RESULTS: Females rated their own dental health more positively than males. Overall, the perceived risk of future problems was low. Seventy-five per cent of graduates reported attending dentists on a regular basis. Females were more likely to attend dentists regularly. Those who reported attending on a regular basis rated their dental health higher than those reporting other dental attendance patterns. There was no significant difference between those who reported a regular attendance service pattern and their perceived likelihood of requiring a filling or getting gum disease within the next five years.
CONCLUSION: Differences in reported dental services usage were related to the perceived benefits of dental check-ups but not to the risk of future problems."
12146850,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12146850/,"OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the association between anthropometric measures and ovarian cancer risk.
METHODS: From a population-based study of 563 cases of ovarian cancer and 523 controls we recorded weight, both at index age and age 18, and height using an in-person questionnaire, and used these to calculate body mass index (BMI). Multivariate logistic regression was used to calculate the exposure odds ratios, adjusted for established risk factors, stratified, in turn, by menopausal status and histologic type of ovarian cancer.
RESULTS: Height, weight, and BMI were unrelated to risk for ovarian cancer in the total group of cases and controls. After stratification by menopausal status, weight and BMI were associated positively with risk among premenopausal women, but did not affect risk postmenopausally. High BMI, weight, and height were most strongly related to risk of serous borderline cancer, particularly among premenopausal women. The association did not appear to be confined only to those overweight women with gynecologic problems such as irregular periods or ovarian cysts.
CONCLUSIONS: Weight and BMI are positively related to premenopausal ovarian cancer risk in this population-based case-control study. This association is particularly noted for serous borderline tumors. This may suggest the importance of endocrine factors, which are altered in overweight women, such as insulin or androgens."
12146987,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12146987/,"HYPOTHESIS: The approach to surgery for primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is controversial. To determine whether routine bilateral neck exploration increases the detection of multiple-gland disease compared with a focused unilateral approach, we compared the incidence of single vs multiple-gland disease in patients undergoing surgical treatment for PHPT as a function of unilateral or bilateral exploration.
DATA SOURCES: From 1993 through 1997, 214 consecutive patients underwent initial bilateral neck exploration for PHPT by a single surgeon. Each patient underwent the surgical procedure without prior localizing studies. Four parathyroid glands were identified, and abnormal glands were excised. The results were compared with published studies of patients who underwent either bilateral neck exploration or focused unilateral neck exploration for PHPT.
STUDY SELECTION: All reported studies from 1995 through 2001 in a MEDLINE search using the terms ""parathyroidectomy"" or ""primary hyperparathyroidism and surgery"" and either ""bilateral"" or ""conventional"" or ""minimally invasive,"" ""selective,"" or ""unilateral.""
DATA EXTRACTION: The studies were analyzed for numbers of patients and a final diagnosis of either a single adenoma or multiple-gland disease (double adenoma or hyperplasia). Proportions were compared statistically with a chi(2) test.
DATA SYNTHESIS: In our series of 214 patients who underwent bilateral neck exploration, 79.4% had a single adenoma, and 20.6% had multiple-gland disease. Of 2166 patients in 14 studies who underwent bilateral neck exploration, 79.7% had a single adenoma, and 19.3% had multiple-gland disease. Of 2095 patients in 31 studies with a focused unilateral approach, 92.5% had a single adenoma, whereas only 5.3% had multiple-gland disease. The incidence of multiple-gland disease was significantly lower among patients treated with a focused unilateral approach compared with a bilateral approach as used in our series and the literature (P<.001).
CONCLUSION: The data suggest that a focused unilateral surgical approach for PHPT may underestimate the incidence of multiple-gland disease."
12146991,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12146991/,"HYPOTHESIS: Although elevations in white blood cell count (WBC) and platelet count (PC) after splenectomy for trauma constitute a physiologic event, certain WBC and PC patterns help differentiate patients with from those without sepsis.
DESIGN: Medical record and trauma registry record retrospective review.
SETTING: Academic level I trauma center.
PATIENTS: From February 1997 through May 2001, 118 trauma patients underwent splenectomy. Sixty patients developed postoperative sepsis (pneumonia, abdominal infection, septicemia, or severe urinary tract infection) (septic group) and 58 did not (nonseptic group).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: White blood cell count, PC, and PC/WBC.
RESULTS: After the fifth postoperative day, the WBC of patients with sepsis remained consistently greater than 15 x 10(3)/microL and the PC/WBC remained consistently less than 20. In patients without sepsis, these values remained less than 15 x 10(3)/microL and greater than 20, respectively. Stepwise regression analysis identified 3 independent predictors of sepsis: (1) day 5 PC/WBC less than 20, (2) Injury Severity Score greater than 16, and (3) day 5 WBC greater than 15 x 10(3)/microL. According to a statistical prediction model, the probability of sepsis when all 3 predictors were present was 97.4%; when all 3 were absent, it was 2.5%.
CONCLUSIONS: At and after the fifth postoperative day, a WBC greater than 15 x 10(3)/microL and a PC/WBC less than 20 are highly associated with sepsis and should not be considered as part of the physiologic response to splenectomy. In view of the seriousness of postsplenectomy sepsis, these values may be used to increase vigilance and prompt early aggressive treatment."
12147113,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12147113/,"OBJECTIVE: The exact weight of a child undergoing resuscitation is usually not known. Several methods to estimate a child's weight have been proposed. We evaluated six of these methods to determine their accuracy and clinical usefulness across a range of weights and ages.
METHOD: Children attending a tertiary paediatric emergency department on 30 non-consecutive days were weighed, a length or height was obtained and an estimation of body habitus (slim, average or heavy) made by a single investigator, Karen Black (KB). All children less than 145 cm were also measured using the Broselow tape. Six methods of weight estimation were employed and the calculated weight compared to the true weight. The weight estimation methods evaluated were the advanced paediatric life support (APLS) method, Broselow tape, devised weight estimation method (DWEM), Oakley table, Traub-Johnson and the Traub-Kichen methods.
RESULTS: Four hundred and ninety-five children were included in the study. Children were evenly distributed among the weight groups of less than 10 kg, 10-25 kg, 25-40 kg and over 40 kg. The methods with the best overall performance were the devised weight estimation method and Broselow tape although the latter has a length limitation of 145 cm. The other methods performed well in the middle two weight groups but poorly outside these groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The most accurate methods of weight estimation in children are the Broselow tape and the devised weight estimation method. We recommend the use of either of these methods in emergency situations where direct weighing is not possible."
12147662,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12147662/,"AIMS: To establish the validity of assuming that by examining midline blocks from the anterior and posterior lips of the cervix, a previously unsuspected cervical intraepithelial glandular neoplasia (CIGN) lesion would be identified.
METHODS: The distribution of CIGN in 30 cone biopsy specimens of cervix was examined.
RESULTS: Nine low grade and 21 high grade cases were identified involving one or other lip in 29 patients and one or both lateral edges in 20. The distribution of CIGN was unifocal in 20 patients, involved two distinct foci in nine, and three distinct foci in one. Only three patients had a circumferential distribution. Midline disease, either CIGN or squamous cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), or both, was present in 27 patients.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that examining the midline blocks from hysterectomy specimens will result in the identification of CIGN lesions in over 90% of patients, either because the CIGN lesion is present in the midline or because an associated squamous CIN lesion will be identified, which will result in the examination of the entire cervix, with the consequent identification of the CIGN lesion."
12147824,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12147824/,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the normal maximal mural thickness (MMT) of the appendix in asymptomatic subjects and determine whether any significant difference in MMT exists between pediatric and adult populations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MMT of 187 appendices in asymptomatic subjects was measured at sustained-compression ultrasonography (US). The measured MMTs were categorized into three groups according to patient age (39 young children [including infants] aged 1-6 years, 79 older children and adolescents aged 7-15 years, 69 adolescents and adults aged 16-82 years), and the relationships between categoric variables were analyzed by using analysis of variance and the parametric Scheffé test.
RESULTS: The mean MMTs in the young children, older children and adolescent, and adolescent and adult groups were 1.9 mm +/- 0.4 (SD), 2.0 mm +/- 0.5, and 2.1 mm +/- 0.5, respectively. The corresponding ranges of normal MMT were 1.1-2.8, 1.0-2.8, and 1.2-3.0 mm, respectively. No significant difference in normal appendix MMT was observed between the young children group and the older children and adolescent group (P =.2) or between the older children and adolescent group and the adolescent and adult group (P =.639). The difference in MMT between the young children group and the adolescent and adult group was marginally significant (P =.042).
CONCLUSION: Although adoption of age-related MMT criteria does not seem warranted because it would necessitate measurement precision below 0.5 mm, which is not possible to achieve consistently in daily practice, data indicate that in children aged 6 years or younger, an appendiceal mural thickness of less than 3 mm should be regarded as normal."
12147826,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12147826/,"PURPOSE: To determine whether there is an association between the spatial distributions of lesions detected at magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the brain in children, adolescents, and young adults after closed-head injury (CHI) and development of the reexperiencing symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data obtained in 94 subjects without a history of PTSD as determined by parental interview were analyzed. MR images were obtained 3 months after CHI. Lesions were manually delineated and registered to the Talairach coordinate system. Mann-Whitney analysis of lesion distribution and PTSD status at 1 year (again, as determined by parental interview) was performed, consisting of an analysis of lesion distribution versus the major symptoms of PTSD: reexperiencing, hyperarousal, and avoidance.
RESULTS: Of the 94 subjects, 41 met the PTSD reexperiencing criterion and nine met all three PTSD criteria. Subjects who met the reexperiencing criterion had fewer lesions in limbic system structures (eg, the cingulum) on the right than did subjects who did not meet this criterion (Mann-Whitney, P =.003).
CONCLUSION: Lesions induced by CHI in the limbic system on the right may inhibit subsequent manifestation of PTSD reexperiencing symptoms in children, adolescents, and young adults."
12147839,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12147839/,"PURPOSE: To determine and report the spectrum of ultrasonographic appearances of echogenic ovarian foci (EOF) without shadowing in otherwise normal ovaries and the histopathologic and physical characteristics of these foci.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The appearances of foci on transvaginal pelvic sonograms obtained in 189 patients with EOF were prospectively analyzed. The foci were classified according to bilaterality, size, number (<5, 5-10, or >10), and location (peripheral, central, or diffuse). At histopathologic analysis, resected normal ovaries, seven with and 10 without echogenic foci, in a water bath were scanned. The foci were then localized for histopathologic correlation. To assess the physical properties of the foci, tissue-mimicking water- and glycerol-based phantoms, with voids of different diameters, in a water bath were scanned with 8- and 70-MHz transducers.
RESULTS: At appearance analysis, EOF (mean diameter, 1.8 mm +/- 0.6 [SD]) were detected unilaterally in 103 (54.5%) of 189 patients. EOF were distributed peripherally in 183 (66.5%), centrally in 15 (5.5%), and diffusely in 77 (28.0%) of 275 ovaries. There were fewer than five foci in 123 (44.7%), five to 10 foci in 91 (33.1%), and more than 10 foci in 61 (22.2%) of 275 ovaries. At histopathologic analysis of the seven ovaries with EOF, the foci had tiny cysts with no evidence of calcifications. A single cyst cluster was identified in two of 10 ovaries that did not have echogenic foci. At physical property analysis, single echogenic foci were associated with specular reflection from the walls of unresolved cysts that were comparable in size to the ultrasound wavelength (about 0.50 mm).
CONCLUSION: EOF without shadowing are caused by a specular reflection from the walls of tiny unresolved benign cysts rather than by psammomatous calcifications."

RESULTS: Surgical excision revealed carcinoma in 22 (21%) of 104 ADH lesions. The lowest incidences of carcinoma (each P <.02) were 16% (15 of 92) in patients with no personal history of breast carcinoma, 13% (nine of 67) when maximum lesion diameter was less than 10 mm, and 8% (three of 36) when 100% of the mammographic lesion was removed at stereotactic biopsy.
CONCLUSION: No clinical, mammographic, or biopsy features alone or in combination could be used to define a substantial subset of probably benign lesions with a less than 2% chance of carcinoma at lumpectomy."
12147966,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12147966/,"BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of renal artery stenosis using echo color-Doppler is subjected to several limitations. The aim of this study was to examine if the routine use of a contrast agent could be helpful in identifying renal artery stenosis (RAS).
METHODS: We analysed 35 patients affected by RAS using an echo color-Doppler coupled with a contrast agent. All patients presented arterial hypertension, with a good drugs control, and mean serum creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL. All patients previously underwent angiography. RAS was at the origin of the artery in 27 patients, at the intermediate tract in 8. All patients had already been submitted to a basal echo color-Doppler.
RESULTS: The contrast agent determined a significant increase in the average colour signal in all the subjects, and a better evaluation of the spectral waveforms, if compared to the basal examination.
CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained showed that the contrast agent doesn't improve the diagnosis of RAS, especially in vascular origin stenosis, while it shows a real advantage in the intermediate or distal stenosis which are better visualized."

RESULTS: Case 1 showed a hyperechogenic cyst that underwent enlargement during fetal life; the diagnosis at birth was an obstructed choledochal cyst (CC). In cases 2 and 3, an anechoic cyst with small, stable dimensions during pregnancy was identified; a biliary atresia (BA) type III-C was confirmed at birth. A slightly hyperechogenic cyst with no increase in size at repeated prenatal scans, was observed in cases 4 and 5; a CC and a cystic lesion at the confluence of the hepatic ducts (without obstruction) were diagnosed postnatally, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The ultrasound scan pattern and size allow to make a prenatal differential diagnosis of BCM. Anechoic, small cyst in the hepatic hilum is highly suspicious for BA. Large, echoic or enlarging cyst is strongly suggestive of ""obstructed"" CC. Echoic, small and stable cyst is more suggestive of ""unobstructed"" CC."
12149909,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12149909/,"PURPOSE: Recently bolus tracking systems were developed to improve the timing of intravenous contrast media application in helical computed tomography. We investigated the benefit of this new method as a parameter of the cardiac function.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 64 patients which incidentally underwent bolus triggered contrast enhanced helical CT and invasive investigation of the heart within one week. All examinations were performed on the CT scanner Somatom Plus 4 Volume Zoom (Siemens Corp., Forchheim, Germany) using the C.A.R.E. Bolus software. This performs repetitive low-dose test scans (e.g. for the abdomen: 140 kV, 20 mA, Tl 0.5 s) and measures the Hounsfield attenuation (increase over the baseline) in a preselected region of interest. The displayed increase of vascular density over the time after peripheral contrast media injection (75 ml lopromid (300 mg/ml), 2 ml/s) was categorised to three types: (a) rapid increase, (b) deceleration before a 100 HE threshold was reached and (c) one or more peaks. The findings of the invasive investigation of the heart were correlated to the findings of the bolus-tracking measurements.
RESULTS: The examinations were categorized as follows: 19 type A, 34 type B, 11 type C. We found a high significant correlation between the type of the Hounsfield attenuation and systolic pressure in the left ventricle. There was no correlation between the type of the Hounsfield attenuation and the diastolic pressure in the left ventricle, the pressures related to the right ventricle or the ejection fraction. The bolus-tacking system showed a sensitivity of 53, a specificity of 82, an accuracy of 70%, a positive predictive value of 70% and a negative predictive value of 70% in detection of left heart failure.
CONCLUSION: The bolus tracking system C.A.R.E.-bolus often shows atypical Hounsfield attenuation in cases of cardiac failure but is not suitable as a screening method of the cardiopulmonary function."
12150148,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12150148/,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of a palliative care clinic (PCC), which provided some of the interdisciplinary services and expertise of an inpatient consult service to outpatients, in traditional clinic sessions.
DESIGN: Chart review.
SETTING: A large urban Veterans Administration Medical Center.
PATIENTS: One hundred patients referred to clinic.
INTERVENTIONS: Palliative care clinic.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients' reported needs, Global Distress Index (GDI) subscale, hospice eligibility, and time to death.
RESULTS: The most common diagnosis was cancer (n = 85). Most patients (n = 89) had at least one need for services that the team provided (median, 2; range, 0-4), the most common of which was a desire for information about prognosis (n = 84). In a Cox proportional hazards model, predictors of enrollment in hospice included white ethnicity (hazard ratio, 3.42; p < 0.001), a need for help around the home (hazard ratio, 3.26; p = 0.002), and insufficient money left at the end of the month (hazard ratio, 2.39; p = 0.014).
CONCLUSIONS: The experience of the PCC described here offers a unique approach to improving end-of-life care for those outpatients who may not be well served by existing structures of care such as palliative care consult services and who have not yet enrolled in hospice."
12150295,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12150295/,"BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: Acute infective endocarditis is a surgical challenge, particularly when paravalvular abscesses and annular destruction are present. The choice of a homograft or mechanical valve prosthesis is an important issue in these patients. The study aim was to compare the outcome with homografts and mechanical valves in patients with acute infective endocarditis.
METHODS: A total of 77 patients (mean age 49+/-9 years) operated on for acute endocarditis of the aortic valve was included in the study and analyzed retrospectively. The causative bacterium was isolated from blood cultures in 71 cases. Preoperatively, 21 patients required artificial ventilation and 24 had inotropic support due to hemodynamic instability. Aortic homografts were implanted in 43 patients, and mechanical valve prostheses in 34. The two patient groups were similar in terms of gender, age and preoperative inotropic support. In total, 31 patients (44%) had paravalvular abscesses, and a homograft was used significantly more often (77%, p <0.05) in these cases. Follow up examinations (clinical examination, ECG and transthoracic echocardiography) were performed six months postoperatively and continued on an annual basis. Endocarditis relapse was defined as persisting infection, whereas re-endocarditis indicated a new infection after an interval of at least six months.
RESULTS: Perioperative mortality was 11.5% (5/43) in homograft patients. In the 38 survivors, follow up was complete and averaged 5.0+/-1.2 years. One patient had an endocarditis relapse three months after surgery. Re-endocarditis occurred in three patients after two or three years. One other patient had pseudoaneurysm formation without a need for intervention, and one had repeat aortic valve replacement due to dysfunction of the graft after four years. The other 33 patients had an uneventful follow up. Echocardiography revealed aortic insufficiency grade 1 in 12 cases (36%), with no progression during follow up. Perioperative mortality in mechanicat valve patients was 20.5% (n = 7) (p <0.05 versus homograft), and in those with paravalvular abscess, perioperative mortality was even higher than in homograft patients (4/7, 57.1% versus 3/24, 12.5%; p <0.05). When considering only patients without paravalvular abscess, there was no significant difference between groups (10.5% versus 12.5%). Three relapses occurred in mechanical valve patients (10.3%), but no endocarditis recurred during follow up. One late death (3.7%) occurred due to bleeding complicating long-term anticoagulation.
CONCLUSION: The study results do not permit a general recommendation to be made for homograft use in patients with acute endocarditis. In cases with paravalvular abscesses, however, there was a trend towards improved outcome in the homograft group."
12150317,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12150317/,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: To investigate the frequency of microarousals (MA) associated with pressure changes during auto-CPAP therapy (APAP) for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).
DESIGN: Patients with OSA were studied by polysomnography during APAP therapy (Somnosmart). The MA were classified on the basis of concomitant changes in APAP pressure.
SETTING: Sleep laboratory of a university hospital
PARTICIPANTS: 30 patients with moderate to severe OSA.
MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The mean AHI during APAP was 4.7+/-4.7, the mean arousal index was 14.5+/-6.6 per hour. During epochs with a pressure variation greater than 0.5 mbar, significantly more MA occurred (0.30+/-0.17 MA per epoch) than in epochs with constant treatment pressure (0.10+/-0.054 MA per epoch; p<0.001). There were more MA during pressure-increase epochs than during pressure-decrease epochs (0.42+/-0.24 vs. 0.16+/-0.12 MA per epoch; p<0.001). 82.5 percent of the MA were not preceded by a significant change in pressure (at least 0.5 mbar within 30 sec.), 10.6% were associated with a significant prior increase and 6.9% with a significant prior decrease in pressure. The percentage of MA preceded by a significant pressure variation varied between 2.3% and 61%, with a mean of 18.9%.
CONCLUSIONS: The overall frequency of MA was low, and in most individuals the relative amount of ""pressure-associated MA"" was not significant. However in some individuals it cannot be excluded that some additional MA may have been induced by pressure variations. Should it prove possible to prevent such ""pressure-associated MA"" by optimizing the regulation of APAP pressure, the overall clinical effect of APAP treatment may be improved."
12150528,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12150528/,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: The differentiated character of changes in the mucous relief of the trachea as induced by air containing pollutants from the wastes of nickel-, mercury-, and cement-producing plants and by Candida albicans occurring in the waste disposal site of a large town are identified. The trachea was chosen because it is the entrance gate for the penetration of polluted air into the lungs. Changes on the trachea influence the character and extent of changes in lungs.
STUDY DESIGN: Histological study with Viennese grey strain laboratory rabbits and rats caught directly on an investigated site.
METHODS: We present new results of the functional morphology of the respiratory system as the results of scanning and transmission electron microscopy studies that can reveal character and range of damage of mucosal relief of trachea relevant to the functional dynamics of mucociliary clearance. Under physiological conditions this mechanism allows that only respirable dust particles enter the deep respiratory tract.
RESULTS: In case of a damaged tracheal relief because of exposure to various aerosols, the functional morphology is changed, which aids in understanding the mechanisms damaging to mucociliary clearance induced by living in heavily polluted areas.
CONCLUSION: Understanding of these morphological changes on base of detailed electron microscopic findings sheds new light on elaborating novel diagnostic methods for clinical practice."
12150607,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12150607/,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate alternative management strategies for anterior table frontal sinus fractures involving the frontal sinus outflow tract.
STUDY DESIGN: A prospective cohort of patients with anterior table frontal sinus fracture with frontal outflow tract involvement documented by computed tomography (CT) scan was examined between 1999 and 2001.
METHODS: A select group of patients with anterior table frontal sinus fracture involving the frontal outflow tract was treated with open reduction of bony fracture without osteoplastic obliteration of the frontal sinus. Serial CT scans were obtained starting at 8 weeks after injury. Patients with persistent frontal sinus obstruction after medical treatment underwent an extended endoscopic frontal sinusotomy or a modified endoscopic Lothrop procedure.
RESULTS: Fourteen patients sustained frontal sinus fractures and were treated during the study period. Seven patients were included in the modified treatment algorithm, with a mean follow-up of 18 months. All patients had concurrent facial fractures: superior orbital rim (n = 5), naso-orbital-ethmoid complex (n = 2), mandible (n = 2), and midface (n = 2). All 7 patients underwent open repair of the facial fractures. Postoperatively, 5 patients had spontaneous frontal sinus ventilation. Two patients, both of whom had naso-orbito-ethmoid fractures, had persistent frontal sinus obstruction clinically and radiographically. These patients were successfully managed with an endoscopic frontal sinus procedure.
CONCLUSIONS: A select group of patients with frontal sinus and outflow tract fracture may be managed with open repair of the anterior table fracture without obliteration. In these cases, suspected frontal outflow tract obstruction can be managed expectantly. Failed frontal sinus ventilation may require endoscopic frontal sinus surgery to reestablish mucociliary clearance."
12151431,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12151431/,"BACKGROUND: With the recently introduced GnRH antagonists, soft stimulation protocols on the basis of clomiphene pretreatment should be possible as the pituitary remains fully sensitive at the beginning of the cycle.
METHODS: A prospective trial was carried out on 107 patients undergoing IVF treatment using the multiple dose GnRH antagonist protocol (cetrorelix), clomiphene citrate, and either HMG (n = 54) or recombinant FSH (rFSH) (n = 53). Different stimulation protocols were used to find the most appropriate one for clinical application.
RESULTS: Both treatment groups, HMG and rFSH, yielded comparable results concerning gonadotrophin dose, stimulation days and pregnancy rate. A mean number of 6.34 +/- 4.4 metaphase II oocytes was retrieved and a mean number of 2.45 +/- 0.65 embryos was transferred. However, the overall rate of premature LH surges was 21.5% (defined as measurement of LH >10 IU/l and progesterone >1 ng/ml) which is unacceptable for clinical practice.
CONCLUSIONS: Increasing the daily cetrorelix dose from 0.25 to 0.5 mg might decrease the number of premature LH surges. Soft stimulation protocols with clomiphene should be used cautiously."
12151609,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12151609/,"AIMS: To investigate the extent that common psychological conditions contribute to lost work among individuals with musculoskeletal and ill defined conditions.
METHODS: Cross sectional health and work related survey evaluating Gulf War veterans seeking Department of Defense health care for Gulf War related health concerns. Ordered probit models were used to study whether a provider diagnosed musculoskeletal condition (ICD-9 codes 710-739) or ""signs, symptoms, and ill defined conditions"" (ICD-9 codes 780-799) have an effect on recent lost work over the previous 90 days in the presence of one or more psychological conditions (ICD-9 codes 290-320) after controlling for sociodemographic variables.
RESULTS: Bivariate analyses revealed that musculoskeletal conditions, ill defined conditions, and psychological conditions were positively associated with lost work. Multivariate analyses showed an independent effect of both psychological conditions and musculoskeletal conditions. A significant interaction existed between psychological conditions and musculoskeletal conditions: the presence of a coexisting psychological condition considerably increased the likelihood that a musculoskeletal disorder resulted in lost work, or vice versa.
CONCLUSIONS: Psychological conditions appear to be an important contributor to absenteeism among individuals with musculoskeletal and ill defined conditions. A limitation of the cross sectional design was the inability to sequence the onset of conditions."
12153381,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12153381/,"BACKGROUND: Population-based hemochromatosis screening has been suggested with the rationale that identification and treatment of subclinical disease would decrease morbidity and mortality due to hemochromatosis.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the prevalence of elevated serum transferrin saturation levels and the burden of illness of hemochromatosis in terms of ambulatory visits, hospitalizations, and death in the United States.
PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Four nationally representative data sets were used for the analysis of the prevalence of hemochromatosis as well as ambulatory care, hospitalizations, and deaths related to hemochromatosis. Participants included men and nonpregnant women aged 18 years and older in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988-1994) and the 1996, 1997, and 1998 National Ambulatory Care Survey, National Hospital Discharge Survey, and Underlying Cause-of-Death Mortality Files. The data sets were based on single measurements of serum transferrin saturation levels, serum ferritin levels, and healthcare provider-recorded diagnoses according to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, code for hemochromatosis.
RESULTS: The prevalence of elevated serum transferrin saturation levels ranged from 1% to 6%. When an elevated serum transferrin saturation level of 55% is combined with an elevated serum ferritin level, the prevalence decreases from 1.9% to 0.65%. The proportion of diagnosed hemochromatosis utilization out of total ambulatory visits, hospitalizations, and deaths is stable across the measures and the 3 years of data ranging from 0.01% to 0.03%. When white men were examined separately, the relationships remained the same as those among the general population of adults.
CONCLUSIONS: Although a substantial proportion of adults whose condition is not currently diagnosed would be identified in a population-based screening program for subclinical hemochromatosis, diagnosed morbidity or mortality owing to hemochromatosis is considerably lower than would be expected. Recommendations for screening programs may need to be revisited."
12153500,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12153500/,"BACKGROUND: Recent reports have highlighted certain aspects of the diets of children and adults in Scotland today that are a cause for concern. If there are significant associations between family members in food choice and thus in nutrient intakes, this may be important in the aetiology and prevention of diseases relating to dietary risk factors.
AIM: To compare the food intake of Scottish children aged 5(1/2)-8(1/2) years with that of their mothers.
METHODS: As part of a larger study, data on food intakes were obtained from 4-day weighed food records for 36 Scottish children (12 boys and 24 girls), aged 5(1/2)-8(1/2) years, who had participated in the 1992/1993 National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS), and their mothers.
RESULTS: Compared with their mothers, children had higher median densities [weight (g) of foods per 4.2 MJ (1000 kcal)] of snack foods including fruit, bread and confectionery and lower median densities of meat and meat products, fish, potatoes and vegetables. Positive, significant correlations between children and mothers were found for median densities of bread (r = 0.360, P < 0.05), fruit (r = 0.735, P < 0.001) and potatoes (r = 0.572, P < 0.001) and also for chips (r = 0.651, P < 0.001) and chocolate confectionery (r = 0.368, P < 0.05), the latter two being foods that should be reduced in the average Scottish diet.
CONCLUSIONS: Children's intakes of snack foods were correlated with that of their mothers emphasizing the need for change at a family level if current guidelines on diet are to be implemented."
12153594,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12153594/,"OBJECTIVE: The diagnosis of GH insufficiency (GHI) in childhood is not straightforward. Our aim was to test the sensitivity and specificity of height velocity (HV), IGF-I, IGFBP-3 and GH stimulation tests alone or in combination in the diagnosis of GHI.
DESIGN: A retrospective review of patients with GHI and idiopathic short stature (ISS) diagnosed in our centre and followed up to the completion of linear growth.
PATIENTS: Thirty-three GHI children and 56 children with ISS were evaluated. GHI diagnosis was based on fulfilment of anthropometric, endocrine and neuroradiological criteria: stature < or = -2 z-score, delayed bone age (at least 1 year), GH peak response to at least two different provocative tests < 10 micro g/l (20 mU/l), brain MRI positive for hypothalamus-pituitary abnormalities, catch-up growth during the first year of GH replacement therapy > or = 75th centile, peak GH response to a third provocative test after growth completion < 10 micro g/l (20 mU/l). Children with anthropometry resembling that of GHI but with peak GH responses > 10 micro g/l (20 mU/l) were diagnosed as ISS.
MEASUREMENTS: All subjects underwent standard anthropometry. GH secretory status was assessed by clonidine, arginine and GHRH plus arginine stimulation tests. IGF-I and IGFBP-3 circulating levels were measured by immunoradiometric assay (IRMA). The following cut-off values were chosen to discriminate between GHI and nonGHI short children: HV < 25th centile over the 6-12 months prior to the initiation of GH therapy, peak GH responses < 10 or < 7 micro g/l (< 20 or < 14 mU/l) and IGF-I and IGFBP-3-values < -1.9 z-score. Sensitivity (true positive ratio) and specificity (true negative ratio) were evaluated.
RESULTS: Taking 10 micro g/l (20 mU/l) as the cut-off value, sensitivity was 100% and specificity 57% for GH provocative tests, whereas taking 7 as the cut-off value, sensitivity was 66% and specificity rose to 78%. Sensitivity was 73% for IGF-I and 30% for IGFBP-3 measurement, whilst specificity was 95% for IGF-I and 98% for IGFBP-3 evaluation. HV assessment revealed a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 43%. When HV and IGF-I evaluations were used in combination, sensitivity reached 95% and specificity 96%. When both HV and IGF-I are normal (26% of our subjects) GHI may be ruled out, whereas when both the indices are subnormal (23%) GHI is so highly likely that the child may undergo only one GH provocative test and brain MRI and, thereafter, may begin GH therapy without any further test. In case of discrepancy, when IGF-I is normal and HV < 25th centile (44% of children), due to the relatively low sensitivity of IGF-I assessment and low specificity of HV, the patient should undergo GH tests and brain MRI. Finally, in the rare case of HV > 25th centile and subnormal IGF-I-values (7%), due to the high specificity of IGF-I measurement, the child should undergo one provocative test and brain MRI for the high suspicion of GHI.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that a simple assessment of HV and basal IGF-I may exclude or, in association with only one stimulation test, confirm the diagnosis of GH insufficiency in more than half of patients with short stature."
12153886,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12153886/,"UNLABELLED: The Brain Trauma Foundation published ""Guidelines for the Management of Severe Head Injury"" in 1995. These evidence-based clinical guidelines (CGs) recommended against prophylactic hyperventilation and glucocorticoid use and advocated for aggressive blood pressure (BP) resuscitation, and the careful use of mannitol.
OBJECTIVE: To survey Michigan emergency physicians (MEPs) to test their adherence to these guidelines.
METHODS: An anonymous mail survey was sent to all 566 MEPs who are members of the American College of Emergency Physicians. Three clinical scenarios involving severe head injury were presented, all with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores of 8 or less. The physicians were asked to choose from 15 diagnostic and treatment options, which included: intubation and hyperventilation, BP resuscitation, intravenous (IV) mannitol administration, and IV glucocorticoid administration.
RESULTS: Three hundred nineteen (56%) surveys were returned. Forty-six percent [95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 40% to 51%] of the MEPs elected to use prophylactic hyperventilation; very few administered IV glucocorticoids. Seventy-eight percent (95% CI = 75% to 81%) corrected hypotension with systolic BP < 90 mm Hg; 83% (95% CI = 80% to 86%) also administered mannitol appropriately.
CONCLUSIONS: A majority of MEPs are managing severe head injury patients in accordance with the ""Guidelines for the Management of Severe Head Injury,"" with the exception of avoiding prophylactic hyperventilation. More education and/or exposure to the evidence regarding prophylactic hyperventilation of severely head injured patients may improve adherence to the guidelines."
12153887,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12153887/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the intubation conditions created by rocuronium are equivalent to those of succinylcholine during rapid-sequence induction (RSI).
METHODS: Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register were searched for randomized clinical trials (RCTs). The search strategy included all generic and trade names for succinylcholine and rocuronium, anesthesia, neuromuscular blockade, and a validated RCT filter. Intubation conditions were a required outcome. Two reviewers assessed studies for eligibility, data extraction, and quality. Intubation conditions were scored with Goldberg's scale (excellent conditions defined as clear vocal cords, easy tube insertion, and no cough). A-priori subgroup analysis was conducted for the sedative, use of opioids, true versus modified RSI, age group, and the dose of rocuronium. Data were analyzed with Metaview 4.1 for relative risk (RR) of achieving excellent intubation conditions. A sample size calculation determined that n = 468 is required for equivalence.
RESULTS: Forty articles were identified; ten articles were excluded by the inclusion criteria, two were duplicate publications, and two had insufficient data. Therefore, 26 studies were analyzed. Overall, rocuronium was inferior to succinylcholine, with a RR = 0.87 (95% CI = 0.81 to 0.94) (N = 1,606). However, intubation conditions were similar in the propofol subgroup, with a RR = 0.96 (95% CI = 0.87 to 1.06) (N = 640). Failed intubations (N = 28) were equivalent in the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, succinylcholine creates excellent intubation conditions more reliably than rocuronium. If a second-line agent is required, rocuronium used with propofol creates intubation conditions equivalent to those with succinylcholine."
12154249,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12154249/,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are at increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and probably other forms of dementia. Some subtypes of vascular dementia (VaD) may possess minor neuropathological changes of AD that may contribute to cognitive impairments. It was posited that MCI, identified by criteria described here, might present as a prodrome for VaD and AD.
METHODS: Serial Mini-Mental State Examination was administered at 3- to 6-month intervals, and neuroimaging was performed annually. Subtle cognitive dysfunctions were weighted and measured according to MCI criteria defined here. Subjects identified with MCI were then followed up for an additional 3.88+/-3.01 years. Diagnoses of VaD and AD were made according to established criteria.
RESULTS: During 3.72+/-2.94 years of follow-up of the original normative subjects, 73 of 291 (25.1%) developed MCI. Of the 27 subjects who developed VaD, 15 (55.6%) had prodromal MCI. Of these, two thirds were subclassified as having small-vessel dementia. The remaining 12 patients with VaD (44.4%) were diagnosed directly from a cognitively normal status without preceding MCI. These were predominantly multi-infarct or strategic-infarct dementia (66.7%). An additional 35 MCI subjects (47.9%) developed AD. Both VaD and AD diagnosed after MCI prodromes manifested similar spectral domains of cognitive impairments, which included memory, during their MCI stages.
CONCLUSIONS: In some VaD subtypes, particularly those caused by subcortical microvascular disease, dementia may be preceded by MCI, which has similar domains of cognitive impairment and a similar progressive course that may mimic AD."

BACKGROUND: RF catheter-mediated ablation lines mimicking the Maze operation have been proposed as a novel curative approach for AF. The relationship between this type of ablation and right atrial mapping has not been extensively studied.
METHODS: Twenty-four patients with recurrent, drug-refractory, paroxysmal AF underwent an extensive mapping of the RA before attempting linear lesion RF ablation. Patients were divided into two groups: 15 patients received two linear lesions (Group 1), 9 patients three linear lesions (Group 2).
RESULTS: One-month success rate AF did not recur in 40% of Group 1 patients (6/15) and in 66% (6/9) of Group 2 patients. 27% of patients in Group 1 and 11% of patients in Group 2 had recurrences controlled by drugs. No benefit in 33% of Group 1 patients and 22% of Group 2. Long-term follow-up In the absence of any drug treatment, no AF recurrences were observed in 26% of Group 1 patients (FU: 23 to 47 months) and 55% of Group 2 (FU: 14 to 23 months).

DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled.
SETTING: Single institution, cardiothoracic specialty hospital.
PARTICIPANTS: Forty-four patients scheduled for elective multivessel coronary artery surgery using either conventional CPB (n = 22) or OP-CAB techniques (n = 22).
INTERVENTIONS: Preischemic, ischemic, and postischemic administration of GIK solution was carried out, optimally dosed to ensure nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) suppression, and supplemented with magnesium, a glycolytic enzymatic cofactor.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: GIK solution therapy reduced plasma NEFA levels (p < 0.001) in OP-CAB surgery and CPB groups but failed to affect the incidence of non-Q wave perioperative myocardial infarction, incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation, incidence of postoperative infection, reduction in creatinine clearance, or duration of postoperative intensive care unit or hospital length of stay. After adjusting for GIK solution therapy, OP-CAB surgery resulted in significantly less ischemic injury (troponin I >15 microg/L, 19.0% v 91.3%; p = 0.0001) and reduced postoperative infections (14.3% v 43.5%; p = 0.049).
CONCLUSION: GIK solution therapy achieved NEFA suppression and an insignificant trend toward reduced biochemical parameters of ischemic injury in OP-CAB surgery and CPB groups, but no major clinical benefit (perioperative myocardial infarction, intensive care unit length of stay, or hospital length of stay) was shown after elective CABG surgery in low-risk patients. Compared with CPB, OP-CAB surgery significantly reduced ischemic injury and postoperative infections."

DESIGN: Open, prospective, observational survey.
SETTING: Favaloro Foundation, single institution.
PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive patients undergoing elective Ross procedure (n = 87).
INTERVENTIONS: Pulmonary valve function and anatomy were assessed by transesophageal echocardiography and the surgeon. Pulmonary autograft function was assessed after implantation. Regurgitation was considered mild (+/4), moderate (++/4), moderate-to-severe (+++/4), and severe (++++/4). Patients were restudied during midterm follow-up.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The Ross procedure was done in 74 patients (85%). Overall mortality was 3.4%. Mean follow-up was 24 +/- 13 months. The Ross procedure was not done in 13 patients (15%): 6 patients had a bicuspid pulmonary valve, 6 patients had >3 mm fenestrations, and 1 patient had regurgitation. The surgeon diagnosed anomalies in the pulmonary valve through direct observation. Transesophageal echocardiography was not sensitive enough to diagnose pulmonary valve defects in 12 of 13 patients with anomalies. Pulmonary valve regurgitation was identified by intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography in only 1 patient. Autograft regurgitation was 1.07 +/- 0.35 at postoperative evaluation. At 1, 6, and 12 months, it was 1.25 +/- 0.7 (p = 0.18), 1.27 +/- 0.9 (p = 0.185), and 1.29 +/- 0.8 (p = 0.17). The difference in values was not statistically significant. Four patients (5.4%) showed an increase in regurgitation during the first transthoracic autograft control.
CONCLUSION: Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography allows assessment of autograft performance after implantation. This method is not helpful, however, in detecting pulmonary valve anatomic anomalies."

RESULTS: Seventy patients aged 16 to 62 years had surgery using the endoscopic technique. Thirty-nine patients presented with oral antral fistula of different locations, the most common being third molar fistula (26 cases). Foreign bodies were found in 21 sinuses, among them teeth roots (in 11), dental fillings (in 7), and packs (in 3). Fungal ball was found in six sinuses. The surgical technique included retrograde resection of the uncinate process, enlargement of the natural maxillary ostium posteriorly, and removal of the polyps and foreign bodies from the sinus through the middle meatal antrostomy window. Approach through the oral antral fistula facilitated additional access to the alveolar recess. Removal of polyps from the alveolar recess was performed using the microdebrider, which was introduced through the fistula under endoscopic control through the nasoantral window. The fistula was closed in two layers. Good results were obtained in all but four patients in terms up to 3 years. No complications occurred. Overall recovery rate after primary surgery was 94.7%.
CONCLUSION: Endoscopic approach to chronic maxillary sinusitis of dental origin is a new, reliable method associated with less morbidity and lower incidence of complications."
12160502,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12160502/,"OBJECTIVE: Intrathecal narcotics (ITNs) are being used in some settings as a sole labor analgesic. However, they have not been directly compared to epidural analgesia.
STUDY DESIGN: We used a prospective observational design.
POPULATION: Eighty-two women with uncomplicated full-term pregnancies were enrolled upon analgesia request during spontaneous labor with cervical dilation 3 to 7 cm. Sixty-three chose ITNs (morphine and fentanyl), and 19 chose epidural analgesia (continuous infusion of bupivacaine and fentanyl).
OUTCOMES MEASURED: Pain scores were documented using a visual analog scale. Satisfaction and side effects were rated with Likert scales during a structured interview on the first postpartum day. Outcomes were analyzed with multivariate regression techniques.
RESULTS: Intrathecal narcotics were associated with significantly higher pain scores than was epidural analgesia during the first and second stages of labor and on an overall postpartum rating. The median effective duration of action for ITNs was between 60 and 120 minutes; however, ITNs provided excellent analgesia for a subgroup of women who delivered within 2 to 3 hours of receiving them. Although women in both groups were satisfied with their pain management, women receiving ITNs had statistically lower overall satisfaction scores.
CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of a nonrandomized study, a single intrathecal injection of morphine and fentanyl has a shorter duration of action and provides less effective pain control than a continuous epidural infusion of bupivacaine and fentanyl. However, ITNs may have a role in settings with limited support from anesthesiologists or for women whose labors are progressing rapidly."
12160524,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12160524/,"AIMS: Studies in avian models of myopia have shown that refractive error development can be influenced by exogenously delivered fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2. The present study sought to determine whether endogenous FGF-2 was associated with retinoscleral signalling or scleral remodelling during changes in refractive error in a mammalian model of myopia.
METHODS: Myopia was induced in tree shrews over a 5-day period. One group of animals was then allowed 3 days of recovery from the induced myopia. Endogenous levels of FGF-2 were measured in scleral and retinal homogenates using ELISA. Real-time PCR was used to investigate scleral FGF-2 and FGF receptor (FGFR)-1 mRNA expression.
RESULTS: No difference in FGF-2 content was found in posterior scleral or retinal extracts of myopic eyes (scleral -4+/-9%, retinal +23+/-17%) or recovering eyes (scleral -10+/-18%, retinal +1+/-13%), when compared with contralateral control eyes. In addition, no significant changes were found in scleral FGF-2 mRNA expression in myopic or recovering eyes (+106+/-56% and +14+/-12% respectively, P=0.21). However, FGF-2 concentration was significantly higher in anterior, relative to posterior, scleral regions in all animals (1602+/-105 vs 1030+/-50pg/mg respectively P<0.001). Expression of scleral FGFR-1 mRNA was upregulated in myopic eyes (+186+/-32%, P=0.01) but returned to control eye levels during recovery (+63+/-20%).
CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that alterations in endogenous retinal or scleral FGF-2 levels are not associated with changes in scleral remodelling in this mammalian model of myopia. However, the reversible changes found in FGFR-1 expression in the sclera of myopic eyes mean that an indirect role for FGF-2 in the control of scleral remodelling is implicated. The anteroposterior difference found in scleral FGF-2 concentration indicates a role for this cytokine in the control of normal scleral growth and development and, presumably, eye size."
12160576,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12160576/,"OBJECTIVES: To examine the possible relationship between the distribution of neuroendocrine (NE) cells and the development of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in the human prostate, we performed an NE cells-distribution analysis and made morphological observations of acinous structures in different-aged prostates.
METHODS: Forty-three human prostates obtained from surgical and autopsy cases aged from 2 months to 86 years were examined immunohistochemically using Chromogranin A and analyzed with special reference to the development of BPH.
RESULTS: NE cells were distributed predominantly in the verumontanum and main prostatic ducts and were fewer in number in the terminal acini. As BPH development progressed, the NE cells were greatly diminished in number or completely lost from most adenoma nodules.
CONCLUSIONS: The NE cells of the prostate may be distributed and transported from the periurethral region near the verumontanum to the terminal acini during the development of the acinar structures. The distribution pattern is relatively consistent among prostates of all ages. However, NE cells do not appear in acquired tissue within BPH nodules as the nodules develop. Thus, the distribution of NE cells does not seem to be related to the development of BPH."
12160592,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12160592/,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the value of the combined use of non contrast computerized tomography (NCCT) and dynamic renal scintigraphy (DRS) in the evaluation of patients with renal colic.
METHODS: Forty-nine consecutive patients with renal colic were evaluated with abdominal plain films (KUB), NCCT and DRS with Tc-99m DTPA or MAG-3. NCCT results showed size and location of the urolithiasis, as well as secondary signs of obstruction. DRS was used to determine the degree of obstruction in the affected renal unit. Patients were submitted to urologic intervention or followed, decision made on the basis of clinical symptoms, degree of obstruction, size, and location of the stone.
RESULTS: Three patients had other etiologies than stone for their symptoms and were excluded from the study. Of the remaining 46 patients, KUB detected stones in 24 (52.2%), while NCCT in all. NCCT showed secondary signs of obstruction in 35 patients (76%). Seven patients in this group (15%) had severe hydronephrosis on NCCT and complete obstruction on DRS. Twenty-eight patients (61%) showed moderate hydronephrosis and/or peri-renal and peri-ureteral stranding on the NCCT. In this latter group, DRS diagnosed complete obstruction in 5 (18%) patients, partial obstruction in 16 (57%) and no signs of obstruction in 7 (25%) patients. Overall 34% (12/35) of the patients with secondary signs of obstruction on NCCT had complete obstruction on DRS. NCCT revealed no secondary signs of obstruction in 11 patients (24%) with partial obstruction diagnosed by DRS in one of them (9%). All 12 patients with complete obstruction on the DRS underwent early intervention. Of the 16 patients with partial obstruction of the DRS, two patients (12.5%) necessitated ureteric stent insertion. Three patients with no obstruction on the RNS underwent elective extracorporal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) while the rest of the patients were followed and passed their stones spontaneously.
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of non-enhanced helical CT and DRS assesses both anatomy and function. When NCCT shows no secondary signs of obstruction, NCCT as the sole imaging study performed may be adequate. If there are secondary signs of obstruction on NCCT, DRS can distinguish patients with different degrees of obstruction and together with the clinical course, size, and location of the lithiasis may help in selecting patients who need earlier intervention from those who may be safely observed."
12160950,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12160950/,"OBJECTIVE: We propose that ischemic preconditioning (IPC) and mitochondrial K(ATP) channel activation protect the myocardium by inhibiting mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) opening at reperfusion.
METHODS: Isolated rat hearts were subjected to 35 min ischemia/120 min reperfusion and assigned to the following groups: (1) control; (2) IPC of 2x5 min each of preceding global ischemia; (3,4,5) 0.2 micromol/l cyclosporin A (CsA, which inhibits MPTP opening), 5 micromol/l FK506 (which inhibits the phosphatase calcineurin without inhibiting MPTP opening), or 20 micromol/l atractyloside (Atr, a MPTP opener) given at reperfusion; (6,7) pre-treatment with 30 micromol/l diazoxide (Diaz, a mitochondrial K(ATP) channel opener) or 200 nmol/l 2 chloro-N(6)-cyclopentyl-adenosine (CCPA, an adenosine A1 receptor agonist); (8) IPC+Atr; (9) Diaz+Atr; (10) CCPA+Atr. The effect of mitochondrial K(ATP) channel activation on calcium-induced MPTP opening in isolated calcein-loaded mitochondria was also assessed.
RESULTS: IPC, CsA when given at reperfusion, and pre-treatment with diazoxide or CCPA all limited infarct size (19.9+/-2.6% in IPC; 24.6+/-1.9% in CsA, 18.0+/-1.7% in Diaz, 20.4+/-3.3% in CCPA vs. 44.7+/-2.0% in control, P<0.0001). Opening the MPTP with atractyloside at reperfusion abolished this cardio-protective effect (47.7+/-1.8% in IPC+Atr, 42.3+/-3.2% in Diaz+Atr, 51.2+/-1.6% in CCPA+Atr). Atractyloside and FK506, given at reperfusion, did not influence infarct size (45.7+/-2.1% in Atr and 43.1+/-3.6% in FK506 vs. 44.7+/-2.0% in control, P=NS). Diazoxide (30 micromol/l) was shown to reduce calcium-induced MPTP opening by 52.5+/-8.0% in calcein-loaded mitochondria. 5-Hydroxydecanoic acid (100 micromol/l) was able to abolish the cardio-protective effects of both diazoxide and IPC.
CONCLUSION: One interpretation of these data is that IPC and mitochondrial K(ATP) channel activation may protect the myocardium by inhibiting MPTP opening at reperfusion."
12161583,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12161583/,"OBJECTIVES: To compare attitudes of medical and law students toward informing a cancer patient about diagnosis and prognosis and to examine whether differences are related to different convictions about benefit or harm of information.
SETTING AND DESIGN: Anonymous questionnaires were distributed to convenience samples of students at the University of Geneva containing four vignettes describing a cancer patient who wishes, or alternatively, who does not wish to be told the truth.
PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and twenty seven medical students and 168 law students.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Five point Likert scale of responses to the vignettes ranging from ""certainly inform"" to ""certainly not inform"" the patient.
RESULTS: All medical students and 96% of law students favoured information about the diagnosis of cancer if the patient requests it. Seventy four per cent of medical students and 82% of law students favoured informing a cancer patient about his or her prognosis (p = 0.0003). Thirty five per cent of law students and 11.7% of medical students favoured telling about the diagnosis (p = 0.0004) and 25.6% of law students and 7% of medical students favoured telling about the prognosis (p < 0.0001) even if the patient had clearly expressed his wish not to be informed. Law students indicated significantly more often than medical students reasons to do with the patient's good, legal obligations, and the physician's obligation to tell the truth, and significantly less often than medical students that their attitude had been determined predominantly by respect for the autonomous choice of the patient.
CONCLUSION: Differences in attitudes according to the type of case and the type of studies were related to convictions about the benefit or harm to the patient caused by being given information. The self reported reasons of future physicians and future lawyers are helpful when considering means to achieve a better acceptance of patients' right to know and not to know."
12161936,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12161936/,"OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to perform a comparative study between IVP (Intra Venous Pyelography) and Doppler US (Ultras Sound) in assessing the normal renal function. The US assessment of the normal renal function consisted in the evaluation of ureteral flux.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The group of patients consisted in 79 patients with small size urinary stones (5-12 mm). Among them, 58 patients had pelvic stones and 21 patients had ureteral stones. The ultrasound system used in our study was a B&K Medical Panther 2002 equipped with a 3.5 MHz transducer.
RESULTS: The sensibility in detecting ureteral flux in patients with pelvic stones and normal IVP was 100%. The sensibility in detecting uretheral flux in ureteral stones with IVP aspect of hydronephrosis was 65%.
CONCLUSIONS: In cases of normal aspect of IVP the presence of uretheral flux assessed by ultrasound could substitute the IVP in the preoperative evaluation for ESWL treatment. In cases of hydronephrotic aspect of IVP, the concordance between results based on IVP and those based on Doppler US in good enough for proposing the Doppler US evaluation of renal function in obstructive stones as a new diagnostic imaging modality. Doppler US could be the method of choice for renal function pre ESWL evaluation mainly for patients with known intolerance to contrast media."
12162586,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12162586/,"PURPOSE: To investigate the potential in vivo influence of different topical glaucoma medications on the diameter of the retinal arterioles of healthy volunteers and glaucoma patients.
METHODS: The diameter of one pre-selected retinal arteriole per eye was measured using the Retinal Vessel Analyser (RVA), an instrument developed for non-invasive clinical measurement of the diameter of the main retinal vessels. The instrument contains a video system, and the integrated software recognises the boundaries of the retinal vessels by detecting their light-transmission profile. The vessel diameter (in arbitrary units) is plotted against time (seconds) on a separate display screen. In Study I the vessel diameter was measured in 12 eyes of six healthy volunteers (age 21-26 years, mean age 24.0 years) on six occasions each separated by 14 days. In a double-masked fashion, each subject's right eye was treated with one of 5 glaucoma medications (brinzolamide 1%, timolol 0.5%, betaxolol 0.5%, brimonidine 0.2% or latanoprost 0.005%) and the left eye always received balanced salt solution. In Study II, one randomly selected eye of 16 patients (age 50-79 years, mean age 65.2 years) suffering from primary open-angle glaucoma controlled with topical monotherapy was investigated, in an unmasked fashion. Four patients were on betaxolol 0.5% treatment, six subjects were receiving non-selective topical beta receptor blockers and six subjects were being treated with once daily latanoprost 0.005%.
RESULTS: The coefficient of variation for the arteriole diameter in the healthy volunteers was less than 12% in each case. No significant post-treatment change of the diameter of the pre-selected arteriole was found for any topical medication investigated, either in the healthy volunteers (Study I) or in the patients suffering from glaucoma (Study II) (p>0.05, paired t-test). In addition, in Study I no difference was observed in the alteration of the arteriole diameter between the baseline and the hour 2 measurements when the values from the drug-treated and placebo treated eyes were compared (p>0.05, two-way ANOVA).
CONCLUSION: In the present investigations it was not possible to detect any statistically meaningful change of the arteriole diameter at two hours after the instillation of any of several topical antiglaucoma drugs widely used in clinical practice. Further investigations are necessary to clarify whether the lack of observed change is due to the lack of retinal vascular effects of the drugs investigated, or is due to an inability of the RVA instrument in practice to detect alterations between time-points separated by several hours."
12162631,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12162631/,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the extent to which certain risk factors in 5- to 6-year-old children predict later psychopathology in a population-based sample of children from the province of Limburg in the south of the Netherlands.
METHOD: Of the 2,290 children of interest, 1,317 children were screened with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and psychosocial risk factors for these children were collected. On the basis of the CBCL ratings, 403 children participated in the second stage in which, 1.5 years later, standardized child psychiatric information was obtained. Weighted logistic regression analyses were used to investigate predictors of psychopathology.
RESULTS: In separate analyses of specific types of child psychopathology, different risk factors emerged as significant. Low-level parental occupation and having foreign-born parents were predictive of conduct disorders, and living in a single-parent family and a having a life event were the most important predictors of mood and anxiety disorders. Furthermore, CBCL-based ratings at 5 to 6 years of age corresponded well with interview-defined diagnoses 1.5 years later.
CONCLUSIONS: Investigation of psychosocial risk factors and CBCL scores at the age of 5 to 6 years could be helpful in predicting child psychopathology and could help identify children at risk, in order to provide them with timely attention."
12162798,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12162798/,"OBJECTIVE: Compare nighttime and daytime arterial blood gas values in patients undergoing long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT).
METHODS: We studied 39 LTOT patients with chronic airflow limitation. Oxygen from an oxygen concentrator was administered via nasal prongs until daytime blood oxygen saturation (measured via pulse oximetry [S(pO2)]) was > or = 90%. Arterial blood samples were drawn at 6:00 PM, while the subject breathed room air, and also during oxygen administration at night (3:00 AM), early in the morning (7:00 AM), and at noon. S(pO2) was measured throughout the night.
RESULTS: Mean patient age was 70 +/- 7 yr. All patients suffered severe chronic airflow limitation (mean forced expiratory volume in the first second 28 +/- 9% of predicted). The mean oxygen flow administered was 1.41 +/- 0.6 L/min. Mean overnight S(pO2) was 92 +/- 2.5%, with 21.5 +/- 28% of recording time under 90%. There were statistically significant differences between P(aO2), P(aCO2), and pH obtained at 3:00 AM and noon and between 7:00 AM and noon, while the patients breathed the same oxygen concentration. The differences between the 3:00 and 7:00 AM values were not significant. In 23 patients (59%) we observed a P(aCO2) increase > 10 mm Hg and/or a pH decrease to < 7.33 during that period, indicating poor response to LTOT.
CONCLUSIONS: Daytime arterial blood gas measurements do not reflect nighttime gas exchange. However, samples taken early in the morning (7:00 AM) do seem to reflect arterial blood gases during the night and can therefore be used for setting and monitoring nighttime oxygen flow."
12164167,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12164167/,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this paper was to review the literature relating to the use of pressure immobilization bandages in the first aid management of jellyfish sting in Australia and to attempt to make a recommendation about their use based on the current literature.
METHODS: A descriptive review of all published cases of jellyfish envenomation in Australia was performed, with specific focus on the discussion of pressure immobilization bandages in the management of such cases. A Medline search was performed using the key words listed for this article. Selected articles were reviewed and further publications were identified from the published reference lists given in the selected articles.
RESULTS: The published articles were grouped into three groups: in vitro evidence, case reports and editorial comment (either in journals or book). Fifteen references were identified that discussed the use of pressure immobilization bandages in the management of jellyfish envenomation. Other articles were identified that had significant management issues discussion.
CONCLUSION: Most of the 'jellyfish' literature is in relation to envenomation by Chironex fleckeri. This jellyfish is usually found in tropical Australia and has resulted in the deaths of 67 people in Australia. The last death was near Cairns in 2000. Unfortunately, there are few good data on marine envenomations, with most of the literature being Chironex envenomation case reports. There are minimal data on the effect of pressure immobilization bandages on other jellyfish envenomations. There is no good evidence to support the use of pressure immobilization bandages in the management of jellyfish sting in Australia [corrected]."
12164349,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12164349/,"BACKGROUND: In most paediatric units, the micturating cystourethrogram (MCU) is the gold standard in the diagnosis of vesicoureteric reflux (VUR). Because of the well-known difficulties associated with MCUs, there is interest in any imaging finding which may be predictive of the absence of VUR with enough confidence to avoid the necessity for an MCU.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether incorporation of measurement of the internal diameter of the retrovesical ureter into a routine urinary tract US protocol can provide a useful predictor of VUR.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The radiology information system at the Royal Alexandra Children's Hospital in Brighton was searched to identify children who had urinary tract US and an MCU within 3 months of each other. This identified 285 renal units in 144 patients. The presence and grade of VUR on the MCU was then compared with the presence or absence of mild-to-moderate distal ureteric dilation, using 3.5 mm as the upppr limit of normal for the retrovesical ureter on US.
RESULTS: A distal ureteric diameter of more than 3.5 mm on US is predictive of VUR with a sensitivity of 0.63 and specificity of 0.78. Figures for dilating VUR (grades 3-5) were 0.78 and 0.77, respectively. The negative predictive value of a ureteric calibre less than 3.5 mm in excluding dilating reflux was 0.96. Interestingly, all three solitary renal units had ureteric diameters of more than 3.5 mm but no VUR.
CONCLUSIONS: Absence of distal ureteric dilation on US, on its own, cannot reliably exclude VUR. It does, however, make dilating reflux unlikely. We believe US measurement of the distal ureteric diameter is a useful additional tool in everyday assessment of children who might have reflux."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: 72 patients with a life-expectancy of more than three years were selected to have bipolar arthroplasty for the treatment of femoral collum fracture at Tampere University Hospital district during 1993-1995. The average age of the patients was 70 (47-92) years. All patients were followed at least 4 years for mortality as well as primary and late complications. A group of 49 (68%) patients could be followed more carefully by clinical examination, by questionaire or by phone.
RESULTS: 20 (28%) patients died during the first three years after surgery and four (6%) patients were re-operated. The bare preoperative clinical estimation made by the senior consultant surgeon did not predict good enough the life expectancy of the patients. Four patients had been revised, all operated by a senior surgeon. There were no revisions among the patients operated by junior doctors. No statistical differences were found between the patients operated by junior or senior surgeons or between cemented and cementless prostheses in pain, walking distances, limping, getting in to a car, need of support or sitting in high or normal chair.
CONCLUSIONS: The bipolar arthroplasty was found to give reproducible results also when residents take the responsibility of hip fracture treatment."
12164570,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12164570/,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate in a prospective, controlled fashion the prevalence of umbilical artery Doppler waveform notching and its association with cord and placental abnormalities.
METHODS: During a 6-month period, umbilical artery velocity waveforms were prospectively obtained on 1857 pregnancies at greater than 27 weeks' gestation. All pregnant patients with the presence of a persistent fetal umbilical artery waveform notch formed the study population (cases). Control patients, matched for gestational age, with normal umbilical artery waveforms, were selected for comparison (2 controls per case). After delivery, detailed pathologic examination was performed on all umbilical cords and placentas.
RESULTS: The presence of an umbilical artery waveform notch was noted in 29 (1.6%) of 1857 pregnancies. Postnatal placental evaluation showed the presence of an accessory placental lobe in 5 (17%) of 29 cases compared with 1 (1.8%) of 54 controls (P = .018). Overall, the presence of an umbilical artery waveform notch was associated with umbilical cord abnormalities in 21 (72%) of 29 cases compared with 8 (14%) of 54 controls (odds ratio, 15; 95% confidence interval, 4.4-54.4).
CONCLUSIONS: Umbilical artery waveform notching appears to be a strong predictor of cord and placental abnormalities. This finding may have important clinical implications."
12164879,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12164879/,"BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy remains unclear, although previous reports implicate a wide range of putative genetic and metabolic factors.
METHODS: Incident and prevalent cases of overt nephropathy (ON), defined as an albumin excretion rate>200 microg/min in at least two of the three timed urines, from the Pittsburgh Epidemiology of Diabetes Complication Study (a prospective epidemiologic study of an incident cohort of childhood onset type 1 diabetic subjects) were studied.
RESULTS: Incidence analyses reveal differences in univariate baseline risk factors that predict ON within 5 years of measurement [low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, white blood cell count, and hypertension] and those that predict in the long-term, that is, 6 to 10 years after baseline, hemoglobin A1 (Hb A1). Estimated glucose disposal rate (calculated using a formula derived from euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp studies), however, strongly (P < 0.001) predicted ON throughout follow-up. Comparing individuals who were most susceptible to ON (those with an onset before 20 years duration of type 1 diabetes and before the development of other advanced complications) with the least susceptible (late or no occurrence of ON despite the development of other advanced complications) revealed otherwise undetected genetic associations [that is, apolipoprotein E (Apo E), angtiotensin-converting enzyme insertion/deletion (ACE I/D), and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) HindIII polymorphism) with odds ratios ranging from 2.9 to 7.1.
CONCLUSIONS: In type 1 diabetes insulin resistance is an underlying risk state for ON, which may be accelerated by other disturbances (for example, hypertension and dyslipidemia). A novel approach to classifying (that is, phenotyping) subjects, which compares those at the extremes of susceptibility, reveals strong genetic associations and important interactions with other risk factors not otherwise apparent."
12164997,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12164997/,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether the use of low-dose oral cobalamin (Cbl) supplements by older persons, as frequently found in multivitamin preparations, affects their Cbl serum concentrations and function, determined by measurements of the serum Cbl-related metabolites methylmalonic acid (MMA), homocysteine (HCYS), and methylcitric acid (MCTR).
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
SETTING: Community.
PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred forty-two independent, active, community-living, older adult volunteers recruited from community events and activities for seniors.
MEASUREMENTS: We systematically collected data on vitamin supplement intake, diet, medications, and medical and surgical history. Serum was obtained for Cbl, MMA, HCYS, and MCTR, and creatinine and hematological parameters.
RESULTS: Serum levels of Cbl were significantly higher in subjects on oral Cbl supplements (2-37.5 microg/day). Similarly, serum levels of the metabolites MMA, HCYS, and MCTR were also lower in subjects on Cbl supplementation. Intake of low-dose oral supplements of Cbl significantly reduced the odds of low Cbl levels or high MMA. The relationship between Cbl supplement dosage and the biochemical parameters was dose dependent.
CONCLUSION: Oral Cbl (2-37.5 microg/day) intake by community-dwelling healthy older adults is associated with higher serum levels of Cbl and improved or normalized Cbl function, as indicated by lower concentrations of the metabolites MMA, HCYS, and MCTR. Use of low-dose oral Cbl replacement therapy might be sufficient to prevent Cbl deficiency in a large proportion of this population."
12165592,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12165592/,"BACKGROUND: The requirements for institutional review board (IRB) review and informed consent (IC) for research involving human subjects have existed for more than 2 decades. Although many studies document them poorly, most published research undergoes IRB review and has IC procedures. Less is known about research published in pediatric journals, and how child health research is determined to be exempt.
METHOD: All full-length articles published in the paper edition of 3 pediatric journals between January and December 2000 were examined. Articles were excluded if they were case studies, meta-analyses, lacked empirical data, or did not include at least 1 US researcher or US subjects. The remaining articles were examined to determine if they documented IRB review and IC mechanisms. If either or both of these features were missing, authors were asked to participate voluntarily in a survey. In addition, all exempt articles were examined to determine if the exemptions were in accordance with the federal regulations for the protection of human subjects.
RESULTS: Three hundred seventy-nine of 575 articles met inclusion criteria. One hundred ninety-seven (52.0%) documented IRB review, 164 (43.3%) documented IC, and 131 (34.6%) properly documented the presence of both IRB review and IC. Two hundred fifty-one researchers were surveyed to clarify IRB review and/or IC mechanisms. Approximately 13.5% of the research had not undergone IRB review, and 12.4% had not had their consent methods reviewed by an IRB. We found that between 26.9% and 39.8% of exempted research did not meet federal regulations requirements.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that most research underwent IRB review and had a consent mechanism despite the lack of documentation in the articles. We also found that most research that did not undergo IRB review would have been exempt under current guidelines. However, a significant number of IRB- and researcher-exempted research were inappropriately classified. Improving research ethics standards will require additional education for researchers and IRB members, and greater adherence of researchers (and editors) to the journals' guidelines on these issues."

The aim of this work was to study how prolonged rhGH administration in trained subjects influences the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system, in order to evaluate new methods in antidoping tests.
METHODS: Morning serum growth hormone (GH), IGF-I, IGF binding protein (BP)-2, IGFBP-3, IGF-I/IGFBP-2, and IGFBP-3/IGFBP-2 ratios were evaluated before, during (8th and 15th days), and at the end and after cessation (+3, +6, +9, +12, and +15 d) of a 3-wk treatment with different doses of rhGH (0.09 IU.kg BW(-1).d(-1) for 6 or 3 d a week, i.e., the A and B trials, respectively) in seven well-trained subjects not involved in competitive sports. The blood collections pre- and during treatment were performed immediately before the daily rhGH dose.
RESULTS: In both trials, significant increases of IGF-I (higher in the A trial) and IGFBP-3 serum concentrations during rhGH administration were observed. Serum IGFBP-3 remained significantly increased in the A trial 3 d after treatment cessation. In the A trial only, two subjects had IFG-I concentrations exceeding the upper limit of the reference range. No modifications of serum GH, IGFBP-2 and IGF-I/IGFBP-2, and IGFBP-3/IGFBP-2 ratios were observed. The z-score evaluation for IGFBP-3 detected GH exposure in 100% of subjects only at end treatment in A trial.
CONCLUSION: Although IGF-I and IGFBP-3 seem potentially the most specific markers of rhGH assumption, our data suggest that for antidoping purposes a single evaluation of their absolute serum concentration is not a sufficiently secure method to detect rhGH abuse in all subjects, especially in the case of low rhGH doses."
12165751,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12165751/,"BACKGROUND: The mechanism of action of the ketogenic diet, a therapy for refractory epilepsy, is unknown. Our hypothesis is that acetone, one of three ketones elevated by the ketogenic diet, is directly responsible for the diet's anticonvulsant effects. This study examined the basic concepts of this hypothesis.
MATERIAL/METHODS: Rats were acutely injected with acetone intraperitoneally at doses of 1 or 10 mmol/kg, or received acetone chronically in drinking water (1% v/v) for 10 days before being injected with a 1 mmol/kg dose of acetone. Controls consumed regular water and were injected with vehicle. A pentylenetetrazole seizure test was administered 15 min after the injections. Following the test, acetone was measured in the cerebrospinal fluid.
RESULTS: A 10 mmol/kg injection of acetone suppressed seizures in 60% of rats (P<0.05). A chronic administration of acetone followed by a 1 mmol/kg injection suppressed seizures in 47% of rats (P<0.05). The acetone concentrations in these rats were 10.3I2.3 and 1.0I0.2 mmol/L, respectively. The effect of the acute 1 mmol/kg injection (without acetone pretreatment) was not statistically significant. This dose elevated acetone to 1.1I0.1 mmol/L in the cerebrospinal fluid.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that acetone is an anticonvulsant and that chronic administration may enhance its action. Linking acetone to the effects of the ketogenic diet requires further research. In particular, it will be important to confirm that the ketogenic diet generates relevant concentrations of acetone."
12165868,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12165868/,"BACKGROUND: In addition to malignant diseases, acute and chronic inflammations may elevate plasma levels of tumor markers CA 125 and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) causes a generalized inflammatory response. In this study, we have investigated the effect of CPB on plasma levels of CA 125 and CEA.
METHODS: We measured plasma levels of CA 125 and CEA in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with CPB (Group 1, n = 21), and in patients who underwent off-pump CABG, that is, without CPB (Group 2, n = 16). Blood samples were collected preoperatively, and on postoperative days 1, 6, and 12.
RESULTS: Within both groups, CEA plasma levels were not significantly influenced in any samples. Comparing with preoperative values, CA 125 values elevated significantly on postoperative days 6 and 12 within both groups. It was observed that the elevation of CA 125 plasma levels in these samples were significantly higher in Group 1.
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that CPB elevated plasma level of CA 125. However, clinical importance of this finding needed further evaluation."
12165895,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12165895/,"BACKGROUND: The current standard in the treatment of nephroblastoma is preoperative chemotherapy based on radiological appearance. After subsequent surgical removal few tumours proved histologically to be neuroblastoma. We asked whether initial chemotherapy according to nephroblastoma trials would change the prognosis for those neuroblastoma patients.
RESULTS: Out of 1603 patients registered in the German neuroblastoma trials, 29 patients (1.8 %) have preoperatively been treated according nephroblastoma protocols. Advanced stages (11 stage 3, 12 stage 4) were dominant. Diagnostic work up of those patients revealed elevation of catecholamine metabolites in only 39 % (compared to 80 % of the control patients) and mIBG uptake in only 71 % (compared to 89 % of the control patients). Elevation of NSE was observed in 92 % of patients (control group 72 %). Patients with preoperative nephroblastoma treatment were older than the patients of the control group. Risk factors like MYCN amplification or elevation of LDH were more often detected. The outcome of the patients with preoperative chemotherapy according nephroblastoma trials was worse than that of the control group, but risk group adapted survival analysis revealed no disadvantage.
CONCLUSION: The prognosis of children with neuroblastoma tumours, which have been radiologically classified as nephroblastoma, is inferior compared to the prognosis of patients without preoperative nephroblastoma therapy. The difference appears to be associated rather with more unfavourable biology than with the element ""preoperative chemotherapy""."
12165945,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12165945/,"BACKGROUND: Aging in the dialitic population currently shows the problem of vascular access for haemodialysis. The use of temporary catheters for haemodialysis has increased the risk of infections. DOQI guidelines underline this problem. We think that the thrombosis of central veins is a problem as important as infection.
METHODS: In the last two years we studied prospectively 310 patients. 686 catheters for haemodialysis were placed. Infection, malfunctioning of catheters and thrombosis of central veins were studied. We compared femoral catheters with jugular catheters. Finally we studied by ultrasound the jugular vessels diameter and thrombi of jugular vein. RESULTS. Fever was present in 5.55% of patients with femoral catheters and in 5.84% of the patients with jugular catheters. The malfunctioning incidence in patients with femoral catheters was 22.75% and 8.76% in patients with jugular catheters with statistic difference. Ultrasound study of jugular veins showed thrombotic incidence of internal jugular vein in 20,8% of patients.
CONCLUSIONS: We think that with correct management of catheters there is no difference in the incidence of fever in patients with jugular catheters versus femoral catheters. Probably jugular catheters have better performance than femoral catheters. We need controlled studies to better understand the problem of central vein thrombosis."

DESIGN: The two groups, both composed of 13 undergraduate students, were matched for age and sex. Other factors influencing tooth wear were controlled by matching the groups on their responses to a questionnaire asking about recognised common causes of tooth wear. The participants teeth were examined and the degree of wear scored according to a tooth wear index.
RESULTS: Severity of occlusal tooth wear of the lower first molar teeth was significantly greater in the drug user group than in the control group (P<0.05). No other statistically significant differences between the groups were found.
CONCLUSION: Regular use of amphetamine-like drugs could be associated with increased posterior tooth wear."
12167186,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12167186/,"BACKGROUND: The ventricular late potential (VLP) detected using the technique of signal average electrocardiography (SAECG) interacts with several factors, primarily time.
METHOD: In this study, we examined the interaction, over time, of VLP with the initial ischemic burden and enzyme levels in acute myocardial infarction. Patients diagnosed as having acute myocardial infarction were included in the study. On the first day, the patients underwent enzyme analysis and electrocardiography (ECG) follow-up every 6 hours. A 24-hour ambulatory ECG was performed on the seventh day in order to determine the ischemic burden. SAECG findings (TQRS, RMS, LAS) were obtained on the seventh day, in the first and third months. The study was continued with the patients who did not require angioplasty as decided with angiographic evaluation in the first month.
RESULTS: The study included 30 patients with acute myocardial infarction (mean age 51 +/- 12, 28 males and 2 females). The initial mean CK-MB levels and the mean ischemic burden were 98 +/- 31 U/L and 44 +/- 96 minutes. The TQRS (ms), LAS (ms), and RMS (microV) values (mean +/- SD ) obtained at day 7, month 1, and month 3 are 97 +/- 12, 96 +/- 9, 103 +/- 11, P = 0.01; 31 +/- 10, 31 +/- 11, 32 +/- 10, P = 0.46; 43 +/- 28, 41 +/- 26, 33 +/- 25, P = 0.01, respectively. We observed that the TQRS and RMS values changed significantly with time, but these levels of significance disappeared when adjusted for the initial ischemic burden and CK-MB levels (P = 0.06; P = 0.53). The VLP frequency was 33% at day 7 and 23% at month 3. Unlike the CK-MB level, the initial ischemic burden was significantly different between the patients with and without VLP at month 3 (150.85 +/- 149.28, 12.34 +/- 26.48, P = 0.001 ). When tested together with age and gender, it was found that the high initial ischemic burden increased the possibility of VLP (OR: 24, CI: 2.09-279.52, P = 0.01 ) at month 3.
CONCLUSION: SAECG findings in patients with myocardial infarction changed with time; however, this change occurred depending on the initial ischemic burden and CK-MB levels. Of these, only the initial ischemic burden, especially in high levels, was a determinant for the presence of VLP in the late period of myocardial infarction."
12167385,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12167385/,"OBJECTIVE: Patients with heart failure have slow metabolic gas exchange kinetics, which may contribute to the elevated slope of the relationship between ventilation and carbon dioxide production (Ve/Vco(2) slope).
SETTING: A tertiary referral centre for cardiology.
SUBJECTS: Eleven patients with stable chronic heart failure and 11 age-matched controls.
DESIGN: Each subject underwent maximal bicycle-based peak exercise testing with metabolic gas exchange analysis and three further repeated tests at 15%, 25% and 50% of the load achieved at peak exercise. The ventilation and carbon dioxide production from each of these steady-state tests was used to re-calculate the Ve/Vco(2) slope and compared with the Ve/Vco(2) slope derived from the maximal test.
RESULTS: Peak oxygen consumption [mean (S.D.)] was lower in heart failure patients [18.2 (4.0) vs. 31.2 (6.3) ml/kg per min; P<0.001] than in controls. The Ve/Vco(2) slope was steeper in patients than controls [32.7 (8.3) vs. 27.1 (1.6); P<0.05]. There was no difference between the Ve/Vco(2) slope reconstructed from the three steady state tests and resting data and that gained from the maximal test [35.3 (7.8) vs. 25.9 (3.2); P=0.43].
CONCLUSIONS: The elevated slope of the relationship between ventilation and carbon dioxide production is not a consequence of the short stages of a standard incremental exercise test combined with delayed metabolic gas kinetics in heart failure patients."
12167389,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12167389/,"BACKGROUND: Beta-adrenergic blockade is of proven value in chronic heart failure. It is uncertain, however, if beta-blockade provides a similar degree of clinical benefit for heart failure patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) as those in sinus rhythm (SR).
AIMS: To compare the effectiveness of beta blockade in patients with heart failure and AF.
METHODS: Patients with chronic heart failure were randomized to treatment (double blind) with metoprolol 50 mg twice daily or carvedilol 25 mg twice daily in addition to standard therapy. Response was assessed after 12 weeks by a quality of life questionnaire, New York Heart Association class, exercise capacity (6-min walk test), radionucleotide ventriculography for LVEF, 2-D echocardiography measurement of left ventricular (LV) dimensions and diastolic filling and 24-h electrocardiograph monitoring to assess heart rate changes.
RESULTS: Both beta-blockers produced significant improvements in LVEF in both the SR group: (+6+/-10% at 12-week, P<0.001) and the AF group: (+11+/-9% at 12-week, P<0.05). However, significant improvement in symptoms (P<0.001) and exercise capacity (P<0.001) were observed only in the SR group but not in the AF group despite a significant improvement in LVEF.
CONCLUSION: Beta-blockers were effective in improving LV ejection fraction in chronic heart failure patients in either SR or AF but had less effect on symptoms and exercise capacity in those with AF."
12167452,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12167452/,"INTRODUCTION: Pleomorphic adenoma is a slow-growing benign salivary tumour most commonly arising in the parotid gland. Macroscopically it has a surrounding capsule from which it can be enucleated-often the treatment used in the past. These tumours do not have a true capsule but can press surrounding normal salivary gland, frequently having finger-like extensions into the normal tissues. Recurrence, or more accurately residual disease, is thought to be due to these small islands of tumour which can be left behind at surgery, in particular enucleation which is associated with high recurrence rate. The current, most common practice is the excision of these tumours through superficial parotidectomy and postoperative follow-up. However, is long-term follow-up necessary and does it reduce the morbidity from tumour recurrence?
METHODS: We reviewed the charts of 182 patients who underwent parotid surgery operated upon by a single surgeon (RKM) between 1973 and 1999. We included only 58 cases of pleomorphic adenomas removed by superficial parotidectomy. We excluded cases that had follow-up of less than 12 months and cases which had previous surgery elsewhere. Adequate tumour excision and the integrity of the capsule were ascertained intra-operatively, and this was confirmed by postoperative histology.
RESULTS: In our study we had 34 females, mean age of 58, and 24 males, mean age of 50. The average follow-up was 6 years with a range of 1-23 years. We had no permanent facial nerve dysfunction, and we recorded only one recurrence (1.7%).
CONCLUSION: Provided adequate excision of the tumour with intact capsule and histological confirmation are achieved, long-term follow-up is unnecessary and can be replaced by patient education and self-examination."
12167505,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12167505/,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to identify the differences between unipolar mania and classical bipolar disorder.
METHODS: Patients with at least four manic episodes and at least 4 years of follow-up without any depressive episodes were classified as unipolar mania. This group was compared to other bipolar-I patients defined according to DSM-IV regarding their clinical and socio-demographic variables.
RESULTS: The rate for unipolar mania as defined by the study criteria was found to be 16.3% in the whole group of bipolar-I patients. Unipolar manic patients tended to have more psychotic features and be less responsive to lithium prophylaxis compared to other bipolar-I patients.
LIMITATIONS: Because it was a retrospective study, there may be some minor depressive episodes left unrecorded in the unipolar mania group despite careful and thorough investigation. In addition, even with our fairly strict criteria for the diagnosis of unipolar mania, the possibility of a future depressive episode cannot be excluded.
CONCLUSIONS: Unipolar mania may be the presentation of a nosologically distinct entity."
12167520,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12167520/,"BACKGROUND: The authors compared the effect of clonazepam supplement treatment on unipolar depression and bipolar depression.
METHODS: A total of 38 protracted depression patients with unipolar depression (n = 19) or bipolar depression (n = 19) were treated with 3.0 mg clonazepam for 4 weeks.
RESULTS: In the unipolar depression group, 84.2% of the subjects fulfilled the response criteria (at least an 80% reduction in their HDRS score). However, in the bipolar depression group, only 10.5% of them fulfilled these criteria.
CONCLUSIONS: The difference in responses between the two groups supposes that the underlying abnormality in unipolar depression is not the same as that in bipolar depression. This trial also supposed that clonazepam can play active role in the treatment of protracted depression in patients with unipolar depression.
LIMITATIONS: This finding was made in an open study, and the effect on clonazepam alone was not established."
12167521,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12167521/,"BACKGROUND: The reliability of telephone interviews for rating 25 selected individual items of the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies (DIGS) was assessed among persons with remitted bipolar disorder I (BPD I, n = 20).
METHODS: The Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies (DIGS) was administered directly (with two raters present) and by telephone in random order to 20 adults with bipolar disorder I.
RESULTS: Telephone interviews achieved reliability comparable to direct interviews for 16 items (64%), but were considered unsatisfactory for seven others (28%). Two other items, which evaluated the overlap between substance abuse and mood disorder, were considered unreliable for both methods of interview.
LIMITATIONS: The presence of two interviewers for the in-person interview may have led to over-estimation of in-person reliability. Investigator bias in favor of phone interviews and a relatively small sample may have confounded the results.
CONCLUSIONS: Telephone interviews may be used to evaluate individuals with BPD I in remission, provided the limitations of this method are recognized. They have limited reliability for dissecting overlap between mood abnormalities and psychotic phenomena or substance abuse."
12167523,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12167523/,"BACKGROUND: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are effective in the treatment of depression, though response to them is difficult to predict. The aims of this study were two-fold: (1) to determine the differences in personality profile between patients with major depression and healthy control subjects and (2) to assess the effect of treatment with fluoxetine on personality domain scores and determine whether any of the personality traits can predict the outcome of antidepressant treatment.
METHODS: The study included 53 patients with major depression and 53 healthy controls. The NEO-Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) was administered to all subjects before and after 24 weeks of treatment with fluoxetine.
RESULTS: The patients in an episode of major depression had a significantly different personality profile compared to healthy controls at baseline and the severity of their illness correlated with higher scores in the Neuroticism domain. Treatment with fluoxetine was associated with a reversal of high Neuroticism scores and low Extraversion scores in the whole sample and in a subgroup of responders but not in non-responders. Among the FFI personality domains, Agreeableness was a better predictor of treatment outcome than baseline HAMD-17 scores.
LIMITATIONS: There was no placebo group, which would have permitted the evaluation of the effect of non-drug factors in treatment outcome and changes in personality domain scores. The sample size was only moderate.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that (a) significant differences exist between the personality profiles of depressed patients and healthy control subjects and (b) responders to treatment with fluoxetine show significant changes in personality profile. These changes may be attributed to improvement of depressive symptoms."
12168476,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12168476/,"BACKGROUND: The focus of this retrospective study was to evaluate if the additional use of SPECT improves the diagnostic value of the preoperative Tc-99m-sestamibi scintigraphy combined with sonography in patients presenting with primary hyperparathyroidism.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: 62 patients (43 female, 19 male) were examined by visual analysis of planar Tc-99m-sestamibi scintigraphy, SPECT and ultrasound. 14/62 were suffering from superimposed thyroid disease, 22/62 patients underwent previous neck surgery. 12/62 presented with recurrent hyperthyroidism, in 8/62 cases dystopic parathyroid tissue had been localized. For statistic evaluation these imaging modalities were correlated with the histopathological examinations of the surgical specimens for single use as well as combined use for all patients (group 1) and for the subgroups ""histologically confirmed adenoma"" (group 2), hyperplastic disease (group 3) ""recurrency and/or dystopic parathyroid tissue"" (group 4) and ""patients presenting with thyroid nodules and/or previous neck surgery"" (group 5), respectively.
RESULTS: For single use planar scintigraphy showed the highest sensitivity (72%) followed by SPECT (67%) and ultrasound (58%). The combination of planar imaging with ultrasound achieved 83% whereas the combined use of all three modalities increased the sensitivity up to a maximum of 85%. The combined use of the imaging modalities leads to the following results: The histologically proven parathyroid adenomas (group 2) could be detected by planar scintigraphy and sonography with a sensitivity of 87%, for group 3 the combined use of all three modalities reached 69% sensitivity. Group 4 achieved the highest sensitivity (69%) by means of planar scintigraphy and SPECT, whereas group 5 reached 82% by means of planar scintigraphy and ultrasound.
CONCLUSION: Planar Tc-99m-sestamibi scintigraphy combined with ultrasound is superior regarding to sensitivity and to the costs for the noninvasive preoperative detection in patients presenting with primary hyperparathyroidism. Due to economic reasons the additional use of SPECT might be limited to patients presenting with recurrent hyperparathyroidism or atypically located parathyroid tissue."
12168960,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12168960/,"BACKGROUND: Dysplastic oral leukoplakia (DOL) has been the index lesion in prevention trials for upper aerodigestive tract squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Vitamin A derivatives, including 13-cis retinoic acid (13-CRA), have been used to treat DOL and to reduce the risk of subsequent SCC. Results from a trial of 13-CRA in patients with DOL are presented here. Transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) and the epidermal growth factor receptor messenger RNA (mRNA) expression were studied to validate their use as surrogate endpoint biomarkers in prevention trials for SCC.
STUDY DESIGN: In a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial of 13-CRA in 28 patients with DOL, TGF-alpha and epidermal growth factor receptor mRNA expression were analyzed in sequential biopsy specimens of DOL and of adjacent normal-appearing mucosa, utilizing a quantitative, competitive, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and were compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for paired comparisons.
RESULTS: In biopsy specimens of DOL, TGF-alpha mRNA expression at baseline, but not baseline expression of epidermal growth factor receptor mRNA, was significantly elevated when compared with its expression in specimens from adjacent normal-appearing mucosa (p = 0.003). In patients randomized to 13-CRA who had > or = 50% clearance of DOL during treatment, significant modulation of TGF-alpha mRNA overexpression was seen after 6 months of treatment (p = 0.016). TGF-alpha mRNA overexpression at baseline predicted a subsequent response to 13-CRA (p 0.066).
CONCLUSIONS: The full extent of the association between TGF-alpha overexpression and the development of SCC is unknown. Evidence is presented in this article that TGF-alpha overexpression mediates the relationship between 13-CRA and DOL, but there is no direct evidence that it mediates the relationship between 13-CRA and the prevention of SCC. Determination of the extent to which TGF-alpha overexpression mediates this relationship and complete validation of TGF-alpha's role as a surrogate endpoint biomarker await the results of animal and human trials that utilize reduction in the incidence of SCC as their endpoint."
12168969,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12168969/,"BACKGROUND: Although mortality rates for some cardiovascular procedures seem to have declined, it is unclear whether other high-risk procedures are becoming safer over time.
STUDY DESIGN: We examined national trends between 1994 and 1999 in operative mortality for 14 high-risk cardiovascular and cancer procedures in the national population of Medicare beneficiaries over age 65. Secular trends were examined using logistic regression adjusting for age, gender, race, socioeconomic status, admission acuity, comorbidities, and hospital volume.
RESULTS: Observed mortality rates varied widely across the 14 procedures, from 2% (carotid endarterectomy) to 16% (esophagectomy). Over the 6-year study period, average patient age increased for all procedures, and patients were more likely to undergo operation at high-volume hospitals for some procedures (pancreatic resection, esophagectomy, cystectomy, and pneumonectomy). After accounting for these changes, operative mortality declined significantly for three cardiovascular procedures, as evidenced by adjusted odds ratios (OR) for the 6-year effect on operative mortality (coronary artery bypass graft OR = 0.85, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.81 to 0.88; carotid endarterectomy OR = 0.86,95% CI 0.80 to 0.93; mitral valve replacement OR = 0.89, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.97). In contrast, operative mortality did not decline for any of the cancer procedures. In fact, adjusted mortality increased for colectomy for colon cancer (OR= 1.13, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.19).
CONCLUSIONS: Although risks of some cardiovascular procedures are declining over time, there is no evidence that other types of high-risk surgery are becoming safer. These findings suggest the need for systematic efforts to monitor and improve surgical performance."

METHODS: A systematic review of the literature from 1966 to 2000 using the search terms 'tryptophan', 5-hydroxytryptophan', '5-HTP', '5-HT' and 'depression'. We extracted and grouped data for meta-analysis by pooling odds ratios (OR) and relative risks where possible.
RESULTS: One hundred and eight studies were located of which only two studies, one of 5-HT and one of L-tryptophan, with a total of 64 patients met sufficient quality criteria to be included. These studies suggest 5-HT and L-tryptophan are better than placebo at alleviating depression (Peto OR = 4.1, 95% CI = 1.3-13.2). However, the small size of the studies, and the large number of inadmissible, poorly executed studies, casts doubt on the result from potential publication bias, and suggests that they are insufficiently evaluated to assess their effectiveness.
CONCLUSION: A large body of evidence was subjected to very basic criteria for assessing reliability and validity, and was found to largely be of insufficient quality to inform clinical practice. More well-designed studies are urgently required to enable an assessment of what may be an effective class of agents."

An important example of such a genetic disorder is the velo-cardio-facial syndrome (VCFS) associated with 22q11 microdeletion.
CASE REPORT: The case of a 22-year-old male, who had the typical genotype and phenotype of VCFS and developed a psychotic illness characterized by withdrawal, catatonic posturing, inappropriate affect, stereotyped behavior, negativism and poverty of speech, is described. He had a partial response to an atypical neuroleptic, but developed myoclonus that was controlled with an anticonvulsant.

Accordingly, this retrospective study was designed to determine the predictive factors for failure of PD of postoperative abscess, in order to better select the patients who may benefit from PD.
METHODS: From 1992 to 2000, the data of 73 patients who underwent computed tomography (CT)-guided PD for postoperative intra-abdominal abscess, were reviewed. PD was considered as failure when clinical sepsis persisted or subsequent surgery was needed. The possible association between failure of PD and 27 patient-, abscess-, surgical-, and drainage-related variables were assessed using univariate and multivariate analysis.
RESULTS: Successful PD was achieved in 59 of 73 (81%) patients. The overall mortality was 3% but no patient died after salvage surgery. Multivariate analysis showed that only an abscess diameter of less than 5 cm (P = 0.042) and absence of antibiotic therapy (P = 0.01) were significant predictive variables for failure of PD.
CONCLUSIONS: CT-guided PD associated with antibiotic therapy could be attempted as the initial treatment of postoperative abdominal abscesses even in complex cases such as loculated abscess or abscess associated with enteric fistula."
12170202,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12170202/,"INTRODUCTION: Although rare, superior mesenteric artery (SMA) aneurysms have a definite rupture risk. Past reports have suggested that this risk is low, yet most investigators recommend repair in selected patients. We reviewed our experience with 21 patients to try to determine when intervention was indicated.
METHODS: A retrospective review of the medical records of all patients with SMA aneurysms at our institutions from January 1980 through December 1998 was undertaken. Only patients with true aneurysms of the SMA were included.
RESULTS: Twenty-one patients with true SMA aneurysms were identified and included 14 males (67%) and seven females (33%). This represents a 6.9% incidence rate of all visceral aneurysms seen at our institutions. Eight patients (38%) had rupture at presentation, including seven of the 14 males (50%). In contrast to previous reports, only one patient (4.7%) had an infectious etiology. Five patients were on beta-blocker therapy, but none were seen with rupture. However, eight of the remaining 16 patients (50%) without beta-blockade had rupture. Thirteen patients (62%) had calcified aneurysms, but all ruptures were seen in noncalcified aneurysms. Operative intervention occurred in 11 of the 21 patients (52%). All eight patients with rupture underwent operation, including six ligations and one successful embolization, and one patient died before completion of repair. The operative mortality rate was 37.5% for ruptured aneurysms. Elective repair included one prosthetic graft, one excision and patch angioplasty, and one embolization, with no mortality. Ten of the 21 patients (48%) with SMA aneurysms were observed, and all were alive and well at a mean of 67 months' follow-up (range, 2 to 148 months).
CONCLUSION: SMA aneurysms are rare but appear to have a higher risk of rupture than previously reported. Male patients and patients with noncalcified aneurysms appear to have a greater risk of rupture. beta-Blockade may have some protective effect against aneurysm rupture. Intervention is reasonable in all patients at good operative risk with SMA aneurysms, considering the high rupture rate in our series."

The purpose of this study was to determine whether plethysmographically derived finger pressures (FPs) or digital-brachial indices (DBIs) are predictive of symptomatic arterial steal.
METHODS: We prospectively studied 72 patients (37 men, 35 women; mean age, 57 +/- 10 years) who were undergoing brachial artery-based hemodialysis access. All patients had complete pre- and postoperative hand examinations and FP determinations. Surgeons were blinded to preoperative FP results.
RESULTS: Prosthetic graft was used in 60 patients (6-mm polytetrafluoroethylene [PTFE] in 50, tapered PTFE in 10), and brachial-based arteriovenous fistulas were created in 12. Fourteen (19%) patients developed arterial steal symptoms. The mean preoperative FP was significantly lower in steal patients than in those without steal (131 +/- 27 vs 151 +/- 31 mm Hg, P <.03). Nine (64%) of the patients with steal had DBIs <1.0, compared to 18 (31%) of the patients without steal (P =.02). However, there was no absolute FP or DBI threshold below which steal was inevitable. The occurrence of steal was attributed to proximal arterial stenoses in seven, to distal arterial disease in five, and was unknown in two. When comparing the 14 patients who developed steal to the 58 who did not, we noted that a higher proportion of steal patients had coronary artery disease (57% vs 17%, P =.005). Steal was more likely to develop in patients with arteriovenous fistulas than in patients with prosthetic grafts (43% vs 14%, P =.009). There were no significant differences in demographic factors, atherosclerotic risks (diabetes, smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia), prevalence of peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, shunt location, tapered vs straight graft, or number of prior grafts placed.
CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that preoperative FPs are lower in patients who develop steal syndrome after hemodialysis access. Patients with preoperative DBIs <1.0 are more likely to develop steal, but there is no DBI threshold below which steal is inevitable. Steal is more likely in patients undergoing brachial-based arteriovenous fistulas than in those receiving prosthetic grafts."
12170406,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12170406/,"BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Using push enteroscopy, the small bowel can only be investigated in part. This preliminary prospective randomized study examined whether increasing the length of the enteroscope can have a beneficial effect on the insertion depth.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between August 1999 and December 1999, 28 consecutive patients were investigated using push enteroscopy and were randomly assigned to two groups. One group was investigated using the Olympus push enteroscope SIF-100 (working length 2200 mm). In the other group, the Olympus push enteroscope SIF-Q140 (working length 2500 mm) was used. All investigations were carried out using an overtube. The insertion depth was estimated by counting the folds in the small bowel. In addition, the insertion length was estimated in centimeters by withdrawing the instrument to the pylorus after straightening.
RESULTS: The two groups were comparable in terms of age, sex distribution, indication for enteroscopy, investigation time, and pathological findings. There were no significant differences in the insertion length between the two types of instrument. With the SIF-100, the median number of folds was 95 (range 30 - 213) and the insertion length was 72.5 cm (range 40 - 110 cm); and with the SIF-Q140, the median number of folds was 79 (range 18 - 203) and the insertion length was 70.0 cm (range 20 - 140 cm).
CONCLUSIONS: As there was no significant difference in the insertion depth between the shorter instrument (Olympus SIF-100) and the longer one (Olympus SIF-Q140), it can be concluded from this preliminary study that there is no advantage in using a longer enteroscope. To document a significant difference, further studies with a larger numbers of patients would be necessary."
12170527,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12170527/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine if there is an age-related effect on bone mineral density (BMD) loss with GnRH agonist treatment of endometriosis and, in particular, whether the impact of this therapy in terms of BMD loss is different if it is used at an age prior to attainment of peak BMD than after attaining it.
STUDY DESIGN: Data from a randomized, double-placebo-controlled clinical trial comparing efficacy and safety of two GnRH agonists, without add-back, for the treatment of endometriosis, were analyzed.
RESULTS: No significant age-related effect was detected for either GnRH agonist on absolute BMD loss with a single, six-month course. However, in women at an age prior to peak BMD, prevention of the natural increase in BMD with these drugs may prevent women from attaining their peak BMD and thus increase their risk of osteoporosis in later life.
CONCLUSION: GnRH agonists should be used with caution and perhaps only with strategies designed to minimize the impact on BMD in women prior to attainment of peak BMD."
12170856,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12170856/,"PURPOSE: In this article, the time taken by a prosthodontist to fabricate and maintain mandibular overdentures retained by two implants and conventional dentures is compared.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty edentulous patients between the ages of 65 and 75 completed a randomized clinical trial. All received new maxillary conventional dentures and either a mandibular conventional denture (n = 30) or a two-implant overdenture on ball attachments (n = 30). The time spent by the prosthodontist and the number of visits required for treatment, including both scheduled and unscheduled visits, were recorded for each patient from preliminary impressions to 6 months following delivery. Data from the two groups were compared using Mann-Whitney U tests.
RESULTS: The prosthodontist spent a mean total time of 296 minutes in treating an implant overdenture patient and 282 minutes on a conventional denture patient during the period from preliminary impressions to the 6-month follow-up. The mean numbers of appointments were 10.1 (implant group) and 10.8 (conventional group). These differences were not significant.
CONCLUSION: Although additional knowledge is required to treat patients with implant prostheses, the time required by the prosthodontist to provide two-implant mandibular overdentures with ball attachments was not significantly different than the time needed for conventional denture treatment."
12171221,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12171221/,"BACKGROUND: In New Zealand, an association has been shown between postnatal depression and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).
AIM: To replicate the New Zealand study.
DESIGN OF STUDY: Case-control study.
SETTING: The city of Sheffield, UK.
METHOD: The database of the Sheffield Child Development Study was used Demographic and obstetric data were collected and at one month postpartum the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was administered. Detailed information on the cause of all infant deaths was available.
RESULTS: There were 32,984 live births during the study period (from the year 1988 to 1993) and 42 babies died with the cause registered as SIDS. Multivariate analysis showed that smoking was the most important risk factorfor SIDS (odds ratio [OR] = 7.24, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 2.76 to 19.01), followed by a high EPDS (OR = 3.20, 95% CI = 1.46 to 6.99) and residence in an area of poverty (OR = 2.33, 95% CI = 1.06 to 5.11).
CONCLUSIONS: The Sheffield data confirm the New Zealand findings. A high EPDS score and, by implication, postnatal depression, may be risk factors for SIDS, however, there are many possible explanations for the association."
12171680,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12171680/,"INTRODUCTION: Isotretinoin has been used to treat acne since 1982. Its current indications in the package insert are limited and many physicians still feel uncomfortable prescribing it because of its side effects. Serum levels of liver enzymes and lipids are carried out as a routine in most clinics both before and during treatment.
AIMS: Our objective was to evaluate the effect of isotretinoin on serum lipids, liver function and other laboratory parameters in order to assess the necessity to perform routine laboratory tests.
METHODS: Computerized medical files of 1292 patients in private practice that received isotretinoin for acne were analyzed.
RESULTS: 907 patients completed a treatment course of 5 to 9 months. Serum levels of liver enzymes were not elevated to a degree necessitating discontinuation of treatment. Only 1.5% of the patients had serum triglyceride levels above 400 mg%. No laboratory abnormalities were a cause for discontinuation of treatment. During a 6-year follow up only 3.5% of patients received a second course of therapy with isotretinoin.
CONCLUSIONS: Aside from its teratogenic effect, isotretinoin is a safe and excellent drug for acne therapy. It should be prescribed for any inflammatory acne and in our opinion there is no need for a routine laboratory follow-up in young, healthy patients aside from a pregnancy test in females. At present, isotretinoin should be considered as the drug of choice for moderate to severe acne."
12171747,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12171747/,"OBJECTIVES: First, to investigate how many decisions by one commissioning body (district health authority) were based on evidence of effectiveness from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews of RCTs. Second, to investigate whether other types of quantitative studies and qualitative studies could be used as evidence to support commissioning decisions.
METHOD: From three planning documents (for 1997-1998), all statements were identified. Effectiveness questions were constructed from each and used to search for evidence from trials and reviews in the Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 1998). Further searches for other studies (all methodologies) were performed on a subset of decisions and appraised by an independent expert panel.
RESULTS: A total of 124 decisions were identified of which two-thirds concerned organisation of care. Evidence existed for less than half (48.4%) the decisions, with 33.9% favouring the decision and 14.5% where evidence was either equivocal or unfavourable. From a random subset of ten decisions, relevant non-randomised quantitative studies and qualitative studies were identified for half the decisions. Evidence from economic evaluations was identified for only one decision.
CONCLUSIONS: Large gaps in knowledge exist if health care purchasers are to base their decisions on evidence of effectiveness from RCTs. However, other types of evidence can be used to support such decisions. Summaries of research should be published in a format that is accessible to purchasers."
12171825,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12171825/,"BACKGROUND: Non-ICU telemetry monitoring has proven to be a valuable resource for patients suspected of having an acute myocardial infarction. While a significant number of patients are admitted to these units, the actual incidence of events or interventions is low.
OBJECTIVE: To identify a subset of patients in whom telemetry monitoring does not alter management.
DESIGN: Prospective observational study.
SETTING: Large tertiary care facility.
PATIENTS: A total of 414 patients consecutively admitted from the emergency department for suspected acute coronary syndromes were studied. Patients were excluded if they presented with ST-segment elevations, were revascularized on hospital admission, were admitted to a surgical service, were transferred from another floor or unit, or remained in the emergency department for the course of the stay.
OUTCOMES: Events were defined as development of myocardial infarction, episodes of chest pain, new or rapid atrial arrhythmias, ventricular arrhythmias, any form of AV nodal block, and asystole. Intervention or change in management was any increase, decrease, or change in medication, cardioversion, electrophysiology study, or transfer to the ICU.
RESULTS: Patients who had atypical chest pain and normal ECG findings were significantly less likely to have both intervention and events (4 interventions vs 23 interventions [p < 0.0001], 12 events vs 45 events [p < 0.0001]), compared to those with typical chest pain and abnormal ECG findings. When normal laboratory values were added, only four telemetry events were observed.
CONCLUSION: Patients with atypical chest pain and normal ECG findings represent a subset of patients with low risk for life-threatening arrhythmia. Use of telemetry monitoring in this subset of patients should be reevaluated."
12171830,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12171830/,"BACKGROUND: Both pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary overflow are associated with functional and structural changes of the pulmonary arterial wall. Current techniques to evaluate the pulmonary vasculature neglect the pulsatile nature of pulmonary flow.
STUDY OBJECTIVES: To determine whether the dynamic properties of the pulmonary arterial wall are altered in patients with abnormal pulmonary hemodynamics due to congenital heart defects, and whether these changes are associated with the progression of pulmonary vascular disease (PVD).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 43 children with PVD due to congenital heart defects and 12 control subjects, pulmonary arterial pulsatility (the relative increase in vessel area during the cardiac cycle) and distensibility (the inverse of the stress/strain elastic modulus) were determined with intravascular ultrasound. Results were correlated with clinical and hemodynamic parameters.
RESULTS: Pulsatility correlated with pulmonary pulse pressure (p < 0.001), pulmonary-to-systemic vascular resistance ratio (PVR/SVR) [p = 0.001], and hemoglobin concentration (p = 0.01). However, when corrected for these variables, pulsatility did not differ between patients and control subjects. In contrast, arterial wall distensibility decreased with the severity of PVD and correlated independently with pulmonary-to-systemic arterial pressure ratio (p < 0.001) and PVR/SVR (p = 0.03), and with hemoglobin concentration (p < 0.01). Adjusted for hemodynamic variables, distensibility was still decreased in patients with PVD compared to control subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that pulmonary arterial wall distensibility is progressively decreased in PVD; moreover, this decreased distensibility is, in part, related to increased distending pressure as a result of pulmonary hypertension but also, in part, to stiffening of the arterial wall during the disease process. Arterial wall distensibility may be of additional value in the evaluation of pulmonary vasculature and ventricular workload."
12172514,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12172514/,"OBJECTIVES: It has been reported recently that follow-up FIM trade mark scores have been obtained from stroke patients via telephone interviews with either the former patient or proxy caregivers. We studied the validity and sensitivity of change of a ""phone FIM"" score in a sample of hip fracture patients after rehabilitation.
DESIGN: We compared FIM scores among hip fracture patients in a specialized musculoskeletal rehabilitation program. Sample size estimate of 27 was determined before the study. Patients included those with hip fracture returning to independent living in their own home.
RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients were identified as a convenience sample of admitted patients. The phone FIM score at 8 wk was a valid predictor of the discharge FIM score and the observed FIM and phone FIM scores at 8 wk were similar. The sensitivity to change over 8 wk was similar between observed and phone FIM scores compared with the discharge FIM score.
CONCLUSIONS: The phone FIM instrument presents a useful clinical instrument to monitor patient functional status in the community, showing excellent psychometric properties. Ease of use and low cost should encourage greater use in clinical management of these patients."
12173078,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12173078/,"BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Controversy exists as to whether all patients with lower intestinal bleeding need to undergo total colonoscopy. This study compares the prevalence of colonic neoplasms in patients reporting scant hematochezia with the prevalence in controls.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Structured interviews were carried out with 4265 consecutive patients referred for colonoscopy. Of these, 468 patients had scant hematochezia, 299 had occult rectal bleeding and 57 reported dark rectal bleeding. Patients with scant hematochezia were matched for age and sex with those having no risk factors for colorectal neoplasms. For all groups, we determined the prevalence of adenomas and cancers below and above 50 cm.
RESULTS: Colonic neoplasms were found in 18 % of patients with scant hematochezia and in 7.5 % of controls. However, most of these tumors were located within the reach of a sigmoidoscope. Compared with controls, patients with scant hematochezia had no increased risk for proximal neoplasms (odds ratio [OR] = 1.2), while this risk was significantly increased in patients with occult rectal bleeding (OR = 3.1) and patients who had observed maroon-colored blood in their stool (OR = 4.8).
CONCLUSIONS: Flexible sigmoidoscopy appears to be a sufficient work-up for young patients who have observed trace amounts of bright red blood on the surface of their stool."
12173080,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12173080/,"BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: The methods of endoscopic ablation of metaplastic and dysplastic areas in Barrett's esophagus so far described, are not satisfactory with respect to efficacy and safety. Therefore we investigated whether photodynamic therapy (PDT) with topical delta-aminolevulinic acid (delta-ALA) leads to ablation of specialized columnar epithelium and eradication of low-grade dysplasia while not producing phototoxicity and systemic side effects.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: 14 patients with histologically proven Barrett's esophagus, seven of whom had evidence of low-grade dysplasia, underwent endoscopic treatment with topical delta-ALA. Photoactivation (wavelength, 632 nm) was performed at 1.5 - 2 hours after drug administration using an argon dye laser. Patients received omeprazole 80 mg daily for 2 months; thereafter; maintenance therapy depended on reflux symptoms. Patients were endoscopically re-evaluated after 7 days, and subsequently at 3, 6, 12 and up to 48 months (mean follow up 33 months). Re-treatment with high-dose topical delta-ALA was offered to the 11 patients with remaining metaplasia and was carried out in five of them.
RESULTS: Low-grade dysplasia was eradicated in all patients. One patient with no dysplasia before PDT developed a high-grade dysplasia after PDT. Complete ablation of Barrett's metaplasia was observed in 21 % of the patients after the first treatment session and in 20 % after the second treatment session. The mean reduction in the length of Barrett's metaplasia was 1.54 +/- 1.29 cm after the first PDT session and 1.02 +/- 0.80 cm after the second PDT session. Post-endoscopic pain and photosensitivity reactions were less frequent with low-dose delta-ALA PDT than with high-dose PDT (pain 15 %, 100 %, respectively; P = 0.001 by Fisher's exact test; phototoxicity, 0 %, 50 %, respectively; P = 0.021 by Fisher's exact test).
CONCLUSION: Low-dose topical administration of delta-ALA provides ablation of low-grade dysplasia in the range obtained with oral delta-ALA. In addition, it is safe and well tolerated. Since, however, topical administration of delta-ALA is not able to consistently eradicate Barrett's esophagus, alternative methods will have to be developed."
12173818,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12173818/,"BACKGROUND: During cardiopulmonary bypass, the activated clotting time is frequently used for determination of anticoagulation, and either Celite or kaolin are used as activators. If aprotinin is administered concomitantly, the Celite activated clotting time (C-ACT) becomes significantly higher than the kaolin activated clotting time (K-ACT). Therefore, insufficient anticoagulation using C-ACT in the presence of aprotinin is a major concern. Whether the application of tranexamic acid (TA), a pharmacologic alternative to aprotinin, has similar effects has not been studied before.
METHODS: An in vitro study using the blood of healthy volunteers was performed. Both C-ACT and K-ACT were measured at baseline, after adding TA, and after adding TA and heparin. In addition, 30 patients undergoing primary cardiac operations had simultaneous measurements of C-ACT and K-ACT after skin-incision, 5 minutes after the application of heparin and TA, every 30 minutes during cardiopulmonary bypass, and 10 minutes after the application of protamine.
RESULTS: In vitro, C-ACT and K-ACT correlated significantly at each measurement. Tranexamic acid had no influence on the activated clotting time. In vivo, C-ACT and K-ACT did not differ significantly, but at each time C-ACT tended to be greater than K-ACT (p = 0.086). The average difference between K-ACT and C-ACT was stable before and after the application of TA (p = 0.85) but the variability of the differences significantly increased during cardiopulmonary bypass (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Application of TA does not seem to differentially affect the mean C-ACT and K-ACT. No recommendation seems warranted to prefer one activator over the other in patients receiving TA."
12173994,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12173994/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether management provided to paediatric inpatients in general units was supported by high-level evidence.
METHODS: A retrospective review was carried out of all patients (n = 142) admitted during one calendar month to two general paediatric units in the USA and Australia. For each patient, the primary diagnosis and primary treatment were determined. A literature review was performed to determine whether the therapy used was evidence-based. The main outcome measure was the level of evidence supporting the primary intervention for the primary diagnosis of each patient.
RESULTS: Level I evidence (at least one randomized trial) supported the primary intervention used in 31% of paediatric admissions and level II evidence (convincing non-experimental evidence) supported the primary intervention in 44% of admissions. Primary interventions were not supported by evidence (level III) in only two patients. The remaining 24% of patients were admitted for observation or evaluation only, and received no primary medical or surgical intervention. Most patients whose interventions were supported by randomized trials were admitted with either asthma or appendicitis.
CONCLUSIONS: Most primary interventions (75%) in paediatric inpatients were supported by high-level published evidence (level I or II). A large number of patients were admitted for evaluation or observation only, and received no therapeutic intervention. Evidence to support this action is not available."
12174000,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12174000/,"OBJECTIVES: We studied the false-positive rate of bag urine cultures in diagnosing bacteriuria in infants and examined the factors responsible for contamination.
METHODS: One hundred asymptomatic patients with previous urinary tract infections (UTI; age range 5-23 months; sex ratio M : F 73:27) were screened by bag urine cultures and confirmed by suprapubic aspiration or catheterization. Those producing contaminated and clean samples were interviewed with a standard questionnaire.
RESULTS: Sixty patients had insignificant growth and 40 had doubtful or mixed growth. After further interview and instructions, the latter group produced a second bag urine sample with negative results in 23 and positive results in 17. Among the latter, UTI was confirmed in five and excluded in 12 cases. The false-positive rate of first urine collection was 36.8%. Comparing patients with contaminated urine to those with negative urine samples, we found the former were associated with waiting for more than one void to complete urine collection, and with uncircumcised boys. Other factors did not reach statistical significance. Proper counselling and repeating a second culture reduced the overall false-positive rate to 12.6%.
CONCLUSION: In our population, the contamination rate of one bag urine culture was 36.8%, which is unacceptable and alternative methods need to be sought. Contamination was associated with improper collection procedures and with uncircumcised boys. Proper instructions and doing a second urine culture reduced the overall rate to 12.6%, but at the expense of delaying diagnosis and treatment."
12174155,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12174155/,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine whether there exists a correlation between anal incontinence, occult sphincter injuries, anal manometry values, and delivery variables in primiparous women after first time vaginal delivery.
METHODS: Eighty-six primigravida women were recruited for this study. Transanal ultrasonography (TAUS) and vector volume manometry (VVM) was performed and bowel symptoms were recorded at 25 weeks of pregnancy and 5 months after labor. Incontinent women at 5 months after vaginal delivery were interviewed again at 12 months.
RESULTS: Nineteen women (25%) experienced flatus incontinence postpartum. After 12 months, only one-third of the women were still incontinent. Fourteen women (19%) showed abnormal TAUS of the anal sphincter. Of the delivery variables, only baby head circumference was significantly associated with flatus incontinence (p = 0.01). There was no correlation between flatus incontinence or delivery variables and anal sphincter injuries; VVM values were not associated with either anal sphincter injuries or flatus incontinence at 5 months, but VVM values were negatively associated with flatus incontinence at 12 months after labor.
CONCLUSIONS: At 5 months after labor, flatus incontinence is relatively common, and is not associated with reduced VVM values. Two-thirds of women recover from flatus incontinence during the first year. Women who had flatus incontinence persisting for a minimum of 1 year had reduced VVM values. Anal sphincter injuries as seen by TAUS are not associated with either VVM values or any delivery variable. Baby head circumference is the only delivery variable significantly associated with flatus incontinence."
12175104,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12175104/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether some behavioural manifestations and poor motor performances in patients affected by rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are due to subclinical cognitive defects.
METHODS: We performed a psychometric assessment of 30 patients affected by RA exploring several cognitive domains such as memory, visual-spatial integration, motor planning, mental flexibility, relating performances with morphological and functional neuroimaging (MRI and SPECT). We also related the cognitive data with the Ritchie and Lee indexes and other clinical parameters.
RESULTS: We found an impairment in visual-spatial tasks in 71% of patients with a high correlation to activity and disease severity as expressed by the Ritchie and Lee indexes (p < 0.005; p < 0.01). Furthermore, we detected in 38% of patients some difficulties in mental flexibility related to the Lee Index (p < 0.05). These poor performances are related to hypoperfusion of the frontal and parietal lobes as detected by brain SPECT; this finding is more evident in patients with brain white matter alterations on MRI.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data allow us to hypothesize that manual dexterity could be due to a disconnection between subcortical white matter and parietal-frontal lobes because of microangiopathy; furthermore, a chronic reduction in sensorial stimuli by impaired joints could lead to produce an alteration in motor planning cognitive processes."
12175388,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12175388/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of urological pathology in a retrospective and prospective study of patients with microscopic haematuria attending a haematuria clinic.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1998 and May 2001, 781 patients attended the haematuria clinic; of these, 368 (47%; median age 60 years, range 18-90) had a history of microscopic haematuria, as detected by urine dipstick testing. These patients were investigated by urine culture and cytology, renal ultrasonography, intravenous urography (IVU), flexible cystoscopy, urea and electrolyte analysis, and assay of prostate specific antigen (PSA) where appropriate.
RESULTS: Urine cytology showed no malignant cells in any patient with a history of microscopic haematuria. In 143 patients (39%), urine cytology showed no red blood cells and all other investigations were normal. Of the remaining 225 patients, IVU showed a tumour in one (bladder), renal stones in 15 and an enlarged prostate in two. Renal ultrasonography detected no additional pathology. Urine analysis showed one urinary tract infection. Flexible cystoscopy detected five patients with a bladder tumour (all G1pTa), two urethral strictures, five bladder stones and enlarged prostates, six enlarged prostates only, and nine red patches in the bladder, showing one patient with carcinoma in situ. No PSA levels were suggestive of prostate cancer.
CONCLUSION: Patients with dipstick-positive haematuria should be re-assessed by urine microscopy before referral. As only 1.4% of patients had a malignant pathology (all noninvasive), microscopic haematuria should be regarded as a separate entity from macroscopic haematuria, and such patients do not need to be referred urgently."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty men with at least 6 months of follow-up and with no signs of recurrent disease after radical cystectomy for bladder carcinoma, and who had either a continent cutaneous diversion or orthotopic bladder substitution, were sent two types of questionnaire, the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Bladder Cancer (FACT-Bl) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), to determine their QoL.
RESULTS: The FACT-Bl and HADS questionnaires were returned by 90% and 71% of the patients, respectively (P < 0.05). In the replies to the generic version of FACT-Bl there were no differences between the groups in any domain, the scores being high in all. In questions covering intestinal, urinary and sexual items, patients with continent diversion had less trouble controlling urine (P < 0.0001), had to empty less often (P < 0.001), and had fewer symptoms when emptying (P < 0.05). Patients with neobladders had a better appreciation of appearance and better preserved erectile function (both P < 0.05). In the answers to the HADS, the mean scores were low (within the normal ranges) and did not differ between the groups.
CONCLUSION: Using two instruments tested for validity and reliability, there were no differences between patients with continent diversion and those with orthotopic substitution."
12175441,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12175441/,"OBJECTIVE: Apolipoprotein E (apo E) is pivotal in lipid metabolism. In women with preeclampsia, an atherogenic state is observed. We hypothesized that a particular genotype of apo E may be associated with preeclampsia.
METHODS: Genomic DNA was extracted from 55 normotensive and 49 preeclamptic women (defined according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists criteria). DNA was amplified by PCR and digested simultaneously by AflIII and HaeII giving profiles identifying all the possible genotypes of apo E.
RESULTS: The most common isoform apo E3 was found both for normotensive and preeclamptic women (76% and 85%, respectively). The frequency of apo E2 and E4, which are more atherogenic, was not higher in the preeclamptic population.
CONCLUSION: We were unable to demonstrate that the ""atherogenic state"" of preeclampsia is associated with a particular genotype of apo E. Familial studies show that shared genetic and environmental factors are involved in lipid variability. However, owing to the diversity of factors contributing to the development of preeclampsia (fetal and paternal genotypes), these data do not allow to rule-out a possible contribution of maternal apo E to preeclampsia."

DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study of prospectively collected data in a hypertensive pregnancy database.
SETTING: Two district general hospitals in the midlands of England. Both hospitals have specialised medical antenatal clinics for pregnant women with chronic hypertension.
PARTICIPANTS: 491 pregnancies in 380 women with essential or secondary hypertension.
OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome measures used were the infant birth weight, birth weight standardized for gestational age, and the ponderal index at birth, a surrogate measure for in utero growth restriction.
RESULTS: The babies of women taking atenolol at conception or during the first trimester had significantly lower birth weights (by 139-512 g, p<0.01) than women on calcium channel blockers or no medication. Likewise the ponderal index was also significantly reduced, p<0.01. In addition most of these babies were small for gestational age (SGA) with 70% on or below the 10th centile and 40% below the third centile. No such independent association was seen with anti-hypertensives taken in the second trimester.
CONCLUSIONS: Atenolol taken at the time of conception and/or during the first trimester of pregnancy was associated with low birth weight. This finding was independent of the development of superimposed pre-eclampsia. Other anti-hypertensives were not found to be associated with low birth weight. Use of atenolol in the second trimester of pregnancy did not produce the same effect and was not materially different in its effects from the other anti-hypertensive drugs. In the second trimester, the development of superimposed pre-eclampsia is the over-riding effect in the reduction of infant birth weight. Atenolol used in the first trimester could be pharmacologically programming these infants to restricted growth patterns."
12176130,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12176130/,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to explore the relationship between low density lipoprotein (LDL) and dendritic cell (DC) activation, based upon the hypothesis that reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated modification of proteins that may be present in local DC microenvironments could be important as mediators of this activation. Although LDL are known to be oxidised in vivo, and taken up by macrophages during atherogenesis; their effect on DC has not been explored previously.
METHODS: Human DCs were prepared from peripheral blood monocytes using GM-CSF and IL-4. Plasma LDLs were isolated by sequential gradient centrifugation, oxidised in CuSO(4), and oxidation arrested to yield mild, moderate and highly oxidised LDL forms. DCs exposed to these LDLs were investigated using combined phenotypic, functional (autologous T cell activation), morphological and viability assays.
RESULTS: Highly-oxidised LDL increased DC HLA-DR, CD40 and CD86 expression, corroborated by increased DC-induced T cell proliferation. Both native and oxidised LDL induced prominent DC clustering. However, high concentrations of highly-oxidised LDL inhibited DC function, due to increased DC apoptosis.
CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the hypothesis that oxidised LDL are capable of triggering the transition from sentinel to messenger DC. Furthermore, the DC clustering-activation-apoptosis sequence in the presence of different LDL forms is consistent with a regulatory DC role in immunopathogenesis of atheroma. A sequence of initial accumulation of DC, increasing LDL oxidation, and DC-induced T cell activation, may explain why local breach of tolerance can occur. Above a threshold level, however, supervening DC apoptosis limits this, contributing instead to the central plaque core."
24236631,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24236631/,"BACKGROUND: Breast cancer tumor markers are used by some clinicians to screen for disease recurrence risk. Since there is limited evidence of benefit, additional research may be warranted.
AIM: To assess the potential value of a randomized clinical trial of breast tumor marker testing in routine follow-up of high-risk, stage II-III breast cancer survivors.
MATERIALS & METHODS: We developed a decision-analytic model of tumor marker testing plus standard surveillance every 3-6 months for 5 years. The expected value of sample information was calculated using probabilistic simulations and was a function of: the probability of selecting the optimal monitoring strategy with current versus future information; the impact of choosing the nonoptimal strategy; and the size of the population affected.
RESULTS: The value of information for a randomized clinical trial involving 9000 women was US$214 million compared with a cost of US$30-60 million to conduct such a trial. The probability of making an alternate, nonoptimal decision and choosing testing versus no testing was 32% with current versus future information from the trial. The impact of a nonoptimal decision was US$2150 and size of population impacted over 10 years was 308,000. The value of improved information on overall survival was US$105 million, quality of life US$37 million and test performance US$71 million.
CONCLUSION: Conducting a randomized clinical trial of breast cancer tumor markers appears to offer a good societal return on investment. Retrospective analyses to assess test performance and evaluation of patient quality of life using tumor markers may also offer valuable areas of research. However, alternative investments may offer even better returns in investments and, as such, the trial concept deserves further study as part of an overall research-portfolio evaluation."
24236804,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24236804/,"AIMS: To report the coexistence of inflammatory hepatocellular adenoma (IHCA) and HNF1α-inactivated HCA (H-HCA) in cases from a multicentre study.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We report nine cases with the coexistence of IHCA and H-HCA; eight occurred in women, and one in a man. The numbers of nodules and the sizes of the largest and smallest HCAs were variable. In one case, the nodules of the two different subtypes were discovered at different times. In all women, HCAs were histologically typical, regardless of their subtype, whereas H-HCA in the man differed histologically from classic H-HCA.
CONCLUSIONS: These cases suggest that a predisposition to develop multiple adenomas, hypothetically caused by a 'benign tumorigenic field effect', although common to all HCAs, may result in different genotypes and phenotypes. Although this is rare, it is expected that more cases with the coexistence of different genotypes will emerge, owing to progress in the use of specific immunohistochemical approaches."
24237097,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24237097/,"OBJECTIVES: To identify areas to improve patient management in lung cancer, which remains the greatest cause of death from cancer in Australia.
DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective survey of all cases of lung cancer reported to the Victorian Cancer Registry from 1 January to 30 June 2003 and followed up for 5 years.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient and disease characteristics, investigations, staging, treatment, cause of death, survival.
RESULTS: 841 patients were included. Smoking data were available for 799, of whom 63 (7.9%) had never smoked. Of 655 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases, 198 (30.2%) were treated with curative intent, 125 (19.1%) by surgery and 73 (11.1%) by radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy. Only 7 (6.9%) of surgical patients with complete R0 resection had adjuvant chemotherapy. Of 101 small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cases, a third had limited stage disease which was mostly treated with curative intent by chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy. Patients whose cases were discussed at a multidisciplinary meeting (MDM) were significantly more likely to receive anticancer treatment and had longer survival; on multivariate analysis, MDM discussion was an independent prognostic factor. Compared with a similar survey 10 years earlier, the median age of patients diagnosed with lung cancer had increased by almost 3 years, the proportion of affected men decreased and adenocarcinoma was more frequent, while 10% of patients continued to have no pathologically confirmed diagnosis and 26% continued to receive no anticancer treatment. The number of patients with NSCLC who went on to a definitive surgical procedure fell with no detriment to survival, which likely reflected better staging with the introduction of positron emission tomography scanning.
CONCLUSIONS: Opportunities to improve patient management included increasing the proportion with a pathologically confirmed diagnosis and greater use of postsurgical adjuvant chemotherapy. A high proportion of patients received no treatment, with underuse of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Critically, the low rate of case discussions at MDMs needs to increase. However, effective strategies are required to identify cases early, as over two-thirds currently present with incurable disease."
24237682,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24237682/,"BACKGROUND: Recent efforts of accelerated malaria control towards the long-term goal of elimination had significant impacts in reducing malaria transmission. While these efforts need to be sustained over time, a scenario of low transmission could bring about changes in individual disease risk perception, hindering adherence to protective measures, and affecting disease-related knowledge. The goal of this study was to investigate the potential impact of a successful malaria vector control intervention on bed net usage and malaria-related knowledge.
METHODS: Dar es Salaam's Urban Malaria Control Program was launched in 2004 with the aim of developing a sustainable larviciding intervention. Larviciding was scaled-up using a stepped-wedge design. Cross-sectional and longitudinal data were collected using a randomized cluster sampling design (2004-2008). Prevalence ratios (PR) for the effect of the larviciding intervention on bed net usage (N = 64,537) and household heads' knowledge of malaria symptoms and transmission (N = 11,254) were obtained from random effects regression models.
RESULTS: The probability that individuals targeted by larviciding had used a bed net was reduced by 5% as compared to those in non-intervention areas (PR = 0.95; 95% credible intervals (CrI): 0.94-0.97) and the magnitude of this effect increased with time. Larviciding also led to a decline in household heads' knowledge of malaria symptoms (PR = 0.88; 95% CrI: 0.83-0.92) but no evidence of effect on knowledge of malaria transmission was found.
CONCLUSION: Successful control interventions could bring about further challenges to sustaining gains in reducing malaria transmission if not accompanied by strategies to avoid changes in individual knowledge and behaviour. This study points to two major research gaps. First, there is an urgent need to gather more evidence on the extent to which countries that have achieved significant decline in malaria transmission are also observing changes in individual behaviour and knowledge. Second, multidisciplinary assessments that combine quantitative and qualitative data, utilizing theories of health behaviour and theories of knowledge, are needed to optimize efforts of national malaria control programmes, and ultimately contribute to sustained reduction in malaria transmission."
24237717,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24237717/,"AIM: Recently, data have questioned the homogenous model of sarcopenia, and suggest that the loss of muscle mass could occur in a site-specific manner. It is unclear, however, whether a muscle strength ratio can be used to assess age-related, site-specific muscle loss. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the relationship between the age-related loss of thigh muscle, muscle function and gait performance.
METHODS: A total of 55 men aged 18-79 years had muscle thickness (MTH) measured by ultrasound at three sites on the anterior (30% and 50% of thigh length) and posterior (70% of thigh length) aspects of the thigh. MTH ratios were calculated to assess the site-specific muscle loss (anterior 30% : posterior 70% MTH [A30:P70] and anterior 50% :posterior 70% MTH [A50:P70]). Walking performance, maximum isometric knee extension/flexion, toe-grasping and handgrip strength were measured.
RESULTS: Age was inversely correlated with the ratios of A30:P70 (r=-0.332) and A50:P70 (r=-0.466). There were no significant correlations between the A30:P70 and A50:P70 ratios, and height and bodyweight. The A30 : P70 and A50 : P70 ratios were also not correlated with maximal walking speed. However, the A50:P70 ratio was significantly correlated with zig-zag walking (r=-0.350) and handgrip strength (r=0.334). In addition, these MTH ratios were also correlated with knee extension (r=0.309 and r=0.405), flexion (r=0.306 and r=0.412) and toe-grasping strength (r=0.265 and r=0.336). After adjusting for physical activity, the MTH ratios were still not correlated with ratio of muscle strength.
CONCLUSION: Strength ratios did not correlate with MTH ratios. Our cross-sectional analysis suggests that age-related site-specific muscle loss could assess the decrease in absolute muscular strength, but not the ratio of muscle strength."
24237751,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24237751/,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Zinc plays a role in skin health, and preliminary data have shown its beneficial effects for melasma. We compared the effect of topical zinc with that of hydroquinone as the standard treatment on severity of melasma.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety-three women with melasma were randomized to receive zinc sulfate 10% or hydroquinone 4% solutions once daily for 2 months. They were followed for an additional 3 months while using sunscreen. The severity of melasma was assessed at baseline and at 2 and 5 months using the Melasma Area and Severity Index (MASI).
RESULTS: Eighty-two patients completed the study. The MASI score fell significantly in both groups, but a greater decrease was seen in those who received hydroquinone (43.5 ± 15.5% vs 18.6 ± 20.8%, p < .001). Postinflammatory pigmentation occurred in 5.2% of the zinc group and irritation in 30.9% of the hydroquinone group.
CONCLUSION: Topical zinc therapy is not highly effective in reducing the severity of melasma, but further trials are needed to determine whether adding zinc to current topical treatments could improve treatment response."
24238124,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24238124/,"BACKGROUND: The clinical implications of repeat completion pancreatectomy for recurrent pancreatic cancer in the remnant pancreas after initial pancreatectomy have not been clarified. We retrospectively analyzed our patients and evaluated the clinical implications of repeat pancreatectomy for isolated local recurrence in the remnant pancreas after initial resection for pancreatic cancer.
METHODS: One-hundred seventy patients who had recurrence of pancreatic cancer out of 326 patients who had initially undergone resection for pancreatic cancer were included in this study. Sixty-seven of 170 recurrent patients were diagnosed as having isolated local recurrence of pancreatic cancer. Eleven of these 67 patients with isolated local recurrence only in the remnant pancreas underwent repeat pancreatectomy. Characteristics and operative outcomes for these 11 patients with repeat pancreatectomy were analyzed and evaluated in comparison with other recurrent patients.
RESULTS: Among 170 patients with recurrence after initial resection for pancreatic cancer, the median survival time was 78.2 and 20.3 months after initial resection, in the repeat pancreatectomy group and the unresectable group, respectively (P < .001), and the 2- and 5-year survival probability rates after initial resection were 91%, and 82% vs 42%, and 13%, respectively. Among 67 patients with isolated local recurrence, the median survival time after repeat resection or diagnosis of recurrence was 25.0 and 9.3 months, and the 2- and 5-year survival probability rates after repeat resection or diagnosis of recurrence were and 61% and 46% vs 19% and 6.2% in the repeat pancreatectomy group and the unresectable group, respectively (P < .01). There was no difference in survivals between the unresectable isolated local recurrence group and the unresectable nonlocal recurrence group.
CONCLUSION: Repeat pancreatectomy might bring about beneficial effects on prognosis in selected patients with isolated local recurrence in the remnant pancreas after initial pancreatectomy for pancreatic cancer without increased operative morbidity or mortality."
24238230,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24238230/,"BACKGROUND: Radiological findings of patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) undergoing surgery have not been well analyzed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of imaging studies for predicting the presence of emphysema-like changes (ELCs) detectable during surgery.
METHODS: Ninety-three PSP patients who underwent surgery from September 2005 to October 2009 were included in the study. We analyzed preoperative chest radiographic and computed tomographic (CT) findings, and compared the findings with intraoperative detection of ELCs. Chest radiographic findings were analyzed by classifying the PSP size into three categories: small, moderate, and complete.
RESULTS: Seventy-six of the 93 patients (82%) had ELCs detected during surgery. The size of the PSP on a radiograph was significantly correlated with the presence of ELCs (p=0.0121). Preoperative CT revealed 64 of the 76 ELCs (sensitivity, 84%; specificity, 100%; accuracy, 87%). Twenty-nine patients without ELCs detected by preoperative CT were analyzed separately. In this group, a larger PSP size also increased the likelihood of ELCs being present (p=0.0049). Seven patients (8%) experienced a recurrence after surgery. No factor could significantly predict recurrence.
CONCLUSIONS: Chest CT analysis alone was associated with a false-negative rate of about 15% for ELCs. Combining the analysis of chest radiographic and CT findings could improve sensitivity."
24238431,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24238431/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine if the right and the left testes migrate at the same time during the human fetal period.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We studied 164 human fetuses (328 testes) ranging in age from 12 to 35 weeks post-conception. The fetuses were carefully dissected with the aid of a stereoscopic lens at ×16/25. The abdomen and pelvis were opened to identify and expose the urogenital organs. Testicular position was classified as: (a) Abdominal, when the testis was proximal to the internal ring; (b) Inguinal, when it was found between the internal and external inguinal rings); and (c) Scrotal, when it was inside the scrotum.
RESULTS: The testes were abdominal in 71% of the cases, inguinal in 9.41%, and scrotal in 19.81%. There was asymmetry in testicular migration in nine cases (5.5%). In three of these nine cases, one testis was situated in the abdomen and the other in the inguinal canal; in another three one testis was situated in the abdomen and the other in the scrotum, and in the remaining three, one testis was in the inguinal canal and the other in the scrotum. In five of the nine cases of asymmetry, the right testis completed the migration first, but this was not statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: Asymmetry in testicular migration is a rare event, accounting for <6% of the cases. The right testis seems to complete migration first."
24238506,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24238506/,"BACKGROUND: There may be concerns over disbenefits to patients who have chosen to undergo laparoscopic gastrectomy by experts in open gastrectomy, considering the disparity between the level of proficiency in open gastrectomy, at which they are already experts, and that in laparoscopic gastrectomy, at which they are beginners. The aim of this study was to compare surgical radicality and outcomes between laparoscopic gastrectomy and open gastrectomy during the learning period of laparoscopic gastrectomy for a senior surgeon who was already an expert in open gastrectomy.
METHODS: Data of short-term surgical outcomes were obtained from patients following laparoscopy assisted distal gastrectomy (LADG) by a surgeon. The initial and following 30 experiences were grouped into LADG-I and LADG-II, respectively. Patients who underwent open distal subtotal gastrectomy (ODSG) and yet could have been candidates for LADG were grouped into ODSG. Known indicators of proficiency levels and the postoperative hospital course were compared. The consequences of extended lymphadenectomy, and the radicality of surgery by completing D2 lymphadenectomy were analyzed.
RESULTS: The LADG group revealed longer operation time and less bleeding compared to the ODSG group (P < 0.001). The number of retrieved lymph nodes and the rate of complications were not significantly different. In the LADG-I group, the D1+:D2 ratio was 4:1, showing significant differences from those in the LADG-II (0.36:1) and ODSG (0.16:1) groups (P < 0.001). The surgeon was able to complete D2 lymphadenectomy during LADG without significant change in the amount of bleeding and the rate of complications, but with a longer operation time (P = 0.009). The number of lymph nodes from the 12a station was not significantly different between the LADG and ODSG groups with D2 lymphadenectomy.
CONCLUSIONS: The surgical outcomes were comparable between LADG and ODSG even during the learning period of LADG, and the equivalence of radicality in lymphadenectomy was soon achieved. As long as the surgeon can accept a long operation time, an expert in open gastrectomy should not refrain from performing laparoscopic gastrectomy in well selected patients because of concerns about disbenefits to patients from choosing laparoscopic gastrectomy over open gastrectomy."
24238631,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24238631/,"OBJECTIVES: Abnormalities of signal transduction are considered among the susceptibility factors for bipolar disorder (BD). These include changes in G-protein-mediated signaling and subsequent modification of gene expression via transcription factors such as cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB).
METHODS: We investigated levels of CREB in lymphoblasts from patients with BD, all responders to lithium prophylaxis (n = 13), and healthy control subjects (n = 15). Phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) was measured by immunoblotting in subjects with BD (n = 15) as well as in their affected (n = 17) and unaffected (n = 18) relatives, and healthy controls (n = 16).
RESULTS: Basal CREB levels were comparable in patients and control subjects and were not changed by lithium treatment. pCREB levels were increased in both patients and their relatives compared to controls (p = 0.003). Forskolin stimulation led to a 24% increase in pCREB levels in cells from healthy subjects (p = 0.002) but not in the other three groups. When using basal and stimulated pCREB levels as a biochemical phenotype in a preliminary linkage study, we found the strongest support for linkage in regions largely overlapping with those showing linkage with the clinical phenotype (3p, 6p, 16p, 17q, 19q, and 21q).

The aim of this study was to compare three dimensional spatiotemporal, kinematic, and kinetic parameters during walking to examine whether MBs offer functional advantages over fixed bearing (FB) designs.
METHODS: Sixteen patients undergoing primary unilateral TKR surgery were randomised to receive either a FB (n=8) or MB (n=8) total knee prosthesis. Eight age and gender matched controls underwent the same protocol on one occasion. A 12 camera Vicon system integrated with four force plates was used. Patients were tested pre-surgery and nine months post-surgery.
RESULTS: No significant differences between FB and MB groups were found at any time point in the spatiotemporal parameters. The MB group was found to have a significantly reduced frontal plane knee range of motion (ROM) at pre-surgery than the FB group (FB=14.92±4.02°; MB=8.87±4.82°), with the difference not observed post-surgery. No further significant kinematic or kinetic differences were observed between FB and MB groups. Fixed bearing and MB groups both displayed spatiotemporal, kinematic, and kinetic differences when compared to controls. Fixed bearing and MB groups differed from controls in six and five parameters at nine months post-surgery, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: No functional advantages were found in knees implanted with MB prostheses during walking, with both groups indicative of similar differences when compared to normal knee biomechanics following prosthesis implantation.

METHODS: A total of 10,149 individuals took part in the implementation project of the national diabetes prevention program (FIN-D2D) conducted in primary health care setting in Finland. At baseline, altogether 2798 non-diabetic individuals participated in the one-year follow-up, and 2275 of them had at least one group or individual counseling visit.
RESULTS: 4.0% of the individuals (n=78) had depressive symptoms, while 96.0% (n=1889) were free of depressive symptoms at baseline. Individuals who had depressive symptoms had higher body mass index and waist circumference at baseline than individuals without depressive symptoms. In terms of changes in cardio-metabolic risk profile and glucose homeostasis the effectiveness of lifestyle counseling was parallel between individuals with and without depressive symptoms during the one-year follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Effectiveness of lifestyle counseling did not differ between individuals with and without depressive symptoms. Individuals with depressive symptoms should not be excluded from lifestyle intervention programs."
24238854,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24238854/,"INTRODUCTION: Most hospitals are faced with reduced personnel, resources, and provider fatigue or shift changes when day turns to night. For these reasons, some have suggested that diaphyseal femur fractures should be fixed during the daytime. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the time of surgery affects the post-operative difference in femoral version (DFV) and femoral length (DFL) between the fixed and uninjured sides following intramedullary nailing (IMN).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Over a 10-year period, 340 patients underwent IMN of a diaphyseal femur fracture (AO types 32-A to C) with a post-operative computed tomography scanogram for version measurement. Demographic and surgical data, including time operated was collected. ""Daytime"" was defined as 7:00 AM to 6:59 PM, while the remainder of the clock was ""nighttime"". Additionally, the night hours were split into 3 consecutive 4-h categories for further analysis. Stepwise, multivariate regressions were used to evaluate any effect of time of surgery on post-operative DFV or DFL. Other variables included in these statistical models were age, sex, mechanism of injury, open vs. closed fracture, trauma vs. non-trauma surgeon, and AO and Winquist classifications.
RESULTS: Overall, 22.4% (76/340) of all fractures were fixed at night. The mean post-operative DFV and DFL from the uninjured side in these patients was 8.9° and 4.1 mm, respectively, compared to 9.0° and 4.8 mm in those treated during the daytime. This difference was not statistically significant when accounting for other factors (p>0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in patients with >10 mm limb length discrepancy or >15 degrees DFV (p=1.0 for both).
CONCLUSION: The time of day at which diaphyseal femur fractures are treated does not have an impact on post-operative femoral version or length. While certain other injuries may be better handled during daytime hours, acceptable IMN of mid-shaft femur fractures may be achieved during all hours at a level 1 trauma centre."
24239014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24239014/,"BACKGROUND: Assisted living facilities (ALFs) provide housing and care to persons unable to live independently, and who often have increasing medical needs. Disease outbreaks illustrate challenges of maintaining adequate resident protections in these facilities.
OBJECTIVES: Describe current state laws on assisted living admissions criteria, medical oversight, medication administration, vaccination requirements, and standards for infection control training.
METHODS: We abstracted laws and regulations governing assisted living facilities for the 50 states using a structured abstraction tool. Selected characteristics were compared according to the time period in which the regulation took effect. Selected state health departments were queried regarding outbreaks identified in assisted living facilities.
RESULTS: Of the 50 states, 84% specify health-based admissions criteria to assisted living facilities; 60% require licensed health care professionals to oversee medical care; 88% specifically allow subcontracting with outside entities to provide routine medical services onsite; 64% address medication administration by assisted living facility staff; 54% specify requirements for some form of initial infection control training for all staff; 50% require reporting of disease outbreaks to the health department; 18% specify requirements to offer or require vaccines to staff; 30% specify requirements to offer or require vaccines to residents. Twelve states identified approximately 1600 outbreaks from 2010 to 2013, with influenza or norovirus infections predominating.
CONCLUSIONS: There is wide variation in how assisted living facilities are regulated in the United States. States may wish to consider regulatory changes that ensure safe health care delivery, and minimize risks of infections, outbreaks of disease, and other forms of harm among assisted living residents."
24239213,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24239213/,"BACKGROUND: Providing written medicine information to consumers enables them to make informed decisions about their medicines, playing an important role in educating and improving health literacy. In Australia, standardized written medicine information called Consumer Medicine Information (CMI) is available for medicines as package inserts, computer prints, or leaflets. Consumers want and read CMI, but may not always ask for it. General practitioners (GPs) and pharmacists are an important source of written medicine information, yet may not always provide CMI in their practice.
OBJECTIVE: To examine and compare the awareness, use and provision of CMI by consumers, pharmacists and general practitioners (GPs).
METHODS: Based on previous studies, structured questionnaires were developed and administered to a national sample of consumers (phone survey); community pharmacists and GPs (postal surveys) about utilization of CMI. Descriptive, comparative and logistic regression analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: The respondents comprised of 349 pharmacists, 181 GPs and 1000 consumers. Two-thirds of consumers, nearly all (99%) pharmacists and 90% of GPs were aware of CMI. About 88% of consumers reported receiving CMI as a package insert, however most pharmacists (99%) and GPs (56%) reported providing computer-generated CMI. GPs' and pharmacists' main reason for providing CMI was on patient request. Reasons for not providing were predominantly because consumers were already taking the medicine, concerns regarding difficulty understanding the information, or potential non-adherence. Of the 691 consumers reportedly reading CMI, 35% indicated concerns after reading. Factors associated with reading included gender, type of CMI received and frequency of provision.
CONCLUSION: Consumers want and read information about their medicines, especially when received from their GP or pharmacist. Healthcare professionals report usually discussing CMI when providing it to patients, although continued improvements in dissemination rates are desirable. Regular use of CMI remains a challenge, and ongoing strategies to promote CMI use are necessary to improve uptake of CMI in Australia."

METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of clinical records of patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis who underwent PBMV between November 1991 and March 2008. Follow-up was obtained by telephone interview and/or clinical records. The procedure was considered unsuccessful when post-procedure mitral valve area was <1.5 cm(2).
RESULTS: We analyzed 124 patients, 108 (87.1%) of them women. Mean age at the time of repair was 46 ± 11 years and mean follow-up time was 10 ± 4 years. Before the procedure, 100 patients (80.6%) had WS ≤ 8 and 24 (19.4%) were in the ""gray zone"" (>8 and <11). Patients with WS ≤ 8 and patients in the gray zone had similar ages at first intervention (45 ± 11 vs. 49 ± 11 years; p=0.095) and follow-up time (10 ± 4 vs. 11 ± 5 years; p=0.55). There were no differences between groups in gender (women: 86% vs. 92%; p=0.735), or in baseline echocardiographic measurements (mitral valve area by planimetry 1.0 cm(2) [P25-P75: 0.9-1.1] vs. 0.9 [P25-P75: 0.8-1.2], p=0.514; pulmonary artery systolic pressure 53 mmHg [P25-P75: 45-63] vs. 50 [P25-P75: 44-54], p=0.823]; left atrial diameter >55 mm [16.5% vs. 13.6%, p=1.00]; mitral regurgitation [46.5% vs. 37.5%, p=0.428]) or baseline transmitral gradient (13 mmHg [P25-P75: 10-19] vs. 13 mmHg [P25-P75: 7-20]). Improvements in mitral valve area by planimetry and in hemodynamic gradient were similar in the two groups (0.91 ± 0.39 cm(2) vs. 0.84 ± 0.44 cm(2), p=0.55; 8.8 ± 5.3 mmHg vs. 7.3 ± 5.9 mmHg, p=0.275, respectively). There were no significant differences in major complications or success rates (4.0 vs. 12.5 p=0.131; 89.9% vs. 95.8%, p=0.69) or in need for urgent surgery or future reintervention (2.0 vs. 8.3%, p=0.168; 22% vs. 27.3%, p=0.594). In-hospital mortality occurred only in patients in the WS gray zone (2 [8.3%] vs. 0%, p=0.04), one death (4.2% vs. 0%, p=0.194) possibly being related to a higher WS (secondary to stroke) and the other as a consequence of peripheral vascular complication. Improvements in NYHA functional class soon after the procedure and during follow-up were similar in the two groups. Total mortality was similar in the two groups (3.1 vs. 8.7%, p=0.244).
CONCLUSIONS: PBMV was a safe and effective procedure in patients in the WS gray zone. Optimal results can be achieved in these patients if they are carefully selected and operated at experienced centers."

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Indicators of feasibility included attendance rate, safety (adverse events, physical function, and pain), participants' perceptions of the intervention (level of difficulty of the exercises, motivation level, and appreciation), and efficacy of the intervention (balance performance assessed with the Mini-Balance Evaluation Systems Test [Mini-BESTest]).
RESULTS: The incidence rate was high (93%) for attendance and low (1.2%) for adverse events. Ratings by the participants indicated progression throughout the training period. All participants considered the training motivational and stated that they would recommend it to others. The efficacy of the intervention measured with the Mini-BESTest showed that 4 out of 5 participants improved their balance performance.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the overall feasibility of this novel balance program in older adults with mild to moderate PD. However, to further evaluate the efficacy of the program, a larger randomized controlled trial is required."
24239800,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24239800/,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Evidence supporting an association between obesity and low back pain (LBP) continues to grow; yet little is known about the cause and effect of this relationship. Even less is known about the mechanisms linking the two. Physical activity is a logical suspect, but no study has demonstrated its role.
PURPOSE: This study was designed to examine the interrelationship between physical activity, obesity, and LBP. The specific aims were to determine if obesity is a risk factor for LBP in the U.S. population, measure the strength of any observed association, and evaluate the role of physical activity in modulating this association.
STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: A cross-sectional U.S. population-based study.
PATIENT SAMPLE: A cohort of 6,796 adults from the 2003-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Demographic information, an in-depth health questionnaire, physical examination details, and 7-day free-living physical activity monitoring using accelerometry (ActiGraph AM-7164; ActiGraph, Pensacola, FL, USA).
METHODS: LBP status was determined by questionnaire response. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated during physical examination and divided here into four groups (normal weight <25, overweight 25-30, obese 31-35, and ultraobese 36+). Summary measures of physical activity were computed based on intensity cutoffs, percentile intensities, and bout. Demographics, social history, and comorbid health conditions were used to build adjusted weighted logistic regression models constructed using Akaike Information Criterion. All displayed estimates are significant at level <.05. No external funding was received to support this study. None of the authors report conflicts of interest directly related to the specific subject matter of this manuscript.
RESULTS: In the U.S. population, the risk of low LBP increases in step with BMI from 2.9% for normal BMI (20-25) to 5.2% for overweight (26-30), 7.7% for obese (31-35), and 11.6% for ultraobese (36+). Smoking is consistently the strongest predictor of LBP across the BMI spectrum (odds ratio 1.6-2.9). Physical activity also modulates these risks. In the overall model, the best physical activity predictors of LBP are in the moderate and high intensity ranges with small effects (odds ratio 0.98 and 0.996 per standard deviation increase, respectively). When broken down by BMI, time spent in sedentary and moderate activity ranges demonstrate more robust influences on LBP status in the overweight, obese, and ultraobese groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Increased BMI is a risk factor for back pain in Americans. More important, the role of physical activity in mitigating back pain risk is shown to be of greater consequence in the overweight and obese populations."
24241501,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24241501/,"OBJECTIVE: To examine which personality traits are associated with the new onset of chronic coronary heart disease (CHD) in psychiatric inpatients within 16 years after their initial evaluation. We theorized that personality measures of depression, anxiety, hostility, social isolation, and substance abuse would predict CHD development in psychiatric inpatients.
METHOD: We used a longitudinal database of psychological test data from 349 Veterans first admitted to a psychiatric unit between October 1, 1983, and September 30, 1987. Veterans Affairs and national databases were assessed to determine the development of new-onset chronic CHD over the intervening 16-year period.
RESULTS: New-onset CHD developed in 154 of the 349 (44.1%) subjects. Thirty-one psychometric variables from five personality tests significantly predicted the development of CHD. We performed a factor analysis of these variables because they overlapped and four factors emerged, with positive adaptive functioning the only significant factor (OR=0.798, p=0.038).
CONCLUSION: These results support previous research linking personality traits to the development of CHD, extending this association to a population of psychiatric inpatients. Compilation of these personality measures showed that 31 overlapping psychometric variables predicted those Veterans who developed a diagnosis of heart disease within 16 years after their initial psychiatric hospitalization. Our results suggest that personality variables measuring positive adaptive functioning are associated with a reduced risk of developing chronic CHD."
24241713,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24241713/,"OBJECTIVES: We assessed socioeconomic inequalities in relation to acute myocardial infarction (AMI) incidence among major ethnic groups in The Netherlands.
METHODS: A nationwide register-based cohort study was conducted (n=2 591 170) between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 2007 among ethnic Dutch and migrant groups from Suriname, Netherlands Antilles, Indonesia, Morocco and Turkey. Standardised household disposable income was used as a proxy for socioeconomic position. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the socioeconomic inequalities in AMI incidence.
RESULTS: Among ethnic Dutch, the AMI incidence was higher in the low-income group than in the high-income group: adjusted HRs were 2.05 (95% CI 2.00 to 2.10) for men and 2.33 (95% CI 2.23 to 2.43) for women. Importantly, similar socioeconomic inequalities in AMI incidence were also observed in all minority groups, with the low socioeconomic group having a higher AMI incidence than the high socioeconomic group: adjusted HR ranging from 2.07 (95% CI 1.26 to 3.40) in Moroccans to 2.73 (95% CI 1.55 to 4.80) in Antilleans in men; and from 2.17 (95% CI 1.74 to 2.71) in Indonesians to 3.88 (95% CI 2.36 to 6.38) in Turks in women.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate socioeconomic inequalities in AMI incidence in migrant groups and suggest a convergence towards the Dutch general population. If the AMI incidence rates of the low socioeconomic group could be reduced to the level of the high socioeconomic group, this would represent a major public health improvement for all ethnic groups."
24241964,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24241964/,"INTRODUCTION: The impact of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease on outcomes following major abdominal surgery is not well defined.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 2008 NSQIP database was queried to identify adult patients undergoing complex abdominal surgery (major colorectal, hepatobiliary, pancreatic, gastric, and esophageal operations). Thirty-day morbidity and mortality in patients on hemodialysis (HD) versus patients not on HD were compared. The impact of preoperative renal insufficiency, measured by glomerular filtration rate (GFR), on morbidity and mortality was then assessed in non-dialysis patients.
RESULTS: Of 24,572 patients who underwent major abdominal operations, excluding emergency cases, only 149 (0.6%) were on HD preoperatively. Thirty-day mortality in the HD group was 12.8% compared to 1.8% for those not on HD (p < 0.0001). Overall complication rate was 23.5 versus 12.3% (p < 0.0001). In particular, rates of pneumonia (6.7 vs 3.0%, p < 0.05) and sepsis (12.8 vs 5.3%, p < 0.001) were higher in patients on HD. In patients not on HD, GFR was significantly predictive of postoperative mortality after controlling for age, gender, race, emergency status, and comorbidities. Compared to patients with normal preoperative kidney function (GFR, 75-90 ml/min/1.73 m(2)), even modest CKD (GFR, 45-60 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) was associated with increased postoperative mortality (odds ratio (OR), 1.62). With greater impairment in kidney function, postoperative mortality was even more marked (GFR, 30-45 ml/min/1.73 m(2) and OR, 2.84; GFR, 15-30 ml/min/1.73 m(2) and OR, 5.56). In addition, CKD was independently associated with increased postoperative complications.
CONCLUSION: Any degree of preoperative kidney impairment, even mild asymptomatic disease, is associated with clinically significant increases in 30-day postoperative morbidity and mortality following major abdominal surgery."
24242990,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24242990/,"PURPOSE: Complete oocyte lysis in in vitro fertilization (IVF) is a rare event, but one against which we remain helpless. The recurrence of this phenomenon in some women in each of their IVF attempts, regardless of treatment, together with the results of animal experiments led us to investigate the possible involvement of the genes encoding for the glycoproteins constituting the zona pellucida (ZP).
PATIENTS & METHODS: Over the last ten years, during which we treated over 500 women each year, three women suffered recurrent oocyte lysis during their IVF attempts in our Centre for Reproductive Biology. For each of these three cases, we sequenced the four genes and promoter sequences encoding the glycoproteins of the ZP. The sequence variations likely to cause a change in protein expression or structure, were investigated in a control group of 35 women who underwent IVF without oocyte lysis and with normal rates of fertilization.
RESULTS & CONCLUSION: We found no mutations in the ZP genes sequenced. Only some polymorphisms present in the control group and in the general population were detected, excluding their specific involvement in the phenotype observed. Thus, although we suspected that complete oocyte lysis was due to a genetic cause, it did not seem possible to directly incriminate the genes encoding the proteins of the ZP in the observed phenotype. Further study of the genes involved in the processing and organization of ZP glycoproteins may allow elucidation of the mechanism underlying recurrent oocyte lysis during in vitro fertilization."
24242991,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24242991/,"PURPOSE: Portable polysomnography (PSG) and cardiorespiratory polygraphy are increasingly being used in the assessment of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) in heart failure patients. Scoring of SDB from cardiorespiratory polygraphy recordings is based only on respiratory signals, while electroencephalographic, electrooculographic and electromyographic channels are taken into account when using PSG recordings. The aim of this study was to assess the agreement between these two scoring methods.
METHODS: An overnight sleep study was performed in 67 heart failure patients using a standard portable polysomnograph. Each recording was scored twice, once using all acquired signals (PSG mode) and, after a median of 64 days, using only respiratory signals (cardiorespiratory mode). Agreement was assessed by Bland-Altman analysis and Cohen's kappa.
RESULTS: We found that (1) more respiratory events were detected using cardiorespiratory analysis [median (25th percentile, 75th percentile), 75 (39, 200) events] compared to analysis of portable PSG [69 (29, 173) events, p < 0.0001], the extra events being, for the vast majority, central in origin; (2) the apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) estimated by cardiorespiratory polygraphy [11.9 (5.7, 30.8)/h] showed a negligible negative bias relative to portable PSG [15.1 (5.7, 33.6)/h; bias, -0.8 (-2.9, 0.4)/h, p = 0.0002]; (3) limits of agreement between the two systems (-6.2/h, 1.7/h) were much smaller than those previously observed between two nights using the same scoring modality; and (4) the kappa coefficient using categorised AHI was 0.89 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82, 0.96).
CONCLUSIONS: We found a high degree of agreement between the AHIs obtained from the two scoring methods, thus suggesting that cardiorespiratory polygraphy may be used as an alternative to portable PSG in the assessment of SDB in heart failure patients."
24243919,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24243919/,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of abiraterone, cabazitaxel, and enzalutamide compared to placebo for treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A decision-tree model compared three treatment options for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients over 18 months from a societal perspective in 2012 USD. Chance nodes included baseline pain as a severity indicator, significant adverse effects (neutropenia, cardiac events, or seizures), and survival. Probabilities, survival rates, and health utilities were from clinical trials (COU-AA, TROPIC, and AFFIRM) and other published studies. Survival of enzalutamide was adjusted to match placebo groups across trials. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses, acceptability curves and net benefit calculations were performed.
RESULTS: Abiraterone was the most cost-effective of the treatments ($123.4 K/quality-adjusted life year) compared to placebo, enzalutamide was $437.6 K/quality-adjusted life year compared to abiraterone, and cabazitaxel was $351.9 K/quality-adjusted life year compared to enzalutamide. Enzalutamide and cabazitaxel were not cost-effective compared to placebo at $154.3 K/quality-adjusted life year and $163.2 K/quality-adjusted life year, respectively. Acceptability curves showed abiraterone was cost-effective 29.3% of the time with a willingness to pay threshold of $100 K. The model was sensitive to changes in cost of the drugs, life expectancy, and survival rate. Sensitivity analysis shows that enzalutamide can become the most cost-effective option if the price of the medication decreased by 26% and other drug costs remained the same.
CONCLUSION: Based on the cost-effective analysis, and survival adjustments necessary to match placebo groups, we would recommend abiraterone for treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer despite not quite falling under the usually accepted willingness to pay threshold. Further analysis should examine comparative survival across the three drugs."
24243999,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24243999/,"BACKGROUND: There has been little investigation of changes in socioeconomic measures and mental health (MH)/illness over time within individuals using methods that control for time-invariant unobserved confounders. We investigate whether changes in multiple socioeconomic measures are associated with self-reported MH using fixed effects methods to control for unobserved time-invariant confounding.
METHODS: Data from three waves of a panel study with information on MH, psychological distress, labour force status, household income, area and individual deprivation. Fixed effects regression modelling was used to explore whether changes in socioeconomic exposures were associated with changes in MH. We also compared increases and decreases in exposure with changes in MH using first difference models.
RESULTS: Respondents who moved into inactive labour force status experienced a 1.34 unit (95% CI -1.85 to -0.82) decline in SF-36 MH score and a 0.50 unit (95% CI 0.34 to 0.67) increase in psychological distress score. An increase in individual deprivation was associated with a 1.47 unit (95% CI -1.67 to -1.28) decline in MH score and a 0.57 unit (95% CI 0.51 to 0.63) increase in psychological distress. Increasing and decreasing levels of individual deprivation were associated with significant changes in both outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: This paper suggests that moving from employment to inactivity and changes in levels of individual deprivation may be more important for short-term MH outcomes than changes in household income or area deprivation. Providing short-term social and economic support for those experiencing financial/material hardship should be considered in interventions to reduce inequalities in MH."
24244332,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24244332/,"BACKGROUND: In dementia screening, most studies have focused on early cognitive impairment by comparing patients suffering from mild dementia or mild cognitive impairment with normal subjects. Few studies have focused on modifications over time of the cognitive function in the healthy elderly. The objective of the present study was to analyze the cognitive function changes of two different samples, born > 15 years apart.
METHOD: A first sample of 204 cognitively normal participants was recruited in the memory clinic of Broca hospital between 1991 and 1997. A second sample of 177 cognitively normal participants was recruited in 2008-2009 in the same institution. Both samples were from the same districts of Paris and were assessed with the same neuropsychological test battery. Mean cognitive test scores were compared between 1991 and 2008 samples, between < 80 years old and ≥ 80 years old in 1991 and 2008 samples, and finally between subjects < 80 year old of 1991 sample and subjects ≥ 80 years old of the 2008 sample. Means were compared with T-tests stratified on gender, age-groups and educational level.
RESULTS: Cognitive scores were significantly higher in the 2008 sample. Participants < 80 years old outperformed those ≥ 80 in both samples. However, participants < 80 years old in 1991 sample and subjects ≥ 80 in the 2008 sample, born on average in 1923, performed mostly identically.
CONCLUSION: This study showed a significant increase of cognitive scores over time. Further, contemporary octogenarians in the later sample performed like septuagenarians in the former sample. These findings might be consistent with the increase in life expectancy and life span in good health. The study highlights the necessity to take into account factors which may contaminate and artificially inflate the age-related differences in favor of younger to the older adults."

METHODS: Twenty-three patients were examined with 3.0 T MR. Two reviewers were recruited for MR images evaluation. Image features were recorded in terms of (1) the injury degree of CET; (2) associated injuries in the elbow joint. Spearman's rank correlation analysis was performed to analyze the relationships between the injury degree of CET and associated abnormalities of the elbow joint, correlations were considered significant at p<0.05.
RESULTS: Total 24 elbows in 23 patients were included. Various degrees of injuries were found in total 24 CETs (10 mild, 7 moderate and 7 severe). Associated abnormalities were detected in accompaniments of the elbow joints including ligaments, tendons, saccussynovialis and muscles. A significantly positive correlation (r = 0.877,p<0.01) was found in injuries of CET and lateral ulnar collateral ligament (LUCL).
CONCLUSION: Injury of the CET is not an isolated lesion for lateral picondylitis, which is mostly accompanied with other abnormalities, of which the LUCL injury is the most commonly seen in lateral epicondylitis, and there is a positive correlation between the injury degree in CET and LUCL."
24245840,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24245840/,"OBJECTIVE: Nocturia (nocturnal awakenings associated with urination) is so common a nocturnal behavior that its association with poor sleep is often overlooked. This study examined nocturia and its potential role in poor sleep by examining reported nightly awakenings and associated bathroom trips.
METHODS: Sleep diaries were kept by 119 adults with poor sleep for intervals up to 14 days. Diaries collected data on nightly number of awakenings and nightly number of bathroom trips. The proportion of nocturnal awakenings accompanied by voiding for each night was calculated and averaged within each individual. Demographics and various health conditions were examined in relation to this measure.
RESULTS: Nocturia was defined when at least two-thirds of all awakenings were associated with nocturnal voiding. Absence of nocturia was defined when less than one-third of awakenings were associated with voiding. Remaining cases were defined as having possible nocturia. Estimates of nocturia derived from prestudy screening were related to nocturia as defined by sleep diaries. Neither gender nor sleep apnea was associated with nocturia. Unadjusted analyses indicated that individuals with nocturia were more likely to have arthritis and attribute their nighttime awakenings to urge to void than individuals without nocturia.
CONCLUSIONS: Nocturia is an exceedingly common phenomenon and may be associated with multiple morbidities. RESULTS are discussed in terms of causality and whether the perceived urge to void precedes or follows nocturnal awakening. Correlates of nocturia have important implications, because they can inform interventions that target brain (e.g., cognitive-behavioral treatments for insomnia, sedative/hypnotic medications) versus bladder (e.g., bladder control exercises, medications affecting urine production or urgency)."
24245842,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24245842/,"OBJECTIVE: Two studies examined whether people are aware of social influences on food intake, and whether recognition of those influences is driven by the observation of mimicked eating and/or matching the amount of food eaten.
METHOD: In Study 1, participants watched a video of 1 person eating alone, or a video of 2 people eating together that varied in the extent to which the target's eating behavior mimicked or matched that of the model. Participants then made attributions for the eating behavior of the target person. In Study 2, each participant watched a video of herself eating with a confederate and made attributions for her own eating behavior. In both studies, the outcome of interest was the extent to which each participant acknowledged the influence of the model's eating behavior on the target's (or her own) food intake.
RESULTS: In Study 1, participants accurately recognized social influences on the food intake of the target person, and this recognition was facilitated by the presence of mimicked eating, but not by matching the total amount eaten. Study 2 showed that the extent to which people acknowledge social influences on their own food intake depended on their self-reported general responsiveness to social cues on eating.
CONCLUSION: Overall, people seem to be aware that social factors can influence others' food intake. Whereas some people (high social eaters) are able to accurately report social influences on their own food intake, others (low social eaters) seem to deny those influences for reasons that merit future investigation."
24245928,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24245928/,"OBJECTIVE: Children with temporal lobe epilepsy are at risk for deficits in new learning (episodic memory) and literacy skills. Semantic memory deficits and double dissociations between episodic and semantic memory have recently been found in this patient population. In the current study we investigate whether impairments of these 2 distinct memory systems relate to literacy skills.
METHOD: 57 children with unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy completed tests of verbal memory (episodic and semantic) and literacy skills (reading and spelling accuracy, and reading comprehension).
RESULTS: For the entire group, semantic memory explained over 30% of variance in each of the literacy domains. Episodic memory explained a significant, but rather small proportion (< 10%) of variance in reading and spelling accuracy, but not in reading comprehension. Moreover, when children with opposite patterns of specific memory impairments (intact semantic/impaired episodic, intact episodic/impaired semantic) were compared, significant reductions in literacy skills were evident only in children with semantic memory impairments, but not in children with episodic memory impairments relative to the norms and to children with temporal lobe epilepsy who had intact memory.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides the first evidence for differential relations between episodic and semantic memory impairments and literacy skills in children with temporal lobe epilepsy. As such, it highlights the urgent need to consider semantic memory deficits in management of children with temporal lobe epilepsy and undertake further research into the nature of reading difficulties of children with semantic memory impairments."
24245964,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24245964/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine if external cephalic version (ECV) can be performed with safety and efficacy in women with previous caesarean section.
DESIGN: Prospective comparative cohort study.
SETTING: Cruces University Hospital (Spain).
POPULATION: Single pregnancy with breech presentation at term.
METHODS: We compared 70 ECV performed in women with previous caesarean section with 387 ECV performed in multiparous women (March 2002 to June 2012).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Success rate, complications of the ECV and caesarean section rate.
RESULTS: The success rate of ECV in women after previous caesarean section was 67.1% versus 66.1% in multiparous women (P = 0.87). The logistic regression analysis confirmed this result (odds ratio 0.93, 95% CI 0.52-1.68; P = 0.82) adjusted by the variables associated with success of ECV. There were no complications in the previous caesarean section cohort. The vaginal delivery rate in the previous caesarean section cohort was 52.8% versus 74.9% in the multiparous cohort (P < 0.01). There were no cases of uterine rupture.
CONCLUSION: Based on our data, we conclude that complications are uncommon with ECV in women with previous caesarean section, with a success rate comparable to that of multiparous women. Uterine scar should not be considered a contraindication and ECV should be offered to women with previous caesarean section with breech presentation at term."
24245982,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24245982/,"BACKGROUND: Length of stay (LoS) following elective surgery is being reported as an outcomes quality measure. Regional referral centres may care for patients travelling significant distances. The effect of travel distance on LoS in pancreatic surgery patients was examined.
METHODS: National Surgical Quality Improvement Program data on pancreatic surgery patients, operated during the period from 2005 to 2011, were reviewed. Demographics, surgical variables and distance travelled were analysed relative to LoS. The LoS was log-transformed in general linear models to achieve normality.
RESULTS: Of the 243 patients, 53% were male. The mean ± standard deviation (SD) age of the total patient sample was 60.6 ± 14 years. The mean ± SD distance travelled was 203 ± 319 miles (326.7 ± 513.4 km) [median: 132 miles (212.4 km); range: 3-3006 miles (4.8-4837.7 km)], and the mean ± SD LoS was 10.5 ± 7 days (range: 1-46 days). Univariate analysis showed a near significant increase in LoS with increased distance travelled (P = 0.05). Significant variables related to LoS were: age (P = 0.002); relative value units (P < 0.001), and preoperative American Society of Anesthesiologists class (P = 0.005). In a general linear model, for every 100 miles (160.9 km) travelled there is an associated 2% increase in LoS (P = 0.031). When the distance travelled is increased by 500 miles (804.7 km), LoS increases by 10.5%.
CONCLUSIONS: Increased travel distance from a patient's home to the hospital was independently associated with an increase in LoS. If LoS is a reportable quality measure in pancreatic surgery, travel distance should be considered in risk adjustments."
24246243,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24246243/,"OBJECTIVES: Smoking plays major role in development of vascular and respiratory serious diseases. It has been reported that negative smoker children are prone for conductive hearing impairment due to repeated attacks of Eustachian tube dysfunction and middle ear effusion. This study aims to identify negative smoking as potential risk factor for development of sensorineural hearing loss.
STUDY: This study was done between January 2010 and November 2012. 411 children aged 5-11 years (8.2 ± 1.5) participated in this study; they were children attending the Ear, Nose, and Throat clinic of a tertiary care hospital and their siblings. The inclusion criteria were: (i) normal speech and language, (ii) absence of any disease or condition that may cause sensorineural hearing loss, and (iii) normal middle ear function on the day of hearing assessment. They were divided into three groups according to the exposure to second-hand smoke at home; group of ""no exposure"" whereas no smoker in the family (131 children), group of 'mild exposure"" whereas the father was the only smoking parent and smoking was prohibited at home (155 children), and group of ""heavy exposure"", whereas the mother was smoking, or the father was freely smoking at home and in the presence of his children (125 children). Audiological evaluation in the form of pure tone and speech audiometry and immitancemetry was done for the study group.
RESULTS: Audiological evaluation revealed that the prevalence of hearing loss was 3.8%, 4.5% and 12% in the ""no exposure"", ""mild exposure"", and ""heavy exposure"" groups, respectively. Significant difference was only detected between the high exposure group and the other two groups. All children had minimal sensorineural hearing loss, i.e. threshold of frequencies showing hearing loss was 20 or 25 dB HL. The risk ratios (95% confidence interval) for hearing loss in the study subgroups were 1.18 (0.38, 3.64) for mild exposure group (p>0.05), 3.14 (1.18, 8.3) for heavy exposure group (p<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Passive smoking in childhood correlates with sensorineural hearing loss, and it is an important risk factor for development of minimal hearing loss. Strict prevention of children exposure to second-hand smoke should be encouraged by every mean."
24246260,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24246260/,"BACKGROUND: Thyroglossal duct cysts (TGDCs) are common in children but also present in adults. This study evaluates the preoperative management and postoperative outcomes in patients with a resected TGDC.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on patients with a surgically treated TGDC. Clinicopathologic variables and treatment outcomes were obtained by chart review.
RESULTS: A total of 79 patients (44 pediatric and 35 adult) were identified. The majority of patients in both groups presented with a neck mass. Compared with children, adults were significantly more likely to undergo preoperative imaging and fine-needle aspiration biopsy. Malignancy was not identified in any patient on preoperative workup or postoperative pathology.
CONCLUSIONS: Adults with a TGDC are more likely to undergo preoperative imaging and biopsy. The infrequent occurrence of TGDC cancer or concurrent thyroid pathology suggests that the diagnosis of a TGDC may be made on clinical grounds in adult patients although ultrasound (±fine-needle aspiration biopsy) may be a useful supplementary modality."
24246283,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24246283/,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to determine specific obstetrical and neonatal complications associated with diet-treated gestational diabetes (DTGD) and medically treated gestational diabetes (MTGD).
METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study of women followed in the Robert Debré Hospital (France, Paris) and who have given birth between 1 January, 2004, and 19 November, 2010. Clinical, biological, maternal and neonatal data were reported in the maternity database. Associations between obstetrical and neonatal complications and gestational diabetes were evaluated by estimating odd ratios (ORs) and their 95% CIs, using a logistic regression model.
RESULTS: 16,244 pregnancies were included in the study. 1515 (9.3%) women had gestational diabetes: 1108 (7.3%) had DTGD, 243 (1.7%) had MTGD. After full adjustment, MTGD was associated with an increased risk of nonscheduled cesarean (ORnonscheduled=2.3; 95% CI: 1.6-3.3; P<0.001) while DTGD was not (ORnonscheduled=1.0; 95% CI: 0.8-1.3; P<0.96). Clinical macrosomia was positively associated with DTGD (OR=2; 95% CI: 1.7-2.4; P<0.0001) or MTGD (OR=2.9; 95% CI: 2.1-3.9; P<0.0001).
CONCLUSION: This study confirms that macrosomia is the main complication of DTGD. By contrast, DTGD was not associated with neonatal hypoglycemia and cesarean, while these complications were associated with MTGD."
24246322,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24246322/,"OBJECTIVE: To report our experience with the diagnosis and management of coexisting ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) and ureterovesical junction obstruction (UVJO).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Among the pediatric patients who underwent pyeloplasty or ureteroneocystostomy from 2003-2012, 15 patients were diagnosed with coexisting UPJO and UVJO. We retrospectively analyzed their medical records.
RESULTS: Of the 15 patients with coexisting UPJO and UVJO, the correct diagnosis was made preoperatively in 10 patients (66.7%). In 4 other patients, only UPJO was diagnosed, and in 1 patient, only UVJO was diagnosed. The decision of where to initially operate was determined from the combined results of the preoperative antegrade evaluation and retrograde ureteropyelography. Pyeloplasty was the initial surgical management choice for 9 patients, and ureteroneocystostomy was the initial surgical approach in 5 patients. In 1 patient, both pyeloplasty and ureteroneocystostomy were performed simultaneously. Of the 9 patients who underwent initial pyeloplasty, additional ureteroneocystostomy was required in 2. Additional pyeloplasty was required in 2 of the 5 patients who initially underwent ureteroneocystostomy.
CONCLUSION: It is often difficult to correctly diagnose coexisting UPJO and UVJO. In patients with UPJO, it is highly recommended that retrograde ureteropyelography be performed before pyeloplasty to evaluate the distal ureter-ureterovesical junction. Initial pyeloplasty is not always recommended as a first-line therapy."
24246345,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24246345/,"OBJECTIVE: To establish the prevalence of reliable self-monitored blood glucose (r-SMBG) data at office visits for diabetes and to determine whether r-SMBG is associated with changes in glycemic control and other clinical parameters.
METHODS: We conducted a chart review of 500 patients followed in an Endocrinology Faculty/Commercial Insurance Practice (FP) or a Managed Medicare/Medicaid Diabetes Clinic (MDC). Follow-up visits for patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes from January 1, 2012 to June 30, 2012 were analyzed for anthropometric data, creatinine (Cr), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), medications, hemoglobin A1C (A1C), change in A1C from the previous visit (ΔA1C), and availability of r-SMBG data at the visit.
RESULTS: Our sample was composed of 215 MDC patients (43%) and 285 FP patients (57%). Overall, 151 patients (30%) provided r-SMBG data at their visit, with no difference between MDC or FP patients. Mean A1C at MDC was 9.1%, while mean A1C at FP was 7.9% (P<.001). MDC patients with A1C >8.0% demonstrated an A1C reduction of 1.2% if they provided r-SMBG, compared to an increase of 0.1% for MDC patients who did not (P<.05). Providing r-SMBG did not affect A1C in FP patients in any A1C range.
CONCLUSION: Only a minority of diabetes patients, mostly insulin-treated, made r-SMBG data available to their providers. Insulin-requiring Managed Medicare/Medicaid patients with poorly controlled diabetes had an A1c reduction associated with r-SMBG. Prospective studies are needed to determine whether this patient population may be more likely to benefit from r-SMBG at their visits."

Determine whether stress in preterm infants, measured with salivary cortisol, decreases after five days of Kangaroo Care (KC) compared to five days of Standard Care (SC). 2. To determine whether kangaroo care provides sustainable pain relief beyond the period of skin-to-skin holding.
STUDY DESIGN: Preterm infants (n = 38) born at 27-30 weeks gestational age were randomized to either the KC or the SC group and received the allocated intervention starting on day of life (DOL) five and continuing for five days. Salivary cortisol was collected on DOL five and again on DOL ten. Differences were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA and t tests. Pain during nasal suctioning over five days was assessed using the Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP).
RESULT: 1. Adequate saliva samples for salivary cortisol were collected for 13 KC infants and 11 SC infants. There was no main effect of group (p = 0.49), but there was a significant main effect of age (DOL five versus DOL ten), with salivary cortisol levels decreasing in both groups (p = 0.02). 2. Pain scores for both groups (n = 38) indicted mild to moderate pain during suctioning, with no significant difference in pain scores between groups.
CONCLUSION: 1. KC did not affect salivary cortisol levels in preterm neonates, but levels in both the KC and SC groups decreased over time from DOL five to ten. Salivary cortisol may vary with age of infant. 2. Infants experience pain during routine suctioning and may require pain management."
24246515,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24246515/,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the association between early enteral feeding and the incidence of hypoglycemia in SGA neonates.
STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review to evaluate the association of hypoglycemia and early enteral feeding was performed. Eligible patients were born full-term between 1/1/2008-7/1/2011 and classified as SGA (birth weight <10th percentile). We collected the first two serum glucose values, time to enteral feeds and feeding type. The primary outcome was incidence of hypoglycemia, defined as serum glucose values ≤35 mg/dL (1.9 mmol/L).
RESULTS: 203 infants were included in the analysis. 94 patients were fed between the first and second glucose measurement and 109 were not. Although the incidence of hypoglycemia was greater in the group that received early enteral feeds (13% versus 4%; p = 0.02), feeding was not a significant predictor of the second serum glucose in a multivariable regression model (p = 0.078).
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that early enteral feeding does not predict hypoglycemia in this cohort of SGA neonates."
24246596,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24246596/,"BACKGROUND: Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) is a self- limited increase in the work of breathing in near- and full-term infants; it is attributed to a delay in the clearance of alveolar fluids. Prophylactic antibiotics are usually administered until blood cultures are reported negative for 48 hours.
OBJECTIVES: To prospectively compare outcomes of infants presented with classic TTN who were treated with or denied from intravenous antibiotics.
METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted on all infants admitted with classic TTN. Pre-set diagnostic criteria for classic TTN were applied in order to exclude other cases presenting with respiratory distress. Infants with classic TTN were stratified into two groups based on whether they received or did not receive antibiotics. The decision to administer antibiotics solely depended upon the style of the covering physician at the time of admission to the NICU. The following investigations were obtained from infants of both groups: blood culture, C-reactive protein, complete blood count, blood gas profile and chest X-ray.
RESULTS: A total of 15146 full-term infants were delivered during the study period; of them 923 were admitted to the NICU. Classic TTN was diagnosed in 168 infants; of them 106 (63%) received and 62 (37%) did not receive antibiotics. Two infants in the treated group and an infant in the non-treated group had microbiologically confirmed bacteremia. Infants in the treatment group stayed longer in the hospital (72 ± 6 vs. 48 ± 3 hrs). No recorded cases required readmission in either group.
CONCLUSIONS: With the application of strict criteria for classic TTN and the close observation in the NICU, the empiric use of antibiotics may be avoidable. Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the feasibility and safety of such approach."
24247226,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24247226/,"BACKGROUND: Ropivacaine is a long-acting local anesthetic used for continuous peripheral nerve catheter infusions. Catheters may remain in situ for prolonged time periods. In the present study, patients were enrolled to receive continuous peripheral nerve catheters with measurement of free serum ropivacaine concentrations.
METHODS: Peripheral nerve catheters were placed for postoperative pain management in trauma patients and infused with ropivacaine 0.2% or bolused with 0.5%. Blood samples were obtained from each subject on days 0 (preinfusion), 3, 5, 7, 10, and every third day until catheter removal. Serum free ropivacaine concentrations were measured via high-performance liquid chromatography and were compared using the Wilcoxon signed rank test.
RESULTS: One hundred thirty-three blood samples were analyzed in 35 patients; all serum free ropivacaine concentrations after infusion initiation (99 samples from 35 subjects) were below 0.34 mg/L (previously determined toxic threshold). The highest concentration achieved in a blood sample was 0.19 mg/L; all other values were <0.09 mg/L. The total amount of drug received during the study ranged from 1146 to 22,320 mg (median of 3722 mg). Catheters remained in situ for a median of 7 days (range: 3-23). From day 0 to 3 (preinfusion), 77% of the study participants had an increase in the serum free-fraction ropivacaine concentrations. The median concentration on day 3 was 0.025 mg/L (95% upper confidence limit for mean: 0.05, range: <0.01-0.19); P < 0.001 compared with preinfusion levels). From day 3 to 5, 68% of the participants had a decrease in the serum free ropivacaine concentrations (median level 0.016 mg/L [95% upper confidence limit for mean: 0.021] P = 0.007 for day 5 compared with day 3).
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, free serum ropivacaine concentrations remained well below toxic values despite large amounts of drug administration in combat-wounded patients. The administration of continuous ropivacaine infusions over prolonged time periods, coupled with multiple drug boluses, did not produce toxic or near-toxic serum concentrations."

The secondary objective is to describe the rate of concordance of propofol use with the PICU local practice of a maximum mean rate of 4 mg/kg/hr and a maximum duration of 24 hours and to assess for signs and symptoms of propofol infusion syndrome.
DESIGN: Retrospective descriptive cohort study.
SETTING: PICU of a tertiary care teaching hospital and referral hospital for the Western Canada.
PATIENTS: Children 1 month to 17 years old who received a nonprocedural propofol infusion between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2009.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-three infusions (representing 210 unique patients) were included in the study. The median average infusion rate (interquartile range) including boluses was 2.7 mg/kg/hr (1.9-3.6 mg/kg/hr), and the mean infusion duration (SD) was 10.3 hours (6.7 hr). Eighty-seven percent and 98% of infusions were concordant with PICU intensivists self-reported practice maximum rate and duration, respectively. No cases of propofol-related infusion syndrome or deaths associated with propofol infusions were identified.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of propofol infusions was in concordance with PICU local practice, and propofol infusion syndrome did not developed in patients. In agreement with previous recommendations, propofol infusions in the PICU appear to be safe when limiting doses to 4 mg/kg/hr and for less than 24 hours; however, appropriate monitoring of adverse effects is still warranted due to absence of robust evidence."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The cross-sectional national-level study was carried out. Quality of life was evaluated with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 and the Visual Analogue Scale. Illness perceptions were measured by the revised Illness Perception Questionnaire.
RESULTS: The response rate was 77.1% (N=501). The variation in global quality of life was explained (32.0%) by levels of emotional representation (β=-0.126; P=0.023) and consequences (β=-0.209; P<0.01); physical functioning (27.0%), by consequences (β=-0.203; P<0.01) and chemotherapy (β=-2.911; P=0.007); role functioning (37.0%), by emotional representations (β=-0.198; P<0.01), timeline cyclical (β=-0.209; P=0.014), and stage of the disease (β=-0.779; P=0.007); emotional functioning (43.0%), by emotional representations (β=-0.361; P<0.01) and education level (β=-0.566; P=0.025); cognitive functioning (34.0%), by educational level (β=0.714; P=0.005), emotional representations (β=-0.118; P=0.019), illness coherence (β=-0.167; P=0.030), consequences (β=-0.187; P=0.001), and hormonal therapy (β=-0.778; P=0.049); and social functioning (39.0%), by consequences (β=-0.320; P<0.01) and combined treatment (β=-1.492; P=0.016).
CONCLUSIONS: Illness perceptions may be important while investigating quality of life in patients with prostate cancer. It may underlie quality-of-life differences in this group of patients and could inform decision makers about the importance of the provision of psychosocial services to patients with prostate cancer."

OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to test whether vitamin D supplementation increases muscle strength and power compared with placebo.
DESIGN: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
SETTING: The setting was immigrants' activity centers.
PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred fifty-one healthy adult males and females aged 18-50 years with non-Western immigrant background performed the baseline test and 86% returned to the follow-up test.
INTERVENTIONS: Sixteen weeks of daily supplementation with 25 μg (1000 IU) vitamin D3, 10 μg (400 IU) vitamin D3, or placebo.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Difference in jump height between pre- and postintervention. Secondary outcomes were differences in handgrip strength and chair-rising test.
RESULTS: Percentage change in jump height did not differ between those receiving vitamin D (25 or 10 μg vitamin D3) and those receiving placebo (mean difference -1.4%, 95% confidence interval: -4.9% to 2.2%, P=.44). No significant effect was detected in the subgroup randomized to 25 μg vitamin D or in other preplanned subgroup analyses nor were there any significant differences in handgrip strength or the chair-rising test.

24248185,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24248185/,"CONTEXT: An increasing body of evidence indicates that human labor, either term or preterm, is an inflammatory event. CRH has been implicated to be a trigger of human parturition.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether CRH induces the cascades of inflammation in human pregnant myometrium, thereby leading to activation of uterus.
DESIGN: The myometrial tissues were obtained from pregnant women who were in labor or not in labor at term. The output of cytokines and prostaglandins (PGs) was determined by Multiplex and ELISA. Western blot analysis was used to determine the levels of uterine activation proteins (UAPs).
RESULTS: The levels of chemokines and cytokines as well as activated nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) were increased in the term labor group more than the not term labor group. CRH stimulated production of a number of chemokines and cytokines in cultured uterine smooth muscle cells (USMCs), which induced chemotaxis of monocytes. These effects were mediated by CRH receptor 1 (CRHR1) and dependent on adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase (PKA) and NF-κB signaling. Cocultures of CRH-treated USMCs with monocytes greatly enhanced the output of cytokines and chemokines as well as PGs in cultures and increased the expression of uterine activation proteins (UAPs) in USMCs. IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α stimulated the expression of UAPs and output of PGs in USMCs.
CONCLUSIONS: CRH induces the production of chemokines and cytokines in myometrium at term and subsequently results in the cascade of inflammation in uterus. The inflammation induced by CRH can lead to activation of uterus."
24248589,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24248589/,"BACKGROUND: Because of the changing referral patterns, operative pediatric supracondylar humerus fractures are increasingly being treated at tertiary referral centers. To expedite patient flow, type II fractures are sometimes pinned in a delayed manner. We sought to determine if delay in surgical treatment of modified Gartland type II supracondylar humerus fractures would affect the rate of complications following closed reduction and percutaneous pinning.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of a consecutive series of 399 modified Gartland type II supracondylar fractures treated operatively at a tertiary referral center over 4 years. Mean patient age in the type II group was 5 years (range, 1 to 15 y). A total of 48% were pinned within 24 hours, 52% pinned >24 hours after the injury.
RESULTS: No difference was in detected in rates of major complications between the early and delayed treatment group. Four percent of patients sustained a complication (16 patients). There were no compartment syndromes, vascular injuries, or permanent nerve injuries. Complications included nerve injury (3), physical therapy referral for stiffness (3), pin site infection (2 treated with oral antibiotics, 4 treated with debridement), refracture (2), and loss of fixation or broken hardware (2). Of the 3 patients who sustained nerve injuries, all underwent surgery within 24 hours of injury. One patient developed an ulnar motor and sensory nerve palsy after fixation with crossed K-wires. This resolved by 7 weeks postoperatively. Two patients presented with an anterior interosseous nerve palsy-1 resolved 1 week after surgery, the other by 8 weeks postoperatively.
CONCLUSIONS: Delay in surgery did not result in an increased rate of major complications following closed reduction and percutaneous pinning of type II supracondylar humerus fractures in children. Further prospective work is necessary to determine if there are subtle treatment benefits from emergent treatment of type II supracondylar humerus fractures.

METHODS: Consecutive patients diagnosed with T3-4/N+ rectal cancer, treated by neoadjuvant chemoradiation and low anterior resection during 2000-2012 were retrospectively evaluated. Patients undergoing closure during adjuvant chemotherapy (Group A) were compared to patients undergoing closure after completing chemotherapy (Group B).
RESULTS: A total of the 165 patients met inclusion criteria, of whom 104 received adjuvant chemotherapy (25 in Group A and 79 in Group B). The pathologic stage was higher in Group B (P = 0.015). The rates of postoperative complications were similar (16% for Group A and 15% for Group B, P = 0.88), as was hospital stay (mean 5.78 days for Group A and 6.25 days for Group B, P = 0.7). There was no significant difference in recurrence rate and overall survival between the groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Referral to ileostomy closure in relation to adjuvant chemotherapy is influenced by pathologic stage. Early referral appears to be reserved to a small number of patients with lower pathologic stage. Timing of ileostomy closure does not change short- or long-term results."
24249520,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24249520/,"BACKGROUND: Among the various controversies in the treatment strategies for patients with thymoma, the optimal mode of resection needs to be defined. To explore whether or not the mode of resection affects the prognosis/recurrence in patients with thymoma, we evaluated the treatment outcome of patients with resected thymoma.
METHODS: One hundred seventy-three nonmyasthenic patients with stage I or II resected thymoma were studied. Patients were divided into two groups: a thymomectomy (resection of thymoma without total thymectomy) group (n = 100) and a thymothymomectomy (resection of thymoma with total thymectomy) group (n = 73). The differences in the clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis between the two groups were examined.
RESULTS: Myasthenia gravis developed postoperatively in three patients (3%) in the thymomectomy group and in 6 (8%) in the thymothymomectomy group. The 5- and 10-year overall survival rates in the thymomectomy group were 96.7% and 92.2%, and those in the thymothymomectomy group were 94.0% and 86.2%, respectively (P = 0.755). Two patients (2%) in the thymomectomy group and 4 (5%) in the thymothymomectomy group experienced recurrence.
CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference in prognosis/recurrence between the two groups. Thymothymomectomy might not always be necessary for nonmyasthenic patients with stage I or II thymoma."
24249533,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24249533/,"BACKGROUND: The use of TKAs in young patients is increasing. Demographic characteristics and activity levels among this patient group may affect implant selection, performance, and survivorship. Patient age (≤ 55 years) and preoperative diagnosis have been used to define this patient group, with the presumption that these patients are more active than older patients with similar indications for TKA.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We questioned whether (1) demographic features of young patients support high activity expectations after TKA, and (2) preoperative or postoperative functional activity measures support projections that young patients are active after TKA.
METHODS: We retrospectively compared demographic characteristics (gender, BMI, diagnosis) and functional activity profile (as determined by preoperative and postoperative UCLA activity score and functional subscores of The Knee Society and WOMAC instruments) for 150 patients 55 years old or younger (181 TKAs) and 262 patients who were between 65 to 75 years old (314 TKAs) at the time of surgery.
RESULTS: Younger patients having TKAs were significantly more likely than older patients to be female (74% versus 60%, p < 0.001) and to have diagnoses other than osteoarthritis (18% versus 3%, p < 0.001). BMI was significantly greater among younger female patients than among other age and gender combinations (35 kg/m(2) versus 31 kg/m(2), p < 0.001). Male patients had higher mean postoperative UCLA activity scores (5.5 versus 4.4, p < 0.001), Knee Society function subscores (80.2 versus 66.4, p < 0.001), and WOMAC function subscores (82.8 versus 74.2, p < 0.01) compared with female patients, but these were not different in older versus younger patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Sustained high activity levels are not likely to be a principal cause of revision TKAs among younger patients when considering age and diagnosis alone. Determining the effect of activity on survivorship of prosthetic designs and techniques should be based on measured functional activity instead of using age and diagnosis as surrogates for activity.

24249538,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24249538/,"BACKGROUND: Whether current postoperative surveillance regimes result in improved overall survival (OS) of patients with extremity sarcomas is unknown.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We hypothesized that a less intensive followup protocol would not be inferior to the conventional followup protocol in terms of OS. We (1) assessed OS of patients to determine if less intensive followup regimens led to worsened survival and asked (2) whether chest radiograph followup group was inferior to CT scan followup group in detecting pulmonary metastasis; and (3) whether less frequent (6-monthly) followup interval was inferior to more frequent (3-monthly) followup in detecting pulmonary metastasis and local recurrence.
METHODS: A prospective randomized single-center noninferiority trial was conducted between January 2006 and June 2010. On the basis of 3-year survival of 60% with intensive, more frequent followup, 500 nonmetastatic patients were randomized to demonstrate noninferiority by a margin (delta) of 10% (hazard ratio [HR], 1.36). The primary end point was OS at 3 years. The secondary objective was to compare disease-free survival (DFS) (time to recurrence) at 3 years. At minimum followup of 30 months (median, 42 months; range, 30-81 months), 178 deaths were documented.
RESULTS: Three-year OS and DFS for all patients was 67% and 52%, respectively. Three-year OS was 67% and 66% in chest radiography and CT groups, respectively (HR, 0.9; upper 90% confidence interval [CI], 1.13). DFS rate was 54% and 49% in chest radiography and CT groups, respectively (HR, 0.82; upper 90% CI, 0.97). Three-year OS was 64% and 69% in 6-monthly and 3-monthly groups, respectively (HR, 1.2; upper 90% CI, 1.47). DFS was 51% and 52% in 6-monthly and 3-monthly groups, respectively (HR, 1.01; upper 90% CI, 1.2). Almost 90% of local recurrences were identified by patients themselves.
CONCLUSIONS: Inexpensive imaging detects the vast majority of recurrent disease in patients with sarcoma without deleterious effects on eventual outcomes. Patient education regarding self-examination will detect most instances of local recurrence although this was not directly assessed in this study. Although less frequent visits adequately detected metastasis and local recurrence, this trial could not conclusively demonstrate noninferiority in OS for a 6-monthly interval of followup visits against 3-monthly visits.

24249537,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24249537/,"BACKGROUND: The opening wedge approach to high tibial osteotomy (HTO) is perceived to have some advantages relative to the closing wedge approach but it may be associated with delayed and nonunions. Because nonunions evolve over months, it would be advantageous to be able to identify risk factors for and early predictors of nonunion after medial opening wedge HTO.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We sought to determine whether (1) preoperatively identifiable patient factors, including tobacco use, body mass index > 30 kg/m(2), and degree of correction, are associated with nonunion, and (2) a modified Radiographic Union Score for Tibial Fractures (RUST) score, taken at 6 weeks and 3 months, would be predictive for delayed or nonunion after medial opening wedge HTO.
METHODS: The medical records and radiographs of 185 patients, 21 bilateral cases, treated with a medial open wedge HTO using the TomoFix(®) device were retrospectively evaluated. For all patients, demographic data regarding risk factors were collected from their records. Diagnosis for delayed or nonunion was already done earlier for standard medical care by the orthopaedic surgeon based on clinical and radiographic grounds. For the retrospective radiographic evaluation, a modified RUST score was used in which each tibial cortex is scored by one observer. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify preoperative and postoperative predictive factors for developing delayed or nonunion. In the series, a total of 19 patients (9.2%) developed clinically delayed/nonunion of whom 10 patients (4.9%) developed a nonunion.
RESULTS: Smoking was identified as a risk factor for developing delayed/nonunion (19% for smokers versus 5.4% for nonsmokers; p = 0.005; odds ratio, 4.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-10.7). By contrast, body mass index, lateral cortical hinge fracture, age, infection, and degree of correction were not risk factors. Patients with delayed/nonunion had lower RUST scores at all time points when a radiograph was taken compared with the total study group.
CONCLUSIONS: The RUST score at 6 weeks and 3 months after surgery and the use of tobacco were identified as predictive factors for development of delayed union and nonunion after open wedge HTO. Based on these results, we now actively try to stop patients from smoking and these data are helpful in doing that. The RUST score may be of use to identify which patients are at risk for developing a delayed union so that interventions may be offered earlier in the course of care.

OBJECTIVE: To establish and evaluate an effective method of removing potassium from bananas (matooke).
METHODS: Bananas were sampled from 5 markets in Kampala, Uganda. Deionized water was used to soak the bananas and the potassium concentration was determined using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer in both the bananas and water after soaking for varying time intervals. We also determined the potassium concentrations in the bananas and the water after boiling the bananas at 200 degrees Celsius at intervals of 10 minutes (for 60 minutes).
RESULTS: The potassium concentration did not appear to change on soaking alone without boiling. However, on boiling, the concentration in the bananas decreased from about 1.4 ppm to approx. 1 ppm after 60 min; yet the concentration of potassium released into deionized water increased steadily from 0.0 ppm to about 1.2 ppm after 60 min of boiling.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that boiling the bananas is a more effective way of removing the potassium from bananas than simply soaking them."

This study examines the time trends in the socioeconomic patterning of generalised and abdominal obesity and overweight in English adults.
METHODS: Data were from core annual samples of the Health Survey for England 1993-2008, including 155 661 participants aged 18-75 years. The prevalence of generalised and abdominal obesity and overweight was reported as crude and age-adjusted estimates. Binomial regression was used to model measures of obesity and overweight with age, sex, survey years, and two indicators of socioeconomic position: Registrar General's Social Class (manual and non-manual occupational groups) and relative length of full time education. Trends in socioeconomic patterning were assessed by formal tests for interactions between socioeconomic position measures and survey periods in these models.
RESULTS: The prevalence of generalised and abdominal overweight and obesity increased consistently between 1993 and 2008. There were significant differences in the four outcomes between the two socioeconomic position (SEP) groups in men and women, except for generalised and abdominal overweight with social class in men. The prevalence of obesity and overweight across the whole period was higher in subgroups with lower SEP (differences of 0.2% to 9.5%). There was no significant widening of the socioeconomic gradient of most indicators of greater body fat since the early 1990s, except for educational gradient in generalised obesity in men and women (P = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Substantial social class and education gradients in obesity and overweight are still present in both sexes. However, there is limited evidence that these socioeconomic inequalities have changed since 1993."
24251833,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24251833/,"BACKGROUND: Botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) has been reported to have analgesic effects independent of its action on muscle tone, mostly by acting on neurogenic inflammatory mediators and controlling the neurotransmitter release of sensory and autonomic nerve terminals that are involved in many chronic painful conditions as chronic intractable trigeminal neuralgia (TN).The aim of our work was evaluating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of BTX-A for the treatment of intractable idiopathic TN.
METHODS: This was a randomized, single-blinded, placebo-control study carried out on 20 Egyptian patients with intractable TN. Patients received a one-time subcutaneous administration of BTX-A using ""follow the pain"" method. The primary efficacy measure was reduction in pain severity on the 10-cm VAS score as well as in paroxysms frequency from the baseline to week 12 (endpoint last observation carried forward [LOCF]). Secondary efficacy measures included QoL assessment and number of acute medications received from baseline to the endpoint.
RESULTS: Pain reduction at the 12-week endpoint was significant in BTX-A group (p&lt;0.0001); VAS scores at endpoint LOCF relative to baseline for BTX-A group showed a decrease of 6.5 compared with a decrease of 0.3 for placebo, also there was a significant decrease in the number of acute medications and an increase in QoL functioning scale.
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that BTX-A has a direct analgesic effect in patients with TN and can represent a therapeutic option for intractable cases."
24252002,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24252002/,"OBJECTIVES: The goal of the study was to examine the influence of biological agents on postoperative infections such as surgical site infection (SSI) and late infection in patients with rheumatoid arthritis after total joint arthroplasty at our hospital between January 2006 and December 2011.
METHODS: The patients were divided into groups with (Bio group, 267 joints) and without (Non-Bio group, 300 joints) treatment with biological agents. We examined the incidence of postoperative infection in Bio group and Non-Bio group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the risk factor of postoperative infection.
RESULTS: The incidences of superficial and deep SSI were 0.37% and 1.0%, respectively, in the Bio group, and 0.67% and 0%, respectively, in the Non-Bio group, with no significant difference between the two groups. The incidences of late infection were 1.0% and 0% in the Bio and Non-Bio groups, respectively, again with no significant difference between the groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed the following values for the surgery of the foot and ankle region [P = 0.001, odds ratio (OR) = 19.27; 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.67-79.45]. The use of biological agents was not a risk factor for postoperative infection.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the use of biological agents does not significantly increase the incidences of SSI and late infection after orthopedic surgery in patients with rheumatoid arthritis after total joint arthroplasty."
24252003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24252003/,"BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a risk factor for the development of Felty's syndrome and large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia. Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies are considered highly specific for RA and are directed against various citrullinated antigens, including citrullinated fibrinogen. Anti-CCP antibodies may interfere with the detection of citrullinated proteins and their function. In this article, we describe the possible inhibition of fibrinogen by anti-CCP antibodies with clinical consequences which have never been reported in the literature to our best knowledge.
CASE REPORT: We present the case of a 79-year-old Caucasian woman with a longstanding history of untreated seropositive RA and who had been investigated for severe neutropenia since several months. The association of splenomegaly led to suspicion of Felty's syndrome. Flux cytometry was compatible with T-cell LGL leukemia. In addition, severe hypofibrinogenemia was detected. The later finding has not been consistently associated with the former clinical entities. Further investigations demonstrated that the anti-CCP antibodies of the patient also recognized the P41 peptide of citrullinated fibrinogen. The patient deceased of intracranial hemorrhage.
CONCLUSION: It is likely, yet not definite, that high anti-citrullinated fibrinogen titers may contribute to low fibrinogen levels and could have contributed to the fatal hemorrhagic event."
24252281,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24252281/,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The underlying evolutionary processes of pollinator-driven floral diversification are still poorly understood. According to the Grant-Stebbins model speciation begins with adaptive local differentiation in the response to spatial heterogeneity in pollinators. Although this crucial process links the micro- and macroevolution of floral adaptation, it has received little attention. In this study geographical phenotypic variation was investigated in Patagonian Calceolaria polyrhiza and its pollinators, two oil-collecting bee species that differ in body size and geographical distribution.
METHODS: Patterns of phenotypic variation were examined together with their relationships with pollinators and abiotic factors. Six floral and seven vegetative traits were measured in 45 populations distributed across the entire species range. Climatic and edaphic parameters were determined for 25 selected sites, 2-16 bees per site of the most frequent pollinator species were captured, and a critical flower-bee mechanical fitting trait involved in effective pollination was measured. Geographical patterns of phenotypic and environmental variation were examined using uni- and multivariate analyses. Decoupled geographical variation between corolla area and floral traits related to the mechanical fit of pollinators was explored using a Mantel test.
KEY RESULTS: The body length of pollinators and the floral traits related to mechanical fit were strongly correlated with each other. Geographical variation of the mechanical-fit-related traits was decoupled from variation in corolla size; the latter had a geographical pattern consistent with that of the vegetative traits and was mainly affected by climatic gradients.
CONCLUSIONS: The results are consistent with pollinators playing a key role in shaping floral phenotype at a geographical scale and promoting the differentiation of two floral ecotypes. The relationship between the critical floral-fit-related trait and bee length remained significant even in models that included various environmental variables and an allometric predictor (corolla area). The abiotic environment also has an important role, mainly affecting floral size. Decoupled geographical variation between floral mechanical-fit-related traits and floral size would represent a strategy to maintain plant-pollinator phenotypic matching in this environmentally heterogeneous area."
24252489,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24252489/,"OBJECTIVE: Celebrity cancer diagnoses generate considerable media coverage of and increase interest in cancer screening, but do they also promote primary cancer prevention?
METHODS: Daily trends for smoking cessation-related media (information-availability) and Google queries (information-seeking) around Brazilian President and smoker Lula da Silva's laryngeal cancer diagnosis announcements were compared to a typical period and several cessation awareness events.
RESULTS: Cessation media coverage was 163% (95% confidence interval, 54-328) higher than expected the week after the announcement but returned to typical levels the second week. Cessation queries were 67% (95% confidence interval, 40-96) greater the week after Lula's announcement, remaining 153% (95% confidence interval, 121-188), 130% (95% confidence interval, 101-163) and 71% (95% confidence interval, 43-100) greater during the second, third, and fourth week after the announcement. There were 1.1 million excess cessation queries the month after Lula's announcement, eclipsing query volumes for the week around New Years Day, World No Tobacco Day, and Brazilian National No Smoking Day.
CONCLUSION: Just as celebrity diagnoses promote cancer screening, they may also promote primary prevention. Discovery of this dynamic suggests the public should be further encouraged to consider primary (in addition to the usual secondary) cancer prevention around celebrity diagnoses, though more cases, cancers, and prevention behaviors must be explored."
24252608,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24252608/,"BACKGROUND: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) lesions on T2/FLAIR brain MRI are frequently seen in healthy elderly people. Whether these radiological lesions correspond to irreversible histological changes is still a matter of debate. We report the radiologic-histopathologic concordance between T2/FLAIR WMHs and neuropathologically confirmed demyelination in the periventricular, perivascular and deep white matter (WM) areas.
RESULTS: Inter-rater reliability was substantial-almost perfect between neuropathologists (kappa 0.71 - 0.79) and fair-moderate between radiologists (kappa 0.34 - 0.42). Discriminating low versus high lesion scores, radiologic compared to neuropathologic evaluation had sensitivity / specificity of 0.83 / 0.47 for periventricular and 0.44 / 0.88 for deep white matter lesions. T2/FLAIR WMHs overestimate neuropathologically confirmed demyelination in the periventricular (p < 0.001) areas but underestimates it in the deep WM (0 < 0.05). In a subset of 14 cases with prominent perivascular WMH, no corresponding demyelination was found in 12 cases.
CONCLUSIONS: MRI T2/FLAIR overestimates periventricular and perivascular lesions compared to histopathologically confirmed demyelination. The relatively high concentration of interstitial water in the periventricular / perivascular regions due to increasing blood-brain-barrier permeability and plasma leakage in brain aging may evoke T2/FLAIR WMH despite relatively mild demyelination."
24252716,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24252716/,"BACKGROUND: Human prion diseases are a group of rare fatal neurodegenerative conditions with well-developed clinical and neuropathological diagnostic criteria. Recent observations have expanded the spectrum of prion diseases beyond the classically recognized forms.
RESULTS: In the present study we report six patients with a novel, apparently sporadic disease characterised by thalamic degeneration and rapidly progressive dementia (duration of illness 2-12 months; age at death: 55-81 years). Light and electron microscopic immunostaining for the prion protein (PrP) revealed a peculiar intraneuritic distribution in neocortical regions. Proteinase K resistant PrP (PrPres) was undetectable by Western blotting in frontal cortex from the three cases with frozen tissue, even after enrichment for PrPres by centrifugation or by phosphotungstic acid precipitation. Conformation-dependent immunoassay analysis using a range of PK digestion conditions (and no PK digestion) produced only very limited evidence of meaningful D-N (denatured/native) values, indicative of the presence of disease-associated PrP (PrPSc) in these cases, when the results were compared with appropriate negative control groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Our observation expands the spectrum of conditions associated with rapidly progressive dementia and may have implications for the understanding of the pathogenesis of prion diseases."
24252816,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24252816/,"BACKGROUND: Chemical-shift magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been known to successfully differentiate adenomas from metastases. However, there has been concern that metastasis from extra-adrenal primary malignancies which contain high lipid content such as clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) could mimic adrenal adenomas.
PURPOSE: To evaluate the ability of MR to differentiate adrenal adenoma from metastasis using chemical-shift imaging and MR feature analysis in patients with clear cell RCC.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study was institutional review board-approved; informed consent was waived. Eleven patients with 13 metastases and 13 patients with 15 adrenal adenomas in patients with clear cell RCC for evaluation of an adrenal mass underwent MR. Signal intensity on in- and opposed-phases, signal intensity index (SII), size, T2 SI, cystic change, necrosis, and hemorrhage were evaluated. Statistical analyses included Student t-test and Fisher exact test. If available, precontrast CT attenuation of the adrenal adenomas was measured. SII was correlated with attenuation using Pearson correlation coefficient.
RESULTS: Mean size of adenomas was smaller than that of metastases (P < 0.002). Mean SII of adenomas (45.0% ± 24.6) was significantly greater than that of metastases (6.6% ± 4.7; P < 0.001). With a threshold of 16.5% for SII, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for adenomas were 80%, 100%, and 89.2%, respectively. All six lipid-rich adenomas were diagnosed as adrenal adenoma. Three of eight (37.5%) lipid-poor adenomas were misdiagnosed as metastases. While up to 53.8% (7/13) of the metastases demonstrated cystic change, necrosis, or hemorrhage, only one (6.7%) adenoma exhibited cystic change or necrosis (P < 0.05 for all). Precontrast attenuation and SII were significantly correlated: r = -0.810 (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: In patients with clear cell RCC who underwent MR for adrenal masses, SII and MR features such as cystic change, necrosis, and hemorrhage were helpful in differentiating adenomas from metastases."
24252817,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24252817/,"BACKGROUND: Most of the breast lesions show hypoechogenicity relative to fat on ultrasonography. The frequency and malignancy rate of hyperechoic lesions are not investigated in a large series.
PURPOSE: To evaluate the frequency and malignancy rate of hyperechoic lesions on breast sonography and to investigate sonographic characteristics that may predict malignancy in hyperechoic breast lesions.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Radiologic reports of 16,416 patients who underwent breast sonography between 2007 and 2008 were searched using ""hyperechoic"", ""echogenic"" or ""heterogeneous echoic"" to describe lesions. Sonographic findings were evaluated according to the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System lexicon. Clinical records including follow-up and pathologic findings were also reviewed. We calculated the frequency of hyperechoic lesions and their malignancy rate. Differences in sonographic appearances between benign and malignant lesions were also investigated.
RESULTS: Among the 16,416 patients, 103 (0.6%) hyperechoic lesions were identified (mean size, 1.79 cm). Of these 103 lesions, 27 (26.2%) were pathologically evaluated and five (4.9%, 4 invasive ductal carcinoma and 1 mucinous carcinoma) were confirmed as malignant. Among the 819 malignant lesions diagnosed using sonography-guided core needle biopsy, five (0.6%) were hyperechoic. In benign lesions, fat necrosis and fibroadenoma were common pathologic diagnoses. Malignant lesions were more likely to have irregular shape (P = 0.003), non-parallel orientation (P = 0.002), non-circumscribed margin (P = 0.007), and a hypoechoic area (P = 0.027) than benign lesions. All hyperechoic carcinomas were seen as suspicious masses on mammograms.
CONCLUSION: Hyperechoic masses are very rare and mostly benign. As an adjunct to mammography, the imaging findings reported here could help to avoid misdiagnosis for malignant hyperechoic lesion."

METHODS: A single surgeon proficient in VATS lobectomy initiated a robotic lobectomy program, and a retrospective review was conducted of his patients undergoing minimally invasive lobectomy (robotics or VATS) for lung cancer between 2011 and 2012. Data collected included patient/tumor characteristics, morbidity, mortality, operative times, and length of hospital stay.
RESULTS: Over a 24-month period, a total of 69 patients underwent minimally invasive lobectomy (35 robotic, 34 VATS). Patients in each group were similar in age and clinical stage. Robotic upper lobectomy operative times were longer than VATS (172 vs 134 minutes; P = .001), with no significant difference in lower lobectomies noted (140 vs 123 minutes; P = .1). Median length of stay was 3 days in both groups, and the median number of lymph nodes harvested was 18 (robotic) versus 16 (VATS; P = .42). Morbidity and mortality for robotic versus VATS were 11% versus 18% (P = .46) and 0% versus 3% (P = .49), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: There does not seem to be a significant advantage for an established VATS lobectomy surgeon to transition to robotics based on clinical outcomes. The learning curve for robotic upper lobectomies seems to be more significant than that for lower lobectomies."
24252941,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24252941/,"BACKGROUND: Patients with congenital heart disease are frequently surviving into adulthood, and many of them will require surgery. Currently, there is no validated risk scoring system for adult congenital heart surgery, and predicting outcomes in these patients is challenging. Our objective was to determine if commonly used pediatric congenital heart disease surgery risk scores are also applicable to adults.
METHODS: Four hundred fifty-eight adult (age ≥ 18 years) operations involving cardiac surgery for congenital heart disease between 2000 and 2010 at a single institution were studied retrospectively. The pediatric scores evaluated were the Risk Adjustment for Congenital Heart Surgery (RACHS-1) score, the Aristotle Basic Score, and the Society of Thoracic Surgery-European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (STAT) Congenital Heart Surgery Mortality score. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to assess the ability of the scoring systems to predict mortality, major adverse events (stroke, renal failure, prolonged ventilation, prolonged coma, deep sternal infection, reoperation, and operative mortality), and prolonged length of stay (>7 days).
RESULTS: Of 458 operations, there were 16 (3%) deaths, 94 (21%) major adverse events, and 90 (20%) prolonged lengths of stay. Four hundred thirty (94%) of the operations were included in all 3 scoring systems and the ROC analysis. For mortality, areas under the ROC curve were 0.91, 0.91, and 0.65 for the Aristotle, STAT, and RACHS-1 scores, respectively. For major adverse event, areas under the ROC curves were 0.81, 0.76, and 0.61 for the Aristotle, STAT, and RACHS-1 scores, respectively. For prolonged length of stay, areas under the ROC curve were 0.82, 0.76, and 0.61 for the Aristotle, STAT, and RACHS-1 scores, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric risk scoring systems such as Aristotle, STAT, and RACHS-1 offer prognostic value in adults undergoing congenital heart surgery. The scores are predictive of mortality, major adverse events, and prolonged lengths of stay. The STAT and Aristotle systems fared best."
24253105,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24253105/,"BACKGROUND: The extension of the compartment-oriented neck dissection at primary surgery in medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is controversial. Because a <50 % decrease in intraoperative calcitonin levels (IO-CT) after total thyroidectomy plus central neck dissection (TT-CND) has been associated with residual disease, IO-CT monitoring has been proposed to predict the completeness of surgery. The goal of the present prospective study was to verify the accuracy of IO-CT monitoring.
METHODS: All patients scheduled for primary surgery for suspected or proven MTC between November 2010 and January 2013 were included. Calcitonin was measured pre-incision (basal level), after tumor manipulation, at the time TT-CND was accomplished (ablation level), 10 and 30 min after ablation. A decrease >50 % with respect to the highest IO-CT level 30 min after ablation was considered predictive of cure.
RESULTS: Twenty-six patients were included, and IO-CT monitoring identified 18 of 23 cured patients (true negative results) and 2 of 3 patients with persistent disease (true positive result). In 5 patients with normal basal and stimulated postoperative calcitonin levels, a decrease <50 % was observed (false positive results). In one of three patients with persistent disease a >50 % decrease in IO-CT was observed (false negative results). Specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy of IO-CT were 78.2, 66.6, and 76.9 %, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative calcitonin monitoring is not highly accurate in predicting the completeness of surgical resection. In the present series, relying on IO-CT would result in limited resection in about one third of the patients with residual neck disease and in unnecessary lateral neck dissection in about 20 % of the cured patients."
24253762,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24253762/,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether undernutrition risk measured using the Spinal Nutrition Screening Tool (SNST) and the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST) is associated with worse clinical outcomes in respect of length of in-patient hospital stay (LOS) and mortality in the 12 months after admission to a spinal cord injuries (SCIs) centre.
METHODS: A multicentre, prospective, cross-sectional observational study was conducted in four UK SCI centres (SCICs). A total of 150 SCI patients (aged 18-88 years (median: 44 years), 30.7% females) were studied between July 2009 and March 2010. LOS and mortality 12 months after admission to the SCIC was monitored. Multivariate regression analysis was used to identify unique predictors of the variance of LOS.
RESULTS: The patients initially undernourished or at risk of undernutrition (44.6%) had a significantly longer LOS (median (days): 129 vs 85, P=0.012) and greater 12-month mortality (% deceased: 9.2% vs 1.4%, P=0.036). In addition, serum albumin and new admission to an SCIC were identified as independent predictors for long LOS.
CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that undernutrition risk, as identified by the SNST, is associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Nutritional screening should be helpful in improving clinical outcomes if it promotes more appropriate and effective nutritional intervention."

OBJECTIVE: To compare cement leakage rate and efficacy for vertebral body restoration of balloon kyphoplasty (BK) versus Kiva novel implant with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) for treating osteolytic vertebral body metastasis.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Minimally invasively vertebral augmentation techniques with PMMA are mostly performed for treating osteoporotic compression fractures. The Kiva implant with PMMA offers better vertebral body restoration and less PMMA leakage than BK in osteoporotic fractures. No previous study compared leakage rate and efficacy for vertebral body restoration in traditional BK and Kiva with PMMA in osteolytic vertebral body metastases.
METHODS: This study examined 23 patients (71 ± 13 yr) with 41 osteolytic vertebral bodies, who received Kiva with low viscosity PMMA and 24 patients (70 ± 11 yr) with 43 vertebral body osteolyses, who were reinforced with BK and high viscosity PMMA. All osteolyses were graded as Tomita 1 to 3. Anterior vertebral body height ratio (AVBHr), posterior vertebral body height ratio (PVBHr), and middle vertebral body height ratio (MVBHr), Gardner kyphotic deformity, PMMA leakage and were measured and compared between the groups. Visual analogue scale and Oswestry Disability Index were used for functional outcome evaluation.
RESULTS: No patient survived after 3 months. Asymptomatic PMMA leakage occurred in 4 (9.3%) vertebrae in the BK group solely (2 to the spinal canal, in Tomita grade 3 osteolysis) Anterior, posterior and middle vertebral body height ratio, Gardner angle improved insignificantly in both groups. Visual anlogue scale and Oswestry Disability Index improved postoperatively similarly in both groups (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: BK and Kiva provided equally significant spinal pain relief in patients with cancer with osteolytic metastasis. The absence of cement leakage in the Kiva group and absence of neurological complication in the BK group leakages reflects the safety of both augmentation techniques even in significant osteolysis. The lack of cement leakage in the Kiva cases, although low viscosity PMMA was used, increases this implant safety in augmenting severely destructed thoracolumbar vertebrae and sacrum from osteolytic metastasis.

OBJECTIVE: To study the associations between strenuous leisure time physical activity (LTPA) and subsequent hospitalization due to back disorders. Socioeconomic and lifestyle factors are associated with back-related hospitalization, but the significance of strenuous LTPA in the working population is unclear.
METHODS: The cohort (n = 902) was drawn from among employees in the metal industry (n = 2,653). Data were collected by a questionnaire and a structured interview on LTPA. Activity regarding strenuous (>500 kcal/h) LTPA was categorized as none, some, and high. Information from national registers on hospitalizations and deaths during 28 years of follow-up was linked to the data. Cox proportional hazards regression was used.
RESULTS: Subjects with a high level of strenuous LTPA had a decreased risk of hospitalization due to back disorders (hazard ratio 0.40; 95% CI 0.21-0.79) compared with persons with no strenuous activity, after adjustment for age and gender. The association persisted (0.48; 0.24-0.96) when further adjusted for occupational class, self-reported back diseases, smoking, and body mass index at baseline.

24254258,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24254258/,"BACKGROUND: One key indicator of the quality of health practitioners-patient interaction is the encounters' duration. Automation have been presented as beneficial to pharmacy staff work with patients and thus with a potential impact on pharmacists' and technicians' job satisfaction.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the interaction length between pharmacy staff and patients, as well as their job satisfaction, in community pharmacies with and without automation.
SETTING: Portuguese community pharmacies with and without automation.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study followed a quasi-experimental design, divided in two phases. In the first, paired community pharmacies with and without automation were purposively selected for a non-participant overt observation. The second phase comprised a job satisfaction questionnaire of both pharmacists and technical staff. Practitioners and patients demographic and interactional data, as well as job satisfaction, were statistically compared across automation.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Interaction length and job satisfaction.
RESULTS: Sixty-eight practitioners from 10 automated and non-automated pharmacies produced 721 registered interaction episodes. Automation had no significant influence in interaction duration, controlling for gender and professional categories, being significantly longer with older patients (p = 0.017). On average, staff working at the pharmacy counter had 45 % of free time from direct patient contact. The mean overall satisfaction in this sample was 5.52 (SD = 0.98) out of a maximum score of seven, with no significant differences with automation as well as between professional categories, only with a significant lower job satisfaction for younger pharmacists.
CONCLUSION: As with previous studies in other settings, duration of the interactions was not influenced by pharmacy automation, as well as practitioners' job satisfaction, while practitioners' time constrains seem to be a subjective perception."

The aim of this prospective, randomized, single-centre study was to compare pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) only versus a left atrial maze (LAM) procedure in patients with paroxysmal AF during mitral valve surgery.
METHODS: Between February 2009 and June 2011, 52 patients with a mean age of 54.2 (standard deviation 7.2 years) underwent mitral valve surgery and concomitant bipolar radiofrequency ablation for paroxysmal AF. Patients were randomized into the PVI group (n = 27) and the LAM group (n = 25). After surgery, an implantable loop recorder for continuous electrocardiography (ECG) monitoring was implanted. Patients with an AF burden (AF%) of <0.5% were considered AF free (responders). The mean follow-up was 18.6 months (standard deviation 2.1 months), and the patient' data were evaluated every 3 months.
RESULTS: All patients were alive at discharge. No procedure-related complications occurred for either the ablation or the loop recorder implantation. Mean aortic clamping and ablation times were significantly longer in the LAM group than in the PVI group. The incidence of early AF paroxysm recurrence was significantly higher in the PVI group than in the LAM group (62.9 vs 24.0%, P < 0.001). At 20 months after surgery, 15 (55.6%) of the 27 patients in the PVI group and 22 (88.0%) of the 25 patients in the LAM group had no documented atrial arrhythmias and were considered responders (AF burden <0.5%). The mean AF burden during all follow-up periods was significantly lower in the LAM group (23.6 ± 8.7%) than in the PVI group (6.8 ± 2.2%) (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: According to continuous ECG monitoring data, freedom from AF was significantly higher after the concomitant LAM procedure than after PVI in patients with paroxysmal AF who underwent mitral valve surgery."
24254917,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24254917/,"BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of data on the effect of vaginal lubricants on specimen adequacy in the era of liquid-based Papanicolaou (Pap) tests. Current manufacturer recommendations advise against the use of lubricants, especially those that contain carbomers or carbopol polymers. There is, however, no conclusive evidence to support this recommendation. Moreover, the data that does exist is conflicting.
METHODS: Retrospective review was performed of all liquid-based Pap tests collected between January 2010 and March 2012 by the Gynecologic Oncology division at a single hospital. Specimen adequacy was compared for vaginal and cervical specimens that were collected with and without a lubricant. Results were also compared for specimens collected with lubricants that did or did not contain carbomers.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference in specimen adequacy for cervical or vaginal Pap test specimens collected with a water-soluble lubricant not containing carbomers, compared to those collected without a lubricant. There was, however, a significantly higher rate of insufficient specimens when a water-soluble lubricant containing carbomers was used. This difference was most pronounced for vaginal Pap tests (26.9% versus 1.2%, OR = 30.3, 95% CI = 16.6-55.1, P < .0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Lubricants containing carbomers should be avoided when collecting liquid-based Pap tests because they can significantly decrease specimen adequacy. Lubricants that do not contain these substances do not significantly affect specimen adequacy. If there is an unusual increase in unsatisfactory Pap tests, the cytology laboratory should notify clinicians and work with them to determine the cause."

Significant increasing trends in the prevalence of family history of diabetes (P<0.001), metabolic syndrome (P<0.001), age (P<0.001) and waist circumference (P=0.043) and decreasing trends in HOMA-β (P<0.001) and oral disposition index (DIo) (P<0.002) were observed among the groups. No significant trends in fasting insulin levels, area under the curve for insulin (AUCINS), Matsuda index of insulin sensitivity (ISI-Matsuda) and visceral adiposity index were detected.
CONCLUSIONS: Impairment of glucose tolerance is characterized by the inability of β-cells to adequately compensate for insulin resistance through increased insulin secretion. Age, genetic predisposition and lifestyle, in combination with the duration and degree of hypercortisolism, strongly contribute to the impairment of glucose tolerance in patients with a natural history of CS. A careful phenotypic evaluation of glucose tolerance defects in patients with CS proves useful for the identification of those at a high risk of metabolic complications."
24256028,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24256028/,"OBJECTIVES: Acupuncture is increasingly used in patients with allergic asthma, but there is a lack of evidence on the cost-benefit relationship of this treatment. The aim of this study was to assess economic aspects of additional acupuncture treatment in patients with allergic bronchial asthma compared to patients receiving routine care alone. DESIGN, SUBJECTS, INTERVENTION, OUTCOME MEASURES: In a randomized controlled trial, patients with allergic bronchial asthma were either allocated to a group receiving acupuncture immediately or a waiting-list control group. Both groups were free to use routine care treatment. The resource consumption, costs, and health-related quality of life were evaluated at baseline, and after 3 and 6 months by using statutory health insurance information and standardized questionnaires. Main economic outcome parameters were direct and indirect cost differences during the study period and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of acupuncture treatment.
RESULTS: Three hundred and six (306) patients (159 acupuncture; 147 controls) were included (mean age 46.5±13.11 years, female 57.2%) and were comparable at baseline. Acupuncture treatment was associated with significantly higher costs compared to control patients (overall costs: €860.76 [95% confidence interval (CI) 705.04-1016.47] versus €518.80 [95% CI 356.66-680.93]; p=0.003; asthma-related costs: €517.52 [95% CI 485.63-549.40] versus €144.87 [95% CI 111.70-178.05]; p<0.001). These additional costs seem essentially driven by acupuncture costs themselves (€378.40 [95% CI 367.10-389.69]). However, acupuncture was associated with superior effectiveness in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Resulting ICER lay between €23,231 (overall) and €25,315 (diagnosis-specific) per additional QALY. When using German acupuncture prices of year 2012, the ICER would improve to €12.810 (overall) versus €14,911 (diagnosis-specific) per QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Treating patients who have allergic bronchial asthma with acupuncture in addition to routine care resulted in additional costs and better effects in terms of patients' quality of life. Acupuncture therefore seems to be a useful and cost-effective add-on treatment."
24256067,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24256067/,"BACKGROUND: Warfarin has been the mainstay treatment for prevention of stroke among patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). Unlike rivaroxaban, warfarin requires laboratory monitoring to allow the attainment of the prothrombin time (PT) international normalized ratio (INR) goal, thereby potentially prolonging a patient's hospital length of stay (LOS).
OBJECTIVE: To compare hospital LOS between hospitalized NVAF patients using rivaroxaban versus warfarin in a real-world setting.
METHODS: A retrospective claims analysis was conducted using the Premier Perspective Comparative Hospital Database from 11/2010 to 9/2012. Adult patients were included in the study if they had a hospitalization for NVAF. Patients using rivaroxaban during hospitalization were matched with up to four warfarin users by propensity score analyses. Patients who were first administered their oral anticoagulants on day 3 or later of their hospital stay were also evaluated. Comparison of hospital LOS was assessed using generalized estimating equations.
RESULTS: The characteristics of the matched cohorts were well balanced. Among the matched rivaroxaban and warfarin users (2809 and 11,085 patients, respectively), the mean age of the cohorts was 71 years and 49% of patients were female. The average (median) hospital LOS for rivaroxaban patients was 4.46 (3) days, compared to 5.27 (4) days for the warfarin cohort. The mean difference in hospital LOS of 0.81 days (19.44 hours) was found to be significant at P < 0.001. Patients who were administered rivaroxaban on day 3 of their hospital stay or later also had a significantly lower LOS compared to warfarin users.
LIMITATIONS: These included inaccuracies or omissions in diagnoses, completeness of baseline characteristics, and a study population that included patients newly initiated on and patients who continued anticoagulant therapy.
CONCLUSION: The study sample of NVAF patients receiving rivaroxaban was associated with a significantly shorter hospital length of stay compared to the sample of patients receiving warfarin."
24256216,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24256216/,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Providing evidence-based clinical care reduces disability and mortality rates following stroke. We examined if compliance with evidence-based processes of care were different for patients with intracerebral haemorrhage when compared with ischemic stroke and sought to describe differences in health outcomes during hospitalization and at time of discharge for these stroke subtypes.
METHODS: The New South Wales acute stroke dataset was used. This included data from 50-100 consecutively admitted patients' medical records collected from 32 New South Wales hospitals between 2003 and 2010. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted taking into account patient factors and clustering of patients by hospital.
RESULTS: Ischemic stroke and intracerebral haemorrhage cases had similar demographic features (ischemic stroke n = 3467, mean age 74 years [standard deviation 13], 50% female; intracerebral haemorrhage n = 275, mean age 74 years [standard deviation 13], 48% female). Following multivariable analyses patients with intracerebral haemorrhage were less likely to be admitted to a stroke unit (adjusted odds ratio 0.65; 95% confidence interval 0.45-0.94) or receive an assessment from allied health (adjusted odds ratio 0.54; 95% confidence interval 0.33-0.89) than patients with ischemic stroke. Patients with intracerebral haemorrhage are also less likely to be independent (adjusted odds ratio 0.36; 95% confidence interval 0.3-0.5) at time of hospital discharge and had a greater odds of dying in hospital (adjusted odds ratio 2.1; 95% confidence interval 1.3-3.5). Patients that were admitted to a stroke unit had a greater odds of being independent (modified Rankin Score 0-2) at day 7-10 irrespective of stroke type or severity on admission (adjusted odds ratio 1.3; 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.66).
CONCLUSIONS: Following intracerebral haemorrhage, patients were less likely to be admitted to an acute stroke unit and receive allied health interventions. Admission to stroke units improved the likelihood of being independent at days 7-10 and, therefore, more should be done to encourage evidence-based care for intracerebral haemorrhage."
24256427,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24256427/,"BACKGROUND: Producing accessible information regarding health issues is very important in order to ensure that people with intellectual disabilities (ID) have equal access to services and can make informed decisions about their treatment.
METHOD: This study examined whether an Easy Read leaflet improved service users' comprehension and compared the efficacy of two different modalities of presenting information: 'text and pictures' or 'pictures only'. Participants' knowledge was assessed at baseline and immediately after the leaflet.
RESULTS: Our findings indicate that the use of the leaflet improved knowledge but neither modality of presenting information was significantly more effective at making the document easier to understand. Contrary to expectation, people with milder ID may find pictures more effective in the absence of text.
CONCLUSIONS: Although pictures were not found to be detrimental, our results do not favour the use of pictures as well as text when giving information, particularly to people with milder disabilities. The generalised use of text and picture formats for all people with ID in spite of the scant evidence supporting its effectiveness is concerning."
24256675,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24256675/,"BACKGROUND: The National Institute of Medicine's report Hospital-Based Emergency Care: At the Breaking Point highlighted the critical issue of emergency department overcrowding. At our institution, patients with anterior abdominal stab wounds (AASW) have been managed with a protocol that uses diagnostic laparoscopy (DL) after positive result on local wound exploration. Patients with negative DL result are eligible for discharge directly from the recovery room. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of DL for AASWs in light of the recommendations that suggested serial abdominal examination (SAE) is preferred to determine the need for laparotomy.
METHODS: Patients admitted to a Level 1 trauma center from January 2010 through August 2012 with AASWs were included (contemporary period to Western Trauma Association study). Information regarding baseline characteristics, diagnostic workup, injury management, and outcomes were retrospectively reviewed and compared with the SAE AASW algorithm.
RESULTS: A total of 158 patients with AASWs were evaluated using our institutional algorithm. Thirty-eight patients (24%) went directly to the operating room for peritonitis, shock, or evisceration; 120 underwent local wound exploration; 99 had positive result (82%). Twenty-eight patients had immediate laparotomy owing to worsening clinical examination findings. Seventy had DL, and 19 of these patients were discharged home from the recovery room, with a mean length of stay of 6.4 hours. When comparing patients managed using the DL algorithm to those managed using the SAE-based algorithm, the nontherapeutic laparotomy rate was lower, although not statistically significant. However, the DL algorithm produced a significantly higher percentage of patients discharged directly home following local wound exploration.
CONCLUSION: With some trauma centers suffering from emergency department overcrowding and constrained resources, DL may offer an alternative to SAE to efficiently use available resources. Both SAE and DL are safe and offer similar therapeutic laparotomy rates. The method used to evaluate patients after AASW should be tailored to institutional needs and resources.

24256685,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24256685/,"BACKGROUND: According to the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, in 2010, 10,228 people were killed in alcohol-impaired driving crashes. Daily, intoxicated drivers are seen in trauma centers across the country. At our trauma center, we sought to determine the number of drivers who had a documented elevation in their blood alcohol content (BAC) and compare this with county police records to evaluate how many charges for driving while intoxicated (DWI) were issued.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed for trauma admissions during a 3-year period. Patients with a BAC of less than 0.08 g/dL were excluded. Only documented drivers were included. This group of intoxicated drivers was then compared against public records from the Dallas County for any record of a charge of DWI.
RESULTS: During a 3-year period, from 2009 to 2011, 118 drivers had a confirmed BAC above the legal limit of 0.08 g/dL. Average BAC level was 0.218 g/dL. Injuries varied widely between patients with an average Injury Severity Score (ISS) of 11. Extremity fractures were seen in 27%, facial fractures were seen in 16%, and intracranial hemorrhage was seen in 7%. Forty-eight percent of the patients were admitted to the intensive care unit initially, with an average length of intensive care unit stay of 1.5 days (range, 0-25 days). Only 18% of our patients (21) received a charge of DWI. Four patients were charge with related offenses.
CONCLUSION: A motor vehicle accident may be protective against the legal ramifications of drinking and driving. Less than 20% of patients who were driving under the influence incurred any legal repercussion. Deterrents that prevent law enforcement from being able to obtain evidence needed for prosecution should be eliminated. Health care providers and law enforcement agencies should work as a team to help mitigate the incidence of drunk driving and its burden on society.

24256700,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24256700/,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether chronotropic incompetence (CI), the inability to reach 85% of the maximal predicted heart rate during exercise, affects the assessment of myocardial ischemia and prognosis in patients undergoing myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (MPS).
METHODS: Patients undergoing exercise/rest MPS were studied. Those taking drugs with negative chronotropic properties were excluded. Summed stress, rest, and difference scores (SSS, SRS, and SDS, representing, respectively, the extent and severity of the total perfusion defect, fibrosis, or ischemia) were calculated. Patients were followed up for the occurrence of hard events (death or myocardial infarction) or myocardial revascularization for 36±20 months.
RESULTS: A total of 391 patients were studied; among them, 11.5% had CI. All perfusion scores were higher in patients with CI. On logistic regression, history of myocardial infarction and SDS were found to be independent predictors of CI. On comparing patients with and without CI, the former more often had hard events (12.5 vs. 0.9%, P=0.007) and revascularization (20.0 vs. 8.1%, P=0.003).
CONCLUSION: CI was associated with myocardial ischemia. Higher rates of hard events and revascularization were observed in patients with CI, in accordance with the larger extent of myocardial ischemia found in these patients. Performing MPS in the setting of CI may maintain the diagnostic and prognostic abilities of the test."
24256741,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24256741/,"BACKGROUND: The meaningful use (MU) of electronic medical records (EMRs) is being implemented in three stages. Key objectives of stage one include electronic analysis of data entered into structured fields, using decision-support tools (e.g., checking drug-drug interactions [DDI]) and electronic information exchange.
OBJECTIVE: The authors assessed the performance of medical students on 10 stage-one MU tasks and measured the correlation between students' MU performance and subsequent end-of-clerkship professionalism assessments and their grades on an end-of-year objective structured clinical examination.
PARTICIPANTS: Two-hundred and twenty-two third-year medical students on the internal medicine (IM) clerkship. DESIGN/MAIN MEASURES: From July 2010 to February 2012, all students viewed 15 online tutorials covering MU competencies. The authors measured student MU documentation and performance in the chart of a virtual patient using a fully functional training EMR. Specific MU measurements included, adding: a new problem, a new medication, an advanced directive, smoking status, the results of screening tests; and performing a DDI (in which a major interaction was probable), and communicating a plan for this interaction.
KEY RESULTS: A total of 130 MU errors were identified. Sixty-eight (30.6%) students had at least one error, and 30 (13.5%) had more than one (range 2-6). Of the 130 errors, 90 (69.2%) were errors in structured data entry. Errors occurred in medication dosing and instructions (18%), DDI identification (12%), documenting smoking status (15%), and colonoscopy results (23%). Students with MU errors demonstrated poorer performance on end-of-clerkship professionalism assessments (r =-0.112, p=0.048) and lower observed structured clinical examination (OSCE) history-taking skills (r =-0.165, p=0.008) and communication scores (r= - 0.173, p=0.006).
CONCLUSIONS: MU errors among medical students are common and correlate with subsequent poor performance in multiple educational domains. These results indicate that without assessment and feedback, a substantial minority of students may not be ready to progress to more advanced MU tasks."
24257163,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24257163/,"OBJECTIVE: Many studies have investigated the effect of redesign on operational performance; fewer studies have evaluated the effects on employees' perceptions of their working environment (organizational climate). Some authors state that redesign will lead to poorer organizational climate, while others state the opposite. The goal of this study was to empirically investigate this relation.
DESIGN: Organizational climate was measured in a field experiment, before and after a redesign intervention. At one of the sites, a redesign project was conducted. At the other site, no redesign efforts took place.
SETTING: Two Dutch child- and adolescent-mental healthcare providers.
PARTICIPANTS: Professionals that worked at one of the units at the start and/or the end of the intervention period.
INTERVENTION: The main intervention was a redesign project aimed at improving timely delivery of services (modeled after the breakthrough series).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Scores on the four models of the organizational climate measure, a validated questionnaire that measures organizational climate.
RESULTS: Our analysis showed that climate at the intervention site changed on factors related to productivity and goal achievement (rational goal model). The intervention group scored worse than the comparison group on the part of the questionnaire that focuses on sociotechnical elements of organizational climate. However, observed differences were so small, that their practical relevance seems rather limited.
CONCLUSIONS: Redesign efforts in healthcare, so it seems, do not influence organizational climate as much as expected."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 152 ovarian cancer patients who had undergone therapy were evaluated. Clinical information, CA-125 levels, and traditional imaging findings were analyzed. According to the indication for PET/CT the patients were divided into five groups for assessing the role of (18)F-FDG PET/CT in the clinical management of ovarian cancer patients after therapy. A comparison was made between the PET/CT findings and the results of clinical follow-up.
RESULTS: Of the 152 patients, 137 had follow-up results and 15 were lost to follow-up. A total of 105 patients were found to have recurrent tumor and 32 were found to be disease-free after long-term follow-up. The diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 98.3, 91.2, 96.8, 97.5, and 93.9%, respectively. PET/CT was especially useful in patients when indications were to diagnose suspected recurrence, assess disease progression, and evaluate therapeutic response.
CONCLUSION: PET/CT has been proven to be extremely valuable in the evaluation of patients with recurrent ovarian cancer and is particularly helpful in guiding treatment planning."
24257658,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24257658/,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the characteristics of the discoid lateral meniscus in patients more than forty years of age. We studied whether a torn discoid lateral meniscus that has no treatment until middle age would increase the tendency of the knee to develop a varus deformity and investigated the correlation between torn discoid lateral meniscus and osteoarthritis.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records for 164 knees in 158 patients who were more than forty years old and who underwent a knee arthroscopic procedure from 1992 to 2007. The mean age at the time of surgery was fifty-two years. Comparative evaluation of the clinical and radiographic differences between the eighty-four patients with torn discoid lateral meniscus (Group A) and the seventy-four patients with a torn normally shaped lateral meniscus (Group B) was carried out.
RESULTS: Preoperative standing anteroposterior radiographs, which were made for all patients, showed that varus deformity was more common in Group A than in Group B and that osteoarthritic changes in both the medial and lateral compartments were also more common in Group A. With regard to chondral injury, Outerbridge grade-3 or 4 involvement was identified in 46% of the knees in Group A and 18% of the knees in Group B.
CONCLUSIONS: In the present study of middle-aged patients, those with a torn discoid lateral meniscus had a higher prevalence of varus knee deformity and a higher prevalence of osteoarthritis. Knees with a discoid lateral meniscus that have diminished valgus alignment should be monitored carefully with long-term follow-up because a discoid lateral meniscus may increase the risk for progression to degenerative knee osteoarthritis."
24258197,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24258197/,"BACKGROUND: Fluctuations in the national economy shape labour market opportunities and outcomes, which in turn may influence the accumulation of cognitive reserve. This study examines whether economic recessions experienced in early and mid-adulthood are associated with later-life cognitive function.
METHOD: Data came from 12,020 respondents in 11 countries participating in the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). Cognitive assessments in 2004/2005 and 2006/2007 were linked to complete work histories retrospectively collected in 2008/2009 and to historical annual data on fluctuations in Gross Domestic Product per capita for each country. Controlling for confounders, we assessed whether recessions experienced at ages 25-34, 35-44 and 45-49 were associated with cognitive function at ages 50-74.
RESULTS: Among men, each additional recession at ages 45-49 was associated with worse cognitive function at ages 50-74 (b=-0.06, CI -0.11 to -0.01). Among women, each additional recession at ages 25-44 was associated with worse cognitive function at ages 50-74 (b25-34=-0.03, CI -0.04 to -0.01; b35-44=-0.02, CI -0.04 to -0.00). Among men, recessions at ages 45-49 influenced risk of being laid-off, whereas among women, recessions at ages 25-44 led to working part-time and higher likelihood of downward occupational mobility, which were all predictors of worse later-life cognitive function.
CONCLUSIONS: Recessions at ages 45-49 among men and 25-44 among women are associated with later-life cognitive function, possibly through more unfavourable labour market trajectories. If replicated in future studies, findings indicate that policies that ameliorate the impact of recessions on labour market outcomes may promote later-life cognitive function."

METHODS: Low-income patients with type 2 diabetes who spoke English or Spanish from 6 urban clinics in San Francisco, California, were invited to participate in the study. Twenty participants received training and provided peer coaching to 109 patients over a 6-month peer coaching intervention. Primary outcome was average change in patient glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C). Characteristics of peer coaches included age, gender, years with diabetes, A1C, body mass index (BMI), levels of diabetes-related distress, self-efficacy in diabetes self-management, and depression.
RESULTS: Patient improvement in A1C was associated with having a coach with a lower sense of self-efficacy in diabetes management (P < .001), higher level of diabetes-related distress (P = .01), and lower depression score (P = .03).
CONCLUSIONS: Coach characteristics are associated with patient success in improving A1C. ""Better"" levels of coach diabetes self-efficacy and distress were not helpful and, in fact, were associated with less improvement in patient A1C, suggesting that some coach uncertainty about his or her own diabetes might foster improved patient self-management. These coach characteristics should be considered when recruiting peer coaches."
24258687,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24258687/,"BACKGROUND: Neglected congenital muscular torticollis is rare in adults but may be associated with pain and cosmetic problems. The efficacy of surgical correction in these patients has not been well established in the literature.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We sought to describe (1) the primary goals that influenced adults with neglected muscular torticollis to seek surgical correction, (2) improvements of patients' function (specifically ROM) and radiographic parameters associated with deformities, (3) patient-derived outcomes using a previously published scale that includes function, and cosmesis, and (4) complications associated with sternocleidomastoid release in one surgeon's series of patients.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of all adult patients who had surgical release of the sternocleidomastoid muscle between 2003 and 2011 by one surgeon and who were followed up for more than 1 year after surgery; 42 of these procedures were performed, and complete followup was available for 37 of them (88%). The mean age of the patients was 27 years (range, 18-48 years), and the minimum followup was 1.5 years (mean, 2.4 years; range, 1.5-4.7 years). The primary goal of the operation for each patient was determined to assess if it was met. Functional outcomes were assessed in terms of motion deficit: lateral flexion and rotation. Radiographic outcomes were assessed for cervicomandibular angle, lateral translation of the head and neck, and Cobb's angle of the cervicothoracic spine. The overall clinical results of surgery were assessed with the modified Cheng and Tang scoring system, and complications were tallied from a chart review.
RESULTS: The primary goals of surgery were cosmesis in 17 (46%) patients, pain in 11 (30%) patients, and function in nine (24%) patients. Patients for whom pain was the primary goal of surgery were older than the other patients. ROM and radiographic parameters associated with deformity consistently improved in these patients (p < 0.001 in all planes), and the overall results according to the modified Cheng and Tang scoring system indicated that 21 (57%) patients had an excellent result, 12 (32%) had a good result, and four (11%) had a fair result. There were no serious complications and no reoperations in these patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Sternocleidomastoid release was beneficial for the treatment of neglected congenital muscular torticollis in adults and was not associated with any serious complications. Surgical treatment led to cosmetic and functional improvements and relieved pain originating from the muscle imbalance brought about by the long-standing deformity.

24259046,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24259046/,"BACKGROUND: Price-based mechanisms are an important tobacco cessation policy tool in New Zealand (NZ) and so measurement of smokers' reaction to price changes is crucial in determining efficacy of this approach. Although approximately two-thirds of NZ tobacco demand is for manufactured cigarettes (MC) and one-third is for Roll-Your-Own (RYO) tobacco, previous price elasticity estimates have ignored differences between RYO tobacco and MC consumers.
METHODS: We employ a seemingly unrelated regression econometric approach applied to quarterly data over the period 1991-2011 to estimate price elasticities of demand separately for MC and RYO tobacco.
RESULTS: Estimate of price elasticity of demand for MC is -1.033, and -0.441 for RYO tobacco. RYO tobacco is an inferior good; a 1% increase in average weekly income is associated with a 0.8% reduction in demand. RYO tobacco is a substitute for MC; a 1% increase in the price of MC is associated with a 0.867% increase in demand for RYO tobacco.
CONCLUSIONS: There is significantly different price responsiveness across the two tobacco product types. MC smokers react far more strongly to price increases compared with RYO tobacco smokers. These findings suggest that pricing mechanisms may be more effective for reducing MC demand than for RYO tobacco. However, substitution between products means that this pricing effect is muted by the uptake of RYO tobacco use. Cessation policy specific to RYO use should be designed to target this growing group."
24259729,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24259729/,"BACKGROUND: Medication adherence reduces disease morbidity. Data regarding changes in a patient's adherence before and after hospitalization and how this hospitalization influences a pharmacist's interventions are scarce.
OBJECTIVE: To assess changes in adherence to cardiovascular and respiratory medications in the year preceding and following a hospitalization; explore patients' perceptions about medication adherence and the pharmacist's role; and describe pharmacists' interventions regarding medication adherence.
METHODS: This cohort study included patients hospitalized for acute coronary syndrome, acute worsening of heart failure, or acute COPD exacerbations. Adherence to cardiovascular and respiratory medications was measured by calculating the proportion of days covered (PDC) from prescription refills. Patient interviews were completed to explore their perceptions about medication adherence and the role of the pharmacist. Community pharmacists were invited to complete an online survey and to participate in focus groups to discuss interventions to improve medication adherence.
RESULTS: Medication adherence was assessed for 61 patients; the mean PDC was 69.8% 12 months before hospitalization and 72.4% 12 months following hospitalization. Patients reported that they felt the need to take their medications to prevent worsening of their disease. They were satisfied with current pharmaceutical services. A total of 136 questionnaires completed by pharmacists were analyzed and 9 participants attended the focus groups. Most pharmacists reported monitoring prescription renewals to assess adherence, with no significant influence from the hospitalization itself. The patient's interest was reported to be an important facilitator, whereas a lack of time and face-to-face interaction with patients who had their medication delivered to their home was reported a main barrier to interventions. This study was limited by a small sample size.
CONCLUSIONS: Patient medication adherence did not significantly change following hospitalization. Hospitalization does not appear to significantly influence patient and pharmacist behavior towards medication adherence."

METHODS: A total of 145 adult patients diagnosed with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C (CHC) who had completed a 48-wk regimen of pegylated-interferon α-2a or -2b plus ribavirin combination therapy were recruited from six large urban healthcare centers and 199 healthy blood donors (controls) from a single site between January 2010 and January 2012. Data on the patients' response to treatment was collected. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism genotyping of the interleukin (IL)28B gene fragment encompassing the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs12979860 (C/T) and rs8099917 (T/G) was carried out for 79 of the CHC patients and 199 of the controls. Bi-directional amplicon sequencing of the two SNPs was carried out for the remaining 66 CHC patients.
RESULTS: SNP rs12979860 genotyping was successful in 99.5% of the controls and 97.2% of the CHC patients, whereas the SNP rs8099917 genotyping was successful in 95.5% of the controls and 100% of the CHC patients. The genotype and allele distributions for both rs12979860 and rs8099917 were significantly different between the control and CHC patient groups, with significantly higher genotype frequencies of CC and TT in the controls (P = 0.037 and 0.046, respectively) and of TT and GG in the CHC patients (P = 0.0009 and 0.0001, respectively). Analysis of the CHC patients who achieved sustained virological response (SVR) to treatment (n = 55) indicated that the rs12979860 C allele and CC genotype were predictors of SVR (P = 0.02). No significant correlation was found between rs8099917 genotypes and treatment response, but carriers of the T allele showed significantly higher rates of SVR (P = 0.02). Linkage disequilibrium analysis of the group that achieved SVR showed a significant association between rs12979860 and rs8099917 (P = 0.07).
CONCLUSION: The higher allele frequency of rs12979860 C and rs8099917 T observed in non-HCV-infected individuals may indicate a potential protective role for these IL28B-related polymorphisms."
24259972,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24259972/,"AIM: To evaluate the red cell distribution width (RDW) as an indicator of the presence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and its association with fibrotic scores.
METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out that included sixty-two biopsy proven NASH, 32 simple steatosis patients and 30 healthy controls. The correlation between the clinical and histopathological features of NASH patients and RDW values was evaluated. Liver fibrosis scores were measured using a 0 to 4 point scale and were divided in to two groups; fibrosis scores 0-1 were termed mild and fibrosis scores 2-4 were termed advanced fibrosis. RDW values were compared between NASH, simple steatosis and healthy controls. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the independent predicting factors for the presence of liver fibrosis caused by NASH.
RESULTS: Patients with NASH had higher RDW values compared with simple steatosis and healthy control groups [14.28% ± 0.25% vs 13.37% ± 0.12%, 12.96% ± 0.14% (P < 0.01), respectively]. Patients with advanced fibrosis had higher RDW values than the mild fibrosis group (15.86% ± 0.4% vs 13.63% ± 0.67%, P < 0.01, respectively). RDW also correlated with fibrotic scores (r = 0.579 and P < 0.01). The variables that were significant in the univariate analysis were evaluated in multivariate logistic regression analysis, and RDW was an independent predicting factor of NASH (OR = 1.75, 95%CI: 1.129-2.711, P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: RDW a new non-invasive marker that can be used to demonstrate the presence of NASH and indicate advanced fibrotic scores."
24260771,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24260771/,"BACKGROUND: Chronic rhinitis with inferior turbinate hypertrophy is the most common cause of chronic nasal obstruction. Pharmacological treatment, mainly consisting of corticosteroids, is largely inadequate and, therefore, in the last few years several surgical techniques have been proposed (emptying, radiofrequency, cryotherapy, etc...). The aim of our work is to demonstrate that surgical removal of the inferior turbinate mucosa with the microdebrider, along with the submucosal chorion, results in a full restoration of mucosal physiological structure and function.
METHODOLOGY: Thirteen symptomatic adult patients were subjected to bilateral inferior partial turbinoplasty with the microdebrider. All patients underwent endoscopic examination, functional nasal tests and nasal mucosa biopsy before and after surgery.
RESULTS: The sensitivity in open airspaces improved after nasal surgery, and the results of functional tests returned to within a normal range. SEM examination confirmed that complete mucosal regeneration was within 4 months.
CONCLUSION: Total removal of the inferior turbinate mucosa with the microdebrider in patients suffering from hypertrophic chronic rhinitis allows the perfect regeneration of physiological respiratory tissue and doesn`t have a negative impact on healing time and offsets any adverse postoperative event."
24260976,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24260976/,"BACKGROUND: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a common chronic condition with significant consequences if left untreated (e.g., poor health outcomes, disease progression, and increased health care costs). However, about half of all patients do not fill their prescription.The factors associated with adherence are complex, and many remain poorly defined and understood.
OBJECTIVES: This pilot study had 2 objectives. First, to determine whether the medication adherence report scale (MARS) can be applied to identify adherence/nonadherence in patients with AR using patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as controls. Second, to identify AR profiles that indicate a particularly high risk of nonadherence.
METHODS: AR patients completed the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised Abbreviated-Form (EPQR-A), the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36), the Mini Rhinitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (Mini-RQLQ), and the MARS. Symptom severity was assessed before and after treatment.
RESULTS: The study population comprised 85 AR patients and 50 COPD patients. Females had worse adherence (significant only in total and unintentional scores) and higher extraversion scores. None of the personality traits predicted adherence. Neuroticism was negatively correlated with the SF-36 score (P < .001). A low to moderate correlation was observed between posttreatment improvement in specific/ generic health-related quality of life and MARS scores in AR patients (P = .002, r = 0.332; and P = .022, r = -0.251; respectively). Higher educational level was found to significantly increase adherence (P = .01, r = 0.223).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study did not reveal a personality effect. However, it did suggest that use of a brief, self-completed medication adherence questionnaire in daily practice can enable health professionals to identify suboptimal adherence in patients who would benefit from close follow-up."

We tested a model of the mediating role of self-efficacy on the relationship between 2 x 2 achievement goals and cardiorespiratory fitness
METHOD: A sample of 276 middle school students (115 boys and 161 girls; 91 sixth graders, 87 seventh graders, and 98 eighth graders), aged 12 to 15 years (Mage = 13.34, SD = 0.96), responded to the Achievement Goals Questionnaire (Conroy, Elliot, & Hofer, 2003) and Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (Gao, Newton, & Carson, 2008) referenced to the fitness test. Their cardiorespiratory fitness was assessed via the Progressive Aerobic Cardiorespiratory Endurance Run (PACER) 3 days later.
RESULTS: Structural equation modeling demonstrated an acceptable model fit to the data, Chi2 (2, N = 105) = 1.66. Self-efficacy had a statistically significant direct effect on the PACER after controlling for the effects of the achievement goals (gamma(self-efficacy))-PACER = .21). MAv and PAp also had direct effects on PACER performance (gammaMAv-PACER = -.24, and gammaPAp-PACER = .24, respectively). MAp failed to exert direct effect on the PACER. However, the indirect effect of MAp on the PACER via self-efficacy was small although it was statistically significant. Additionally, the indirect effects of MAv and PAp on PACER through self-efficacy were not significant.
CONCLUSIONS: Students' self-efficacy fully mediated the effect of MAp on fitness performance, as well as partially mediated the effects of MAv and PAp on cardiorespiratory fitness performance. Study implications are provided for educators and practitioners."
24261019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24261019/,"PURPOSE: This exploratory study examined the notion of Seefeldt's (1980) hypothesized motor skill ""proficiency barrier"" related to composite levels of health-related physical fitness (HRF) in young adults.
METHOD: A motor skill competence (MSC) index composed of maximum throwing and kicking speed and jumping distance in 187 young adults aged 18 to 25 years old was evaluated against a composite index of 5 health-related fitness (HRF) test scores. MSC (high, moderate, and low) and HRF indexes (good, fair, and poor) were categorized according to normative fitness percentile ranges. 2 separate 3-way chi-square analyses were conducted to determine the probabilities of skill predicting fitness and fitness predicting skill.
RESULTS: Most correlations among HRF and MSC variables by gender demonstrated low-to-moderate positive correlations in both men (12/15; r = .23-.58) and women (14/15; r = .21-.53). Chi-square analyses for the total sample, using composite indexes, demonstrated statistically significant predictive models, chi2(1, N = 187) = 66.99, p < .001, Cramer's V = .42. Only 3.1% of low-skilled (2 of 65) individuals were classified as having a ""good"" HRF. Only 1 participant (out of 65) who demonstrated high MSC was classified as having ""poor"" HRF (1.5%).
CONCLUSION: Although individual correlations among individual MSC and HRF measures were low to moderate, these data provide indirect evidence for the possibility of a motor skill ""proficiency barrier"" as indicated by low composite HRF levels. This study may generate future research to address the proficiency barrier hypothesis in youth as well as adults."
24261230,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24261230/,"AIM: To assess an association of uric acid level with preclinical target organ damage in patients with hypertensive disease (HD).
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The trial enrolled 100 patients (63 men and 37 women) with Stage I-II HD at moderate and high risk for cardiovascular events (CVEs). The mean age of the patients was 44.9 +/- 1.3 years. Their medical history showed that the duration of hypertension averaged 4.4 +/- 0.3 years. The average daily level of systolic blood pressure (BP) was 138.1 +/- 1.4 mm Hg and that of diastolic BP was 84.3 +/- 1.1 mm Hg.
RESULTS: The entire patient group showed a positive correlation between C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum uric acid (SUA) (r = 0.27; p < 0.01), suggesting that the nonspecific inflammatory processes were associated with uric acid levels in patients with HD. An intragroup analysis also revealed a relationship between CRP and SUA levels in the hypertensive patients at high risk for CVEs (r = 0.43; p = 0.01); this relationship was not found in those at their low risk. The hypertensive patients were ascertained to have elevated CRP levels and microalbuminuria, hyperuricosuria, and glomerular hyperfiltration when they had a SUA level >319 micromol/l.
CONCLUSION: It can be assumed that the SUA level >319 micromol/l triggers the activation of nonspecific inflammatory processes, which in turn affects renal microvessels."
24261376,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24261376/,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to examine whether the rate of complicated appendicitis and the hospital length of stay (LOS) increased during the transition to an ultrasound-first paradigm for the imaging evaluation of acute appendicitis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All pediatric patients with surgically proven appendicitis from 2005 to 2011 were identified by searching the hospital billing database for the discharge diagnosis codes for simple appendicitis (ICD-9 [International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision] code 540.9) and complicated appendicitis (ICD-9 codes 540.0 and 540.1). Annual trends of the proportions of these patients who underwent ultrasound and CT were determined and plotted for the study period. Correlation of complicated appendicitis and median hospital LOS with calendar year was assessed using the Spearman (ρ) rank correlation test. RESULTS. Eight hundred four patients met the inclusion criteria. The percentage of patients who underwent CT only showed a moderate downward association with year (ρ = -0.32, p < 0.01), and the percentage of patients who underwent ultrasound first showed a moderate upward trend (ρ = 0.44, p < 0.01). The percentage of patients with ultrasound as the only study performed before appendectomy increased moderately over the 7-year study period (ρ = 0.33, p < 0.01). The percentage of patients with complicated appendicitis and the median hospital LOS did not increase significantly over the study duration (ρ = -0.01, p = 0.74 and ρ = -0.04, p = 0.25, respectively).
CONCLUSION: The transition to an ultrasound-first pathway for the imaging workup of acute appendicitis in children occurred without evidence of a corresponding increase in the proportion of patients with complicated appendicitis or in the median hospital LOS."
24261410,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24261410/,"INTRODUCTION: Controlled donation after circulatory death (DCD) remains ethically controversial. The authors developed a controlled DCD protocol in which comfort therapy is regularly used. The aim of this study was to determine whether this policy shortens the DCD donors' life.
METHODS: The authors retrospectively analyzed prospectively collected data on patients proposed for DCD at the University Hospital of Liege, Belgium, over a 56-month period. The survival duration of these patients, defined as duration between the time of proposal for DCD and the time of circulatory arrest, was compared between patients who actually donated organs and those who did not.
RESULTS: About 128 patients were considered for controlled DCD and 54 (43%) became donors. Among the 74 non-donor patients, 34 (46%) objected to organ donation, 38 patients (51%) were denied by the transplant team for various medical reasons, and two potential DCD donors did not undergo procurement due to logistical and organizational reasons. The survival durations were similar in the DCD donor and non-donor groups. No non-donor patient survived.
CONCLUSIONS: Survival of DCD donors is not shortened when compared with non-donor patients. These data support the ethical and respectful approach to potential DCD donors in the authors' center, including regular comfort therapy."
24261423,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24261423/,"BACKGROUND: Dentists in the US see an increasing number of patients with systemic conditions. These patients are challenging to care for when the relationship between oral and systemic disease is not well understood. The prevalence of professional isolation exacerbates the problem due to the difficulty in finding expert advice or peer support. This study aims to identify whether dentists discuss the oral-systemic connection and what aspects they discuss; to understand their perceptions of and attitudes toward the connection; and to determine what information they need to treat patients with systemic conditions.
METHODS: We retrieved 14,576 messages posted to the Internet Dental Forum from April 2008 to May 2009. Using natural language processing and human classification, we identified substantive phrases and keywords and used them to retrieve 141messages on the oral-systemic connection. We then conducted coding and thematic analysis to identify recurring themes on the topic.
RESULTS: Dentists discuss a variety of topics on oral diseases and systemic health, with the association between periodontal and systemic diseases, the effect of dental materials or procedures on general health, and the impact of oral-systemic connection on practice behaviors as the leading topics. They also disseminate and share research findings on oral and systemic health with colleagues online. However, dentists are very cautious about the nature of the oral-systemic linkage that may not be causal. Nonetheless, they embrace the positive association as a motivating point for patients in practice. When treating patients with systemic conditions, dentists enquire about the cause of less common dental diseases potentially in relation to medical conditions in one-third of the cases and in half of the cases seek clinical guidelines and evidence-based interventions on treating dental diseases with established association with systemic conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: Dentists' unmet information needs call for more research into the association between less studied dental conditions and systemic diseases, and more actionable clinical guidelines for well-researched disease connections. To improve dissemination and foster behavioral change, it is imperative to understand what information clinicians need and in which situations. Leveraging peer influence via social media could be a useful strategy to achieve the goal."

DESIGN: Data from three cycles (2002, 2006, 2010) of the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) Study were used for cross-sectional and trend analyses of adolescent cannabis use.
SETTING: Representative surveys in 30 European and North American countries.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 160 606 15-year-old students.
MEASUREMENTS: Respondents' life-time cannabis use, demographics, family affluence (FAS) and frequency of peer contacts were measured individually. Indicators of wealth (gross domestic product per capita, GDP) and perceived availability of cannabis were obtained from national public data bases.
FINDINGS: The frequency of life-time cannabis use decreased over time among adolescents in Europe and North America, particularly in western European countries and the United States (relative risk (RR) = 0.86: confidence interval (CI) 0.79-0.93). This trend was not observed consistently in rapidly developing countries in eastern, central and southern Europe. Over time (2002-10), cannabis use became: (i) less characteristic of high GDP countries in contrast to lower GDP countries (RR = 0.74: CI 0.57-0.95); (ii) less characteristic of youth from high FAS families in contrast to youth from low FAS families (RR = 0.83: CI 0.72-0.96); and (iii) characterized by an increasing gender gap, i.e. consumption was higher among males (RR 1.26: CI 1.04-1.53). Perceived availability of cannabis and peer contacts remained strong predictors of frequent cannabis use.
CONCLUSIONS: Among 30 European and North American countries, cannabis use appears to have 'trickled down' over time, with developing countries taking on the former (heavier) use pattern of richer countries, and less affluent youth taking on the former (heavier) use pattern of more affluent youth. Cannabis use continues to be more common among adolescent males than females."
24261875,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24261875/,"OBJECTIVE: To reduce the operative delivery rate in the prolonged second stage of labor (PSSL) through intrapartum sonography.
METHODS: Sixty-two women - with uncomplicated pregnancies at term, fetus in cephalic presentation and occipitoanterior position, in PSSL - had already undergone epidural anesthesia and oxytocin infusion. Transperineal ultrasound was performed to define fetal head direction (downward, horizontal, and upward) and patients were divided into three groups (D, H, and U). PROPOSED PROTOCOL: Cessation of oxytocin infusion, addition of a dose of anesthesia, invitation to assume a hand-and-knee position, and to relax. After one hour, oxytocin infusion was started again and women were invited to push. Fetal well-being ensured by cardiotocography (CTG). Chi-square test was used to compare the mode of delivery: cesarean section (CS), vacuum extraction (VE), and spontaneous delivery (SD).
RESULTS: Group D (n = 20): 4 SD (20%), 4 VE, 12 CS; group H (n = 22): 9 SD (41%), 9 VE, 4 CS; group U (n20): 16 SD (80%), 4 VE. The risk of not having a SD in group D versus U is quadrupled (RR 4; 95% CI 1.6-9.9).
CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound diagnosis of fetal head upward direction is highly predictive of SD in case of PSSL. Further studies are needed to assess this hypothesis."
24261907,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24261907/,"BACKGROUND: Gallbladder diseases present with cholelithiasis in a wide spectrum of adenomas and cancers. Two or three specimens are sampled in cholecystectomies in routine pathology practice. The aim of this study was to investigate the increase in frequency of histologic alterations in cholecystectomies, particularly precancerous lesions, by increasing the sample size to understand the carcinoma pathway.
METHODS: Cholecystectomies of 432 patients with pathology records and materials from two medical centers were collected, and two groups were created. Initial data with two or three samples were allocated to Group 1 and the new six samples with the initial ones were allocated to Group 2. Hematoxylin and eosin (HandE) sections were examined for histopathologic alterations, and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) Alcian blue (pH 2.5) and high iron diamine (pH 2.5) stains were used to signify the mucin profile in case of metaplasias. For the comparison of findings, non-parametric tests, McNemar's tests, chi-squared tests and Fisher's exact test were performed.
RESULTS: Of the 432 patients, 308 (71.3%) patients were female and 124 (28.7%) patients were male. The mean age of patients was 47.9±14.6 years. Cholesterolosis was observed in 95 (22%) patients in Group 1 and 108 (25%) patients in Group 2. Gallstones were detected in 255 (59%) of the cholecystectomies. There was a significant difference between Group 1 and Group 2 by increasing the sample size when we compared cholesterolosis, metaplasia and polyps (P<0.05). Cholecystitis and dysplasia rates were the same in both of the groups. There was no cancer determined.
CONCLUSION: Increasing the sample size in cholecystectomies increased the diagnosis of some histologic alterations, but further studies with a larger number of samples over a longer period time might increase the ability to determine precancerous lesions and concomitants."
24262125,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24262125/,"OBJECTIVE: To examine if children who suffer from significant Nighttime Fears (NF) experience higher degree of general fears and behavioral problems and to explore whether effortful control mediates NF association with internalizing problems.
METHODS: One-hundred and nine preschool children (64 boys) between the ages 4 and 6years suffering from significant NF and 30 healthy children (16 boys) were evaluated using parental reports of behavioral problems [Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL)], parental and child report of fears [Fear Survey Revised for Parents (FSS-PC), Koala Fear Questionnaire (KFQ)], and a measure of effortful control derived from the Child Behavior Questionnaire (CBQ).
RESULTS: Children with severe NF also suffer from an increased level of a wide variety of fears other than NF, and exhibit more behavioral problems than controls both on parental and children's measures of general fears, and main CBCL scale scores (Internalizing, Externalizing, Total score). Additionally, children with NF had lower abilities of effortful control (as manifested in CBQ attention and inhibitory control scales). Attention control mediated NF association to internalizing problems scale.
CONCLUSIONS: NF may serve as a marker for anxiety vulnerability, and this vulnerability might be mediated by abnormal attentional control. Our finding also highlights the need for a more comprehensive assessment of behavioral problems, fears and anxiety phenomena among children referred with NF."
24262136,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24262136/,"INTRODUCTION: Spontaneous preterm birth (SPTB) is the common endpoint of different underlying etiologies, including chorion-decidual bleeding and inflammation. However, specific histologic findings from a prior pregnancy do not always inform clinical management in subsequent pregnancies secondary to few prior studies having evaluated the relationship between prior pregnancy pathology and subsequent outcomes in patients with SPTB.
METHODS: Included subjects had: 1) a SPTB with available placental pathology and 2) a subsequent consecutive delivery at >20 weeks gestational age at our institution. For included subjects archived placenta and membrane paraffin blocks from the index SPTB were cut, stained with Prussian Blue and evaluated by a perinatal pathologist for the presence of hemosiderin. The association between histologic findings and subsequent pregnancy outcomes were evaluated through logistic and linear regression.
RESULTS: A total of 131 subjects were included, of whom 39.7% had a recurrent SPTB. Funisitis at the time of preterm delivery significantly increased the risk of early (<34 weeks) recurrent preterm birth (OR 3.38, p = 0.016), though this may have been confounded by gestational age at delivery. Several histologic features were significantly associated with reductions in birth weight in the subsequent pregnancies, even if they did not increase the risk of recurrent preterm birth.
DISCUSSION: The presence of chorion-decidual bleeding or inflammation in a prior pregnancy can signal an increased risk in a future pregnancy beyond the recurrent risk of SPTB itself.
CONCLUSIONS: Placental histologic findings after SPTB maybe associated with differences in birth weight in a subsequent pregnancy."
24262140,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24262140/,"BACKGROUND: There is increasing interest in evidence-based educational interventions in central venous catheter care. It is unclear how effective these are at reducing the risk of bloodstream infections from the use of intravascular catheters (catheter-BSIs) and the associated costs and health benefits.
AIM: To estimate the additional costs and health benefits from introducing such interventions and the costs associated with catheter-BSIs.
METHODS: A comprehensive epidemiological and economic review was performed to develop the parameters for an economic model to assess the cost-effectiveness of introducing an educational intervention compared with clinical practice without the intervention. The model follows the clinical pathway of cohorts of patients from their admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), where some may acquire catheter-BSI, and estimates the associated costs, mortality and life expectancy.
FINDINGS: The additional cost per catheter-BSI episode was £3940. The results of this model demonstrate that introducing an additional educational intervention to prevent catheter-BSI improved patient life expectancy and reduced overall costs.
CONCLUSION: Introducing evidence-based education is likely to reduce the incidence of catheter-BSI and the model results suggest that the cost of introducing the interventions will be outweighed by savings related to reduced ICU bed occupancy costs."
24262330,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24262330/,"BACKGROUND: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a ubiquitous pathogen that chronically infects B lymphocytes and is implicated in the pathogenesis of lymphoproliferative diseases. Latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), the major oncoprotein of the virus, has been shown to inhibit apoptosis and trigger survivin expression in malignant cell lines. LMP1 expression has been detected in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, but its properties have not been studied in patients with low-grade B-cell lymphomas. Recent data show that LMP1 can simultaneously induce and inhibit apoptosis in B cells. We detected LMP1 messenger RNA (mRNA) in patients with leukemic low-grade B-cell lymphoma and correlated the expression of the antiapoptotic molecule survivin to that of LMP1 in this group of patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Peripheral whole blood from 64 patients with low-grade B-cell lymphoma was tested by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the presence of the BXLF-1 gene of EBV, and positive samples were tested by conventional PCR for LMP1 expression. Accordingly, survivin mRNA levels were measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR in all samples and compared between LMP1-positive (LMP1(+)) and LMP1(-) patients.
RESULTS: The BXLF-1 gene was detected in 27 of 64 patients (42%). LMP1 was expressed in 22 of 27 (81%) EBV(+) patients. Survivin expression was found to be 6.36 times higher in LMP1(-) patients than in LMP1(+) patients (P = .008).
CONCLUSION: Our results imply that in patients with non-EBV-related leukemic low-grade B-cell lymphoma, LMP1 expression is possibly correlated to apoptosis, as indicated by the lower survivin mRNA levels in LMP1(+) patients."
24262874,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24262874/,"OBJECTIVE: A subset of uterine serous carcinoma (USC) may have better clinical behavior bringing up the possibility that there may be morphologic features, which would help in their categorization. The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential use of the MD Anderson Cancer Center 2-tier grading system for ovarian carcinoma in USC.
METHODS: Tumors assigned a combined score included in this analysis were 1) low-grade: tumors without marked atypia and 12 mitoses/10 high power field (HPF) and 2) high grade: tumors with severe nuclear atypia and >12 mitoses/10 HPF. Clinicopathologic parameters evaluated included patients' age, tumor size, myometrial invasion (MI), lymphovascular invasion (LVI), lymph node (LN), FIGO stage, and patient outcome.
RESULTS: 140 patients with USC were included, 30 low grade uterine serous carcinoma (LGUSC) and 110 high grade uterine serous carcinoma (HGUSC). Of all parameters only 2 (MI and stage IA) reached statistical significance. 67% of LGUSC cases showed myometrial invasion versus 93.6% HGUSC cases (p = 0.003). A higher percentage of LGUSC (63.3%) versus HGUSC (32.7%) were in stage IA (p = 0.01). However, by multivariate analysis including age, LVI, stage and tumor grade only stage was an independent prognostic factor.
CONCLUSION: The presence of atypia and mitosis across a uterine serous carcinoma is notoriously variable in magnitude and extent, potentially making evaluation of these features difficult and subsequent grading subjective. Our findings thus show that actual prognostic utility of application of MDACC two-tier grading system to uterine serous carcinoma may not be applicable."

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of obesity on quality of life (QoL) in endometrial cancer survivors.
METHODS: Participants were endometrioid endometrial cancer survivors diagnosed between 2008 and 2013. Quality of life was measured through the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life questionnaire (QLQ-C30, version 3.0). Associations between BMI and quality of life were determined by means of multivariate analyses.
RESULTS: 322 women diagnosed with endometrioid endometrial cancer were invited to participate. Excluded were 15 women with unknown BMI, 40 with non-endometrioid histology and 10 with concurrent cancer. The QLQ-C30 questionnaire was completed by 158 (61.5%) women, of which 63 women (40%) were obese (BMI ≥ 30-39.9), and 30 women (19%) were morbidly obese (BMI ≥ 40). Morbidly obese women reported worse physical, role and social functioning and more somatic complaints.
CONCLUSION: Morbid obesity is associated with poorer quality of life in endometrial cancer survivors. Life style interventions such as exercise programs and diet interventions could be viable means to improve the quality of life of obese endometrial cancer survivors. Future research should focus on means to improve quality of life in obese endometrial cancer survivors."
24263041,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24263041/,"INTRODUCTION: Line type blood-liquid warmers are used widely due to their low expense, practical use and nondependence on sets. We aimed to investigate the relationship of bubbles in line type warmers with two different warming properties.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two groups were designed with S-line and Astoflo® brand blood-liquid warmers. By using 10 medisets for each group (n = 20), we infused 1,000 mL 0.9% NaCl solutions at 350 mL.hour-1 speed for one hour in the operating room. Temperatures at the proximal, midway and distal parts of lines, temperature of experiment environment, temperature of liquid used and temperature of liquid reaching the cannula after warming were measured. Time to visually observable bubble formation was recorded. We compared findings statistically using the Mann-Whitney U test.
RESULTS: There were no differences between the groups with respect to temperatures at the proximal, midway and distal parts of lines, temperature of experiment environment, temperature of liquid used and temperature of liquid reaching the cannula (p > 0.05). Bubbles were observed with both warmers and time to bubble formation was similar in the two study groups (p = 0.143).
CONCLUSIONS: In the experimental setting, we have designed conditions similar to our clinical environment. Both types of warmers provided similar warming levels and formed visible bubbles. Considering that low amounts of emboli can be fatal in infants and children, bubble formation should be taken seriously into account for emboli and further studies should be carried out to determine the amount, the reasons and the contents of bubble formation."

Full blood samples were collected preoperatively and synovium samples intraoperatively. Joint tissue lesions such as menisci, anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and hyaline cartilage were estimated. Real time PCR with spectrophotometric analysis was performed.
RESULTS: An ACL lesion was found in 56 patients, medial menisci (MM) in 65, and lateral menisci (LM) in five. Chondral lesions were estimated according to Outerbridge's grading system. In laboratory tests correlation between ACL tear and gene expression was seen except TIMP1 in serum (p < 0.05). In MM lesions MMP9, Agg2 elevation in serum was observed. LM lesions erased MMP13, MMP14 in serum and MMP8 in synovium. Chondral lesions revealed that many genes had higher expression in patients without hyaline degeneration. All of the gene expressions correlated between serum and synovium.
CONCLUSION: An ACL lesion provokes elevation in expression of proteases genes, while the influence of other lesions remains elusive. Gene expression in synovium correlates with peripheral blood."
24264549,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24264549/,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to determine the relationship between musculoskeletal disorders (MD) and physical activity levels (PAL) in individuals.
METHODS: 125 individuals (74 female, 51 male) aged between 20-65 participated in the study. Extended Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire was used to examine MD, International Physical Activity Questionnaire was used to determine PAL.
RESULTS: The mean age of the cases was 31.56 ± 7.09 years. It was found that individuals were 33.6% sufficiently active, 39.2% minimally active, 27.2% inactive. Body regions which were most commonly reported for experiencing pain, low back (51.2%), upper back (51.2%), neck (48.8%) at some point in their lifetime, neck (38.4%), upper back (35.2%), low back (35.2%) during the past 12 months, upper back (29.6%), neck (28.8%), low back (23.2%) in the past month, upper back (16.8%), shoulders (12.8%), neck and low back (11.2%) on the day of study. When MD during the past 12 months, in the past month, on the day of study were compared with PAL, statistically significant relation was found between knee pain and PAL (p=0.002, p=0.001, p=0.023, respectively).
CONCLUSION: The results showed that musculoskeletal pain was more frequent in spine (low back, upper back, neck). When the presence of MD compared with PAL, statistically significant relation was found between knee pain and PAL. In our study, patients with knee pain had high PAL, this can be explained by, those who are physically active tend to experience sport related injuries than inactive individuals and anatomic feature of knee joint."
24264772,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24264772/,"BACKGROUND: Informal caregiving can be deleterious to mental health, but research results are inconsistent and may reflect an interaction between caregiving and vulnerability to stress.
METHODS: We examined psychological distress among 1,228 female caregiving and non-caregiving twins. By examining monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs discordant for caregiving, we assessed the extent to which distress is directly related to caregiving or confounded by common genes and environmental exposures.
RESULTS: Caregiving was associated with distress as measured by mental health functioning, anxiety, perceived stress, and depression. The overall association between caregiving and distress was confounded by common genes and environment for mental health functioning, anxiety, and depression. Common environment also confounded the association of caregiving and perceived stress.
CONCLUSIONS: Vulnerability to distress is a factor in predicting caregivers' psychosocial functioning. Additional research is needed to explicate the mechanisms by which common genes and environment increase the risk of distress among informal caregivers."
24265090,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24265090/,"BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with higher risk of prostate cancer (PCa). This study aimed to evaluate whether published SNPs improve the performance of a clinical risk-calculator in predicting prostate biopsy result.
METHODS: Three hundred forty-six patients with a previous prostate biopsy (191 positive, 155 negative) were enrolled. After literature search, nine SNPs were selected for their statistically significant association with increased PCa risk. Allelic odds ratios were computed and a new logistic regression model was built integrating the clinical risk score (i.e., prior biopsy results, PSA level, prostate volume, transrectal ultrasound, and digital rectal examination) and a multilocus genetic risk score (MGRS). Areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (AUC) of the clinical score alone versus the integrated clinic-genetic model were compared. The added value of the MGRS was assessed using the Integrated Discrimination Improvement (IDI) and Net Reclassification Improvement (NRI) statistics.
RESULTS: Predictive performance of the integrated clinico-genetic model (AUC = 0.781) was slightly higher than predictive performance of the clinical score alone (AUC = 0.770). The prediction of PCa was significantly improved with an IDI of 0.015 (P-value = 0.035) and a continuous NRI of 0.403 (P-value < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The predictive performance of the clinical model was only slightly improved by adding MGRS questioning the real clinical added value with regards to the cost of genetic testing and performance of current inexpensive clinical risk-calculators."
24265168,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24265168/,"AIMS: The article examines whether preventive measures and work adjustments at the establishment level affects sickness absence among workers aged 50 years and older.
METHODS: We combine survey data from a representative sample of 713 Norwegian companies, mapping the prevalence of preventive health measures in the work place in 2005, with register data on sickness absence and demographic variables for workers aged 50 years or older in 2001 and 2007. By means of a difference-in-differences approach, we compare changes and differences in the likelihood of sickness absence among the sample group, with and without the various measures/ instruments in 2005 respectively.
RESULTS: In general, work-place preventive measures at the establishment level have not contributed to reducing the probability for sickness absence among workers aged 50 years and older. However, analyses comparing differences between industries find that the work-place measures have had a positive effect on public administration employees.
CONCLUSIONS: Whether work-place preventive initiatives influence levels of sickness absence seems to be contingent on sector and industry. Therefore, work-place measures may be more effective in the public administration sector where most employees have office jobs compared to sectors such as manufacturing, construction and transportation, where many employees have manual work and more physical demanding jobs. Work-place initiatives thus seem to have less effect on preventing sickness absence in sectors dominated by manual labour."
24265572,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24265572/,"OBJECTIVE: Suspicious incidental gastrointestinal FDG uptake during positron-emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) examinations can be caused by different diseases, including malignancies. However, differentiation with PET alone is difficult. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of PET alone, contrast-enhanced CT (ceCT), and low-dose CT (ldCT) in routine PET/CT protocols for differentiation of incidental gastrointestinal lesions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty patients with incidental gastrointestinal lesions who underwent a routine PET/CT protocol with ldCT and ceCT were retrospectively analysed. The PET lesions were evaluated regarding their FDG uptake patterns and the standard uptake value. The anatomical correlates in both CT protocols were compared in regard to the correct lesion classification with the reference standard endoscopy.
RESULTS: Sixty-two lesions were found in 60 patients (17 malignant, 10 premalignant, 5 benign, 13 inflammatory, 17 physiological). The differentiation of the FDG uptake patterns did not enable reliable lesion classification. The positive predictive value for pathology was 0.81 for ceCT in PET/CT and 0.70 for ldCT. Malignancies were detected in 100% of the patients by ceCT vs. 29.4% by ldCT. The false negative rate of ceCT for all pathologies was 31.1%, vs. 68.9% for ldCT. False positive results (17/62) could not be excluded sufficiently by either CT protocol.
CONCLUSION: PET/ceCT protocols provide additional benefit especially in detecting gastrointestinal malignancies as a cause of suspicious incidental gastrointestinal FDG uptake. However, since follow-up endoscopy cannot be forgone due to the considerable false negative rate even with ceCT, the addition of ceCT to a routine PET/ldCT protocol cannot be recommended for this purpose."
24266303,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24266303/,"INTRODUCTION: Proper preparation of the individual is a key prerequisite for ensuring the quality of laboratory testing. Our hypothesis was that many outpatients are not sufficiently familiar with the correct way of preparing for the laboratory tests, for which the individual needs to be at fasting. This study aimed to investigate: i) whether patients are aware of how they need to prepare properly for laboratory tests; ii) the way in which users are informed about how to prepare for laboratory testing; and iii) whether users arrive to the laboratory for phlebotomy properly prepared.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: An anonymous questionnaire was conducted on 150 outpatients older than 18 years, during February 2013. The response rate was 11%. All patients were interviewed by the laboratory staff. Patients were informed about detail of the questionnaire and agreed to participate in the survey.
RESULTS: Out of the total number subjects, 39% were fully aware of the proper definition of the fasting, whereas even 46% subjects replied that the last meal has to be taken the day before and the exact time that must pass after the last meal to blood sampling is not important. Furthermore, 52% subjects did not receive any information about how they need to prepare themselves properly for blood testing. Only 60% of them came properly prepared for the laboratory blood testing.
CONCLUSIONS: Substantial proportion of patients do not come properly prepared for laboratory testing. We conclude that patients are not well informed about the fasting requirements for laboratory blood testing. Moreover, requesting physician is the preferred source of information from which patients learn how to prepare themselves for phlebotomy."
24266309,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24266309/,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Bleeding from peptic ulcers can be effectively and safely treated with endoscopic hemoclips therapy. However, due to certain limiting factors of hemoclips, application of combination with another endoscopic method may give better results. The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy and safety of endoscopic hemoclips therapy and to evaluate potential benefits of this therapy combined with epinephrine in the treatment of bleeding peptic ulcers.
METHODS: This prospective randomized study included 70 patients with bleeding gastric or duodenal ulcer. In 34 of the patients endoscopic hemoclips therapy was applied (group I), and in 36 of them a combined therapy of hemoclips and epinephrine (group II).
RESULTS: Initial hemostasis was achieved in most patients treated with endoscopic hemoclips therapy (94.1%) as well as in the patients treated with combination therapy (97.2%). After initial hemostasis achieved rebleeding occurred in 3 (9.3%) patients treated with hemoclips and in 2 (5.7%) patients treated with combination therapy, but this difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). The difference in the achieved final hemostasis between the group I (91.1%) and the group II (94.4%) was not statistically significant. Also, the differences between the two groups of patients in the need for blood transfusions, length of hospital stay, need for surgery and mortality were not statistically significant (p > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Endoscopic hemoclips therapy is effective and safe in treatment of bleeding peptic ulcers. Combination therapy of hemoclips and epinephrine has no advantage over hemoclips monotherapy."

DESIGN: Prospective observational study.
SETTING: Large national tertiary referral center.
POPULATION: All singleton laboring nulliparous parturients delivering infants >500 g over a 2-year period, 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2009.
METHODS: Details of intrapartum characteristics and neonatal outcomes of deliveries occurring between midnight and 08.00 h were compared with deliveries occurring outside of these hours.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Maternal and neonatal morbidity.
RESULTS: During the study period there were 8450 nulliparous deliveries. 2668 (31.6%) delivered between midnight and 08.00 h, and 5782 (68.4%) outside of these hours. There was a significant difference between the time periods in the number of babies born with a cord pH <7.1: 10.8% (44/406) of babies were born between midnight and 08.00 h, and 6.3% (63/1007) of babies were born outside these hours (p = 0.003). There was no significant difference in terms of Apgar score <7 at 5 min (p = 0.17). There was a trend toward a larger number of anal sphincter injuries occurring between midnight and 08.00 h (3% vs. 2.3%; p = 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that infants are more likely to be born with a pH <7.1 and there was a trend toward an increased rate of anal sphincter injury during time periods when staffing levels are low and clinician fatigue may play a role in decision-making and patient management. This may play a role in service provision planning and staff recruitment."
24266698,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24266698/,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate pregnancy-related leading follicles during ovulation induction and superovulation with clomiphene citrate (CC) or gonadotropin.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort.
PATIENTS: Five hundred and forty-two women who underwent a total of 615 treatment cycles with CC or gonadotropin.
INTERVENTION: We evaluated the effects of CC and gonadotropin on the leading follicles, clinical pregnancy rates and miscarriage rate.
RESULTS: The number of follicles larger than 15 mm in the different protocols was comparable. In those treated with CC, the diameter of the dominant follicles before human chorionic gonadotropins (hCG) trigger in the conception cycles (20.4 ± 1.2 mm) was significantly larger than in the non-conception cycles (18.8 ± 1.9 mm). In women treated with gonadotropin, the diameter of the leading follicle in the conception cycles (18.5 ± 1.7 mm) was comparable to that in the non-conception cycles (18.2 ± 1.7 mm). The pregnancy-related diameter of the leading follicle in CC cycles (20.4 ± 1.2 mm) was significantly larger than that in gonadotropin cycles (18.8 ± 1.9 mm; p = 0.001; 95% CI, -2.2 to -0.9).
CONCLUSION: Pregnancy-related diameter of the leading follicle in CC cycles is significantly larger than that in gonadotropin cycles and the best time for hCG trigger in the CC cycle is when the leading follicle reaches 20 mm."
24266750,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24266750/,"PURPOSE: To assess application of cystatin C and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) as biomarkers for renal ischemic injury. We also evaluated the use of allopurinol as a renoprotective agent. A second goal was to assess cystatin C as a biomarker in patients undergoing partial nephrectomy.
METHODS: Using 58 Sprague-Dawley rats, we evaluated urinary cystatin C (n=26) and NGAL (n=32) as a biomarker for renal ischemia injury. Half of the rats were pretreated with allopurinol; the other cohort served as a control. The right renal hilum was ligated in all rats, thereby creating a solitary kidney model. After a 30-minute stabilization period, the left hilum was clamped for time periods of 15, 30, and 60 minutes. Urinary levels of cystatin C and NGAL were then measured at the following time points: Preclamp (after the 30-minute stabilization period) and postclamp (30, 45, and 60 minute periods after unclamping). For our clinical subjects, serum cystatin C levels (n=17) were obtained preoperatively, at the induction of anesthesia before robot-assisted partial nephrectomy, immediately postoperatively, and on postoperative days 1 and 2. Three of these patients had their tumors excised off clamp and served as controls. We then estimated glomerular filtration rate by using the Creatinine-Cystatin C Equation.
RESULTS: Urinary levels of cystatin C and NGAL increased after renal clamping. The 30-minute period of ischemia demonstrated the greatest increase of these biomarkers. Allopurinol did appear to serve a renoprotective function in those animals undergoing 30-minute clamp times. In our clinical patients, the serum cystatin C levels did increase at each postoperative time point, but remained nonelevated in the control group.
CONCLUSIONS: Cystatin C and NGAL both appear to be useful biomarkers of renal injury. Studies with larger numbers are needed, however. Also, allopurinol does exhibit renoprotective effects against ischemic injury."
24267109,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24267109/,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the urodynamic characteristics of the two patterns (phasic, P and terminal, T) of detrusor overactivity (DO) according to gender and neurological condition.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Urodynamic characteristics of DO were analysed in a population with proven urodynamic DO (127 women and 76 men, respectively with 48 and 43 neurological diseases (encephalic, incomplete medullar lesion or peripheral)). Phasic DO is characterized by phasic waves with or without leakage while terminal DO is defined by a single non-inhibited contraction resulting in incontinence. Parameters analysed for both patterns of DO (among other parameters) included: volume and amplitude of the first non-inhibited detrusor contraction (NIDC#1), and for phasic DO: duration of pressure rise during NIDC#1 and number of NIDC.
RESULTS: Phasic DO was observed in younger patients in the whole population whatever the gender (women: 55.9 years vs. 64.7 years, p = 0.0052; men: 57.4 years vs. 67.8 years, p = 0.0038). Volume at NIDC#1 was greater for neurological PDO (significant in women: 185 vs. 125 mL, p = 0.0223). Other parameters were not significantly different whatever the gender. Amplitude of NIDC#1 during PDO was significantly lower than that of NIDC during terminal DO (TDO) in both genders whatever the neurological condition (p < 0.0001). Volume at NIDC#1 in both patterns was dependent on the level of neurological lesion.
CONCLUSION: The main difference between the patterns of DO is that PDO occurs in younger individuals. There is no significant difference between urodynamic characteristics of each pattern whatever gender or neurological status. Further studies will provide additional information on the impact of the level of neurological lesion on the pattern of DO."
24267122,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24267122/,"PURPOSE: To report the outcomes of patients with pathologic T4 UTUC and investigate the potential impact of peri-operative chemotherapy combined with radical nephroureterectomy (RNU) and regional lymph node dissection (LND) on oncologic outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with pathologic T4 UTUC were identified from the cohort of 1464 patients treated with RNU at 13 academic centers between 1987 and 2007. Oncologic outcomes were stratified according to utilization of perioperative systemic chemotherapy and regional LND as an adjunct to RNU.
RESULTS: The study included 69 patients, 42 males (61%) with median age 73 (range 43-98). Median follow-up was 17 months (range: 6-88). Lymphovascular invasion was found in 47 (68%) and regional lymph node metastases were found in 31 (45%). Peri-operative chemotherapy was utilized in 29 (42%) patients. Patients treated with peri-operative chemotherapy and RNU with LND demonstrated superior oncologic outcomes compared to those not treated by chemotherapy and/or LND during RNU (3Y-DFS: 35% vs. 10%; P = 0.02 and 3Y-CSS: 28% vs. 14%; P = 0.08). In multivariate Cox regression analysis, administration of peri-operative chemotherapy and utilization of LND during RNU was associated with lower probability of recurrence (HR: 0.4, P = 0.01), and cancer specific mortality (HR: 0.5, P = 0.06).
CONCLUSIONS: Pathological T4 UTUC is associated with poor prognosis. Peri-operative chemotherapy combined with aggressive surgery, including lymph node dissection, may improve oncological outcomes. Our findings support the use of aggressive multimodal treatment in patients with advanced UTUC."
24267365,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24267365/,"BACKGROUND: Myxomycete spores are present in the outdoor air but have not been studied for allergenicity.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) symptoms are sensitized to myxomycete spores.
METHODS: Myxomycete specimens were collected in the field. Nine species of myxomycetes were collected and identified: Arcyria cinerea, Ceratiomyxa fruticulosa, Fuligo septica, Hemitrichia clavata, Lycogala epidendrum, Metatrichia vesparium, Stemonitis nigrescens, Tubifera ferruginosa, and Trichea favoginea. Allergen extracts were made for each species. Protein content of each extract was measured by bicinchoninic acid assay. Protein electrophoresis was performed. Subjects with a history of SAR symptoms were enrolled, and allergy skin prick testing was performed with each extract.
RESULTS: Protein content of the extracts ranged from 1.05 to 5.8 mg/mL. Protein bands were seen at 10 to 250 kD. Allergy prick testing was performed in 69 subjects; 42% of subjects had positive prick test results for at least 1 myxomycete extract, with 9% to 22% reacting to each extract. Five of the 12 subjects who tested negative for all allergens on the standard aeroallergen panel had positive prick test results for myxomycetes.
CONCLUSION: Forty-two percent of subjects with SAR were sensitized to myxomycete spores. A significant subset of subjects who had SAR symptoms and otherwise negative skin test results showed sensitization to myxomycetes. These spores are present in the outdoor air during the summer and autumn and might be significant aeroallergens."
24267518,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24267518/,"AIMS: In females, columnar cell lesions (CCLs) have been recognized as putative precursor lesions of low-grade breast cancer, but their role in male breast carcinogenesis is as yet unclear.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We reviewed surgical resections from males with breast cancer (n = 89), gynaecomastia (n = 20) and normal breast specimens from autopsies (n = 5) for the presence of CCL. In addition, we performed immunohistochemistry for cytokeratin 5/6 (CK5/6), CK14 and oestrogen receptor alpha (ER). In 19 of 89 resections (two DCIS cases and 17 invasive carcinoma), some individual ducts were found to contain cells with snouts on the luminal border but lacking further typical columnar cell lesion features. We mainly found three-layered ductal epithelium, characteristic for gynaecomastia and confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Moreover, we found a few ducts in male breast cancer sections that were clonally negative for basal cytokeratins.
CONCLUSION: We found no lesions with convincing CCL morphology at the periphery of invasive male breast cancers, in gynaecomastia or in normal male breast specimens. Although we cannot completely exclude the existence of CCLs in the male breast, these lesions seem to be very uncommon and are therefore unlikely to play a major role in male breast carcinogenesis."
24267780,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24267780/,"OBJECTIVES: Patients with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries can present with tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and Ebsteinoid dysplasia of the tricuspid valve. To determine the fate of the tricuspid valve after anatomic repair and the effectiveness of tricuspid valvuloplasty, we reviewed our experience with anatomic repair of congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries.
METHODS: From 1992 to 2012, 106 patients with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries underwent anatomic repair. Of the 106 patients, 24 (22.6%) had moderate or greater TR before anatomic repair, 14 of whom had Ebsteinoid dysplasia. Nine patients (8.5%) had Ebsteinoid dysplasia without significant TR, and 73 patients (68.9%) had neither TR nor dysplasia.
RESULTS: Of the 106 patients, 6 (5.6%) with TR underwent tricuspid valvuloplasty at anatomic repair, 5 with (21%) and 1 without (11%) Ebsteinoid dysplasia (P < .001). During a median follow-up period of 32 months, of the 24 patients with TR before anatomic repair, all 6 who had undergone tricuspid valvuloplasty had mild TR or less at the latest follow-up visit; 15 of the 18 (83%) without valvuloplasty had mild TR or less (P = .4) and 3 (16.7%) had moderate or greater TR. Of the 14 patients with Ebsteinoid dysplasia and TR, 5 underwent valvuloplasty and had no significant TR during follow-up; 2 of the 9 (22.2%) without valvuloplasty had moderate or greater TR (P = .51). Valvuloplasty was associated with an absolute risk of TR reduction of 16.7%, which was further reduced by 22.2% in patients with associated Ebsteinoid dysplasia.
CONCLUSIONS: Tricuspid valve function significantly improved after anatomic repair, independent of direct surgical intervention. For significant TR associated with Ebsteinoid dysplasia, valvuloplasty should be considered."
24267854,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24267854/,"BACKGROUND: Concern exists regarding differential performance of candidates in postgraduate clinical assessments by ethnicity, sex, and country of primary qualification. Could examiner bias be responsible?
AIM: To explore whether candidate demographics affect examiners' judgements, by investigating candidates' case performances by candidates' and examiners' demographics.
DESIGN AND SETTING: Data on 4000 candidates (52,000 cases) sitting the MRCGP clinical skills assessment in 2011-2012.
METHOD: Univariate analyses were undertaken of subgroup performance (male/female, white/black and minority ethnic (BME), UK/non-UK graduates) by parallel examiner demographics. Due to confounding of variables, these were complemented by multivariate ANOVA and multiple regression analyses.
RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed some differences between outcomes between the same-group and other-group examiners: these were contradictory regarding examiners 'favouring their own', for example, males received higher marks from female examiners than from males: maximum effect size was 3.6%. A six-way ANOVA confirmed all three candidate and examiner variables as having significant effects individually, identifying one significant interaction (examiner sex by examiner ethnicity). Stepwise regression showed candidate variables predicting 12% of score variance, parallel examiner demographics adding little (approximately 0.2% of variance). One 'transactional' variable proved significant, explaining 0.06% of score variance.
CONCLUSION: Examiners show no general tendency to 'favour their own kind'. With confounding between variables, as far as the impact on candidates' case scores, substantial effects relate to candidate and not examiner characteristics. Candidate-examiner interaction effects were inconsistent in their direction and slight in their calculated impact."
24267971,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24267971/,"PURPOSE: Pseudoprogression (PP) during adjuvant treatment of glioblastoma (GBM) is frequent and is a clinically and radiologically challenging problem. While there are several reports of the frequency of PP in GBM cohorts including mainly patients with primary GBM, there are few data on the incidence of PP in patients with secondary glioblastomas (sGBM). Therefore, the goal of this study was to evaluate the frequency of PP in sGBM.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: We retrospectively evaluated the incidence of PP in adult patients with sGBM treated with chemoradiation therapy (CRTx) using temozolomide (TMZ) and sought to assess if there was an association between PP and MGMT promoter methylation status, IDH mutations status, or 1p/19q codeletion. The definition of PP according to the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Working Group was used.
RESULTS: None of the evaluable 15 sGBM patients in our series demonstrated a PP. Of the 9 sGBM patients who received concomitant CRTx with TMZ, 6 patients had the methylated MGMT promoter, and 6 patients had IDH mutations. There also was no PP identified in sGBM patients who received sequential CRTx, irrespective of MGMT or IDH status. The median time of follow-up was 3.4 years after diagnosis of an sGBM, and the median overall survival was 18.2 months (range, 14.3-45.2 months). Three of 15 patients had previously received radiation therapy for their World Health Organization low-grade 2 glioma, while none of them had received chemotherapy at that stage.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on this small series of sGBM patients treated with CRTx (concomitantly or sequentially) the frequency of PP appears to be very low in sGBM, even in those patients with methylated MGMT promoter or IDH mutations. Our results highlight the differences between primary glioblastomas and sGBM in particular as they relate to PP."
24268053,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24268053/,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study is to examine whether women who have undergone cesarean deliveries on maternal request (CDMR) have a higher utilization of outpatient and inpatient obstetric and gynecological services than do those with vaginal deliveries (VD).
METHODS: We use two population-based claims datasets to trace the six-month, one-year, and two-year postpartum periods (PP) medical care utilizations by women who have undergone CDMRs or VDs during 2002 in Taiwan. The paper analyses the utilization of services through logistic, negative binomial, linear, and log-linear regressions based on the data types.
RESULTS: We find that CDMRs are associated with a greater utilization of medical care than are VDs. Compared to mothers who have undergone VDs, those who underwent CDMRs have a greater likelihood to have additional outpatient visits (by 9.6% for six-month PP and 7.5% for one-year PP) and re-hospitalization (by 0.24%, 0.3%, and 0.66% for the three PPs, respectively), more outpatient revisits (by 0.47, 0.66, and 1.07, respectively), greater outpatient expenditure (by NT$324 for one-year PP) and inpatient expenditure (by NT$6178, NT$5992, and NT$5484, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Cesarean deliveries on maternal request lead to significant negative outcomes during the postpartum period, which should be taken into account in the cost-benefit calculation."

METHODS: Was measured: the lumbar and femoral BMD by dual energy X-Ray absorptiometer, calcium and protein intake by a week frequencies questionnaire, and calciuria. Obesity, exercise, alcohol, tobacco and family history of osteoporosis were considered. Levels of BMD < -1SD was considered as osteopenia.
RESULTS: Calcium intake average was 989 mg/day, 62% by dairy. Twenty-five percent presented osteopenia in some bone site. BMD was not correlated with calcium or protein intake, calcium/protein nor calciuria. No differences was found between normal and osteopenic group for any of the studied variables, except lower body mass index in the femoral osteopenic group. Those women who decreased the calcium intake from adolescence had 8.2% less femoral BMD tha those who increased the consumption (p = 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Current and adolescent calcium intake, family history of osteoporosi calciuria, and exercise have not found useful as screening of osteopenia in premenopausal women with moderated exercise level and low consumption of alcohol and tobacco."
9543560,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9543560/,"OBJECTIVE: To search for evidence of actinic elastotic degeneration (actinic arteriopathy) and giant cell arteritis (GCA) in the posterior ciliary arteries of eyes from aged white Australians.
METHODS: Three hundred donor eyes were given to us by the Lions Eye Bank of New South Wales at Sydney Hospital. Of these, 146 formed the basis of this study. Portions of the posterior ciliary arteries located in relation to the optic nerve heads were processed in paraffin and were then stained by a sensitive haematoxylin and eosin stain that had been especially developed to display actinic elastotic degeneration of elastic tissue.
RESULTS: Among 60 ""aged"" subjects (70-90 yrs.), a total of 41 (approximately 68%) showed definite changes of actinic elastotic degeneration in their laminae, a condition called actinic arteriopathy. One of these subjects revealed giant cells on degenerate lamina, giving a picture regarded as early (pre-clinical) GCA. A young ""control"" group of 60 subjects 17-59 years of age revealed only one subject with a similar degree of actinic arteriopathy.
CONCLUSIONS: Actinic arteriopathy of the posterior ciliary arteries was more frequent and advanced in the ""aged"", over-70 group as compared with changes in the ""young"" group < 60 years of age. One aged subject without a history of eye disease showed giant cells associated with elastotically degenerate internal elastic lamina. Her fortuitous lesions are regarded as indicative of how GCA is likely to begin in the damaged arteries."
9543642,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9543642/,"PURPOSE: Compensatory responses to focusing errors imposed by spectacle lenses in chicks, tree shrews and primates leave little doubt that active emmetropization can occur, and debate is now centered on whether this process is uni-directional or bi-directional in nature. To provide further insight into this emmetropization process, the studies reported in this paper addressed the question of whether access to sharp vision is necessary for compensation to myopic defocus in the chick.
METHODS: Two different experimental paradigms were used to address the above question: (A) Myopic defocus was imposed, either with +15 or +40 d lenses alone or with +15 D lenses on eyes made myopic by 7 days of form deprivation; these treatments result in a shift in the plane of focus of the eye (far point) to 6.67, 2.5 cm and approximately 3.5 cm resp., with only objects at or closer than these planes being in focus. The addition to the lenses of stand-off cones, either 2.5 or 5 cm in length, further limited access to (or precluded) sharp vision by controlling how closely the chicks could approach objects. One group that had sharp vision precluded also underwent optic nerve section. (B) A range of positive lenses (+15 to +65 D) were used on their own to impose myopic defocus; for the high power lenses, access to sharp vision was very restricted because of the close proximity of the new far point (1.54 cm for +65 D lens). Refractive errors and axial ocular dimensions were measured in all experiments.
RESULTS: In the first study (A), preclusion of sharp vision not only prevented compensation but resulted in increased eye growth and myopia. This myopia, like form-deprivation myopia, was unaltered by optic nerve section surgery. Limiting but not precluding sharp vision resulted in partial compensation. In the second study (B), good compensation was observed with the +15 D lens but compensation progressively declined for higher powers, with the +50 D lens having no apparent effect on eye growth and refraction and the +65 D lens inducing myopia instead of hyperopia.
CONCLUSIONS: Together these results argue that some sharp vision is fundamental to compensation to impose myopia. The significance of this new finding in relation to the processes underlying active emmetropization is discussed."
9544596,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9544596/,"OBJECTIVES: Data from 536 primary care patients initiating antidepressant treatment were used to examine the performance of the Medical Outcomes Study SF-36 Physical Component and Mental Component summary scores.
METHODS: The SF-36 was administered at baseline and readministered after 1 month and 3 months (n = 482).
RESULTS: At the baseline assessment, patients reported modest impairment on the Physical Function, Role--Physical, Bodily Pain, and General Health Perceptions subscales (0.10 to 0.68 standard deviations below national norms), but the Physical Component summary (mean = 51) indicated no impairment based on a population norm of 50. During 3 months of follow-up evaluation, the Physical Function, Role--Physical, Bodily Pain, and General Health Perceptions subscales all showed moderate and statistically significant improvement (range from 0.28 to 0.49 standard deviation units), whereas the Physical Component summary score was essentially unchanged (mean = 50 at both 1-month and 3-month assessments). This pattern of results is a natural consequence of the assumptions and methods used to calculate these summary scores-orthogonal factor rotation and negative scoring coefficients.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest caution in the interpretation of Mental Component Summary and Physical Component Summary scores when the condition or treatment of interest has strong effects on scales with negative scoring coefficients (Mental Health and Role--Emotional for the Physical Component; Physical Function, Role--Physical, and Bodily Pain for the Mental Component)."
9545841,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9545841/,"UNLABELLED: The frequency of adverse effects caused by doctors may serve as a quality control. We therefore assessed the number of adverse effects leading to a hospital admission and occurring during a six-month period in the medical department of a district hospital. We compared these figures with the number of admissions caused by substance-abuse by the patient himself.
RESULTS: At admission to hospital 35 patients (6.4%) suffered from adverse effects. In 89% of these, the adverse effect was the leading factor to admit the patient; in the remaining 4 patients (11%) the adverse effect was detected by routine-screening upon admission. Further 8.6% developed adverse effects in the hospital which in 12.5% had consequences upon course and duration of the hospitalization. Self-afflicted hospital-admissions (substance-abuse, suicide-attempts) were found in 13%. Iatrogenic adverse effects brought 3.5% of the patients to the hospital.
CONCLUSIONS: Adverse effects caused by diagnostic and therapeutic activities of doctors considerably contribute to hospital-admissions and course of hospital-stay, but even more often the patient himself is responsible by his self-damaging behavior."
9546003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9546003/,"OBJECTIVE: While pharmacological interventions are of established utility in bulimia nervosa, medications have no clear role in the treatment of anorexia nervosa. Because patients with anorexia nervosa frequently exhibit mood disturbances and symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder, the authors tested the utility of fluoxetine in the treatment of women participating in an inpatient program for anorexia nervosa.
METHOD: The authors conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 7-week study of fluoxetine at a target daily dose of 60 mg in 31 women with anorexia nervosa receiving treatment for their eating disorder on a clinical research unit. Body weight and measures of eating behavior and psychological state were obtained at baseline and at termination.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in clinical outcome on any measure between patients receiving fluoxetine and patients receiving placebo.
CONCLUSIONS: Fluoxetine does not appear to add significant benefit to the inpatient treatment of anorexia nervosa."
9546230,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9546230/,"PURPOSE: To investigate the relation between endoleaks and intraaneurysmal pressure (IAP) and the effect of coil embolization in the management of endoleaks.
METHODS: The infrarenal aorta of a dog (n = 15) was replaced by a polytetrafluoroethylene aneurysm containing a pressure transducer. Group I (n = 4) had untreated aneurysms. Group II (n = 4) had endovascularly excluded aneurysms without an endoleak. Group III (n = 7) had aneurysms excluded by means of grafts with a defect that represented the source of an endoleak. After 4 weeks of follow-up study, the endoleaks in group III dogs were subjected to coil embolization. Systolic IAP was measured daily and expressed as a ratio of systolic blood pressure obtained from a forelimb cuff. Arteriography, duplex ultrasonography, and spiral contrast computed tomography were performed to evaluate endoleaks.
RESULTS: In group I, the LAP remained close to systolic blood pressure (ratio of 0.96 +/- 0.06), whereas in group II the IAP ratio showed a decline to 0.34 +/- 0.16 (p = 0.0009 group I versus II). After an initial decrease, the IAP ratio in group III stabilized at 0.75 +/- 0.18 (p = 0.003, group II versus III). Aneurysms with an endoleak remained pulsatile with a pulse pressure of 30 +/- 16 mm Hg, which was less than that of untreated aneurysms (62 +/- 15 mm Hg; p < 0.0001 group I versus III). Arteriography and computed tomography revealed ""sealing"" of endoleaks after coil embolization, but IAP ratio did not decrease (0.76 +/- 0.14) after coil embolization.
CONCLUSIONS: Incomplete endovascular aneurysm exclusion caused by an endoleak fails to reduce IAP ratio and may subject the aneurysm to a continued risk for rupture. Although coil embolization resulted in angiographic and computed tomographic sealing, it failed to reduce IAP ratio."
9546569,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9546569/,"OBJECTIVE: To review the validity of the clinical assessment and diagnostic tests in patients with suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
METHODS: A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted by searching MEDLINE from 1966 to April 1997.
RESULTS: Individual symptoms and signs alone do not reliably predict which patients have DVT. Overall, the diagnostic properties of the clinical examination are poor; the sensitivity of the clinical examination ranges from 60% to 96%, and the specificity ranges from 20% to 72%. However, using specific combinations of risk factors, symptoms, and physical signs for DVT, clinicians can reliably stratify patients with suspected DVT into low, moderate, or high pretest probability categories of actually suffering from DVT. This stratification process in combination with noninvasive testing, such as compression ultrasonography, simplifies the management strategies for patients with suspected DVT.
CONCLUSIONS: Use of a clinical prediction guide that includes specific factors from both the history and physical examination in combination with noninvasive tests simplifies management strategies for patients with suspected DVT."
9547668,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9547668/,"OBJECTIVE: A study was undertaken to assess the procedural validity of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) for the diagnosis of eating disorders.
METHOD: The CIDI was administered to 44 patients consecutively admitted to an eating disorders unit. CIDI-generated diagnoses were compared with clinical diagnoses documented in patient files. Discrepancies between diagnoses were examined in detail.
RESULTS: A significant level of disagreement was apparent, particularly for anorexia nervosa patients. A large number of patients with symptoms requiring inpatient treatment did not reach criteria using CIDI's diagnostic algorithm.
CONCLUSION: Considerable difficulties remain in the use of standardized assessments, such as the CIDI, to diagnose eating disorders. While presenting features of the illness, for example, ego syntonic nature of the illness, secrecy, and denial, may be part of the reason, the questions used by the CIDI appear to be in need of some refinement."
9547958,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9547958/,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of a variety of tests in differentiating simulating test performances from genuine memory-impaired and normal (control) test performances.
DESIGN: A simulation design was implemented, based on an analogue design in which normal participants were given experimental instructions to feign a mental impairment and are compared to (a) other normal participants with instructions to perform honestly, and (b) a comparison group, for example, acquired brain-injured persons, with similar instructions.
METHOD: Forty individuals comprised the simulating and control group and all participants were randomly assigned to the simulating and control groups. Twenty memory-impaired patients, all of whom had been diagnosed as suffering from a memory impairment following acquired brain damage, participated as the memory-impaired control group. The simulation group was directed to imitate a person with a memory impairment. The primary outcome measure involved identifying those tests, if any, where simulators were significantly different from normal and memory-impaired participants.
RESULTS: On 5 of the 15 tasks administered, simulators performed significantly differently from normal and memory-impaired participants. Of these 5 tasks, the coin-in-the-hand, when administered in conjunction with the autobiographical interview, identified 95 per cent of the simulators without misclassifying any of the memory-impaired or normal participants.
CONCLUSION: It is suggested that these two tests, when administered jointly, might be of use in clinical settings to assist in the detection of malingerers."
9547959,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9547959/,"OBJECTIVES: Two experiments investigating the presence of information-processing biases on tasks of attention (Stroop task) and memory (free recall) in relation to mood states in chronic pain patients are reported. The first investigates whether previously reported attentional bias is a function of pain status or mood state. The second describes a more detailed examination of the roles of anxiety and depression in processing biases in chronic pain patients.
DESIGN AND METHOD: Both studies compared interference time on an emotional Stroop task between chronic pain patients and controls. Other measures included self-report of pain, depression and anxiety.
RESULTS: Neither study found evidence for an attentional bias, although a memory recall bias was demonstrated.
CONCLUSIONS: Interference in attending to emotionally salient stimuli appears to be related to measures of anxiety and depression rather than pain per se. When added to the findings of other investigators, these results suggest that the presence of attentional biases in chronic pain patients can best be accounted for as arising from mood state rather than pain-patient status."
9548036,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9548036/,"BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: There is controversy concerning the need for an antireflux procedure in patients undergoing open or endoscopic cardiomyotomy for achalasia. The addition of an antireflux wrap (partial or total), while preventing reflux, may result in persistence or incomplete relief of dysphagia in patients with total oesophageal aperistalsis. The technique of laparoscopic cardiomyotomy used in Dundee preserves the lateral and posterior attachments of the gastro-oesophageal junction, and was designed to minimize the risk of gastro-oesophageal reflux.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A consecutive series of patients with achalasia (n = 19) were treated by laparoscopic cardiomyotomy using the Dundee technique, which limits the mobilization to the anterior wall of the abdominal and thoracic oesophagus. The patients were followed up prospectively to assess the long-term relief of dysphagia and the postoperative incidence of reflux symptoms, with or without oesophagitis.
RESULTS: The follow-up symptoms and assessment of the patients (15-53 months, median 27 months) showed total relief (n = 12) or substantial relief (n = 5) of dysphagia in 89%. On assessment at a median follow-up of 27 months, the number of patients experiencing heartburn after this operation increased from four of 15 to five of 15, and one patient (6.6%) developed endoscopically proved oesophagitis, with a positive oesophageal pH monitoring test.
CONCLUSIONS: The routine addition of an antireflux operation is not justified in patients undergoing laparoscopic cardiomyotomy, provided that the lateral and posterior attachment of the oesophagus are kept intact."
9549003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9549003/,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine whether or not regular multivitamin/mineral supplementation can modify the relation between maternal smoking and preterm birth (gestational age < 37 weeks), very-low-birthweight (VLBW) (< 1500 g), moderately-low-birthweight (MLBW) (< 2499 g), or small-for-gestational-age (SGA) (< 10th percentile of birth weight for gestational age).
METHODS: Live birth data from the 1988 National Maternal and Infant Health Survey (NMIHS) were used for the analysis. Maternal smoking referred to self-reported average number of cigarettes smoked after recognition of pregnancy, while regular multivitamin/mineral supplementation referred to use of multivitamin/mineral supplements for at least three days per week during the three months before and/or after recognition of pregnancy. Sample sizes included 9402 singleton infants for the analysis of preterm birth, 9395 for very or moderately low birthweight, and 9363 for small-for-gestational-age. Odds ratios were derived from logistic regression analyses after adjusting for a number of demographic and reproductive variables.
RESULTS: Major results include: 1) increased risks for the adverse outcomes studied were observed among smoking women; 2) no effect of regular multivitamin/mineral supplementation in the absence of maternal smoking was revealed; and 3) relative excess risks due to interaction at different smoking levels and overall interactions between smoking and supplementation were not observed.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that regular multivitamin/mineral supplementation does not minimize the adverse effects associated with maternal smoking."
9549394,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9549394/,"INTRODUCTION: Determination of pulmonary to systemic blood flow ratio (QP/QS) is considered to be important for the management of patients with atrial septal defect. The QP/QS provides information on shunt severity and is usually determined by three methods: oximetry, first-pass radionuclide angiocardiography and Doppler echocardiography. The aim of the present study was to assess the accuracy and concordance level of these three methods in QP/QS quantification in atrial septal defects.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-four adult atrial septal defects patients in whom QP/QS was determined by these three methods with a 6 month interval were studied. Nuclear and echocardiographic post-surgical studies were repeated in 36 patients.
RESULTS: QP/QS values determined by the three techniques had a low correlation between them: oximetry (r = 0.52; SEE = 0.74); radionuclide angiocardiography (r = 0.40; SEE = 0.79) and Doppler echocardiography (r = 0.72; SEE = 0.57). Radionuclide angiocardiography underestimated QP/QS > 3 (-0.61 +/- 1.21; p < 0.01). Only in 33% of studies there concordance (differences < 0.5) among the three methods and in 58% between two methods. Right ventricular dilatation and tricuspid regurgitation influenced radionuclide accuracy. Nevertheless, the correlation between this technique and echocardiography was satisfactory when the 36 post-surgical were included (r = 0.75); both techniques agreed in the diagnosis of the two cases with residual post-surgical shunt.
CONCLUSIONS: Inter-method disparity in QP/QS quantification is high and no method can be used as a gold standard; clinical decisions therefore based on QP/QS quantification by one technique alone are ill-advised."

STUDY DESIGN: The neonatal outcome in 76 closely matched low birth weight infants was compared retrospectively: those whose mothers received indomethacin together with betamimetics formed the study group, those whose mothers received only betamimetics formed the control group.
RESULTS: There was an increased incidence of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in the study group (97% versus 45%; P<0.001), an increased need for surfactant use (68% versus 26%; P<0.001) and increased ventilatory support, and an increased incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) (47% versus 24%; P=0.03). Gestation could not be prolonged significantly by the addition of indomethacin.
CONCLUSION: Indomethacin as an additional tocolytic agent was associated with an increased incidence of RDS, surfactant use and BPD but did not significantly prolong gestation."
9550643,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9550643/,"BACKGROUND: Elevated homocysteine concentrations have been associated with premature arteriosclerosis and with impairment of key methylation reactions through accumulation of the homocysteine metabolite S-adenosylhomocysteine. In end-stage renal failure high homocysteine concentrations are commonly found but thus far the concentrations of related adenosylated metabolites in plasma have not been assessed.
METHODS: In this prospective study we determined plasma homocysteine and related metabolites in 25 patients on regular haemodialysis, and in 40 healthy volunteers. Blood samples from patients were drawn immediately before and in 10 patients additionally after the dialysis session.
RESULTS: Folic acid and vitamin B12 in plasma were similar in patients (mean +/- SEM 25+/-2 nmol/l and 400+/-41 pmol/l respectively) and controls (24+/-3 and 324+/-23 respectively). In patients plasma homocysteine, S-adenosylmethionine and S-adenosylhomocysteine were markedly elevated (36.6+/-3.6 micromol/l, 381+/-32nmol/l and 1074+/-55 nmol/l respectively) compared to the control values (6.8+/-0.4 micromol/l, 60+/-3 nmol/l and 24.4+/-1.1 nmol/l respectively) whereas the molar ratio of plasma S-adenosylmethionine and S-adenosylhomocysteine was significantly decreased (0.36+/-0.02 and 2.7+/-0.2 in patients and controls respectively). Haemodialysis failed to normalize the abnormal levels of these metabolites.
CONCLUSION: Since the ratio of S-adenosylmethionine : S-adenosylhomocysteine is closely linked to the activity of numerous enzymatic methylation reactions, these results suggest that methylation may be impaired in these patients."

RESULTS: Blood pressure was higher in men, and in those with higher body mass index. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure were correlated with the derived kidney volume. However, when corrected for age, sex and BMI the relationship was not statistically significant. Blood pressure correlated inversely with the width : length ratio of the left kidney.
CONCLUSIONS: Blood pressure was not correlated with kidney size in this group of adults."
9550954,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9550954/,"OBJECTIVE: To test the clinical equivalence and resource consequences of day care with inpatient care for active rheumatoid arthritis.
DESIGN: Randomised controlled clinical trial with integrated cost minimisation economic evaluation.
SETTING: Rheumatic diseases unit at a teaching hospital between 1994 and 1996.
SUBJECTS: 118 consecutive patients with active rheumatoid arthritis randomised to receive either day care or inpatient care.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical assessments recorded on admission, discharge, and follow up at 12 months comprised: the health assessment questionnaire, Ritchie articular index, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, hospital anxiety and depression scale, and Steinbrocker functional class. Resource estimates were of the direct and indirect costs relating to treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. Secondary outcome measures (health utility) were ascertained by time trade off and with the quality of well being scale.
RESULTS: Both groups had improvement in scores on the health assessment questionnaire and Ritchie index and erythrocyte sedimentation rate after hospital treatment (P < 0.0001) but clinical outcome did not differ significantly between the groups either at discharge or follow up. The mean hospital cost per patient for day care, 798 Pounds (95% confidence interval 705 Pounds to 888 Pounds), was lower than for inpatient care, 1253 Pounds (1155 Pounds to 1370 Pounds), but this difference was offset by higher community, travel, and readmission costs. The difference in total cost per patient between day care and inpatient care was small (1789 Pounds (1539 Pounds to 2027 Pounds) v 2021 Pounds (1834 Pounds to 2230 Pounds)). Quantile regression analysis showed a cost difference in favour of day care up to the 50th centile (374 Pounds; 639 Pounds to 109 Pounds).
CONCLUSIONS: Day care and inpatient care for patients with uncomplicated active rheumatoid arthritis have equivalent clinical outcome with a small difference in overall resource cost in favour of day care. The choice of management strategy may depend increasingly on convenience, satisfaction, or more comprehensive health measures reflecting the preferences of patients, providers, and service commissioners."

9551051,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9551051/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the advantages and disadvantages of two different transabdominal approaches to expose the pararenal aorta; infacolic (IC) and medical visceral rotation (MVR).
DESIGN: Retrospective study.
METHODS: We reviewed a consecutive series of concurrently treated patients undergoing combined aortorenal reconstruction using one of these two approaches (IC n = 45; MVR n = 30).
RESULTS: The two groups were identical with respect to demographics, risk factors and associated illnesses. Aortic aneurysmal disease predominated among MVR patients, and occlusive disease among IC patients (p = 0.001). The most common aortic reconstruction was aortofemoral bypass grafting. Renal revascularisation was most often performed for symptoms; only in the MVR group it was the result of involvement by aortic aneurysmal disease (p = 0.000). Thromboendarterectomy was the most common renal reconstruction, though performed only 10 times in the MVR group (p = 0.01). Except for supraceliac aortic cross-clamping, which was required more often in the MVR group (p = 0.004), operative details did not differ between the groups. Although the overall perioperative mortality and complication rate were equal, intraoperative splenic injury occurred solely in the MVR group (p = 0.001), and these patients experienced more pulmonary complications (p = 0.004) and they were hospitalised longer than the IC group (29.7 +/- 35.8 vs. 17.2 +/- 15.4 days; p = 0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: MVR has increased morbidity, but its unrestricted continuous exposure is optimum for combined aortorenal reconstruction involving pararenal aneurysmal disease. Pararenal occlusive disease is adequately exposed in most cases by the IC approach."
9551280,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9551280/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether clinical trials originating in certain countries always have positive results.
DATA SOURCES: Abstracts of trials from Medline (January 1966-June 1995).
STUDY SELECTION: Two separate studies were conducted. The first included trials in which the clinical outcome of a group of subjects receiving acupuncture was compared to that of a group receiving placebo, no treatment, or a nonacupuncture intervention. In the second study, randomized or controlled trials of interventions other than acupuncture that were published in China, Japan, Russia/USSR, or Taiwan were compared to those published in England.
DATA EXTRACTION: Blinded reviewers determined inclusion and outcome and separately classified each trial by country of origin.
DATA SYNTHESIS: In the study of acupuncture trials, 252 of 1085 abstracts met the inclusion criteria. Research conducted in certain countries was uniformly favorable to acupuncture; all trials originating in China, Japan, Hong Kong, and Taiwan were positive, as were 10 out of 11 of those published in Russia/USSR. In studies that examined interventions other than acupuncture, 405 of 1100 abstracts met the inclusion criteria. Of trials published in England, 75% gave the test treatment as superior to control. The results for China, Japan, Russia/USSR, and Taiwan were 99%, 89%, 97%, and 95%, respectively. No trial published in China or Russia/USSR found a test treatment to be ineffective.
CONCLUSIONS: Some countries publish unusually high proportions of positive results. Publication bias is a possible explanation. Researchers undertaking systematic reviews should consider carefully how to manage data from these countries."

METHODS: We studied 48 patients with biopsy-proven, hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid positive chronic hepatitis treated with interferon: 18 were ""Sustained Responders"", 12 ""Relapsers"" and 18 ""Non-Responders"".
RESULTS: Relapsers showed higher basal levels of alpha-glutathione-S-transferases, which remained higher than normal even when alanine aminotransferases normalized. No correlation was documented between alpha-glutathione-S-transferase levels and all other parameters examined (alanine aminotransferases, gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase, viremia, and histological activity index).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that alpha-glutathione-S-transferase levels may be considered a predictive index of response to interferon therapy in chronic hepatitis C patients."
9552048,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9552048/,"PURPOSE: An allogeneic polyvalent melanoma cell vaccine (PMCV) has been shown to be efficacious in improving overall survival of patients with malignant melanoma in a phase II clinical setting. The PMCV consists of three allogeneic melanoma cell lines. The objectives of the study were to determine (1) whether the survival of melanoma patients who received PMCV was related to the patient's human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I phenotype matching the HLA class I phenotype of the PMCV, and (2) whether PMCV clinical efficacy was correlated to melanoma patients with a particular HLA phenotype(s).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: PMCV was given to 69 melanoma patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage I to IV disease status. The PMCV and patients lymphocytes were typed for HLA-A and -B. A correlation was made between the HLA expression of PMCV lines and the HLA of patients to their survival status. A second correlation was made between the HLA of patients and survival independent of the PMCV HLA phenotype.
RESULTS: Patients whose HLA phenotype (A3/11 and B7/44) matched the PMCV lines had a better overall survival (P < .029). Analysis of HLA expression of patients independent of PMCV HLA to survival showed that HLA-A25 phenotype patients had a significantly better overall survival (P = .006). HLA-B35 patients had a poorer survival outcome (P = .019).
CONCLUSION: The studies indicate that overall survival following PMCV treatment in melanoma patients significantly correlates with their HLA phenotypes. These correlations may be related to the host immune response to the PMCV or due to differences in the clinical course of melanoma in patients with different HLA types."
9552066,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9552066/,"PURPOSE: Standard treatments for neoplastic meningitis are only modestly effective and are associated with significant morbidity. Isolated reports suggest that concurrent systemic and intrathecal (i.t.) therapy may be more effective than i.t. therapy alone. We present our experience, which includes CSF and serum pharmacokinetic data, on the use of high-dose (HD) intravenous (i.v.) methotrexate (MTX) as the sole treatment for neoplastic meningitis.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixteen patients with solid-tumor neoplastic meningitis received one to four courses (mean, 2.3 courses) of HD (8 g/m2 over 4 hours) i.v. MTX and leucovorin rescue. Serum and CSF MTX concentrations were measured daily. Toxicity, response, and survival were retrospectively compared with a reference group of 15 patients treated with standard i.t. MTX during the same time interval.
RESULTS: Peak methotrexate concentrations ranged from 3.7 to 55 micromol/L (mean, 17.1 micromol/L) in CSF and 178 to 1,700 micromol/L (mean, 779 micromol/L) in serum. Cytotoxic CSF and serum MTX concentrations were maintained much longer than with i.t. dosing. Toxicity was minimal. Cytologic clearing was seen in 81% of patients compared with 60% of patients treated intrathecally (P = .3). Median survival in the HD i.v. MTX group was 13.8 months versus 2.3 months in the i.t. MTX group (P = .003).
CONCLUSION: HD i.v. MTX is easily administered and well tolerated. This regimen achieves prolonged cytotoxic serum MTX concentrations and CSF concentrations at least comparable to those achieved with standard i.t. therapy. Cytologic clearing and survival may be superior in patients treated with HD i.v. MTX. Prospective studies and a reconsideration of the use of i.t. chemotherapy for patients with neoplastic meningitis are warranted."
9552185,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9552185/,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the data quality of septicemia and sepsis registration in a hospital discharge registry in the County of Northern Jutland, Denmark.
DESIGN: Comparison of data from the discharge registry of an 880-bed, public, urban hospital in the County of Northern Jutland with data from a computerized bacteremia database at the regional department of clinical microbiology.
SETTING: Urban hospital with approximately 45,000 admissions per year.
PATIENTS: The study included 406 episodes of bacteremia in the bacteremia database and 83 discharges with the diagnosis of septicemia registered in the hospital discharge registry between January 1, 1994, and December 31, 1994.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
RESULTS: Eighteen episodes were registered in both the hospital discharge registry and the bacteremia database. Using the bacteremia database as reference standard, the sensitivity for the diagnosis of septicemia in the hospital discharge registry was 4.4% (18/406; 95% confidence intervals [CI95, 2.4%-6.4%]). By review of hospital records, we estimated the positive predictive value of septicemia registration in the hospital discharge registry as 21.7% (18/83; CI95, 12.8%-30.5%). No blood culture had been obtained in 44.4% (36/81; CI95, 33.6%-55.3%) of the cases with a discharge diagnosis of septicemia. In 33.3% (27/81; CI95, 23.1%-43.6%), the discharge diagnosis of septicemia was given, although blood cultures were negative.
CONCLUSIONS: The hospital discharge registry revealed numerous misclassifications, and the system was found not suited for surveillance of, or research in, bacteremia at present."
9553306,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9553306/,"UNLABELLED: Different Results at Different Times of Questioning? In 1994 a quality assurance programme for the German medical rehabilitation system was introduced by the national association of pension funds. One of its five parts focussed on patients' satisfaction and health effects. Both domains were to be assessed by postal questionnaires. The first section of the instrument enquired about patients' perceptions and evaluations of both rehabilitation structures and processes. It is well known that satisfaction surveys tend to underestimate the true level of criticism due to social desirability bias. This is especially problematic in the context of quality assurance programmes where criticism can be seen as one driving force of improvement. The magnitude of the bias depends on many factors. In this study we tested the influence of different time intervals between discharge from rehabilitation clinic and first postal contact.
DESIGN: We conducted an experimentally varied satisfaction survey among four groups of rehabilitands. If necessary, the first postal questionnaire was followed by two reminders.
SETTING: One Bavarian pension fund for blue collar workers.
PATIENTS: 520 rehabilitands were recruited from various rehabilitation clinics specialized in muskuloskeletal disorders. About 70% suffered from nonspecific back pain. They were randomly allocated to one of the following time intervals between discharge and postal questionnaire: one, four, eight and twelve weeks. INSTRUMENTS AND TARGET VARIABLES: All patients received an identical questionnaire with 67 items and several subscales. We compared the extent of dissatisfaction between the four groups.
RESULTS: The response rate (after two reminders) showed a linear decrease from 97% (postal questionnaire after one week) to 83% (12 weeks). The extent of dissatisfaction did not change systematically though there was a (statistically nonsignificant) tendency towards higher levels of criticism at week twelve.
CONCLUSIONS: An experimental variation of time intervals between discharge from rehabilitation and first postal contact does not seem to influence the extent of reported dissatisfaction though it clearly influences the response rate: The later the sending out the lower the response rate. Taking into account additional administrative and organisational aspects of the programme we propose to send out satisfaction questionnaires between 8 and 10 weeks after rehabilitation."
9553792,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9553792/,"OBJECTIVE: To discuss regulatory guidelines excluding subjects with erythrocyte glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency from lead-exposed jobs in the light of epidemiology findings on the mortality of these subjects.
METHODS: Two mortality follow-up studies were conducted. The first comprised 1979 male subjects newly identified as G6PD-deficient during a 1981 screening of the G6PD polymorphism among the general population in Sardinia, Italy. The second comprised 1080 male workers employed in maintenance and production departments of a lead smelting plant, who were divided into two subcohorts by erythrocyte G6PD phenotype.
RESULTS: As compared with the general male population, G6PD-deficient subjects had significantly fewer deaths than expected from ischemic heart disease (standardized mortality ratio (SMR) = 28; 95% CI 10-62), cerebrovascular diseases (SMR = 22; 95% CI 6-55), and liver cirrhosis (SMR = 12; 95% CI 0-66). Among lead smelters the standardized mortality rates from cardiovascular diseases and all cancers observed among the G6PD-deficient subcohort were lower than those seen among subjects with the wild-type G6PD. No death from disease of the blood and hematopoietic system was observed among G6PD-deficient subjects in these two follow-up studies.
CONCLUSIONS: These studies did not provide evidence of hypersensitivity to lead hematotoxicity among G6PD-deficient individuals at exposure levels within the current standards. Provided that workplace exposure complies with current standards, the hypothetical benefit of excluding G6PD-deficient individuals from lead-exposed jobs should be weighted against the loss of personal abilities and the economic damage in a social environment with diffuse unemployment."
9553856,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9553856/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine if reamed femoral intramedullary nailing increases the pulmonary complications seen in chest-injured patients.
DESIGN: Retrospective review of prospectively collected trauma database data from January 1991 to October 1994.
SETTING: Methodist Hospital, Indianapolis, Indiana, Level I Trauma Center.
PATIENTS: Group I: Chest-injured patients [chest Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS) > or = 2] without femur or tibia fractures. Group II: Chest-injured patients (chest AIS > or = 2) with femoral reamed intramedullary fixation. Group III: Chest-injured patients (chest AIS > or = 2) with femoral shaft fixation using nonreamed fixation (rush rods, plating, or external fixation). Group IV: Non-chest-injured patients (chest AIS < 2) with femoral reamed intramedullary fixation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENT/HYPOTHESIS: Reamed femoral intramedullary nailing does not alter pulmonary outcomes, even in chest-injured patients.
RESULTS: Groups I and II had a very similar incidence of adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia, and number of ventilator days. Group III had a significantly higher incidence of ARDS and number of ventilator days than did Group I or II. Group III did not have a chest AIS score significantly different than Groups I and II. Group II had significantly higher ARDS and more ventilator days than did Group IV when only analyzing raw data. When injury severity was adjusted, there were no significant differences in pulmonary outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Reamed intramedullary femoral fixation did not increase pulmonary morbidity in chest-injured patients."
9554406,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9554406/,"PURPOSE: Testicular torsion followed by ischemia results in variable degrees of infertility and until now there appears to be no effective way to recover it. Testosterone participation in the maintenance of male sexual organs and spermatogenesis led us to hypothesize that intratesticular administration could recover ischemic injury.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We divided 40 Wistar rats in 2 groups, of 20 each. One group was control and the other underwent a 120-minute testicular ischemia by means of a vascular clamp on the left spermatic cord. Each group was further subdivided in 2 subgroups. The first one was observed and the second received intratesticular testosterone 25 mg. starting on the third day after injury and during the next 7 consecutive days. Half the animals were sacrificed 30 days after injury and the remaining ones after 60 days. Weight, volume, number of seminiferous tubules, histology and spermatogenesis of the same side and contralateral testes were examined. For statistical analysis ANOVA and Fisher's tests were applied.
RESULTS: It was found that testosterone was capable of acting upon volume and weight of the left testis (p=0.0001). The animals receiving intratesticular testosterone showed lower testicular weight and volume after 30 and 60 days, respectively. This subgroup also showed a higher number of seminiferous tubules, modified histology and absent spermatogenesis suggesting testicular atrophy.
CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that intratesticular injection of testosterone 25 mg. once a day during 7 consecutive days after transitory testicular ischemia causes ipsilateral testis atrophy. The animals in control group showed testicular histological recovery 60 days after injury. There were no significant histological differences in the contralateral testes."
9554632,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9554632/,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: Inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) treatment is first-line maintenance therapy in bronchial asthma. However, it is not clear whether and when ICS treatment can be withdrawn. The aim of this open study was to assess whether normalization of bronchial responsiveness could be used as a reliable index to assess the opportunity of ICS treatment withdrawal.
DESIGN: Open study at two different points in time.
SETTING: Outpatient pulmonary clinic.
PATIENTS: Eighteen asthmatic subjects.
MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: ICS therapy was withdrawn in subjects treated with beclomethasone dipropionate, at the maintenance dose of 889+/-246 microg/d for >3 months. Upon recruitment, all subjects were asymptomatic, had FEV1 >70% of predicted value, and were in treatment with beta2-agonists on an as-needed basis. Eight subjects (group 1) had normal bronchial responsiveness (methacholine provocative dose causing a 20% fall in FEV1 [PD20] >2,000 microg) and 10 subjects (group 2) had bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) (PD20 < or = 2,000 microg). After withdrawal of ICS treatment, subjects were followed up for 3 weeks and were asked to record their asthma symptoms (cough, dyspnea, and wheezing) and their beta2-agonist use. At recruitment and at the end of follow-up, subjects underwent spirometry and a methacholine challenge test. Frequency of asthma exacerbation was similar in subjects with normal bronchial responsiveness (NBR) and in subjects with BHR (50% vs 60%), but subjects with NBR tended to remain asymptomatic for longer than those with BHR (mean+/-SD, 10.7+/-4.4 days vs 5.5+/-3.8 days) (p=0.08). None of the subjects reported any condition that could have triggered exacerbation. Asthma exacerbation was associated with a significant decrease in FEV1 (-105+/-107 mL; p<0.05) and in PD20 (-1,332+/-1,020 microg; p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that the likelihood of asthma exacerbation is not reduced if ICS treatment is withdrawn when the subjects have NBR, but the exacerbation could be delayed. Further studies in larger populations of asthmatics are needed to confirm these findings."
9554644,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9554644/,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: To determine the bronchoscopist's ability to predict specimen quality at the time of transbronchial biopsy and to determine the influence of biopsy specimen size and alveolar content on diagnostic value.
DESIGN: Prospective, blinded, observational analysis.
SETTING: Tertiary care academic hospital-based pulmonary practice.
PATIENTS: Forty-three adult patients who underwent transbronchial lung biopsy.
INTERVENTIONS: Each of 170 biopsy specimens was rated as to likelihood of containing diagnostic tissue, size and ability to float, tissue types present, number of alveoli, and pathologic diagnosis.
RESULTS: Fifteen percent of biopsy specimens were small and 40% were large. Seventy-six percent of specimens floated; 61.8% of the 170 biopsy specimens contained abnormal lung tissue; and 14.7% of individual specimens were diagnostic. Fifty-two percent of specimens contained >20 alveoli. Larger biopsy specimens were more likely to contain diagnostic tissue (r=0.29, p=0.001). Cup forceps retrieved smaller pieces of tissue (p=0.007) and were less likely to obtain diagnostic tissue (p=0.06). Physician ratings of specimen quality (mean+/-SD) did not differ between specimens containing normal and abnormal tissue (5.98+/-2.3 vs 5.46+/-5.5; p=0.24) or between specimens containing diagnostic vs nondiagnostic tissue (5.56+/-2.5 vs 6.25+/-2.1; p=0.14). Specimens that floated were no more likely to be diagnostic or abnormal than specimens that sank (p<0.05). Diagnosis when established was made by the first biopsy specimen in 53.3% and the second in 33.3%
CONCLUSIONS: Physician estimate of biopsy specimen quality and the float sign are not helpful in predicting that the biopsy specimen contains abnormal or diagnostic tissue. Diagnostic biopsy specimen will likely be obtained if the size of the specimen fills the forceps, 2 to 4 biopsies are performed, and toothed forceps are used."
9555825,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9555825/,"BACKGROUND: The Injury Severity Score (ISS) does not take into account multiple injuries in the same body region, whereas a New ISS (NISS) may provide a more accurate measure of trauma severity by considering the patient's three greatest injuries regardless of body region. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ISS and NISS in patients with blunt trauma.
METHODS: Consecutive individuals treated from January of 1992 to September of 1996 at one institution were included if they had sustained blunt trauma and satisfied triage standards (n = 2,328). For each patient, we computed the ISS and the NISS to determine how often the two scores were identical or discrepant. Discrepant cases were then further analyzed using receiver operating characteristic curves to determine which score better predicted short-term mortality.
RESULTS: The mean ISS was 25 +/- 13, and the mean NISS was 33 +/- 18. The two predictive scores were identical in 32% of patients and discrepant in 68% of patients. Patients with identical scores had a lower mortality rate than patients with discrepant scores (10% vs. 13%; p < 0.02). In patients with discrepant scores, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves was greater for the NISS than the ISS (0.852 vs. 0.799; p < 0.001), and greater amounts of discrepancy were associated with increasing rates of mortality (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The NISS often increases the apparent severity of injury and provides a more accurate prediction of short-term mortality. The benefit associated with using the NISS rather than the ISS must be weighed against the disadvantages of changing a scoring system and the potential for still greater improvements."

METHODS: Trauma registry records of patients who underwent abdominal computed tomography from January 1994 through January 1997 were studied. Data were reviewed for age, gender, CT scan interpretation, associated injuries, and operative findings.
RESULTS: Abdominal injury was identified in 126 patients. Seventy-eight patients had evidence of solid-organ injury and 17 patients had extraperitoneal injury. Isolated intraperitoneal fluid was identified in 31 patients. All patients with isolated fluid underwent laparotomy; 29 of these procedures (94%) were therapeutic. Bowel injuries occurred in 18 patients and mesenteric injuries in 8 patients. Five patients had intraperitoneal bladder rupture, and undetected solid-organ injuries were found in two patients. Other organs injured included the stomach, pancreas, ovary, and uterus.
CONCLUSION: Exploratory laparotomy was therapeutic in 94% of patients. Isolated intraperitoneal fluid on CT scan after blunt trauma mandates laparotomy."
9555836,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9555836/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether surgeons and residents with minimal training can evaluate accurately emergency ultrasound (US) examinations compared with radiologists for blunt abdominal trauma.
METHODS: Over 7 months, we conducted a prospective study comparing the evaluation of emergency US for blunt abdominal trauma by surgeons and attending radiologists. US readings from the surgical team and the radiologists were correlated with outcome.
RESULTS: One hundred-twelve patients were included in the study. Ninety-two patients had an US read as negative by the surgical and radiology services with no subsequent injuries identified. Eighteen patients had an US deemed positive by the surgical service and radiologists. Injuries were confirmed in this group by operation or computed tomography. One patient had an US deemed positive by the surgical team and subsequently negative by the radiologist. A diagnostic peritoneal lavage was performed which was negative. Another patient had an US interpreted as negative by the surgical evaluator and positive by the radiologist. Exploratory laparotomy was negative for intraabdominal hemorrhage or organ injury. Overall results reveal an accuracy on US reading of 99% for the surgical team and 99% for the attending radiologists.
CONCLUSION: Surgeons and surgical residents at different levels of training can accurately interpret emergency ultrasound examinations for blunt trauma from the real-time images, at a level comparable to attending radiologists."
9555846,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9555846/,"BACKGROUND: Recent studies have questioned the use of aggressive fluid resuscitation after uncontrolled arterial hemorrhage until the bleeding is controlled. However, it remains unknown whether resuscitation after hemorrhage from a venous origin (usually nonaccessible to surgical intervention) has any beneficial or deleterious effects on regional perfusion. The aim of this study, therefore, was to determine whether increased volume of fluid resuscitation after uncontrolled venous hemorrhage improves hemodynamic profile and regional perfusion in various tissues.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: After methoxyflurane anesthesia and midline laparotomy, both lumbar veins in the rat were severed, which resulted in lowering the mean arterial blood pressure to approximately 40 mm Hg. This pressure was maintained for 45 minutes by allowing further bleeding from the lumbar veins. The abdominal incision was then closed in layers and the animals received either 0, 10, or 30 mL of lactated Ringer's solution intravenously over a period of 60 minutes. Cardiac output and regional blood flow were determined by radioactive microspheres immediately or at 1.5 hours after the completion of resuscitation.
RESULTS: Fluid resuscitation with 10 or 30 mL lactated Ringer's solution increased mean arterial blood pressure and cardiac output immediately after resuscitation compared with the nonresuscitated animals. At both time points, regional perfusion in the heart, kidney and intestines remained significantly decreased compared with the sham values, irrespective of the volume of fluid resuscitation. Moreover, no further improvements in hemodynamics or regional perfusion occurred when volume resuscitation was increased from 10 mL to 30 mL. Total hepatic blood flow, however, increased with 10 mL lactated Ringer's solution compared with the other hemorrhage groups and the increase was evident even at 1.5 hours after resuscitation.
CONCLUSIONS: Fluid resuscitation after uncontrolled venous bleeding transiently increased cardiac output and mean arterial blood pressure compared with nonresuscitated animals. Moderate fluid administration, i.e., 10 mL, however, did increase total hepatic blood flow. In contrast, increasing the resuscitation volume to 30 mL did not improve hemodynamic parameters or regional perfusion. Thus moderate instead of no resuscitation or larger volume of resuscitation is recommended in an uncontrolled model of venous hemorrhage."
9556197,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9556197/,"BACKGROUND: Cognitive models of panic disorder are becoming more and more influential. Therefore, research specifying cognitive processes related to panic disorder is needed. The present study investigated memory bias for panic-related material in patients with panic disorder.
METHODS: Memory bias for panic-related material was investigated experimentally by a memory task requiring classification of panic-related and non-panic-related words. Sixty patients with panic disorder and 60 controls with no diagnosis of a mental disorder participated in the study.
RESULTS: As expected, panic patients showed smaller differences in the time needed for classification of panic-related versus non-panic-related material than controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with panic disorder show a memory bias for panic-related material when conceptual implicit recall is required. In order to clarify whether this bias is involved in the maintenance of the disorder, it seems important to investigate whether the bias is still present after successful therapy."
9556468,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9556468/,"BACKGROUND: The cause of age-related degenerative (tricuspid) aortic valve calcification is largely unknown, but one typical characteristic is an active inflammatory process. The presence of Chlamydia pneumoniae in aortic valve stenosis was recently shown.
OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that if persistent C. pneumoniae infection plays an active role in the development of aortic stenosis, the organism can be detected in the healthy aortic valves of young persons.
DESIGN: A cadaver study.
SETTING: Oulu University Hospital, Oulu, Finland.
SUBJECTS: 46 consecutive cadavers undergoing autopsy.
MEASUREMENTS: Macroscopic and histologic pathology of aortic valves was determined. The presence of C. pneumoniae was determined by immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: 34 of 46 valves were macroscopically normal. Early lesions of aortic valve disease were found in 12 valves (no lesions in valves from persons 20 to 40 years of age [n = 15], 4 lesions in valves from persons 41 to 60 years of age [n = 16], and 8 lesions in valves from persons older than 60 years of age [n = 15]; P = 0.004). Fifteen of 34 normal valves (44%) and 10 of 12 valves with early lesions (83%) had positive results on staining for C. pneumoniae (P = 0.02). In persons older than 60 years of age, the chance of an early lesion was higher if the valve tested positive for C. pneumoniae (7 of 8 valves with C. pneumoniae infection compared with 1 of 7 valves without C. pneumoniae infection; P = 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Chlamydia pneumoniae is frequently present in aortic valves and is associated with early lesions of aortic valve stenosis in elderly persons."
9556692,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9556692/,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The value of medical dissertations has for some time been controversial. Critical opinions have, on the one hand, been directed against the effort required, its duration and the concept behind these dissertations, while asserting, on the other hand, that such dissertations hinder studying and lead to unnecessary lengthening of the medical curriculum.
PARTICIPANTS AND METHOD: In collaboration with the Medical School in Hanover a questionnaire was sent to all the 189 dissertationists of one year, to be returned anonymously. It contained 16 questions about the dissertation itself, supervision. time spent on it, total duration of medical course and effect of the dissertation on the individual's medical studies. The answers were evaluated statistically by explorative data analysis.
RESULTS: 181 questionnaires could be evaluated (96%). Average age of those questioned was 30.5 years, median duration of medical studies to-data was 13 semesters. For 80% it was the first attempted dissertation. 22% had been working on an entirely experimental topic (laboratory or animal experiments). The median time from starting to submitting the dissertation was 4 years, the median time of the experimental phase one year. Two-thirds of students said that work on the dissertation had not prolonged their studies. Supervision during various phases of the dissertation was overwhelmingly judged to have been ""very good"" or ""good"". Altogether 90% of dissertationists thought that it had been personally meaningful, and they would recommend it to younger costudents.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study show that a universal criticism of medical dissertations does not stand up to detailed enquiry. Successful dissertationists highly rated their value both to themselves and to scientific medicine. The medical dissertation should therefore firmly remain as part of medical studies and of research within them."

METHODS: The medical and surgical patients charts from 1991-1993 were selected for the diagnosis of septic shock (according to the definition of ACCP/SCCM Consensus Conference), and reviewed. Also included were patients with available variables to complete APACHE II and septic severity score.
RESULTS: Tachycardia was observed more in the non-survivors (9 patients) both in shock (107.8 vs 93.4) and non-shock states (112.3 vs 93.2). Heart rate in the survival group decreased below the cut-off value, which is 95 beats/min, as specified by ACCP/SCCM. Comparison between APACHE II and SSS was not well correlated because of the small sample size. Elements in creating a predictor and its categorisation are mentioned.
CONCLUSION: Heart rate was concluded to be a simple predictor reflecting physiologic derangements in septic shock. It is recommended that further study needs to be carried out to unravel a predictor of clinical value in terms of practicality, especially that involving the inflammatory aspect of the disease process."
9557341,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9557341/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the utility of the urethral plug in the management of female stress urinary incontinence.
METHODS: A prospective clinical study was conducted in 20 female patients with stress urinary incontinence in order to evaluate the efficacy of a new urethral plug. The mean age was 59.6 +/- 6.2 years (range 40-66). The study design included 3 visits (4 weeks). The results were considered ""positive"" when urinary incontinence decreased and the patient referred a subjective sensation of improvement, and ""negative"" if otherwise.
RESULTS: Positive results were demonstrated in 8 patients (40%). Ten patients (50%) refused to continue, mainly due to urinary tract infection in 7 cases (35%), difficulties in plug use (loss of plugs, anomalous urethral anatomy, cystocele,...) in 6 cases (30%) and urethral mucosa irritation in one case (5%). No plug migrated into the bladder. The initial urinary incontinence grade in the positive cases were: minor in 4 (50%), mild in 2 (25%) and severe in 2 (25%). We found no statistical relationship between the urinary incontinence grade and clinical results. The patients used a median of 5 plugs per day. Of the 10 patients who completed the study, 5 (50%) refused to continue using the plug and 5 (50%) decided to continue using the plug in combination with electrostimulation and/or pelvic floor exercises.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of the urethral plug in the management of female stress urinary incontinence is not an alternative to surgical treatment or pelvic floor rehabilitation. However, it could be useful for patients who are unwilling or unfit for surgery. Finally, the urethral plug is an alternative to the use of collecting systems or devices in female stress urinary incontinence."

DESIGN: An observational, cross-sectional study.
SETTING: Primary Care Area 4, INSALUD, Madrid, covering 526,987 inhabitants.
PARTICIPANTS: The complaints presented at PC Centres during 1993 were included. Those presented for reasons not concerning the centre were excluded. In all, 448 complaints were studied.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Significant differences were found in the general index of complaints according to the care model. Statistically significant differences were detected between PCT and the TM for complaints due to disagreement with the treatment and disagreement with the follow-up procedures.
CONCLUSIONS: Since the indicators of prescription profiles and the following of procedures are better in PCTs than in the TM, perhaps patients should be encouraged to participate more in the taking of clinical decisions. This would help the introduction of improvements both in the technical quality of treatment and in the follow-up of chronic diseases to be perceived as such by patients. At present, as this study suggests, they are causes of greater dissatisfaction."

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 125/143 patients compiled a set questionnaire to detect any subjective postoperative disorders and to evaluate whether they were similar to preoperative symptoms or were new ones.
RESULTS: 125/143 patients completed the 12-month follow-up programme, which revealed a 30% (38/125) with postcholecystectomy symptoms and 13.4% (17) with a postcholecystectomy syndrome. Moreover, 10% (13) of the patients reported the same digestive symptoms as before treatment. Statistical analysis confirmed that cholecystectomy was efficacious in curing gallstone related symptoms and digestive disorders in both Groups with a general improvement in clinical picture (p > 0.01). No significant statistical difference in the incidence of postcholecystectomy dyspeptic symptoms was found between the 2 Groups.

9557918,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9557918/,"BACKGROUND: Several guidelines for the management of hypertension do not give special preference to a specific position of the patient during blood pressure measurement, suggesting that blood pressure readings taken with patients sitting and with patients supine are interchangeable.
OBJECTIVE: To test whether there is any difference between the blood pressure readings with patients sitting and supine.
DESIGN AND METHODS: Blood pressure and heart rate were measured three times each for 245 subjects (171 hypertensives), with subjects both sitting and supine, simultaneously on both arms, with a Hawksley random-zero sphygmomanometer on the right arm and a semi-automatic oscillometric device (Bosomat) on the left arm. The sequence of the two positions was randomized. The procedure was repeated on a second occasion for 49 subjects (41 hypertensives) with the sequence of the positions reversed. Because there was no systematic difference among the three readings per position, the averages of the three blood pressure and heart rate readings with subjects sitting and supine were compared and the influences of age, body mass index, hypertension and medication on the difference were examined.
RESULTS: We found no influence of the subject's body posture on the systolic blood pressure. We found a higher diastolic blood pressure [by 5.2+/-0.4 mmHg (mean+/-SEM), P< 0.001 with Hawksley random-zero sphygmomanometer] and a greater heart rate [by 1.5+/-0.3 beats/min (mean+/-SEM), P< 0.001] with subjects sitting. The sitting minus supine differences for diastolic blood pressure and heart rate decreased significantly with increasing age (P< 0.001). We found no effect of body mass index, hypertension and medication on the sitting - supine differences.
CONCLUSIONS: The subject's body posture influenced especially the diastolic blood pressure and heart rate, both of them being significantly higher with patients sitting rather than supine. This effect decreased with age. Thus, for indirect blood pressure measurement, diastolic blood pressure values obtained with subjects sitting and supine cannot automatically be regarded as equivalent."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty patients with heart disease underwent surgery between March 1994 and March 1995, with the use of crystalloid cardioplegia (group A). Blood cardioplegia was used in 72 patients during the same period (group B).
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in clinical (age, arterial hypertension, diabetes, chronic bronchial disease, severity of angina, severity of heart disease) or surgical (emergency, percent use of the internal thoracic artery, duration of extracorporeal circulation) variables. The percentage of patients with low ejection fraction was higher in group B as a result of preoperative selection. The mean number of grafts was higher in group B than in group A (3.5% and 2.5, respectively) (p < 0.01). Postoperative results (use of inotropics, counterpulsation balloon, creatine phosphokinase, perioperative myocardial infarction or hospital mortality) were not significantly different. The percent of supraventricular arrhythmias after surgery was higher in group A than in group B (20% and 5%, respectively) (p < 0.05) and lactic dehydrogenase level was lower in group A than in group B (472 and 572 mu/l, respectively) (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: We believe that crystalloid cardioplegia continues to be a valid and effective myocardial protection technique in heart patients with preserved left ventricular systolic function."
9559506,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9559506/,"PURPOSE: To ascertain if tear film disturbance in congenital nasolacrimal-duct obstruction (CNLDO) interferes with visual maturation.
METHODS: Review of a cohort of children in which the occurrence and duration of CNLDO had been previously documented. Information obtained included acuity, refractive data, and presence or absence of strabismus. The incidence of abnormality in the CNLDO group was compared with that in controls, which were fellow eyes in those children with unilateral obstruction, and all children with no history of CNLDO.
RESULTS: Of 4792 children, visual acuity data were obtained on 2249. There was no difference in the incidence of amblyopia in CNLDO children compared with controls (p < 0.89) nor in the watering eye compared with the fellow eye (p < 0.58). No correlation between refractive error or astigmatism and CNLDO (p < 0.26 and p < 0.32 respectively) was found. Strabismus was no more common in CNLDO than in controls (p < 0.89).
CONCLUSIONS: This study found no evidence to suggest that visual maturation is adversely affected by allowing spontaneous resolution of CNLDO."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1985 and 1996, 62 patients completed treatment with combined modality therapy. A median total dose of 50 Gy was given to the primary, perirectal, presacral, and inguinal nodes followed by a local boost in selected cases. 5-Fluorouracil was scheduled as a continuous infusion of 1,000 mg/m2 per 24 hours on days 1 to 5 and 29 to 33 and mitomycin C as a bolus of 10 mg/m2 on days 1 and 29. Routinely processed paraffin-embedded sections were stained using monoclonal antibodies for detection of proliferating cell nuclear antigen and MIB1 (Ki-67) antigen to determine the labeling index. In addition, DNA ploidy was assessed after Feulgen staining.
RESULTS: Actuarial cancer-related survival, no evidence of disease survival, and colostomy-free survival rates at five years were 81, 76, and 86 percent, respectively. In univariate analysis, T category (T1/2 vs. T3/4) was predictive for no evidence of disease survival (87 vs. 59 percent; P = 0.03) and colostomy-free survival (94 vs. 73 percent; P = 0.05). N category (N0 vs. N1-3) influenced actuarial cancer-related survival (85 vs. 58 percent; P = 0.002) and no evidence of disease survival (80 vs. 53 percent; P = 0.02). A higher proliferative potential as measured by the MIB1 labeling index was associated with a better colostomy-free survival (90 vs. 50 percent; P = 0.04). In multivariate analysis, actuarial cancer-related survival was only influenced by the N category (P = 0.03) and no evidence of disease survival by N category (P = 0.03) and mitomycin C dose (P = 0.04). Salvage abdominoperineal resection achieved long-term control in only four of seven patients with local failures.
CONCLUSION: Treatment with a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy is safe and effective for patients with anal canal carcinoma. Abdominoperineal resection is indicated as a salvage procedure in nonresponding and recurrent lesions and may be of benefit in a small subgroup of patients with poor prognostic factors."
9559709,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9559709/,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of leukemia in a series of bone marrow aspiration (BMA) samples collected to confirm provisional diagnoses of acute idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) in children.
DESIGN: A retrospective cohort.
SETTING: All BMA reports at The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario (a tertiary care pediatric hospital), from January 1, 1984, to May 31, 1996, were reviewed.
PATIENTS: Included were BMAs performed to confirm provisional diagnoses of ITP in children (6 months to 18 years of age) with ""typical"" contemporaneous hematologic features of ITP (platelet count, < or =50 x 10(9)/L; hemoglobin level, > or =100 g/L [6-12 months of age] or > or =110 g/L [> 1 year of age]; white blood cell count, > or =5 x 10(9)/L [6 months to 6 years of age] or > or =4 x 10(9)/L [> 6 years of age]; and neutrophil count, > or =1.5 x 10(9)/L [6 months to 6 years of age] or > or =2 x 10(9)/L [> 6 years of age]). Children with chronic ITP, thrombocytopenia-related chronic conditions, or leukemic blasts on peripheral smears were excluded.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The finding of leukemia in the BMA report was chosen a priori as the primary outcome for the yield of BMA.
RESULTS: Four hundred eighty-four BMAs were performed to confirm provisional diagnoses of acute childhood ITP. No diagnoses of leukemia were revealed in the 332 children with typical hematologic features of ITP. The risk of missing the diagnosis of leukemia in this setting is less than 1%.
CONCLUSIONS: The yield of BMA for leukemia in this setting is low. Routine BMA is not necessary for children with typical acute ITP."
9559713,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9559713/,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the affect of families' attitudes about the appropriateness of discussing psychosocial concerns on pediatric providers' identification of psychosocial problems.
DESIGN: These data were collected as part of the Greater New Haven Child Health Study, New Haven, Conn. The study design was a prospective cohort.
SETTING: Families were recruited from a stratified random sample of all primary care practices in the greater New Haven area. Nineteen of 23 invited practices agreed to participate including 2 prepaid practices, 2 neighborhood health centers, and 7 fee-for-service group and 8 fee-for-service solo practices.
PARTICIPANTS: All families of children aged 4 to 8 years who attended these practices during 2 separate 3-week periods (1 in fall 1987 and 1 in spring 1988) were invited to participate in the study. Families were invited to participate only once, on the first contact with any eligible child, using approved procedures. Of 2006 eligible families, 1886 (94%) chose to participate.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The outcome variable for these analyses is the identification of any behavioral, emotional, or developmental problem by the pediatrician on the 13-category checklist. Overall, pediatric clinicians identified 27.5% of children with 1 or more psychosocial problems.
RESULTS: Our data suggest that there is a great deal of discrepancy between what parents report is appropriate to do when their children have psychosocial problems and what they actually do when they recognize such problems in their children. Most (81.1%) believed it was appropriate to discuss 4 or more of the 6 hypothetical situations with their children's physician, while only 40.9% actually did discuss any of these problems with a physician when a problem occurred. Given the correlates of parents who intended to discuss such problems (higher education, older age, Euro-American ethnicity, higher income, married, availability of medical insurance) the possibility that parents are providing socially acceptable responses to such questions seems likely. Further, our data indicate that parents' actual reports of discussions of psychosocial problems is unrelated to whether physicians identified those problems in children.
CONCLUSIONS: Pediatricians'judgments about the presence of psychosocial problems in their young patients seem to be based on their own observations rather than on what parents report. Physician-parent communication about psychosocial problems will be increasingly important as primary care physicians assume their role as gatekeepers to more expensive services such as mental health interventions."
9559714,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9559714/,"BACKGROUND: Pediatric visits during summer months may be especially opportune times for sun protection counseling for children and their parents. Few data exist on the extent of such counseling.
OBJECTIVE: To begin to assess this, we surveyed practicing Massachusetts pediatricians to examine current attitudes and practices of sun protection counseling.
DESIGN AND SETTING: Surveys mailed to Massachusetts pediatricians.
RESULTS: We received surveys from 756 (60%) of 1263 eligible Massachusetts pediatricians. Almost 70% indicated that they recommended safe sun practices to more than 50% of their patients and their parents during the summer months. Counseling regarding seat belt use, bicycle helmet use, and smoking prevention were ranked higher in priority than sun protection counseling by pediatricians; nutritional guidelines were noted by pediatricians to be a parent's most frequent concern. Four variables were independently associated with a practitioner's providing safe sun recommendations to more than 50% of parents and children: (1) private setting and health maintenance organization practitioners as opposed to academic physicians, (2) high ranking of patients' safe sun knowledge, (3) high priorities of both parents and physicians for sun protection counseling and parental knowledge of safe sun practices relative to other recommendations, and (4) pediatrician interest in receiving instructional materials.
CONCLUSIONS: For the most part, summer sun protection counseling among Massachusetts pediatricians seems well integrated into standard practice. Most pediatricians rated their confidence level as high for discussing sun protection and only a few cited inadequate training or poor reimbursement as barriers toward improved counseling. Small steps, such as providing more instructional materials to patients and using office-based reminder systems, may improve the quality of sun protection counseling practices. Incorporating sunburn prevention into the list of routinely recommended injury prevention guidelines for pediatricians should be considered."
9560062,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9560062/,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the predictive accuracy of two validated indices, one that uses self-reported variables and a second that uses variables derived from administrative data sources, to predict future hospitalization. To compare the predictive accuracy of these same two indices for predicting future functional decline.
DESIGN: A longitudinal cohort study with 4 years of follow-up.
SETTING: A large staff model HMO in western Washington State.
PARTICIPANTS: HMO Enrollees 65 years and older (n = 2174) selected at random to participate in a health promotion trial and who completed a baseline questionnaire.
MEASUREMENT: Predicted probabilities from the two indices were determined for study participants for each of two outcomes: hospitalization two or more times in 4 years and functional decline in 4 years, measured by Restricted Activity Days. The two indices included similar demographic characteristics, diagnoses, and utilization predictors. The probabilities from each index were entered into a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve program to obtain the Area Under the Curve (AUC) for comparison of predictive accuracy.
RESULTS: For hospitalization, the AUC of the self-report and administrative indices were .696 and .694, respectively (difference between curves, P = .828). For functional decline, the AUC of the two indices were .714 and .691, respectively (difference between curves, P = .144).
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with a self-report index, the administrative index affords wider population coverage, freedom from nonresponse bias, lower cost, and similar predictive accuracy. A screening strategy utilizing administrative data sources may thus prove more valuable for identifying high risk older health plan enrollees for population-based interventions designed to improve their health status."
9560863,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9560863/,"OBJECTIVE: Past organ donation research has studied attitudes toward donation, predictors of signing donor cards, and distinguishing characteristics of donors vs. nondonors. The current study is the first to examine predictors of family members' satisfaction with the decision to consent or refuse donation of a dying loved one's organs or tissue.
METHOD: This study surveyed 225 family members who had been approached to donate the organs or tissue of a dying loved one. Participants were surveyed about demographic characteristics, medical/hospital factors, previous knowledge of transplantation, the request process, religion, and characteristics of the deceased and of the recipient. Discriminant analyses were conducted to characterise four specific groups: a) donors who would donate again; b) donors who would not donate again; c) nondonors who would now donate; and d) nondonors who still would not donate.
RESULTS: Three significant discriminant functions emerged discriminating donors from nondonors, those who were satisfied with their decision from those who were not, and people who would now donate from those who would not. Donation was predicated by formal education, being married, volunteerism, signing donor cards, and having personal conversations about donation. Subsequent satisfaction was predicted by comfort and confidence during the decision-making process, familiarity with medical center, and understanding of brain death. A willingness to now donate was predicted by personal discussions about donation.
CONCLUSIONS: People should be encouraged not only to sign donor cards, but to have discussions with family about wishes. Individuals should be encouraged to seek the help of family and friends during the decision, and be aware of the need of social support from family and friends during and after the decision."

METHODS: Multivariate analyses of data from the 1988 National Maternal and Infant Health Survey and the 1988 National Survey of Family Growth were conducted to investigate whether women with unplanned births differ from other women in their pregnancy behavior, independent of their social and demographic characteristics.
RESULTS: Women with intended conceptions are more likely than similar women with unintended pregnancies to recognize early signs of pregnancy and to seek out early prenatal care, and somewhat more likely to quit smoking, but they are not more likely than women with comparable social and demographic characteristics to adhere to a recommended schedule of prenatal visits once they begin care, to reduce alcohol intake, or to follow their clinician's advice about taking vitamins and gaining weight. Social and demographic differences in these behaviors are largely unaffected by planning status, indicating that these differences are independently related to pregnancy behaviors.
CONCLUSIONS: Both the intendedness of a pregnancy and the mother's social and demographic characteristics are important predictors of pregnancy-related behavior."

OBJECTIVE: To determine the value of previous treatment history and sputum smear examination at 2-3 months in predicting treatment failure and relapse in tuberculosis patients treated with four drugs given twice weekly for six months under direct observation.
DESIGN: Four cohort studies among 562 ambulant adults with culture positive pulmonary tuberculosis, designed to test the effectiveness of isoniazid 600-900 mg, rifampicin 600 mg, pyrazinamide 2-3 g, and streptomycin 1-2 g, given twice weekly. The same drug regimen was given to all patients irrespective of previous treatment history. Therapy was not changed if smears remained positive at 2-3 months.
RESULTS: Positive predictive values of a history of previous treatment for a positive smear at 2-3 months (18.3%), treatment failure (5.2%), and relapse (9.4%) were poor. Although patients with positive smears at 2-3 months were more likely to fail therapy than patients with negative smears (relative risk=4.5, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.6-12.8), positive predictive value for treatment failure was only 12.5%. Although relapse was more frequent in patients with positive smears than those with negative smears (9.7% vs 6.2%; P=0.4), most patients who relapsed had been smear negative at 2-3 months (18/21).
CONCLUSION: A four-drug rifampicin-containing regimen can safely be given twice weekly under direct observation to both new and retreatment cases, and the 2-3 month smear examination can safely be omitted."
9562148,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9562148/,"OBJECTIVE: To review the rationale for requiring prescriptions to control vaccine access, in contrast to other medications.
DATA SOURCES: Literature on immunization delivery and health-service barriers was reviewed via MEDLINE search and relevant textbooks. Additional literature was obtained from reference lists of pertinent articles.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Society controls access to medications to protect consumers. Many medications have changed from prescription-only to over-the-counter (OTC) status. No parenteral drug has been switched, although insulin has long had OTC status. Limiting access to vaccines has advantages in record-keeping, storage, injection quality, and response to anaphylactic reactions. These advantages are outweighed by 600000 people who will die over the next decade for lack of pneumococcal and influenza immunizations. Physicians see most of those who die of these diseases, but many neglect to vaccinate them. Three options are offered to expand access to these vaccines. The most feasible one involves expanding prescribing authority for pneumococcal and influenza vaccines to all licensed healthcare professionals and paraprofessionals with physiologic and pharmacologic expertise to responsibly vaccinate. Community pharmacies offer advantages as immunization delivery sites, in terms of proximity, hours of operation, and knowledge of people at highest risk. Expanded professional training can ensure high levels of public safeguards while expanding immunization delivery.
CONCLUSIONS: Society decides the controls needed to protect the health of the people. If society restricts vaccine access too severely, people die needlessly. Increasing prescribing authority for pneumococcal and influenza vaccines to more health professionals will save many lives."
9562480,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9562480/,"BACKGROUND: Certain risk factors for arteriosclerosis are associated with obesity, e.g. hypertension, insulin resistance, the high triglyceride - low HDL pattern. One aim in treating morbid obesity is to reduce these risk factors. This study was designed to follow metabolic risk factors after weight loss in 165 morbidly obese patients who underwent a gastric restriction operation.
METHODS AND PATIENTS: Lipid and hormone levels were analyzed before surgery and after 25, 50, 75 and 100% loss of excess weight. Mean cholesterol and triglyceride levels were normal or slightly elevated. HDL cholesterol was also normal (41 mg/dl). Thirty eight percent of the patients had elevated cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Insulin levels were measured as an indicator of potential insulin resistance, and with a mean of 21 microU/ml it was at the upper normal level.
RESULTS: After reaching 75% reduction of overweight in a mean time of 10 months, serum cholesterol levels were unchanged. Serum triglycerides, however, decreased by 35% (P<0.0001) and HDL cholesterol increased by 24% (P<0.0001). Insulin levels decreased to 8 microU/ml (P<0.0001).
CONCLUSION: We found an amelioration in the metabolic parameters in 75% of the patients. Nevertheless morbidly obese patients were found to have fewer abnormalities in lipid and glucose metabolism than expected from data of overweight patients with metabolic syndrome. Further long-term studies with careful evaluation of the metabolic parameters as risk factors in patients with morbid obesity need to be performed."
9563112,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9563112/,"STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study with two age cohorts.
OBJECTIVE: To assess whether women receiving hormone replacement therapy after menopause have a higher prevalence of back problems than women who do not receive such treatment.
BACKGROUND: Back pain is a common medical problem throughout life and especially during pregnancy. Hormonal factors have been proposed as a possible contributor.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A validated postal questionnaire was sent in early 1995 to all 1324 women of 55 years and 56 years of age residing in Linköping, Sweden. This questionnaire included questions about current hormone replacement treatment, previous and current back problems, medical care for back problems, parity, exercise and smoking habits, and occupation.
RESULTS: The questionnaire was returned by 84.7% of the women. There was a significant, albeit weak, positive association between current use of hormone replacement treatment and low back pain. Previous back problems during pregnancy was a strong risk factor for current back pain, whereas neither current smoking nor regular physical exercise was a risk factor according to multiple logistic regression analysis. The interaction of smoking and an occupation involving heavy lifting significantly affected back pain.
CONCLUSIONS: Women receiving hormone replacement treatment had a slightly, but significantly, higher prevalence of current back pain than nonusers (48% vs. 42%, respectively, P < 0.05), which could not be explained by differences in occupation, smoking habits, or current physical activity. Although the association between hormone replacement therapy and back problems is weak and probably of minor clinical importance, it is speculated that hormonal effects on joints and ligaments may be involved."

METHODS: This prospective study documents the use of the KSRESS and clinical rating system in 333 primary posterior cruciate retaining PFC total knee arthroplasties preoperatively, at 3 month and at yearly intervals postoperatively. The average follow-up period was 3.2 years (range 2-5.5 y).
RESULTS: The average component position and alignment angles remained unchanged at biomechanically correct angles during the follow-up period. Radiolucent lines were observed regularly at the edges of the tibial and femoral components. The average total radiolucent lines score decreased for the tibial component. Patellar and femoral lucencies remained unchanged. The total radiolucent lines scores did not correlate with postoperative pain, body-mass-index, alignment, stability, knee and function score. Four revisions, one with relevant radiolucent lines, had to be performed.
CONCLUSIONS: The KSRESS is a useful tool. Standardisation of roentgenograms is mandatory. The PFC arthroplasty, the operative technique and the instruments ensure a biomechanically correct implantation."
9563543,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9563543/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine if any preoperative or intraoperative factors can reliably predict malignancy in patients with Hürthle cell neoplasms.
SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Most experienced surgeons recommend total thyroidectomy for Hürthle cell carcinomas and reserve thyroid lobectomy for Hürthle cell adenomas. However, delineation between Hürthle cell adenoma versus carcinoma often cannot reliably be made either before or during surgery.
METHODS: Medical records from 57 consecutive patients who underwent thyroid resections for Hürthle cell neoplasms between October 1984 and April 1995 at The Johns Hopkins Hospital were analyzed to determine if any factors were predictive of malignancy.
RESULTS: Of the 57 patients with Hürthle cell neoplasms, 37 had adenomas and 20 had carcinomas, resulting in a 35% prevalence of malignancy. Patients with adenomas did not differ from those with carcinoma with respect to age, sex, or history of head and neck irradiation. However, patients with Hürthle cell carcinomas had significantly larger tumors (4.0 +/- 0.4 cm vs. 2.4 +/- 0.2 cm, p < 0.005). Furthermore, although the incidence of malignancy was only 17% for tumors 1 cm or less and 23% for tumors 1 to 4 cm, tumors 4 cm or greater were malignant 65% of the time (p < 0.05). Both fine-needle aspiration and intraoperative frozen section analysis had low sensitivities in the detection of cancer (16% and 23%, respectively). With up to 9 years of follow-up, there has been no tumor-related mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that the size of a Hürthle cell neoplasm is predictive of malignancy. Therefore, at the time of initial exploration for large Hürthle cell neoplasms (>4 cm), definitive resection involving both thyroid lobes should be considered because of the higher probability of malignancy."
9564375,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9564375/,"BACKGROUND: Brief interventions with problem drinkers have been shown to be effective, but physicians often do not ask about alcohol use. If a single question could effectively screen for problem drinking, it might facilitate intervention with problem drinkers.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was undertaken to address the clinical utility of the question, ""On any single occasion during the past 3 months, have you had more than 5 drinks containing alcohol?"" Placing it between questions about tobacco and seat-belt use, we presented the three questions in writing to 1435 patients; 95.3% answered them. With a systematic sample of 101 patients who answered yes and 99 who answered no, we administered the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test in writing followed by two gold-standard interview instruments: (1) a calendar-based review of drinking, with at-risk drinking defined as drinking more than 4 drinks on one occasion or more than 14 drinks per week for men, and more than 3 drinks on one occasion or 7 per week for women; and (2) the alcohol questions in the Composite International Diagnostic Interview, with alcohol-use disorders defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) criteria. We defined problem drinking as either at-risk drinking in the previous month or an alcohol-use disorder in the past 12 months.
RESULTS: The single question had a positive predictive value of 74% and negative predictive value of 88% for problem drinking, with a sensitivity of 62% and a specificity of 93%. The question's utility was similar for detecting at-risk drinking and current alcohol-use disorders; it correctly identified all 29 patients who had both.
CONCLUSIONS: A single question about alcohol can detect at-risk drinking and current alcohol-use disorders with clinically useful positive and negative predictive values."
9564917,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9564917/,"BACKGROUND: Reexploration of the mediastinum for bleeding is required in 3% to 7% of patients after cardiac operation, with many proving to have no surgically correctable cause. In spite of a ""negative exploration,"" the bleeding often ceases. We propose the hypothesis that such a negative exploration can be therapeutic by reducing marked fibrinolytic activity in the mediastinal cavity.
METHODS: Fibrinolytic activity in shed mediastinal blood was compared with that in the system blood in 5 patients after cardiac operation by measuring fibrinogen, fibrin degradation product, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and alpha2-antiplasmin levels.
RESULTS: Fibrinolytic activity in mediastinal blood was markedly increased when compared with paired systemic venous blood. This was indicated by the mediastinal blood's lower fibrinogen levels (0.47 versus 1.91 U/mL; p < 0.001), very high levels of fibrin degradation products (1,350 versus 200 ng/mL; p < 0.05), and higher levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (55.5 versus 28.1 ng/mL; p < 0.005). Decreased levels of alpha2-antiplasmin were also observed in the mediastinum (0.50 versus 0.61 U/mL; p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm that fibrinolytic activity can be extremely high in the mediastinum in response to clot formation. This may explain the hemostatic effects of a negative reexploration, where irrigation and the removal of clots may reduce the fibrinolytic process; this may allow the bleeding ends of capillaries and small vessels to thrombose. Decreased levels of alpha2-antiplasmin observed suggest that lysine analogs, such as epsilon-aminocaproic acid, may have a beneficial role when locally delivered into the mediastinum."
9564932,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9564932/,"BACKGROUND: The number of homograft donors is limited and the once-thawed homograft may be unsuitable for the recipient and obliged to be wasted. The purpose of this study was to investigate the possibility of recryopreserving and using the once-thawed homograft for another patient.
METHODS: Canine aortic valve leaflets were frozen to -80 degrees C by a programmed freezer, stored in liquid nitrogen, and thawed after 1 week. A subgroup of leaflets was left at 4 degrees C for 15 minutes, re-cryopreserved, and thawed after 1 week. Pathologic and flow cytometric evaluations were performed.
RESULTS: After thawing, by pathology, alignment of the fibers was acceptably maintained but the membrane and cytoplasm of the fibroblast were damaged. These findings were not significantly aggravated even after rethawing. By flow cytometry, fibroblast viability was 90.7%+/-1.7% immediately after thawing, 87.6%+/-1.0% after thawing for 15 minutes at 4 degrees C, 63.7%+/-2.7% during refreezing at 0 degrees C, and 39.4%+/-4.3% after rethawing.

9565116,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9565116/,"OBJECTIVE: To better define the effectiveness of abdominal computed tomographic scanning (ACTS) in adult patients with suspected appendicitis.
DESIGN: Retrospective analysis.
SETTING: A community teaching hospital.
PATIENTS: Ninety-seven patients with appendicitis in the differential diagnosis, whose clinical findings were insufficient to perform surgery or to discharge from the hospital, during a 14-month period.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Accuracy of ACTS, rate of appendectomies that show no appendicitis (negative appendectomy rate), and frequency of ACTS as a definitive diagnostic test.
RESULTS: Forty-nine of the 50 patients with appendicitis were correctly diagnosed by ACTS. Forty-three of the 47 patients without appendicitis were correctly diagnosed by ACTS. Positive predictive value was 92%, negative predictive value was 98%, and accuracy was 96%. The ACTS group had a negative appendectomy rate of 5.8% (3/52), lower than the hospital rate of 14% for the preceding 3 years. The ACTS established an alternative diagnosis in 16 patients, allowed 10 other patients to be discharged early or not admitted, and was the critical diagnostic test in 30 of the patients with appendicitis. Therefore, the ACTS played a definitive role in the treatment of 56 (57.7%) of the 97 patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The ACTS was an accurate test in the diagnosis of appendicitis and was of significant benefit in 57.7% of the patients studied. However, it was difficult to predict which patients were most likely to benefit. Expanded selective use of ACTS for patients with clinically indeterminate appendicitis may result in a lower negative appendectomy rate and fewer patient admissions for observation."
9565386,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9565386/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the independent contribution of admission delirium to hospital outcomes including mortality, institutionalization, and functional decline.
DESIGN: Three prospective cohort studies.
SETTING: Three university-affiliated teaching hospitals.
PATIENTS: Consecutive samples of 727 patients, aged 65 years and older.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Delirium was present at admission in 88 (12%) of 727 patients. The main outcome measures at hospital discharge and 3-month follow-up were death, new nursing home placement, death or new nursing home placement, and functional decline. At hospital discharge, new nursing home placement occurred in 60 (9%) of 692 patients, and the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for delirium, controlling for baseline covariates of age, gender, dementia, APACHE II score, and functional measures, was 3.0, (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4, 6.2). Death or new nursing home placement occurred in 95 (13%) of 727 patients (adjusted OR for delirium 2.1, 95% CI 1.1, 4.0). The findings were replicated across all sites. The associations between delirium and death alone (in 35 [5%] of 727 patients) and between delirium and length of stay were not statistically significant. At 3-month follow-up, new nursing home placement occurred in 77 (13%) of 600 patients (adjusted OR for delirium 3.0; 95% CI 1.5, 6.0). Death or new nursing home placement occurred in 165 (25%) of 663 patients (adjusted OR for delirium 2.6; 95% CI 1.4, 4.5). The findings were replicated across all sites. For death alone (in 98 [14%] of 680 patients), the adjusted OR for delirium was 1.6 (95% CI 0.8, 3.2). Delirium was a significant predictor of functional decline at both hospital discharge (adjusted OR 3.0; 95% CI 1.6, 5.8) and follow-up (adjusted OR 2.7; 95% CI 1.4, 5.2).
CONCLUSIONS: Delirium is an important independent prognostic determinant of hospital outcomes including new nursing home placement, death or new nursing home placement, and functional decline-even after controlling for age, gender, dementia, illness severity, and functional status. Thus, delirium should be considered as a prognostic variable in case-mix adjustment systems and in studies examining hospital outcomes in older persons."
9565438,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9565438/,"OBJECTIVES: To determine 1) the frequency of missed vaccine opportunities (VOs) in inner city children </=3 years of age; 2) whether the recommended vaccine(s) were given within 6 months of the missed opportunity (MO); 3) whether these vaccinations were age-appropriate according to the guidelines of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices; and 4) variables associated with MOs.
DESIGN: Retrospective chart review with a nested retrospective cohort of children with MOs.
SETTING: Two inner city practice settings in Milwaukee: a community health center and an academic continuity care practice. PATIENTS/SELECTION PROCEDURE: A consecutive sample of 710 visits of inner city children </=3 years of age with VOs, seen between January 1 and March 31, 1995. A VO was defined as any encounter when the child was vaccine-eligible according to Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices guidelines.
RESULTS: MOs occurred in 47% (330/710) of the VOs. Only 40% of the children with MOs received age-appropriate immunizations within 6 months; 30% received the vaccinations beyond the age-appropriate time. The remaining 30% either did not return or were not vaccinated on return. The variables significantly associated with MOs were 1) age: children with MOs were older than those without, with a mean age of 15.5 months vs 10.9 months; 2) minor febrile illness; 3) moderate/severe illness; 4) acute illness encounters; and 5) patient's being seen at the community health center. Only 15.5% of all MOs were justified by the presence of moderate/severe illness.
CONCLUSIONS: VOs are frequently missed in inner city children. Most of the MOs were not justified by the valid contraindication of moderate/severe illness. Sixty percent of the children with MOs did not receive age-appropriate immunizations within 6 months. These children are vulnerable to vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles and pertussis."
9566100,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9566100/,"BACKGROUND: Leukotrienes and prostaglandines are important mediators of inflammation. While prostaglandine synthesis can be influenced by NSAIDs therapeutical approaches to the 5-lipoxygenase pathway are rare. Resinous extracts of Boswellia serrata (H15, indish incense), known from traditional ayurvedic medicine, decrease leukotriene synthesis in vitro. Case reports suggest a clinical role for that drug.
METHODS: Outpatients with active RA have been enrolled into a multicenter controlled trial. Patients received 9 tablets of active drug (3600 mg) or placebo daily in addition to their previous therapy. Doses of NSAIDs could be adjusted on demand. Efficacy parameters, Ritchies Index for swelling and pain, ESR, CRP, pain on VAS and NSAID dose were documented at baseline and 6 and 12 weeks after initiation. Mean values and medians were calculated to compare the groups for significant or clinically relevant change from baseline or difference between both groups at any time point of observation.
RESULTS: A total of 78 patients were recruited in 4 centers, the data have been published in abstract form. Only 37 patients (verum 18, placebo 19), enrolled in Ratingen were available for detailed efficacy and safety analysis. All evaluations in these patients were performed by one investigator (G.H.). There was no subjective, clinical or laboratory parameter showing a significant or clinically relevant change from baseline or difference between both groups at any time point of observation. The mean NSAID dose reduction reached levels of 5.8% (H15) and 3.1% (placebo). One patient in each group showed a good response in all parameters but 4 patients in each group worsened. The others showed no alteration of their disease.
CONCLUSION: Treatment with H15 showed no measurable efficacy. Controlled studies including a greater patient population are necessary to confirm or reject our results."
9566175,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9566175/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of a voucher for free mammography on compliance with recommended mammography screening guidelines.
STUDY DESIGN: Vouchers for free mammography distributed to a random sample of women over the age of 50 in two rural southern Minnesota counties. The vouchers were good for one year. Baseline and follow-up data were collected and rates of compliance with current mammography guidelines were observed for the voucher group and a control group of women living in the same counties.
METHODS: Logistic regression models were used to estimate the effect of the voucher on compliance with mammography guidelines and the impact of factors potentially influencing the effectiveness of the voucher.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The voucher improved mammography rates primarily through increasing screening among women who were out of compliance at baseline.
CONCLUSIONS: Vouchers, even when distributed randomly within a population of rural Midwestern women, can significantly improve compliance rates. Vouchers are no less effective a means of increasing screening among vulnerable women than among other women."
9567219,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9567219/,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: The mechanisms of initiation and maintenance of renal fibrosis remain obscure, but one hypothesis highlights the importance of tubular epithelial cell-interstitial fibroblast interactions and suggests that tubular injury may be a precipitating factor. The aims of the study were to examine the effects of factors of proximal tubular origin on renal fibroblasts expressing different levels of smooth muscle actin (SMA; a putative marker of fibroblast activation) and to examine the modulation of SMA by extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), a major profibrotic cytokine.
METHODS: Primary cultures of rat cortical fibroblasts (CF) and the rat kidney fibroblast cell line NRK-49F were (1) cultured on different ECM proteins; (2) treated with medium conditioned by rat proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTE), and (3) treated with TGF-beta 1. SMA protein expression was examined by immunocytochemistry, while expression of MMP-2, MMP-3, TIMP-1, and collagen I mRNA was determined by Northern blot analysis or reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: In cells with low basal levels of SMA (CF), serum was the most potent inducer of increased SMA expression, although ECM proteins also modulated expression. With high basal levels of SMA expression (NRK), ECM proteins alone had little or no effect, but acted synergistically with serum to stimulate expression. In CF, PTE-conditioned medium (CM) had no effect on SMA and TIMP mRNA levels, but suppressed expression of MMP mRNAs. In NRK-49F, PTE-CM stimulated SMA and TIMP-1 mRNA levels, but had no effect on MMP mRNA levels. Although TGF-beta 1 modulated some cellular responses in NRK-49F, neutralizing antibody studies showed it was not the main mediator of the PTE-CM-induced effects.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest (1) that in renal fibroblasts SMA expression can be modulated by both serum and ECM proteins and (2) that PTE induce a fibrogenic phenotype in both non-activated (low SMA) and activated (high SMA) fibroblasts via different mechanisms."
9567334,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9567334/,"PURPOSE: To investigate the differences between clinical aspects and evolution of apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (AHCM) seen in Rio de Janeiro and the Oriental form, which was the first described.
METHODS: In 156 patients with AHCM diagnosed in our institution, there were 13 (8.34%) with the apical form of the disease, whose clinical settings, diagnostic procedures and evolution were studied.
RESULTS: There were 8 males and 5 females, between 19 and 75 years old, all white. Electrocardiogram (EKG) showed giant T waves in precordial leads in 10 (76.92%), echocardiogram (ECHO) demonstrated apical hypertrophy in all, 10 (76.92%) had only in the left ventricle, 2 in right ventricle and one involving both. Cineangiography corroborated ECHO findings. Follow-up ranged from 6 to 294 months (x = 95.4). Two deaths occurred in patients with RV involvement, due to large atria, atrial fibrillation, tricuspid or mitral insufficiency and thromboembolism. Among the survivors, the patient with RV disease has diastolic restriction and the ones with LV involvement, 9 are asymptomatic using either propranolol (8) or amiodarone (1), and one uses no medication.
CONCLUSION: A HCM seen in Rio de Janeiro is similar to that found in the Orient (Japan) regarding presentation, diagnosis and evolution; but in 3 patients we have found RV disease, not described in Japan, characterizing a distinct group with a worse evolution."
9567389,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9567389/,"BACKGROUND: Stunting is a prevalent problem in developing countries and may affect up to 50% of school age children.
AIM: To search for a relationship between the short stature of school age children of opposing socioeconomic levels and that of their parents.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: One thousand, eight hundred and forty two children of low socioeconomic level and 2,770 children of high socioeconomic level were initially measured. Those with a z score for height below -1 were selected (251 of low socioeconomic level and 157 of high socioeconomic level) and the height of their parents was measured.
RESULTS: Mothers and fathers of low socioeconomic level were 6.1 and 7.4 cm shorter than their counterparts of high socioeconomic level. The z score for height of low socioeconomic level children was significantly better than that of their parents and the relative risk for stunting was 2 when one of the parents had a short stature. Among children of high socioeconomic level, the relative risk of stunting was 4.8 and 11, when the mother or the father had a short stature, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The better height adequacy of low socioeconomic level children, compared to their parents, suggests that the new generations are growing better than their ancestors. Among children of high socioeconomic level, whose growth potential is fully expressed, the parents height is a good predictor of stunting."
9567392,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9567392/,"BACKGROUND: Epidemiology of osteoporosis is assessed measuring bone density or measuring the rates of bone frailty-related fracture rates. Of these, the most important are hip fractures, that markedly increase after 65 years of age.
AIM: To measure the incidence of hip fractures in Chile from 1982 to 1993.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: All hospital discharges that occurred in Chile from 1982 to 1993 were analyzed, looking for the diagnosis of hip fracture. National censuses in the same period were also analyzed searching for possible changes in the age structure of the population. Fracture rates were analyzed for three age groups, and changes along the years were calculated correlating the rates with the number of the year.
RESULTS: In the twelve year period, women aged 55-64 years old had a correlation of 0.32 (NS), women aged 65-74 years old had a correlation of 0.58 (NS) and women aged over 75 years old had a correlation of 0.95 (p < 0.001). This age group corresponded to 2.01% of the whole population in 1982 and to 2.52% in 1993. The mean age of the group increased from 80.7 to 80.9 years in the same lapse.
CONCLUSIONS: Fracture rates increased in the 12 years period studied, specially among women older than 75 years old. During the same period the proportion of people over 75 years old also increased, but there was only a slight increase in its mean age. Thus, the increase in fracture rates is disproportionate to population aging and could be related to changes in lifestyles."
9567642,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9567642/,"INTRODUCTION: Anorectal manometry provides objective information on the sphincter function of the anal canal. However, in many centers sphincter function is evaluated by digital examination, due to the unavailability of manometry.
OBJECTIVE: A study is made to correlate the sensitivity and specificity of a quantitative digital examination in the analysis of sphincter tone with the pressures recorded by manometry, and to examine the capacity of both techniques to discriminate continent subjects and incontinent patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 191 patients were divided into three groups: control (C), obstructive defecation (OD) and fecal incontinence (FI). Subjective quantitative digital evaluation of anal tone was performed on a scale of 0 to 5 points at rest, and 0 to 10 points at squeeze. A correlation analysis was performed, and the sensitivity and specificity of each fecal incontinence diagnostic test was determined.
RESULTS: Digital examination found rectal tone to be diminished in elderly patients. A significant correlation was established between the digital and manometric tone readings, both at rest and at squeeze. Both techniques showed a low anal sphincter pressure in the FI group versus the C and OD groups. Differences in tone were recorded between the C and OD groups with manometry, but not with digital examination. The latter was in turn found to be more sensitive but less specific than manometry in differentiating between fecal continence and incontinence.
CONCLUSIONS: Although digital examination does not substitute anorectal manometry, a good correlation exists between the two techniques. In this sense, digital examination may afford an approximate clinical evaluation of some fecal continence mechanisms in those centers where manometry is not available."
9568649,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9568649/,"BACKGROUND: Intraperitoneal culturing during appendectomy is a routine procedure. Significant decrease in the mortality and dramatic improvement in the morbidity were achieved by using antibiotics perioperatively. The value of intraoperative abdominal cavity culture was assessed in our study.
METHODS: A total of 499 patients formed two groups, those with acute nonperforated appendicitis (group A) and those with perforated appendicitis (group B). Intraoperative abdominal cavity culture were taken randomly in both groups. The perioperative morbidity, the validity, and the impact of positive culture on the antibiotic treatment were examined in both groups.
RESULTS: Clinical diagnosed perforation was confirmed histologically in 176 patients (98.3% accuracy). Intraperitoneal cultures were obtained in 30.1% of the patients in group A and in 67.1% of group B. The majority of the patients in group A were treated preoperatively and postoperatively by a single antibiotic agent whereas 58.0% of the patients in group B were started on triple-agent antibiotics for significantly longer periods (22.4 +/- 9.4 versus 5.7 +/- 7.4 doses, respectively; P < 0.0001). No significant difference was found in both groups in the postoperative complication rate (wound infection, intra-abdominal abscess and small bowel obstruction) whether intra-abdominal culture was obtained or not (5.9% versus 4.7% in group A and 21.2% versus 21.9% in group B; P > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Traditional intraoperative abdominal cavity culture can be abandoned. In perforated appendicitis, colonic flora can be predicted, and antibiotic therapy should begun without any abdominal cavity culture results. This practical approach will save money and reduce laboratory work without affecting the patient's morbidity."
9568658,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9568658/,"BACKGROUND: Blood bank recommendations specify that Ringer's lactate solution (LR) should be avoided while transfusing blood. However, there are few studies either evaluating or quantifying increased coagulation during rapid infusion of LR and blood.
DESIGN AND METHODS: Whole blood (WB, n = 25) and packed red blood cells (PRBC, n = 26) were rapidly admixed with normal saline (NS), Lactate solution and LR with 1 g (LR-1), 2 g (LR-2), and 5 g (LR-5) CaCl2/L solutions for assessment of infusion time, filter weight, and clot formation.
RESULTS: No significant differences in infusion time or filter weight using WB or PRBC with NS or LR were seen. No significant difference in clot formation between NS and LR with WB or PRBC was found, but the presence of visible clot was increased in the LR-5 group (P = 0.013, WB, and P = 0.002, PRBC).
CONCLUSION: A comparison of LR and NS with rapid infusion rates of blood showed no significant difference between infusion time, filter weight and clot formation. Blood bank guidelines should be revised to allow the use of LR in the rapid transfusion of PRBC."
9568943,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9568943/,"OBJECTIVES: To determine whether the current incidence of intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) of grade 2 or more is high enough in preterm infants born after 29 weeks gestation to justify the cost of screening with ultrasound and to explore clinical indicators for risk of IVH in the more mature preterm infant.
METHODS: This cohort study examined the incidence and severity of IVH in 800 preterm infants born between January 1992 and August 1996, of whom 436 were born after 29 weeks. Demographic and clinical details were collected from a prospectively maintained database. The Medicare schedule charge rate for cerebral ultrasound was used to calculate costs.
RESULTS: 1.1% of preterm babies born after 29 weeks gestation who had routine ultrasound scans had an IVH of grade 2 or 3, no infant had a grade 4 IVH. Two infants had a grade 3 IVH, both of which were symptomatic. IVH was poorly predicted by other clinical criteria. Using the Medicare schedule to estimate costs, detecting the five grade 2 or 3 IVH cost A$42,000.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of grade 2-4 IVH is low in infants born after 29 weeks gestation. Screening of this population is expensive and probably not justified. It may be most appropriate to scan these infants only if their condition raises concern."

DESIGN: Nurse practitioners and senior house officers in 13 A&E departments or minor injury units were shown 20 radiographs of distal limbs, with brief history and examination findings, and asked to record their interpretation.
OUTCOME MEASURE: A total score for each subject was calculated by comparing answers against agreed correct responses.
RESULTS: Nurse practitioners in general compared favourably with senior house officers. Those nurse practitioners who interpret radiographs as part of their role in minor injury units performed as well as the experienced senior house officer group.
CONCLUSIONS: Nurse practitioners in A&E are able to interpret radiographs to a standard equal to senior house officers with three to five months' experience. Those nurse practitioners actively interpreting radiographs as part of their role in minor injury units are able to interpret radiographs to the same standard as senior house officers with more than five months' experience."
9570598,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9570598/,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is associated with the unique complication of transurethral resection of prostate syndrome (TURS), which is attributed to the absorption of irrigating fluid. This study was initiated to investigate the effects of spinal anesthesia and TURP on cerebral oxygen balance.
METHODS: Thirty patients scheduled for TURP were included. Jugular bulb oxygen saturation (SjbO2) was measured via retrograde cannulation of jugular venous bulb. Spinal anesthesia was initiated by 3 mL hyperbaric 0.5% bupivacaine injected at L3-L4 in the sitting position, producing a block to the T10 dermatome. Hemodynamic measurements and arterial and jugular bulb blood gasometry were performed before and after spinal anesthesia, throughout surgery, and during the postoperative period.
RESULTS: A significant decrease of cerebral perfusion pressure after spinal anesthesia was accompanied by a significant decrease of SjbO2 below a preoperative value of 61% +/- 1. Eight patients developed yawning, irritability, restlessness, and nausea toward the end of surgery, and these were considered to be early signs of TURS. These patients demonstrated SjbO2 below 55% and 50% in 63% and 42% of respective data set points.
CONCLUSION: The neurologic symptoms in patients undergoing TURP during spinal anesthesia might not only be caused by absorption of irrigating fluid but also by impairment of cerebral oxygenation."
9571594,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9571594/,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate if disappearance of climacteric symptoms during hormone replacement therapy (HRT) also means good therapeutic level of serum estradiol. The study group comprised of 32 postmenopausal women who had frequent climacteric symptoms.
METHODS: The women increased the daily treatment doses of percutaneous estradiol every 2 weeks until they felt comfortable with it. Each woman continued at that treatment dose for up to 3 months. Blood samples for estradiol assay were drawn at baseline, every time before the estradiol dosage was increased and at the end of the study. Climacteric symptoms were scored according to the Kupperman menopausal index.
RESULTS: Despite the relief of climacteric symptoms, serum estradiol concentration was at a menopausal level (< 50 pg/ml) in 22% of the women. In all, 45% of the subjects showed serum estradiol remaining under 60 pg/ml, 29% of the women showed levels of 60-100 pg/ml and 26% showed serum estradiol concentration more than 100 pg/ml.
CONCLUSIONS: The disappearance of climacteric symptoms during HRT does not guarantee that estrogen levels are sufficiently high for obtaining long term benefits of HRT."
9572092,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9572092/,"BACKGROUND: The heterogeneity of schizophrenic and delusional syndromes by age of onset has frequently been discussed.
METHODS: The age distribution of symptoms and 5 year course was studied in a population-based first-episode sample admitted to 10 psychiatric hospitals before the age of 60 (N = 232) and in a clinical sample without age limit of consecutive first admissions to a single hospital (N = 1109), both samples with broadly diagnosed schizophrenia.
RESULTS: Early-onset patients, particularly men, presented more non-specific symptoms and higher PSE-CATEGO total scores than late-onset patients. In men, symptom severity decreased with increasing age of onset. In women, it remained stable except for an increase of negative symptoms with late-onset. Only a few symptoms changed markedly with age: disorganization decreased, while paranoid and systematic delusions increased steeply across the whole age of onset range. Pronounced age- and sex-differences emerged in illness behaviour, socially negative behaviour and substance abuse. Within the group of late-onset psychoses there were continuous transitions in symptom profiles and no discrimination between schizophrenia and paranoid psychosis or late paraphrenia. The main determinant of social course was onset level of social development. Early-onset patients did not improve in social status, while late-onset patients, prior to retirement, suffered considerable decline in social status.
CONCLUSIONS: Gender differences in age at onset and in age trends in symptom severity support the hypothesis of a mild protective effect of oestrogen. Social course results from an interplay between biological factors (age at onset and functional impairment) and development factors (level of social development at onset and illness behaviour)."
10090112,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10090112/,"BACKGROUND: For patients who have had a previous myocardial infarction (MI), the use of aspirin, beta-blockers, and lipid-lowering agents reduces the risk of recurrent MI and death.
OBJECTIVE: To examine trends in and determinants of receipt of these 3 medications before hospitalization for recurrent acute MI (AMI).
METHODS: The study population consisted of 1710 patients with a previous history of MI hospitalized with a validated recurrent AMI in all hospitals in Worcester, Mass, during 1986, 1988, 1990, 1991, 1993, and 1995. Logistic regression analyses were used to assess the effect of demographic, clinical, and temporal factors on the receipt of aspirin, beta-blockers, and lipid-lowering medications before hospital admission for recurrent AMI.
RESULTS: More than 47% of patients in each study year were not receiving each medication before admission, although significant increases in use were noted over time for aspirin (from 13.5% to 52.6%), beta-blockers (from 33.2% to 44.4%), and lipid-lowering medications (from 0.8% to 11.7%). In multivariate analyses, advancing age was associated with not receiving aspirin (odds ratio [OR], 0.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51-0.89), lipid-lowering medications (OR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.08-0.25), and beta-blockers (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.57-1.00), although this effect was of borderline significance for beta-blockers. Being a woman was associated with not receiving aspirin (OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.62-0.98) but was positively associated with receiving lipid-lowering medications (OR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.04-2.43). Coexisting medical conditions and concurrent use of other cardiovascular medications were also associated with receipt of each medication.
CONCLUSION: Despite encouraging increases over time, the low absolute levels of receipt of medications shown to be efficacious in the long-term treatment of patients after an MI, and their variation by age and sex, suggest that substantial opportunities may exist to prevent recurrent AMIs through the increased use of aspirin, beta-blockers, and lipid-lowering medications."
10090872,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10090872/,"BACKGROUND: The most recent major U.S. trials that evaluated community-level programs to influence risk factors and health behaviors identified secular trends in the risk factors and health behaviors among the factors that might have limited community-level effects. The research reported in this paper uses data from one of the trials to examine the secular trend explanation directly.
METHODS: Data from the 22-community Community Intervention Trial for Smoking Cessation (COMMIT) were analyzed to test a hypothesis based on secular trend reasoning: program effects for smoking prevalence were larger for treatment communities matched to control communities with small declines in smoking than in treatment communities matched to control communities with larger declines in smoking.
RESULTS: Consistent with the secular trend explanation, program effects were larger when control communities had relatively small declines in smoking prevalence.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that secular trends masked community-level program effects in COMMIT."
10091731,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10091731/,"BACKGROUND: Lymph node status is a key prognostic factor for pancreatic carcinoma. The paraaortic lymph nodes are the highest level of lymph nodes that can be resected safely in the abdomen for pancreatic and other gastrointestinal tumors. The pattern of paraaortic lymph node involvement and its relation with other lymph node groups were analyzed and the significance of this information relative to surgical therapy examined.
METHODS: Between 1974-1996, 99 patients with invasive ductal carcinoma of the pancreas underwent pancreatectomy at the study institution. The pattern of lymph node involvement, particularly paraaortic, was evaluated by careful pathologic review of extended lymphadenectomy specimens. RESULTS. Fifty-eight of 76 patients (76%) with carcinoma in the pancreatic head (Ph) and 19 of 23 patients (83%) with carcinoma of the pancreatic body and tail (Pbt) had lymph node involvement. Fourteen patients with Ph disease (18%) and 4 with Pbt disease (17%) had paraaortic lymph node involvement. Tumor size did not correlate with paraaortic lymph node involvement. A correlation was found between Group 13 (posterior pancreaticoduodenal lymph nodes), Group 14 (lymph nodes surrounding the superior mesenteric artery), and the paraaortic lymph nodes for Ph disease. All paraaortic lymph node metastases were located in the 16M region (the region between the celiac trunk and the inferior mesenteric artery). For patients with Pbt disease, the distribution of paraaortic lymph node metastases was the same as for those with Ph disease. Only 33% of cases of paraaortic lymph node metastases were suspected preoperatively or perioperatively. The longest survival for a patient with paraaortic lymph node metastases was 36 months and 17 months, respectively, for patients with Ph and Pbt disease.
CONCLUSIONS: The paraaortic lymph nodes are frequent sites of metastasis from pancreatic carcinoma, and are difficult to evaluate preoperatively or perioperatively. This situation mandates paraaortic lymph node dissection, at least in the 16M region."
10091831,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10091831/,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study in patients with quantitatively determined, poorly developed coronary collaterals was to assess the contribution of ischemic as well as adenosine-induced preconditioning and of collateral recruitment to the development of tolerance against repetitive myocardial ischemia.
BACKGROUND: The development of myocardial tolerance to repeated ischemia is nowadays interpreted to be due to biochemical adaptation (i.e., ischemic preconditioning).
METHODS: In 30 patients undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, myocardial adaptation to ischemia was measured using intracoronary (i.c.) electrocardiographic (ECG) ST segment elevation changes obtained from a 0.014-in. (0.036 cm) pressure guidewire positioned distal to the stenosis during three subsequent 2-min balloon occlusions. Simultaneously, an i.c. pressure-derived collateral flow index (CFI, no unit) was determined as the ratio between distal occlusive minus central venous pressure divided by the mean aortic minus central venous pressure. The study patients were divided into two groups according to the pretreatment with i.c. adenosine (2.4 mg/min for 10 min starting 20 min before the first occlusion, n = 15) or with normal saline (control group, n = 15).
RESULTS: Collateral flow index at the first occlusion was not different between the groups (0.15 +/- 0.10 in the adenosine group and 0.13 +/- 0.11 in the control group, p = NS), and it increased significantly and similarly to 0.20 +/- 0.14 and to 0.19 +/- 0.10, respectively (p < 0.01) during the third occlusion. The i.c. ECG ST elevation (normalized for the QRS amplitude) was not different between the two groups at the first occlusion (0.25 +/- 0.13 in the adenosine group, 0.25 +/- 0.19 in the control group). It decreased significantly during subsequent coronary occlusions to 0.20 +/- 0.15 and to 0.17 +/- 0.13, respectively. There was a correlation between the change in CFI (first to third occlusion; deltaCFI) and the respective ST elevation shift (deltaST): deltaST = -0.02 to 0.78 x deltaCFI; r = 0.54, p = 0.02.
CONCLUSIONS: Even in patients with few coronary collaterals, the myocardial adaptation to repetitive ischemia is closely related to collateral recruitment. Pharmacologic preconditioning using a treatment with i.c. adenosine before angioplasty does not occur. The variable responses of ECG signs of ischemic adaptation to collateral channel opening suggest that ischemic preconditioning is a relevant factor in the development of ischemic tolerance."
10091883,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10091883/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine to what extent tuberculosis incidence is associated with altitude.
METHODS: Notification rates were obtained from all 41 districts in Kenya in the period 1988-1990; the mean altitude of each district was estimated. Data on indicators of socio-economic status such as literacy rate and infant mortality rate were obtained from the 1989 census, as well as data on other potential confounders such as urbanisation and median household size.
RESULTS: The notification rate of new smear-positive tuberculosis was 32/100000 overall, varying between districts from 5 to 222/100000. Notification rates steeply reduced with increasing altitude (r = -0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.51 to -0.83). At altitudes of 1000 m or more the notification rates were less than 30% of those in districts at altitudes below 500 m, also after adjustment for confounding.
CONCLUSION: Tuberculosis incidence in Kenya decreases strongly with increasing altitude. If the association is not due to unknown confounding factors, a range of potential biological explanations needs to be explored."
10092568,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10092568/,"BACKGROUND: Myocardial stunning is known to occur following a single episode of effort angina in patients with coronary artery disease. The effect on left ventricular (LV) function of repeated episodes of ischaemia is unknown.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of repeated episodes of exercise induced ischaemia on LV function in patients with chronic stable angina.
METHODS: Patients with significant coronary artery disease and normal LV function underwent two episodes of symptom limited treadmill exercise separated by three different time intervals: either 30 minutes (group A, n = 14); 60 minutes (group B, n = 14); or 240 minutes (group C, n = 14). Quantitative stress echocardiography was performed at repeated intervals between the two exercises and for 240 minutes following the second test.
RESULTS: For all groups there was no difference between the degree of ischaemia judged by maximal ST depression during the two tests. All episodes of exercise induced ischaemia produced prolonged abnormalities of LV systolic and diastolic function despite rapid normalisation of haemodynamic and ECG changes. In group A (30 minutes) these abnormalities were less pronounced after the second test than after the first, while in group B (60 minutes) they were more severe and long lasting. In group C (240 minutes) the two tests produced similar abnormalities of LV function.
CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged abnormalities of LV function occurred following exercise induced ischaemia with a time course consistent with myocardial stunning. The severity and degree of LV dysfunction caused by a further episode of ischaemia appear to be dependent on the time interval between ischaemic episodes."
10092715,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10092715/,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine whether implementation of a set of standardized pediatric telephone triage protocols results in consistent triage dispositions when applied by different operators.
METHODS: A descriptive study with interrater comparisons was performed. Telephone interviews simulated the setting of a triage station in a university hospital-based pediatric emergency department. A mock parent presented 15 standardized respiratory cases in random order to 12 pediatric ED nurses. Nurses assigned patients' complaints to severity categories using 9 respiratory complaint protocols extracted from a commercially available pediatric telephone triage tool. Protocol selection and severity endpoints were recorded. Interobserver agreement among nurses was analyzed by the kappa statistic. Comparisons of operator characteristics and triage results were carried out by ANOVA.
RESULTS: Interrater agreement in triage disposition among nurses was poor (kappa,.11; 95% confidence interval,.02 to.20). Protocol selection varied; the group used a mean of 3 different disposition-generating protocols per case. Disposition also varied, with up to 4 different severity endpoints per protocol in a given case. A post-hoc comparison of the mean disposition severity between nurses did not reach significance at an adjusted level (P =.04). Fifty-eight percent of the nurses felt confined by the protocols, and 42% admitted to at least 1 intentional deviation from them.
CONCLUSION: It may not simply be assumed that the use of protocols will standardize care. This is particularly important in the case of triage, with current trends toward medical decisionmaking by less skilled providers with diminishing patient contact. Although triage protocols may be useful to guide clinical thinking, their consistency must be validated before they may be safely disseminated for general use."
10092896,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10092896/,"BACKGROUND: Recurrent varicose veins remain a problem in surgical practice despite improvements to the preoperative investigation of, and surgery for varicose veins. Neovascularisation accounts for some cases of recurrence within a few years of surgery, but other factors relating to disease progression must also play a part. We investigated whether new venous reflux (neoreflux) could occur in the early postoperative period (within 6 weeks) following successful varicose vein surgery.
METHODS: Eighteen-month prospective observational study in the dedicated vascular surgery unit of a university teaching hospital. Forty-six patients, with primary saphenofemoral junction reflux, awaiting varicose vein surgery were chosen consecutively from the waiting list. All saphenofemoral surgery was performed in a standardised fashion. Assessments were performed prior to, at 6 weeks and at 1 year after surgery. Duplex ultrasound was used to identify and locate sites of reflux.
RESULTS: Neoreflux was present at the 6-week postoperative scan in nine limbs after varicose vein surgery (19.6%), and resolved in 55.6% of patients within 1 year. Neovascularisation was noted in two limbs at the 1-year scan.
CONCLUSION: New sites of reflux, which may resolve spontaneously, occur in the early postoperative period despite adequate varicose vein surgery. It is our hypothesis that this is a manifestation of the effect of altered venous haemodynamics in a system of susceptible veins."

DESIGN: Retrospective analysis. Data were collected from hospital medical records and laboratory results.
SETTING: Large tertiary-level metropolitan teaching hospital, Victoria.
PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-six patients who had undergone BMB for investigation of isolated thrombocytopenia between January 1992 and May 1997, according to defined eligibility criteria.
RESULTS: Sixty-one of the 66 patients had BMB findings consistent with ITP (i.e., normal or increased numbers of megakaryocytes and other haemopoietic lineages normal). Three of these patients' biopsies incidentally showed reduced or absent iron stores. In the remaining five patients, BMB in four showed mild hypocellularity and the subsequent course in these patients was consistent with chronic ITP. The fifth patient had neutrophil hypersegmentation and giant band cells on BMB, the cause of which was unclear. The subsequent course in this patient has also been consistent with chronic ITP.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the routine performance of BMB for the diagnosis of ITP is not useful, provided that a thorough clinical history and physical examination are undertaken and that the blood count and peripheral blood smear show no abnormalities apart from thrombocytopenia."
10093169,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10093169/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the public health benefits of making nicotine replacement therapy available without prescription, in terms of number of quitters and life expectancy.
DESIGN: A decision-analytic model was developed to compare the policy of over-the-counter (OTC) availability of nicotine replacement therapy with that of prescription ([symbol: see text]) availability for the adult smoking population in the United States.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Long-term (six-month) quit rates, life expectancy, and smoking attributable mortality (SAM) rates.
RESULTS: OTC availability of nicotine replacement therapy would result in 91,151 additional successful quitters over a six-month period, and a cumulative total of approximately 1.7 million additional quitters over 25 years. All-cause SAM would decrease by 348 deaths per year and 2940 deaths per year at six months and five years, respectively. Relative to [symbol: see text] nicotine replacement therapy availability, OTC availability would result in an average gain in life expectancy across the entire adult smoking population of 0.196 years per smoker. In sensitivity analyses, the benefits of OTC availability were evident across a wide range of changes in baseline parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with [symbol: see text] availability of nicotine replacement therapy, OTC availability would result in more successful quitters, fewer smoking-attributable deaths, and increased life expectancy for current smokers."
10093609,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10093609/,"BACKGROUND: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an endothelial cell specific mitogen with strong angiogenic activity. Expression of VEGF may therefore be an indicator for the angiogenic potential and biological aggressiveness of a tumor. Recently, measurement of the VEGF-protein in sera has become available. We report results of serum-VEGF in an unselected group of patients with cancer with special emphasis on a possible role of anemia.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between August 1997 and January 1998, serum-levels of VEGF were determined in a total number of 54 consecutive patients with previously untreated, non-metastatic carcinomas at the Department of Radiotherapy at the Martin-Luther University Halle-Wittenberg. The age ranged from 35 through 89 years with a median age of 67 years. All patients had locoregional confined disease without evidence of hematogenous metastases. Tumor sites were gynecological cancers in 22, head and neck in 14, gastrointestinal in 13, lung in 4 and prostate in 1 case. Forty-four patients had squamous carcinomas and 10 adenocarcinomas. Prior to treatment, routine laboratory work-up was done including measurement of serum-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The pretreatment hemoglobin ranged from 8.9 through 15.6 g/dl with a median of 13 g/dl. VEGF was measured with a quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay technique.
RESULTS: The serum levels of VEGF in 40 patients with benign diseases ranged from 57 through 891 pg/ml with a mean of 267 +/- 170 pg/ml. In the investigated 54 cancer patients, VEGF ranged from 62 through 2,609 pg/ml with a mean of 614 +/- 551 pg/ml. Age, UICC/FIGO-stage, T- or N-category, primary tumor site, grade and histologic type had no significant impact on VEGF-serum levels. There was, however, an association between hemoglobin level and serum-VEGF with an increased mean serum-VEGF in 26 patients with a low hemoglobin (< 13 g/dl) as compared to 28 patients with a hemoglobin > 13 g/dl (805 +/- 656 vs 438 +/- 360, p = 0.016, 2-sided t-test).
CONCLUSIONS: With regard to the recently established correlation between anemia and intratumoral hypoxia, the increased serum-VEGF levels in patients with low hemoglobin may be explained via hypoxia-induced VEGF secretion. This would suggest that anemia may stimulate angiogenesis via hypoxia. The hypothesis, however, requires further investigation and might have important therapeutical impact."
10093689,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10093689/,"BACKGROUND: Mammography screening is a promising method for improving prognosis in breast cancer.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this economic analysis, data from the Norwegian Mammography Project (NMP), the National Health Administration (NMA) and the Norwegian Medical Association (NMA) were employed in a model for cost-effectiveness analysis. According to the annual report of the NMP for 1996, 60,147 women aged 50-69 years had been invited to a two-yearly mammographic screening programme 46,329 (77%) had been screened and 337 (0.7%) breast cancers had been revealed. The use of breast conserving surgery (BCS) was in this study estimated raised by 17% due to screening, the breast cancer mortality decreased by 30% and the number of life years saved per prevented breast cancer death was calculated 15 years.
RESULTS: The cost per woman screened was calculated 75.4 Pounds, the cost per cancer detected 10.365 Pounds and the cost per life year (LY) saved 8.561 Pounds. A raised frequency of BCS, diagnosis and adjuvant chemotherapy brought two years forward, follow-up costs and costs/savings due to prevented breast cancer deaths were all included in the analysis. A sensitivity analysis documented mammography screening cost-effective in Norway when four to nine years are gained per prevented breast cancer death.
CONCLUSION: Mammography screening in Norway looks cost-effective. Time has come to encourage national screening programmes."

OBJECTIVE: To appraise the adjunctive role of prednisolone (PN) in pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) with toxic reactions.
DESIGN: After excluding other febrile causes, and 2 weeks of four/five-drug antituberculosis therapy insufficient to resolve toxic reactions, 178 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative patients with advanced PTB causing persistent high-grade fever (> or =38 degrees C), weight loss (> or =2 kg/week) and/or low serum albumin levels (<3 g/dL) were randomly allocated to receive either a 12-month course of antituberculosis treatment using four first-line drugs and PN (20 mg b.i.d. IV/IM initially, decreasing over 40 days) (91 patients-PN group), or 12 months of antituberculosis treatment only (87 patients-CO group). Twice-weekly sputum bacillary count, temperature recorded every 6 hours, weekly weight, serial albumin level and liver function measurements and chest roentgenograms were used to assess the effects of PN on PTB.
RESULTS: Temperature decreased from 39.1+/-0.9 degrees C to 37.9+/-0.7 degrees C (P = 0.0030) within the first 72 (+/-9) hours in those patients on PN treatment, whereas a gradual decline occurred over 22 (+/-3) days in the CO group. In the PN group, patients' weight increased from 49.7+/-4.8 kg to 56.9+/-8.3 kg, compared to 47.1 +/- 6.4 kg to 51.31+/-5.9 kg in the CO group (P = 0.0022). Increases in serum albumin levels in the PN and CO groups were from 2.26+/-0.8 g/dL to 3.32+/-0.6 g/dL and from 2.31+/-0.5 g/dL to 2.90+/-0.7 g/dL, respectively (P = 0.0035). The radiographic regression and drop in bacillary count were more rapid, and the hospital stay shorter (53.4+/-3.1 days vs 71.3+/-5.6 days) in the PN group, although there were no differences in the acid-fast bacilli conversion rates. There were no detrimental side effects and relapses attributable to PN during the 1-3 year follow-up, even in 18 cases with drug resistance.
CONCLUSION: Prednosolone is a beneficial and safe adjunct to 12-month antituberculosis treatment in advanced PTB causing toxic reactions, provided that close clinical, radiographic and bacillary monitoring is exercised."

DESIGN: Descriptive study with a questionnaire to people collecting their prescriptions for long-term treatment.
SETTING: Patients of working age and pensioners of our health centre who take medication for chronic illnesses.
PARTICIPANTS: 100 patients of working age and 100 pensioners who take medication for chronic illnesses.
MEASUREMENTS: They were asked how much they thought each drug they picked up in CLT prescriptions cost. The figure given was compared with the real price. An opinion questionnaire, with 5 questions on the economic aspects of medication, was conducted.
RESULTS: Patients of working age knew the price of 64% of their prescriptions with under 25% error. Pensioners only knew the cost of 27% of their prescriptions with under 25% error. 50% of patients of working age were very interested in the cost of what their doctor prescribed, whereas only 30.4% of pensioners were.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients of working age know quite accurately how much the drugs they are prescribed for long-term treatment cost, but pensioners know a lot less. Patients believed that doctors were sufficiently sensitive to the cost of prescriptions."
10095441,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10095441/,"AIMS: The present series describes 15 cellular neurothekeomas whose clinicopathologic features indicate a close relationship to dermatofibroma.
METHODS: Retrospective clinicopathologic study.
RESULTS: Lesions preferentially occurred in adolescents to young adults on the upper half of the body, often clinically diagnosed as some kind of fibrohistiocytic tissue response. Besides characteristic whorled nests to fascicles of palely eosinophilic epithelioid cells all lesions showed variable clues pointing to dermatofibroma: acanthosis, ill-defined storiform periphery, peripherally accentuated prominent sclerosis and lymphocytic demarcation/infiltration. All cases were positive with NK1C3 (CD 57), Ki-M1p and proliferating cell nuclear antigen, 7 for neuron specific enolase, 5 for factor XIIIa, 6 for smooth muscle actin and 3 with E9, an anti-metallothionein marker. These findings are similar to other types of dermatofibromas, the variability of the profile being best explained by time cycle and function dependent changes. Ultrastructurally, two cases showed microfilaments, attachment plaques, prominent pinocytosis and focal remnants of basal lamina. A careful study of data and microphotographs from the literature reveals that in many cases similar conclusions can be reached. Obvious discrepancies are most likely due to the confusion with myxoid neurothekeoma, a well circumscribed, more spindly and myxoid, S 100 positive lesion of Schwannian origin.
CONCLUSION: According to our results cellular neurothekeoma seems to be a whorled-nested to plexiform epithelioid variant of dermatofibroma."
10096265,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10096265/,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of modafinil, a central nonamphetamine awakening substance, on blood pressure and heart rate in hypersomnolent patients with obstructive sleep apnea.
DESIGN: This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial was performed over 2 days and 3 nights in a single-center study of hospitalized patients from a referred care center. Twenty-six otherwise healthy men (age range, 30 to 60 years) with mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea were recruited by the outpatient department of the Marburg University Sleep Laboratory. Patients were given 200 mg oral modafinil in the morning and 100 mg at midday. Placebo was given in the same manner in a crossover design. Mean arterial (radial) blood pressure was monitored continuously during nocturnal sleep and during a series of standardized daytime physical and psychologic performance tests.
RESULTS: The difference in the main end point between the treatment with modafinil and placebo was 1.17+/-0.83 (mean +/- SE) mm Hg (95% confidence interval: -0.56 to 2.91 mm Hg). The maximal differences in blood pressure values occurred under loaded conditions (systolic blood pressure, ergometry: 5.62+/-1.13 mm Hg; mental stress test: 6.19+/-1.33 mm Hg).
CONCLUSION: Short-term administration of modafinil did not elicit a significant response with regard to the main end point. However, cardiovascular effects during mental and physical load were observed. Longterm studies that include subjects with hypertension are necessary to investigate the clinical relevance of the cardiovascular effects of modafinil."
10097779,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10097779/,"OBJECTIVES: We investigated homecare patients with dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT; n = 36) or vascular dementia (VD; n = 36) and their care-providing relatives regarding clinical and psychosocial variables to determine whether DAT and VD impose different burdens on caregivers.
METHOD: All patients were diagnosed according to ICD-10 criteria. The diagnoses were confirmed by internal medical, clinical-neurological, and psychiatric parameters. The severity of the dementias was graded according to the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS). Caregiving relatives responded to the Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (BAD), the Blessed Dementia Scale (BDS), and the Screen for Caregiver Burden (SCB).
RESULTS: Analyses revealed that caregivers' burden (SCB), disease symptoms and personality changes of patients (BAD), and the patients' inability to cope with everyday tasks (BDS) were sharply higher for DAT than for VD patients in the group with severe dementia. Concerning patients with mild or moderately severe disease, scores in the DAT group were similar or lower than those in the VD group.
CONCLUSION: In early stages, VD patients impose a greater burden on relatives than do patients with DAT. In severe stages this relationship undergoes a reversal, with relatives of DAT patients experiencing the burden more adversely than those of VD patients. The differences in the onset and course characteristics, as well as the specific differences between these two types of dementia with respect to caregiver burden factors, call for their diagnostic separation and the development of specific homecare support systems for family caregivers."
10097924,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10097924/,"OBJECTIVE: To compare, in men and women, the prevalence of undiagnosed type 2 diabetes assessed using criteria from the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the World Health Organization (WHO) and to investigate risk factors associated with fasting and 2-h postload plasma glucose.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data from two companion surveys of Europeans, South Asians, and Afro-Caribbeans in west London were used. A total of 4,367 men and women aged 40-64 years who were not known to have diabetes underwent an oral glucose tolerance test after an overnight fast. The prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes was estimated using the ADA (fasting plasma glucose > or = 7.0 mmol/l) and WHO (2-h postload glucose > or = 11.1 mmol/l) criteria for epidemiologic studies. The association of body fat and usual alcohol intake with plasma glucose and diabetes prevalence was assessed.
RESULTS: Compared with the WHO criterion, the ADA criterion gave a higher prevalence of diabetes in men (6.4 vs. 4.7%) but a lower prevalence in women (3.3 vs. 4.2%). In Afro-Caribbeans, the sex difference in diabetes prevalence was reversed. Women had significantly lower fasting glucose than men despite higher 2-h glucose levels. Alcohol intake was positively associated with fasting glucose in men and women but not with 2-h glucose levels.
CONCLUSIONS: The new ADA criterion, based on fasting glucose alone, does not take account of sex differences in metabolic response to fasting or possible artifactual effects on fasting glucose. With the ADA criterion, alcohol intake was a significant risk factor for diabetes in our study population; this was not the case with the WHO criterion."
10098566,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10098566/,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the impact of insurance status on inpatient resource use after adjusting for health upon admission and site of care.
DESIGN: Detailed patient information linked to billing records from the AIDS Cost and Service Utilization Survey (ACSUS), a longitudinal analysis of inpatient and outpatient care between March 1991 and August 1992.
SETTING: Hospitalizations of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients from 10 US cities with high incidence of AIDS.
PATIENTS: One thousand, nine hundred and forty nine adolescents and adults at various stages of HIV.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We estimate inpatient charges, payments and length of stay as a function of patient, and provider and reimbursement characteristics for more than 1,500 hospitalizations to HIV patients. We control for patient characteristics and underlying risk factors including disease stage, CD4 percentage, mode of transmission, discharge status, type of admission, and region. We use hospital-fixed effects to control for unmeasured differences across facilities.
RESULTS: Unadjusted means indicate that uninsured patients or patients covered by public insurance have significantly lower charges and payments than privately insured patients with similar medical conditions. We find that those differences are substantially reduced after controlling for the hospital in which care is received. Further, we find little evidence that ""underinsured"" patients are discharged sooner on average.
CONCLUSIONS: Inpatient resource use is affected by both the hospital in which care is received and the type of patient admitted. Failure to control for unmeasured differences across hospitals is likely to overstate the impact of insurance substantially."
10098568,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10098568/,"BACKGROUND: Ambulatory Care Groups (ACGs), a US case-mix system that uses the patient as the unit of analysis, is particularly appropriate for health care systems in which physicians serve a defined list of patients.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the extent to which the categorization of patients according to ACGs would account for the utilization of primary care services in a national health care system within the European Union.
METHODS: Of all subjects continuously assigned to 9 physicians from public primary health care centers in Bizkaia, Basque Country (Spain) over a 12-month period, those visited at least once (n = 9,093) were included. According to the subject's age, sex, and ICD-9-CM diagnoses assigned during a year of patient-provider encounters, patients were classified by means of the ACGs system.
RESULTS: Multiple linear regression analyses indicated that age and sex did not explain more than 7.1% of the variance in annual visits made by adults and 25.7% by children to primary care physicians. However, the r2 adjusted to the ACGs model was 50% and 48%, respectively, and even higher, that is 58% and 64% for another component of the system, the Ambulatory Diagnostic Groups (ADGs).
CONCLUSIONS: Those results support the inadequacy of using the patient's age and sex alone to estimate physicians' workload in the primary health setting and the need to consider morbidity categories. The ACGs case-mix system is a useful tool for incorporating patients' morbidity in the explanation of the use of primary health care services in a European national health system."
10098572,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10098572/,"BACKGROUND: Hip fracture is a common problem among older Americans. Two types of procedures are available for repairing hip fractures: hip replacement and open or closed reduction with or without internal fixation. The assumption has been that hip replacement produces better functional outcomes. Although that is the common wisdom, outcome studies evaluating hip replacement for treatment of hip fracture are few and have not clearly documented its superiority.
OBJECTIVES: To compare outcomes of hip fracture patients who receive hip replacement versus another stabilizing procedure (open or closed reduction with or without internal fixation).
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
PARTICIPANTS: We studied 332 patients (age, > 65) who were hospitalized for a femoral neck fracture and discharged alive.
MEASUREMENTS: We examined 2 treatment groups, hip replacement versus another procedure, on 6 outcomes [Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), walking, living situation (institutionalized or not), perceived health (excellent/good vs. fair/poor), rehospitalization, and mortality] at 3 postdischarge times (6 weeks, 6 months and 1 year).
RESULTS: Mean age was 80, 80% were female, 96% White, 28% married, and 71% had a hip replacement. The treatment groups were similar at baseline (3 months before admission as reported at discharge) on ADLs, walking, living situation, and perceived health (all P > 0.24). After adjusting for demographics, clinical characteristics, fracture characteristics, and prior ADLs, walking ability, living situation, and perceived health, patients with a hip replacement did not do better at 6 weeks, 6 months, or 1 year post-discharge on any of the 6 outcome measures (all 18 P > 0.10). A global test of all 6 outcomes finds hip replacement patients doing less well at one year (P = 0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the commonly held belief that hip replacement is a superior treatment for hip fracture, we found no suggestion of better outcomes for hip replacement on any of 6 key outcomes."

DESIGN: Cohort study with retrospectively collected data on size at birth.
SUBJECTS AND SETTING: The study included 1334 men born during 1920-1924, living in Uppsala, Sweden, who were examined at the ages of 50 and 60 years, and followed-up to the end of 1995.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mortality from circulatory diseases based on routine death registration.
RESULTS: Birth weight showed a specific, inverse association with mortality from circulatory diseases: the rate ratio was 0.67 (95% confidence interval 0.50 to 0.89) per 1000 g increase in birth weight. This association was not appreciably affected by adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics or smoking, but was strengthened slightly by adjustment for body mass index at the ages of 50 and 60 years. Adjustment for systolic blood pressure at the age of 50 years only slightly reduced the strength of the inverse association between birth weight and mortality from ischaemic heart disease, and did not affect the inverse association between birth weight and mortality from stroke. Adjustments for systolic and diastolic blood pressure and hypertension treatment at the ages of 50 and 60 years did not reduce the strength of the association between birth weight and mortality from circulatory diseases at the age of 60-75 years.
CONCLUSIONS: The inverse association between birth weight and mortality from circulatory diseases in men aged 50-75 years is independent of adult sociodemographic characteristics, smoking and adult obesity and does not seem to be mediated through an increased blood pressure in those with low birth weight."
10100516,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10100516/,"HYPOTHESIS: Otosclerosis does not occur outside the temporal bone.
BACKGROUND: The widely accepted assumption that otosclerosis is confined to the temporal bone has never been tested. It is important to investigate this issue, particularly because of evidence that otosclerosis may be a systemic (genetic) disease that could affect other bones.
METHODS: Biopsies from 9 to 11 skeletal sites were obtained from 2 patients with clinical otosclerosis. Two hundred forty-one nontemporal bone sections were examined by light microscopy.
RESULTS: No nontemporal skeletal bone section showed histologic evidence of otosclerosis. The data indicate, with 95% confidence, that the true prevalence of otosclerosis in the extratemporal skeleton of the 2 patients examined was < 3%.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that otosclerosis is unlikely to occur outside the temporal bone. Factors unique to the otic capsule that may predispose it to otosclerosis are lack of bone remodeling and the presence of globuli interossei."

DESIGN: Retrospective evaluation of all cases of infantile visceral leishmaniasis diagnosed in Tabuk, Saudi Arabia between 1989 and 1994.
RESULTS: 5 cases of infantile visceral leishmaniasis were reviewed. In four cases, no evidence of travel outside Tabuk could be identified, suggesting primary infection by viscerotropic Leishmanial organisms in this area of Saudi Arabia.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in two stages: a structured interview inquired about perceived dental caries status and treatment needs, and dental examinations were performed to determine oral health status and normative treatment needs. Perceived and normative assessments were compared for overall proportions, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV), using the dental examination as a gold standard.
RESULTS: Of 139 people examined, 122 were dentate. The PPVs for perceived caries and treatment need were 0.58 and 0.67, respectively. Overall agreement was 65.4 percent for the presence of caries and 64.7 percent for the presence of treatment need. However, no net error was found between the proportions of participants with decay, and a small net error (7.4%) was found between perceived and normative treatment need.
CONCLUSIONS: Self-assessment is not useful to assess individual dental treatment need, but is of possible value in assessing the needs of adult communities."

To evaluate further the effects of UDCA on this disease, we evaluated immunological markers and indices of inflammation during a one-year, prospective, open-label trial of UDCA therapy in patients with PSC.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventeen PSC patients were enrolled for one year of treatment with UDCA 12-15 mg/kg/day. Serum biochemical variables, immunological markers and indices of inflammation were compared before and at the end of therapy and 4 months after treatment had been withdrawn. Liver histology and immunohistochemistry for human leucocyte antigen (HLA) class I/II and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) expression were compared before and at the end of therapy.
RESULTS: UDCA treatment was associated with significant improvements in serum biochemical liver tests, immunoglobulin levels and blood coagulation factors. Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) production after in vitro whole-blood phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) stimulation was increased, but unaltered by UDCA therapy. Baseline serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and soluble IL-2 receptor were normal, and serum IL-8 levels were increased, but none of these variables was significantly affected by UDCA therapy. Liver histological stage/grade and HLA class I/II and ICAM-1 expression on biliary epithelial cells and hepatocytes were not markedly altered by UDCA therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: UDCA therapy in PSC patients was associated with a decrease in cholestasis, but no consistent improvement in hepatic inflammation, fibrosis or histological stage of the disease. Immunomodulatory effects of UDCA in PSC do not appear to be HLA-restricted."
10102346,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10102346/,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Breast-conserving surgery requires excision of all gross tumor and subsequent radiation therapy. It is generally accepted that the presence of microscopically positive margins requires reexcision. The goal of this study was to identify characteristics that distinguish breast biopsy specimens with positive margins that when reexcised are free from residual tumor. This population of patients may benefit from breast irradiation only, without the need for another surgical procedure.
METHODS: One hundred and fifteen of 395 cancer-proven biopsies had positive surgical margins and were treated with reexcision or mastectomy. Sixty-seven of these were negative for residual tumor and 48 were positive for residual tumor. Evaluation for tumor type, tumor size, grade, presence of vascular invasion, volume of the biopsy specimen, true positivity and the number of positive margins, multifocality of the tumor, and type of anesthesia was done by univariate and multivariate analysis.
RESULTS: Univariate and multivariate analysis revealed that factors associated with a positive reexcision included margin status, method of detection, histologic appearance, and type of anesthesia used.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that small, clinically detectable unifocal tumors could be treated without the need for a further excision. Eradication of microscopic residual tumor could be done by irradiation only, sparing the patient an additional surgical procedure."
10102457,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10102457/,"INTRODUCTION: Previous investigations have suggested a lower prevalence of the factor V Leiden mutation in patients with pulmonary embolism, as compared to patients with deep leg vein thrombosis.
METHODS: We studied unselected patients with pulmonary embolism, in whom we also assessed the presence of deep vein thrombosis by ultrasonography. We assessed the prevalence of heterozygosity for the factor V Leiden mutation and compared the outcome of patients with a normal ultrasound (primary pulmonary embolism) to those with an abnormal ultrasound (combined form of venous thromboembolism). Furthermore, we performed a literature search to identify all articles regarding the prevalence of heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation in patients with primary deep vein thrombosis, primary pulmonary embolism and a combined form of venous thromboembolism. We calculated a (common) odds ratio for these 3 manifestations of venous thromboembolism, including the current findings.
RESULTS: In 92 patients with proven pulmonary embolism, 25 (27%) had also an abnormal ultrasound. In these patients, the prevalence of the factor V Leiden mutation was 24% (95% CI 9%-45%), whereas the mutation was present in 5 of 67 patients with primary pulmonary embolism (7%; 95% CI 2%-16%). The literature analysis indicated the common odds ratio for the presence of heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation in patients with primary deep vein thrombosis, primary pulmonary embolism and the combined form of venous thromboembolism to be 7.9 (95% CI 5-12), 3.5 (95% CI 2-6) and 6.8 (95% CI 3-14), respectively.
CONCLUSION: In patients with primary pulmonary embolism the prevalence of the factor V Leiden mutation appears to be half of that reported in patients with primary deep vein thrombosis. The mechanism remains unclear."
10102548,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10102548/,"OBJECTIVE: Describe the symptoms experienced by patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), compare women and men with regard to their physical and psychologic symptoms, and determine the predictors of fatigue for the group as a whole and for women separately.
DESIGN: Correlational, predictive.
PARTICIPANTS: One hundred four (48 women/56 men) outpatients with severe COPD and a mean age of 60 years.
MEASURES: Self-report of fatigue using the SF-36 energy/fatigue subscale and a ""lack of energy"" question. Self-report of dyspnea, general symptoms using the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale, and psychologic symptoms using the Brief Symptom Inventory. Pulmonary function tests and arterial blood gas levels.
RESULTS: Patients reported a moderate level of fatigue (mean of 44 on the SF-36), with no difference in the reports of men and women. When reporting their ""lack of energy"" during the past week, women reported more fatigue than did men. Other symptoms in descending order of reporting were dyspnea and cough. More women reported ""don't look like myself"" than did men. Women and men were similar in their psychologic symptoms except anxiety, which was higher in women (t = 2.64, p < .01). Predictors of fatigue (SF-36 subscale) for the group as a whole were found to be dyspnea and physical symptoms, predicting 42% of the variance. For the women alone, dyspnea and physical symptoms entered the equation, to predict 67% of the variance in fatigue.
CONCLUSIONS: Predictors of fatigue were similar for women compared to the group as a whole, with symptoms having more of an impact on fatigue than did physiologic variables."
10102850,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10102850/,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the direct and indirect effects of being a twin, maternal smoking, birth weight, and mother's height on blood pressure at ages 9 and 18 years.
DESIGN: Longitudinal study.
SUBJECTS: Cohort born in 1972-3.
SETTING: Dunedin, New Zealand.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Blood pressure at ages 9 and 18 years.
RESULTS: Compared with singletons, twins had a systolic blood pressure 4.55 (95% confidence interval 1.57 to 7.52) mm Hg lower at age 9 after adjustment for direct and indirect effects of sex, maternal smoking, mother's height, socioeconomic status, and birth weight, as well as concurrent height and body mass index. Blood pressure in children whose mothers had smoked during pregnancy was 1.54 (0.46 to 2.62) mm Hg higher than in those whose mothers did not. The total effect of birth weight on systolic blood pressure at age 9 was -0.78 (-1.76 to 0.20) mm Hg and that for mother's height was 0.10 (0.06 to 0.14) mm Hg. Similar results were obtained for systolic blood pressure at age 18. The total effect of twins, maternal smoking, and birth weight on diastolic blood pressure was not significant at either age.
CONCLUSIONS: Twins had lower birth weight and lower systolic blood pressure at ages 9 and 18 than singletons. This finding challenges the fetal origins hypothesis. The effect of maternal smoking was consistent with the fetal origin hypothesis in that the infants of smokers were smaller and had higher blood pressure at both ages. This may be explained by pharmacological rather than nutritional effects. The total effect of birth weight on systolic blood pressure, after its indirect effect working through concurrent measures of height and body mass index was taken into account, was small."
10102950,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10102950/,"BACKGROUND: A direct role for neutrophils in the pathophysiology of indomethacin-induced gastric damage is controversial. Therefore, such damage was evaluated in hamsters.
METHODS: Gastric antral damage was evaluated 4 h after the oro-gastric administration of indomethacin (30 mg/kg). Prior to indomethacin, hamsters were treated with various pharmacological agents: rebamipide, methotrexate or anti-neutrophil serum (ANS). The number of circulating neutrophils was determined from Wright-Giemsa stained blood smears. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was measured as a marker of gastric antral neutrophil infiltration.
RESULTS: Indomethacin caused primarily gastric antral damage. By histology, this damage did not penetrate the muscularis mucosa. A significant increase in gastric antral MPO activity was also found in indomethacin-treated hamsters. Rebamipide decreased macroscopic gastric antral damage in a dose-related fashion. Methotrexate treatment reduced the circulating blood neutrophil number by 38-44%, but did not affect gastric damage. ANS treatment resulted in near complete neutropenia, and also in a substantial reduction (84%) in gastric antral MPO activity. However, gastric antral damage was not significantly altered by ANS.
CONCLUSIONS: Neutrophils are not directly involved in the pathophysiology of indomethacin-induced damage to the hamster gastric antrum."
10102966,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10102966/,"AIM: To compare the diagnostic accuracy of routine histology for Helicobacter pylori infection, with histology by an expert pathologist, and to compare histology with the rapid urease test (RUT), 13C-urea breath test, IgG serology and culture of antrum and corpus specimens, in a consecutive series of untreated patients presenting for upper oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: One-hundred and fifteen consecutive patients underwent multiple tests for H. pylori infection: rapid urease test, 13C-urea breath test, IgG serology and histology and culture on antrum and corpus biopsy specimens. Histology was first evaluated by the pathologists in a routine examination, and then blindly reviewed by an expert pathologist with a special interest in gastrointestinal pathology. The patients were considered to be H. pylori-positive if two or more tests were positive.
RESULTS: Eighty-one patients (70.4%) were found to be H. pylori positive. 13C-urea breath test and IgG serology showed the best sensitivity and specificity (100%). Both the antral and body cultures, and the rapid urease test had the highest specificity (100%). Histological diagnosis after re-evaluation by an expert pathologist showed a high sensitivity (98. 8%) and specificity (100%), and was better than routine histology (sensitivity 92.6%; specificity 90.3%). The accuracy of the rapid urease test was greater than that of routine histology, and the combination of these two tests improved the sensitivity of H. pylori detection to up to 100%.
CONCLUSION: All diagnostic tests usually utilised in clinical practice have a sensitivity higher than 90%. In patients who were not pre-treated with antisecretory agents or antibiotics, the sensitivity of histological diagnosis, however, seems to be influenced by the accuracy of the histological examination. The sensitivity of routine histology, but not of revised histological diagnosis, is improved by an additional rapid urease test."
10102971,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10102971/,"BACKGROUND: The efficacy of sulphasalazine and mesalazine in preventing relapse in patients with ulcerative colitis is well known. It is less clear how long such maintenance should be continued, and if the duration of disease remission is a factor that affects the risk of recurrence.
AIM: To determine whether the duration of disease remission affects the relapse rate, by comparing the efficacy of a delayed-release mesalazine (Asacol, Bracco S.p.A., Milan, Italy) against placebo in patients with ulcerative colitis with short- and long-duration of disease remission.
METHODS: 112 patients (66 male, 46 female, mean age 35 years), with intermittent chronic ulcerative colitis in clinical, endoscopic and histological remission with sulphasalazine or mesalazine for at least 1 year, were included in the study. Assuming that a lower duration of remission might be associated with a higher relapse rate, the patients were stratified according to the length of their disease remission, prior to randomization into Group A (Asacol 26, placebo 35) in remission from 1 to 2 years, or Group B (Asacol 28, placebo 23) in remission for over 2 years, median 4 years. Patients were treated daily with oral Asacol 1.2 g vs. placebo, for a follow-up period of 1 year.
RESULTS: We employed an intention-to-treat analysis. In Group A, whilst no difference was found between the two treatments after 6 months, mesalazine was significantly more effective than placebo in preventing relapse at 12 months [Asacol 6/26 (23%), placebo 17/35 (49%), P = 0.035, 95% Cl: 48-2.3%]. In contrast, in Group B no statistically significant difference was observed between the two treatments, either at 6 or 12 months [Asacol 5/28 (18%), placebo 6/23 (26%), P = 0.35, 95% Cl: 31-14%] of follow-up. Patients in group B were older, and had the disease and remission duration for longer, than those in Group A.
CONCLUSIONS: Mesalazine prophylaxis is necessary for the prevention of relapse by patients with ulcerative colitis in remission for less than 2 years, but this study casts doubt over whether continuous maintenance treatment is necessary in patients with prolonged clinical, endoscopic and histological remission, who are at very low risk of relapse."

OBJECTIVE: To assess whether greater COC is associated with lower emergency department (ED) utilization.
SETTING: Outpatient teaching clinic at Children's Hospital and Regional Medical Center, Seattle, WA.
PATIENTS: All 785 Medicaid managed care children ages 0 to 19 years followed at Children's Hospital and Regional Medical Center between 1993 to 1997 who had at least four outpatient visits.
METHODS: Retrospective claims-based analysis. COC was quantified based on the number of different care providers in relation to the number of clinic visits.
RESULTS: Attending COC was significantly greater than resident COC. In a multiple event survival analysis, compared with those patients in the lowest tertile of attending COC, those in the middle tertile had 30% lower ED utilization (hazard ratio 0.70 [0.53-0.93]) and those in the highest tertile had 35% lower ED use (hazard ratio 0.65 [0.50-0.80]). Resident COC was not significantly associated with ED use.

10103328,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10103328/,"OBJECTIVE: To compare general pediatric knowledge acquisition and clinical problem-solving skills by students pre- and postcurricular reform based on the 1994 Ambulatory Pediatric Association and the Council on Medical Student Education in Pediatrics (APA-COMSEP) curricular guidelines.
SETTING: A large, urban academic medical center.
SUBJECTS: Third-year medical students on a required clerkship in Pediatrics.
INTERVENTION: Pre- and postcurricular revision, the students were given both the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) Pediatric Subject Examination and an objective examination, which was developed in-house, based on the APA-COMSEP guidelines (Pediatric Clerkship Examination [PCE]). Baseline data before curricular revision were obtained on 52 students from May 1995 to May 1996. After curricular redesign in May 1996, data were obtained on 42 students from May 1996 to May 1997. Curricular revision focused on the following: defining educational principles, selecting teaching strategies, defining learning objectives, implementing the curriculum, and evaluating the students with an examination.
RESULTS: Before curricular revision, the average NBME score was 521 +/- 122. The average PCE score was 53.7% +/- 10.1%. After curricular revision, the average NBME score was 520 +/- 109, and the average PCE score was 67.7% +/- 8.4%. Content areas showing the greatest improvement were fluids and electrolytes, issues pertaining to the newborn, and health supervision.
CONCLUSIONS: Our baseline data indicate that despite spending two thirds of the clerkship in the ambulatory setting, students did not acquire adequate general pediatric knowledge or clinical problem-solving ability. After broad clerkship revision based on the APA-COMSEP Core Curriculum, students' acquisition of general pediatric knowledge and clinical problem-solving improved significantly, as measured by the PCE. The overall NBME Pediatric Subject Examination scores did not reflect this increased acquisition of general pediatric knowledge."

DESIGN: Cross-sectional case-control analysis of structured parent interviews conducted in two hospital-based and four community-based pediatric clinics in New England.
SUBJECTS: Parents of 199 healthy 1- to 5-year-old children whose mean age was 30 +/- 15 (SD) months were interviewed. Parents were primarily mothers (94%) with a mean age of 28 +/- 7 (SD) years 60% of whom were single. Educational levels of study parents varied: 43% had not graduated from high school, 29% had a high school equivalency, and 28% had at least a year of college or vocational training. This was a multiethnic parent group. Sixty-five percent were bilingual or non-English speaking. Fifty-eight percent were born outside of the continental United States. Parents were primarily of low-income status with 85% receiving Women, Infant, and Children (WIC) food supplements, Aid to Families With Dependent Children, and/or Medicaid.
RESULTS: Half of the parents interviewed reported that they rarely read books. Sixty percent of children had fewer than 10 books at home and two-thirds of these households contained fewer than 50 books total. When asked open-ended questions, 28% of parents said that sharing books with their child was one of their three favorite activities together, 14% said that looking at books was one of their child's three favorite things to do, and 19% reported sharing books at bedtime at least six times each week. Thirty-nine percent of families had at least one of these three literacy-related responses present and so were said to have a CCLO. A backwards stepwise multiple logistic regression on CCLO was performed with family financial, human, and social capital variables. Parents married or living together (odds ratio [OR] 2.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.21-5.42), higher adult-to-child ratios in the home (OR 1.92, 95% CI = 1.20-3.05), households speaking only English (OR 2.67, 95% CI = 1.24-5.76), parents reading books themselves at least a few times a week (OR 2.86, 95% CI = 1.38-5.91), and homes with more than 10 children's books (OR 3.3, 95% CI = 1.6-6.83), were all independently and significantly associated with the presence of CCLO. Older child age and higher parent education remain in the model but were not significant at the P <.05 level. Ethnicity and income status were dropped for lack of additional significance from this model, which described 24% of the variance in CCLO.
CONCLUSION: Although two-parent families and higher adult-to-child ratios in the home appear to be social capital variables with protective effects, low-income, single-parent, and minority or immigrant families are at significant risk for lacking both children's books and a CCLO. We suggest that CCLO may itself be another form of social capital reflecting parental goals and expectations for their children. We speculate that interventions which provide children's books and information about reading with children to impoverished families with young children may facilitate more parent-child book sharing. Pediatricians and other primary care providers serving underserved populations may have a unique opportunity to encourage activities focusing on young children and promoting literacy."
1986828,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1986828/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost of screening all Canadians aged 30 years or more without coronary heart disease (CHD) for hypercholesterolemia.
DATA SOURCES: The expected results of initial screening of the serum cholesterol level were estimated on the basis of 1986 Canadian census data and the 1978 Canada Health Survey. The results of repeat testing were estimated on the basis of data from the Lipid Research Clinics Prevalence Study. Lipid profile results were extrapolated from tests at the Montreal General Hospital's clinical chemistry laboratory. Laboratory costs and primary care practitioner costs were provided by the Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists and provincial fee schedules respectively.
MAIN RESULTS: Among 12,479,356 Canadians free of CHD 48.7% would be identified as being at high risk, 4.8% would be identified as being at moderate risk, and 46.6% would be reassured that their lipid risk for CHD was low. The total cost of implementing the program in the first year would be $432 million to $561 million ($325 million for laboratory tests and $107 million to $236 million for visits to primary care practitioners).
CONCLUSION: The substantial cost of implementing a nationwide screening program must be weighed against the expected benefits to ensure that the final result is both practical and economically feasible."

DESIGN: Cohort study.
SETTING: Thirty-two hospitals in southwestern Ontario (1 level III, 1 modified level III and 30 level II or I).
PATIENTS: All pregnant women admitted to the hospitals and their infants.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Antenatal and neonatal transfer status, live-born with discharge home alive from hospital of birth, stillborn, and live-born with death before discharge.
RESULTS: Between 1982 and 1985 the antenatal transfer rate increased from 2.2% to 2.8% (p less than 0.003). The proportion of births of infants weighing 500 to 1499 g increased from 49% to 69% at the level III hospital. The neonatal transfer rate increased from 26.2% to 47.9% (p less than 0.05) for infants in this birth-weight category and decreased from 10.2% to 7.1% (p less than 0.03) for infants weighing 1500 to 2499 g. The death rate among infants of low birth weight was lowest among those born at the level III centre and decreased at all centres between 1982 and 1985.
CONCLUSIONS: Perinatal care in southwestern Ontario is regionalized and not centralized; regionalization in southwestern Ontario increased between 1982 and 1985."

DESIGN: A prospective study of a consecutive sample of patients with relapsing inflammatory bowel disease, followed by monthly questionnaires and periodic office visits.
SETTING: A referral-based gastroenterology clinic at a medical school.
PATIENTS: A consecutive sample of 32 patients with inflammatory bowel disease who had had at least one relapse in a 2-year period after entry into the study.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The Social Readjustment Rating Scale (measuring life events), the Beck Depression Inventory (a visual analog scale for depressed mood) and an inventory of intestinal symptoms were completed monthly by each subject with a 78% rate of compliance. A mean of 2.2 exacerbations was seen per subject during the study period. Life events were not temporally associated with changes in intestinal symptoms. Significant associations were found between intestinal symptoms and the two mood scales (P less than 0.05 for each), but no directionality in symptom occurrence could be detected in a time-lagged analysis. The results were similar when the months preceding exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease were analyzed separately.
CONCLUSIONS: Although these findings suggest that mood changed concurrently with exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease, no evidence indicated that stressful life events or depressed mood precipitated exacerbations in this study group."
1994793,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1994793/,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the role of endothelin-1, a potent endothelial-derived vasoconstrictor peptide, in pulmonary hypertension, by measuring its concentration in arterial and venous plasma.
DESIGN: A survey, case series study.
SETTING: University-affiliated hospitals and outpatient clinics.
PATIENTS: Twenty-seven patients with pulmonary hypertension: 7 with primary, and 20 with secondary pulmonary hypertension of various causes. The control groups (n = 16) comprised 8 healthy volunteers and 8 patients with coronary artery disease but without evidence of pulmonary hypertension.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Pulmonary artery pressure was markedly increased (94/43 +/- 23/13 mm Hg) in the patients with pulmonary hypertension. Venous plasma immunoreactive endothelin-1, measured by a specific radioimmunoassay, was significantly higher in patients with pulmonary hypertension (3.5 +/- 2.5 pg/mL, P less than 0.001) than in normal subjects (1.45 +/- 0.45 pg/mL), or patients with coronary disease (0.75 +/- 0.64 pg/mL). The arterial-to-venous ratio of immunoreactive endothelin-1 was significantly greater than unity in primary pulmonary hypertension (2.21 +/- 0.72, P = 0.01), whereas the patients with secondary pulmonary hypertension had a mean ratio not different from 1 (0.97 +/- 0.42). In contrast, the mean arterial-to-venous ratios were significantly less than unity in both control groups (0.59 +/- 0.35, and 0.54 +/- 0.64; P less than 0.02, for normal subjects and coronary disease patients, respectively), indicating a possible clearance of endothelin-1 across the healthy lung.
CONCLUSIONS: Patient with pulmonary hypertension have substantial alterations in plasma immunoreactive endothelin-1, which may reflect changes in net release or clearance of endothelin-1 by the lung. In patients with primary pulmonary hypertension, the high levels in arterial compared with venous plasma suggest pulmonary production of endothelin-1, which may contribute to elevated pulmonary vascular resistance."
1995137,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1995137/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the views of directors of public health on the importance of housing for public health and their departments' and health authorities' participation in housing issues.
DESIGN: Postal self administered questionnaire survey.
SETTING: All district health authorities in England and health boards in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland.
SUBJECTS: All 221 district directors of public health in England and chief administrative medical officers in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Response to questionnaire consisting of fixed and open ended questions on housing issues.
RESULTS: The response rate was 89% (196/221). Housing was perceived as a major health problem by 33% (65/196) of directors. Positive responses were most likely from inner city districts. In 47% (93/196) of departments there was a formal time commitment to housing issues with a median time of one session/week (range one per month to 10 per week). The main function was allocation of medical priority for public sector rehousing. Overall, 73% (144/196) reported some participation in this process. Reported participation in joint care planning and links with non-statutory housing organisations were uncommon. 53% (104/196) of directors had included housing issues in their annual health report. In 16% (32/196) of districts specific services for the homeless had been set up.
CONCLUSIONS: Although concern about the impact of current housing policy on public health was shown by a substantial number of directors, the main activity was still allocation of medical priority despite a background of increasing housing need and homelessness. The underlying need is for greater advocacy to produce a healthy housing policy for all, and the annual public health report could be used to promote this objective."
1999752,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1999752/,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of two teaching interventions to increase residents' performance of smoking cessation counseling.
DESIGN: Randomized controlled factorial trial.
SETTING: Eleven residency programs, in internal medicine (six), family medicine (three), and pediatrics (two). Programs were located in three university medical centers and four university-affiliated community hospitals.
PARTICIPANTS: 261 residents who saw ambulatory care patients at least one half-day per week, and 937 returning patients aged 17 to 75 years who reported having smoked five or more cigarettes in the preceding seven days. Of the 937, 843 were eligible for follow-up, and 659 (78%) were interviewed by phone at six months.
INTERVENTIONS: Two interventions (tutorial and prompt) and four groups. The tutorial was a two-hour educational program in minimal-contact smoking cessation counseling for residents. The prompt was a chart-based reminder to assist physician counseling. One group of residents received the tutorial; one, the prompt; and one, both. A fourth group received no intervention.
MEASUREMENT AND RESULTS: Six months after the intervention, physician self-reports showed that residents in the tutorial + prompt and tutorial-only groups had used more counseling techniques (1.5-1.9) than had prompt-only or control residents (0.9). Residents in all three intervention groups advised more patients to quit smoking (76-79%) than did control group residents (69%). The tutorial had more effect on counseling practices than did the prompt. Physician confidence, perceived preparedness, and perceived success followed similar patterns. Exit interviews with 937 patients corroborated physician self-reports of counseling practices. Six months later, self-reported and biochemically verified patient quitting rates for residents in the three intervention groups (self-reported: 5.3-8.2%; biochemically verified: 3.4-5.7%) were higher than those for residents in the control group (self-reported: 5.2%; biochemically verified: 1.7%), though the differences were not statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: A simple and feasible educational intervention can increase residents' smoking cessation counseling."
2003625,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2003625/,"BACKGROUND: The incidence of breast cancer has been increasing over time in the United States.
METHODS: To determine the role of screening in this increase, trends in the incidence of in situ and invasive carcinoma of the breast were evaluated using records of the metropolitan Atlanta SEER program between 1979 and 1986. From a sample of records, evidence of symptoms and mammographic screening prior to diagnosis was recorded.
RESULTS: The average annual age-adjusted incidence of invasive disease rose 29 percent among Whites and 41 percent among Blacks. Incidence increased in all age groups. A trend towards earlier detection of invasive disease was found. Asymptomatic tumors accounted for only 40 percent of the increased incidence among whites and 25 percent of the increased incidence among blacks, with mammography as the principal contributing procedure.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that increased detection accounts for some but not all of the rising incidence of breast cancer in the United States."
2003663,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2003663/,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to determine whether flight nurses can perform surgical cricothyrotomies with acceptable success and complication rates.
METHODS: This case series examined the survival, success, and complication rates of surgical cricothyrotomy. A specially trained flight nurse retrospectively reviewed all prehospital, emergency department, inpatient, autopsy, and outpatient follow-up records.
RESULTS: Fifty-five consecutive patients in whom surgical cricothyrotomy was attempted by a flight nurse during a two-and-one-half-year period were studied. Patients ranged in age from 9 to 76 years. The airway was not cannulated successfully by a flight nurse in two patients. In two patients, the tube was not in the cricothyroid space (one in the upper tracheal rings, and the other in the larynx). In three patients, packing was insufficient to stop bleeding from around the operative site; and in three the tube became occluded by blood in the emergency department. Finally, two patients developed subglottic stenosis.
CONCLUSION: Surgical cricothyrotomy in the field can be performed reliably by specially trained nurses. Because only the most critically ill or injured patients with unmanageable airways are subjected to this procedure, a significant complication rate can be anticipated."

Psychiatric problems seen among cancer patients may increase the suicide probability and patients perceive suicide as a peaceful death type. The aim of this study was to examine the correlation between functional life and suicide probability among cancer patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was conducted with 105 cancer patients as descriptive. The Functional Living Index_Cancer (FLI- C),""suicide probability scale"" (SPS) and personal information form were used as data collecting tools. Data were evaluated by descriptive analysis, and Pearson's correlation.
RESULTS: It was determined that 34.3% of patients thought of suicide. Significant negative correlation was found between functional life and suicide probability (r=-.641, p=0.000), increase being evident in those with poor functional life.
CONCLUSIONS: It is recommended that cancer patients should be supported for improving their functional lives with help in coping processes for illness and treatment symptoms. Evaluation of the patient mental status to prevent the suicide among this group is an important role for nurses."
25422310,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25422310/,"BACKGROUND: Studies in the USA and Europe have demonstrated inequalities in adult access to renal transplants. We previously demonstrate that the centre of treatment was impacting the time to be registered on the renal waiting list. In this study, we sought to ascertain the influence of patient and centre characteristics on the probability of transplantation within 1 year after registration on the waiting list for children.
METHODS: We included patients <18 years awaiting transplantation from the French ESRD National Registry. The effects of patient and centre characteristics were studied by hierarchical logistic regression. Centre effects were assessed by centre-level residual variance. A descriptive survey was performed to investigate differences in the centres' practices, and linear regression was used to confirm findings of different HLA compatibility requirements between centres.
RESULTS: The study included 556 patients treated at 54 centres; 450 (80.9%) received transplants in the year after their listing. HLA group scarcity, time of inactive status during the year, pre-emptive listing and listing after age 18 were associated with lower probabilities of transplantation. Patient characteristics explained most of the variability among centres, but patients treated in paediatric centres had a lower probability of transplantation within 1 year because of higher HLA compatibility requirements for transplants.
CONCLUSIONS: Although patient characteristics explained most of the inter-centre variability, harmonization of some practices might enable us to reduce some inequalities in access to renal transplantation while maintaining optimal transplant survival and chances to get a second transplant when needed."
25423471,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25423471/,"BACKGROUND: Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is associated with several extra-articular manifestations. Nephrolithiasis (NL) has not been recognized as one of those, however, several factors known to increase the risk of NL are at play in AS patients. The objective was to estimate rates and predictors of NL in Swedish patients with AS compared to the general population.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We performed a prospective population-based nationwide cohort study based on linkage of data from Swedish registries. 8,572 AS patients were followed for 49,258 person-years (py) and 39,639 matched general population comparators were followed for 223,985 py. Patients were followed prospectively together with comparator subjects from January 2001 through December 2009. The first occurrence of NL during follow-up was the primary outcome. Hazard Ratios (HR) were used to compare these rates adjusting for comorbidities and treatment, and to assess predictors for NL. Mean age at study entry was 46 years (inter quartile range 36-56 years), 65% were males. Based on 250 vs. 466 NL events, the adjusted HR of NL in AS patients was 2.1 (95%CI 1.8 to 2.4). Predictors of NL within the AS group included prior diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (HR 2.3; 95%CI 1.7 to 3.3), prior diagnosis of NL (HR 16.4; 95%CI 11.5 to 23.4), and patients receiving anti-TNF treatment (HR 1.6; 95%CI 1.2 to 2.1). Male sex was a risk factor for NL both in AS patients and in the general population.
LIMITATIONS: The risk for residual confounding and inability to study the chemical nature of NL were considered the main limitations of the study.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with AS are at increased risk of NL, which may be considered a novel extra-articular manifestation. Previous history of NL, IBD, AS disease severity and male sex were identified as predictors of NL in AS."
25423706,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25423706/,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the surgical outcomes of abdominal radical trachelectomy(ART) and the efficacy of transrectal ultrasonography in determining the upper end of cervical incision during this operation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: ART was performed in five patients with early-stage cervical cancer in the present clinic. In the first three patients, uterine corpus was transacted blindly at a level of approximately five mm below the internal os. In the last two patients, the authors performed transrectal ultrasonography before vaginal incision to evaluate the distance between upper margin of tumoral mass and internal os of cervical canal.
RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 21 months. During this period, menstrual abnormality occurred in three patients. The two patients in which transrectal ultrasonographies were taken intraoperatively had 9- and 12-mm postoperative cervical canal length and both of them were asymptomatic postoperatively.
CONCLUSIONS: ART is usually associated with menstrual abnormality at late postoperative period and transrectal ultrasonograph during this procedure may decrease postoperative morbidity."
25424158,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25424158/,"BACKGROUND: Intramedullary nailing is the accepted form of treatment for impending or pathologic fractures of the femoral diaphysis. Traditional teaching promotes the use of a cephalomedullary nail so that stabilization is provided for the femoral neck in the event that a future femoral neck metastasis develops. However, that approach may add cost, surgical time, blood loss, and added radiation exposure to staff members, and there is limited evidence in the literature that supports this practice.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: The purpose of our study was to evaluate the incidence of femoral neck metastases in patients who underwent femoral nailing of diaphyseal metastases.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of our Musculoskeletal Oncology database identified 145 femoral nailings performed for metastatic disease, myeloma, or lymphoma of the femoral diaphysis between 2001 and 2011. Average patient age was 59 years. One hundred forty-one patients underwent 145 femoral nailings (four were bilateral). One hundred forty-four of the nails used were cephalomedullary implants and one was a flexible nail. Thirty-six (25%) femurs had sustained a pathologic fracture and 109 (75%) femurs were treated as impending fractures. Eighty-four patients received either preoperative or postoperative radiation therapy. Average radiographic followup was 13 months and average postoperative survival was 16 months. Of the 141 patients in this series, 121 (86%) are known to have died at a median of 9 months (range, 0.1-133 months) after surgery. The latest followup radiographs were obtained at a median of 5 months after the femoral nailing (range, 0-119 months). Of the 90 patients with documented dates of death and radiographic followup greater than zero months, 76 (84%) had radiographs available within a year of death. Thirty-one patients had zero months radiographic followup. The median survival for this group of patients was only 0.9 months (range, 0.1-12 months).
RESULTS: No patients (0%) in this series had femoral neck metastases develop postoperatively.
CONCLUSION: Despite traditional teaching that supports the use of cephalomedullary implants when treating metastatic disease of the femur, we were unable to identify a single patient who had femoral neck metastasis after surgery on the femur. Our findings do not support the use of cephalomedullary implants in this patient population for the sole purpose of prophylactic femoral neck stabilization; however, this series was relatively small, and the experiences of other centers will be needed to come to a more-complete sense of the frequency of what in all likelihood is a rare event."
25424168,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25424168/,"BACKGROUND: Although researchers and practitioners have long been aware of interdependence among health behaviors, they tend to compartmentalize health behaviors in research and practice. This kind of approach often fails to acknowledge the syndemic nature of health behaviors.
PURPOSE: This study investigated differences in the relationship between cigarette smoking and other key health behaviors, such as vigorous physical activity, fruit and vegetable consumption, and binge drinking among young adults (ages 18 to 30 years) across 180 metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas (MMSAs) in the USA.
METHOD: A total of 19,027 young adults in the 2009 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data were analyzed using multilevel logistic regression models.
RESULTS: Both vigorous physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption were negatively associated with cigarette smoking, whereas binge drinking was positively associated with smoking. There were significant differences in the relation of smoking with vigorous physical activity, fruit and vegetable consumption, and binge drinking across the 180 MMSAs. These differences were associated with the prevalence of cigarette smoking and binge drinking for each MMSA.
CONCLUSION: As indicated by the social learning theory, geographic area-specific prevalence of health behaviors appears to reflect group norms regarding those behaviors which, in turn, affect the clustering of health behaviors in the respective area."
25424377,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25424377/,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the accuracy of the gestation-adjusted projection method of birth weight prediction, as compared to near delivery ultrasound estimated fetal weight, in a gestational diabetic population.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort was conducted including all women with gestational diabetes who had an ultrasound estimated fetal weight (EFW) between 34(0/7) and 36(6/7) weeks and an additional ultrasound EFW within 7 d of delivery at term. The gestation-adjusted projection (GAP) method was applied to the earlier sonogram, resulting in the GAP predicted birth weight. The GAP predicted weight and the term ultrasound EFW were compared to the actual birth weight. Absolute and percent birth weight errors were compared using paired t-tests.
RESULTS: The mean absolute percent errors and mean absolute errors for the GAP method and term ultrasound were 7.7 ± 5.6% versus 7.1 ± 5.1% and 256 ± 184 g versus 236 ± 169 g respectively (p = 0.22 and p = 0.29). The sensitivity of predicting birth weight ≥4000 g was 22% for the GAP method and 28% for term ultrasound, with specificity reaching 97% for both the methods.
CONCLUSION: The GAP method is as accurate as term ultrasound in predicting birth weight in gestational diabetes."
25424519,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25424519/,"INTRODUCTION: Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis (IGM) is a rare benign breast disease, which can be protracted, disfiguring and may be linked to an underlying autoimmune disorder. The clinical presentation may mimic bacterial mastitis or carcinoma.
AIMS: To review the mode of presentation, diagnosis, management, resolution and incidence of IGM in three tertiary breast centres and propose guidelines for management.
METHODS: The breast and anatomical databases of three centres were reviewed from January 2000 to December 2013 to identify patients with histological diagnosis of IGM. Clinical and demographic characteristics were retrieved and treatment modalities and time to resolution were recorded.
RESULTS: Seventeen patients were identified with a median age of 40. The majority of patients were premenopausal, multiparous and presented with a mass. All patients had initial treatment as infectious mastitis. The diagnosis was made by core biopsy in 71%. Eleven patients required immunosuppressive treatment with steroids and four of these patients required a steroid-sparing agent because of steroidal side effects, recurrence or persistence of symptoms. The median time to resolution was 3 months (0-24 months). One patient had subsequent systemic Wegener's granulomatosis diagnosed.
CONCLUSIONS: Idiopathic granulomatosis mastitis requires histological confirmation, close monitoring, exclusion of underlying systemic autoimmune conditions and judicious use of steroids and steroid-sparing agents such as methotrexate. It has a protracted course with some patients relapsing quickly upon cessation of steroids."
25424539,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25424539/,"BACKGROUND: Whether there are systematic differences in depression symptom expression during pregnancy, the postpartum period and outside these periods (i.e., outside the peripartum period) remains debated. The aim of this study was to use methods based on item response theory (IRT) to examine, after equating for depression severity, differences in the likelihood of reporting DSM-IV symptoms of major depressive episode (MDE) in women of childbearing age (i.e., aged 18-50) during pregnancy, the postpartum period and outside the peripartum period.
METHODS: We conducted these analyses using a large, nationally representative sample of women of childbearing age from the United States (n = 11,256) who participated in the second wave of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC).
RESULTS: The overall 12-month prevalence of all depressive criteria (except for worthlessness/guilt) was significantly lower in pregnant women than in women of childbearing age outside the peripartum period, whereas the prevalence of all symptoms (except for ""psychomotor symptoms"") was not significantly different between the postpartum and the nonperipartum group. There were no clinically significant differences in the endorsement rates of symptoms of MDE by pregnancy status when equating for levels of depression severity.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the clinical presentation of depressive symptoms in women of childbearing age does not differ during pregnancy, the postpartum period and outside the peripartum period. These findings do not provide psychometric support for the inclusion of the peripartum onset specifier for major depressive disorder in the DSM-5."
25424908,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25424908/,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the renal-protective effect of lercanidipine in patients undergoing renal artery intervention.
METHODS: A prospective, single-center, cohort study was conducted and patients, 30-75 years of age, with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis were consecutively enrolled between September 2011 and October 2012. Lercanidipine (10-20 mg/day) was regularly taken after the intervention. Follow up visits were performed at 3 and 6 months after the intervention. Serum creatinine, clinical blood pressure, 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure, pulse wave velocity, and 24 hour urine protein were assessed. Adverse events were recorded.
RESULTS: In total, 55 patients (mean age 63.5 ± 8.9 years) were enrolled and 52 completed the study. Renal function, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and 24 hour urine protein at 3 months after the intervention were not statistically different compared with the baseline. At 6 months after the intervention eGFR significantly increased versus baseline (78 ± 23 ml/min/1.73 m(2) vs 71 ± 21 ml/min/1.73 m(2), p = 0.021); 24 hour urine protein decreased significantly (0.02 g [IQR, 0.01-0.1] vs 0.03 g [IQR, 0.01-0.28], p = 0.042). Blood pressure control improved at 3 months and 6 months after the intervention. The need for antihypertensive drugs decreased; clinical systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and 24 hour average systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure decreased. The pulse wave velocity decreased after 3 and 6 months. At the end of follow-up, none of the following adverse events occurred: death, dialysis, myocardial infarction or stroke. Mild lower extremity edema occurred in only one patient. No other side effects occurred.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that lercanidipine can improve renal function in patients undergoing renal artery intervention."
25425086,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25425086/,"BACKGROUND: Negative symptoms are a core component of schizophrenia which can severely impact quality of life and functional outcomes. These symptoms are understood to be highly stable but this has not been tested in a meta-analysis, despite the wealth of longitudinal data available.
METHOD: A systematic review of the literature was conducted, with eligible studies pooled into a random-effects meta-analysis. Planned meta-regressions were conducted to evaluate the impact of factors known to induce secondary negative symptoms, in addition to other possible sources of heterogeneity.
RESULTS: The main analysis included 89 samples from 41 studies, totalling 5944 participants. Negative symptoms were found to significantly reduce in all treatment interventions, including in placebo and treatment as usual conditions, with a medium effect size (ES) present across all study conditions (ES = 0.66, 95% confidence interval 0.56-0.77, I(2) = 94.0%). In a multivariate meta-regression, only the type of scale used was found to significantly influence negative symptom change. No difference in outcome was found between studies that excluded patients with a high level of positive or depressive symptoms, compared to those that did not.
CONCLUSIONS: Negative symptoms were found to reduce in almost all schizophrenia outpatient samples. A reduction was found across all conditions, with effect sizes ranging from small to large depending upon the condition type. These findings challenge the convention that negative symptoms are highly stable and suggest that they may improve to a greater extent than what has previously been assumed."
25425093,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25425093/,"PURPOSE: The aim was to compare the power of spectacles donated to a recycled spectacle program to the custom-made spectacle refractive prescriptions dispensed in a developing country.
METHODS: Two hundred consecutive prescriptions were audited in an optical dispensary in Timor-Leste, a developing nation. These refractions were compared against measurements of 2,075 wearable donated spectacles. We determined how many of the 200 prescriptions could be matched to a donated spectacle measurement, how many donated spectacles could be tried for each prescription and how long it would take to find the matched spectacles.
RESULTS: There were 1,854 donated spectacles identified as being suitable for comparison with the 200 refractive prescriptions. Twenty-nine out of 200 prescriptions (14.5 per cent) were matched to at least one pair of donated spectacles.
CONCLUSION: Recycling all spectacles is not cost-effective in a developing country that has the ability to make custom-made spectacles and dispense ready-made spectacles."
25425363,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25425363/,"OBJECTIVES: Tremor is one of the cardinal features of Parkinson disease (PD) and may cause cumulative trauma-related injury to nerves of the hands. The aim of this study was to assess the electrodiagnostic and sonographic features of patients with PD and to assess the effect of tremor in PD on the median nerve.
METHODS: We studied 31 hands of healthy control participants (n = 16; mean age ± SD, 60.25 ± 14.67 years) and 81 hands of patients with PD (n = 42; 64.95 ± 11.13 years). Motor symptoms were measured by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III. Median nerve conduction studies and sonographic cross-sectional area measurements were performed in all participants.
RESULTS: The median nerve cross-sectional area in patients with PD (10.71 ± 2.79 mm(2)) was significantly larger than that in the control group (7.40 ± 1.05 mm(2); P < .05). However, there was no significant difference in median nerve electrodiagnostic findings between the PD and control groups. The median nerve cross-sectional area was associated with the severity of the tremor but not with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor score.
CONCLUSIONS: Tremor in PD is associated with median nerve enlargement but not with impairment of median nerve conduction."
25425371,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25425371/,"OBJECTIVES: Tolerance of intermittent hemodialysis is potentially poor for patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit, particularly those in shock. The aim of this study was to determine whether an evaluation of the hemodynamic state by echocardiography before an intermittent hemodialysis session could predict tolerance during the session.
METHODS: Before an intermittent hemodialysis session, transesophageal echocardiography was performed on sedated patients, and transthoracic echocardiography was performed on nonsedated patients. Poor tolerance during intermittent hemodialysis was defined by the following criteria: greater than 20% decrease in mean arterial pressure, need for fluid loading (≥500 mL), a 15% increase in catecholamine if the dose was stable before the session or doubling the speed of catecholamine infusion if necessary, arrhythmia, and the necessity to stop the session before its prescribed end.
RESULTS: A total of 54 patients were included: 20 (37%) were intubated under controlled mechanical ventilation (group 1) and underwent transesophageal echocardiography; 14 (26%) were intubated under pressure support ventilation (group 2) and underwent transthoracic echocardiography; and 20 (37%) had no ventilation support (group 3). Twenty-four patients (46%) had poor tolerance criteria. A comparison of groups showed no significant difference in tolerance. Similarly, there was no difference with and without ultrafiltration. Increased respiratory variation of the vena cava was not predictive of poor tolerance in groups 1 and 2. In group 3, there was greater variation in patients with poor tolerance. In patients receiving mechanical ventilation, greater respiratory variability of the maximum velocity measured in the pulmonary artery was predictive of poor tolerance.
CONCLUSIONS: The hemodynamic profile of patients receiving mechanical ventilation was unable to predict tolerance of an intermittent hemodialysis session. In patients without mechanical ventilation, hypovolemia before the session appeared to be predictive of poor tolerance."
25425528,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25425528/,"BACKGROUND: Some centers have advocated selecting patients with small papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) to undergo active surveillance without surgical treatment. The objectives of the current study were to analyze thyroid cancer (TC)-related mortality in a population-based cohort and to determine the impact of small PTCs (defined as tumors ≤ 2 cm in greatest dimension) on TC-related mortality.
METHODS: Data on patients with TC of follicular cell origin from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 17 Registries database (1988-2007) were used to analyze the characteristics of PTCs ≤ 2 cm in patients who died from TC-related causes. The effects of clinical features on disease-specific survival were analyzed.
RESULTS: Over the 20-year study period, the rate of TC-related mortality was 2.8% (n = 1753 of 61,523 patients). Of the patients who died from TC-related causes, 38% had PTC, 10% had follicular TC, and 31.3% had anaplastic TC. PTCs ≤ 2 cm accounted for 12.3% of TC-related mortalities. Compared with patients who did not experience TC-related mortality from PTCs ≤ 2 cm, there were significantly higher rates of men (30% vs 17%; P < .01), patients aged ≥ 45 years (92% vs 52%; P < .01), tumors measuring >1 cm (59% vs 46%; P < .01), extrathyroid extension (41% vs 11%; P < .01), lymph node metastases (77% vs 28%; P < .01), and distant metastases (31% vs 1%; P < .01) among the patients who died from PTCs ≤ 2 cm. Independent risk factors for death from PTCs ≤ 2 cm included age ≥ 45 years, lymph node and distant metastases, extrathyroid extension, and undergoing less than thyroid lobectomy.
CONCLUSIONS: Because 12.3% of patients who experienced TC-related deaths had PTCs ≤ 2 cm despite undergoing thyroidectomy, the current results indicate that nonoperative management for patients who have PTCs ≤ 2 cm should be used with caution. Patients aged ≥ 45 years with PTCs ≤ 2 cm should undergo thyroidectomy."
25425555,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25425555/,"OBJECTIVES: The impact of permanent pacemaker (PPM) leads on functional outcome of tricuspid valve (TV) repair has not been clearly demonstrated. Therefore, controversy exists as to whether transvalvular PPM leads should be explanted and replaced by epicardial leads at the time of valve repair. This study evaluates the influence of PPM leads on functional outcome, TV-related reoperations and survival in patients undergoing TV repair for functional tricuspid regurgitation (TR).
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 415 consecutive patients who underwent TV ring annuloplasty at our institution from July 2007 to February 2013. In 112 patients (27%), a PPM was implanted either pre- or postoperatively. The follow-up is 94% complete (mean: 24.4 months; cumulative total 845 patient-years).
RESULTS: The mean age was 70.2 ± 9.8 years and the mean logistic European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE) was 12.4%. Of note, 76.6% of the patients were in New York Heart Association class III or IV. Echocardiography documented moderate or severe TR in 96.4% of the patients, with a mean annulus diameter of 44.8 ± 5.4 mm. 95.4% of the patients underwent a combined procedure and 16.4% an urgent or emergent operation. The 30-day mortality was 7.5%. The preoperative TR grade was reduced from 2.47 ± 0.52 to 0.70 ± 0.54 (P < 0.001). At hospital discharge, residual ≥II TR was present in 7.1% of the patients. Freedom from recurrent ≥II TR at 5 years was 86.7 ± 3.2%. Upon uni- and multivariate analyses, the presence of a transvalvular PPM was not a risk factor for recurrent ≥II TR and late mortality. Freedom from TV-reoperations was 98.1 ± 0.8% at 5 years without significant difference between groups.
CONCLUSION: The presence of a transvalvular PPM lead is not a risk factor for recurrent TR, TV-related reoperations and late mortality in patients undergoing ring annuloplasty for functional TR."
25425588,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25425588/,"BACKGROUND: Little empirical examination of the relationship between work organisational factors and return to work following injury has been undertaken despite the growing recognition of examining broader multi-dimensional contexts for recovery following injury.
OBJECTIVE: To explore relationships between pre-injury work organisational factors and work status (working/work absent) 3-month after injury among people employed prior to injury.
METHODS: Cases (work absent) and controls (working), selected from a larger study of injury outcomes according to reported work status 3-month after injury, completed a postal questionnaire. Work organisational factors were compared between cases and controls using univariate and multivariable analyses.
RESULTS: One hundred and twelve participants completed the questionnaire (44 cases; 68 controls). Of 11 work organisation factors examined, organisational size was the only explanatory variable significantly associated with work status in the multivariable model. Higher odds of work absence were found in small (< 50 employees) (OR 5.6) and large (> 500 employees) (OR 7.2) workplaces, compared with medium-sized (50-500 employees) organisations.
CONCLUSIONS: Variations in post-injury work patterns among those working pre-injury may be partly explained by organisation size. Future research examining work status following injury should examine the influence of work organisational factors in larger studies."
25425679,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25425679/,"BACKGROUND: The prognostic benefit from heart rate (HR) reduction in patients with ischaemic heart disease (IHD) and/or chronic heart failure (CHF) is now firmly established. Most decisions regarding initiation and/or dose adjustment of HR-limiting medications in such patients are based on clinic HR. Yet, this is a highly variable parameter that may not necessarily reflect HR control over the 24 h period.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the level of agreement between mean clinic and mean ambulatory HRs in patients with IHD and/or CHF taking rate-limiting medications.
METHODS: Prospective, observational study. Fifty patients with IHD and/or CHF who attended cardiology outpatient clinics at the Manchester Heart Centre and underwent same-day 24 h continuous ECG recording between March and October 2013 were included in the study. Mean clinic HR was compared with mean 24 h, daytime and night-time HRs. Limits-of-agreement plots were constructed to examine the relationship between the two HR measures in more detail.
RESULTS: The mean clinic HR was numerically similar to the mean HRs of all ambulatory time periods examined. However, on Bland-Altman plots, the limits of agreement between clinic and ambulatory HR means were quite wide, with the mean clinic HR ranging between 10.93 and 13.58 bpm below and 8.4 and 18.15 bpm above the mean ambulatory HR.
CONCLUSIONS: Although numerically similar, the means of clinic and ambulatory HRs in patients with IHD and/or CHF display wide limits of agreement. As such, the two measures cannot be regarded as interchangeable."
25426708,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25426708/,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate if magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is the best Magnetic Resonance (MR)-based method when compared to gradient-echo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the detection and quantification of liver steatosis in diabetic patients in the clinical practice using liver biopsy as the reference standard, and to assess the influence of steatohepatitis and fibrosis on liver fat quantification.
METHODS: Institutional approval and patient consent were obtained for this prospective study. Seventy-three patients with type 2 diabetes (60 women and 13 men; mean age, 54 ± 9 years) underwent MRI and MRS at 3.0 T. The liver fat fraction was calculated from triple- and multi-echo gradient-echo sequences, and MRS data. Liver specimens were obtained in all patients. The accuracy for liver fat detection was estimated by receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis, and the correlation between fat quantification by imaging and histolopathology was analyzed by Spearman's correlation coefficients.
RESULTS: The prevalence of hepatic steatosis was 92%. All gradient-echo MRI and MRS findings strongly correlated with biopsy findings (triple-echo, rho = 0.819; multi-echo, rho = 0.773; MRS, rho = 0.767). Areas under the ROC curves to detect mild, moderate, and severe steatosis were: triple-echo sequences, 0.961, 0.975, and 0.962; multi-echo sequences, 0.878, 0.979, and 0.961; and MRS, 0.981, 0.980, and 0.954. The thresholds for mild, moderate, and severe steatosis were: triple-echo sequences, 4.09, 9.34, and 12.34, multi-echo sequences, 7.53, 11.75, and 15.08, and MRS, 1.71, 11.69, and 14.91. Quantification was not significantly influenced by steatohepatitis or fibrosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Liver fat quantification by MR methods strongly correlates with histopathology. Due to the wide availability and easier post-processing, gradient-echo sequences may represent the best imaging method for the detection and quantification of liver fat fraction in diabetic patients in the clinical practice."
25427259,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25427259/,"AIM: To test whether residents of Queensland differ from residents elsewhere in Australia with respect to support for water fluoridation.
METHODS: Questionnaire data were obtained from an Australia-wide sample of 517 adults. The study occurred in 2008, shortly after the state government mandated fluoridation across Queensland.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in fluoridation support or in beliefs regarding the benefits and harms of fluoridation between Queensland and non-Queensland residents. However, respondents from Queensland were more resistant to changing their minds regarding their fluoridation stance, more distrusting of public health officials, and more supportive of decisions to introduce fluoridation being made by the people via a referendum. After controlling for potentially confounding variables, Queenslanders demonstrated significantly more support for water fluoridation than non-Queenslanders.
CONCLUSIONS: Perceived Queensland characteristics, which political scientists have used to explain aberrant political behavior or public policy, were not relevant to the longstanding pre-2009 disparity in water fluoridation coverage between Queensland and the rest of Australia. The findings of this investigation do not support the assumption that Queenslanders are more opposed to fluoridation than residents elsewhere in Australia."
25427859,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25427859/,"BACKGROUND: The relationship between research funding across therapeutic areas and the burden of disease in Norway has not been investigated. Further, few studies have looked at the association between national research investments and the global disease burden. The aim of the present study was to analyze the correlation between a significant part of Norwegian investment in health research and the burden of disease across therapeutic areas, using both Norwegian and global burden of disease estimates.
METHODS: We used research investment records for 2012 from the Research Council of Norway, and the investment records distributed through liaison committees between regional health authorities and universities. Both were classified by the Health Research Classification System (HRCS). Furthermore, we used the years of life lost and Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) for Norway and globally from the Global Burden of Disease 2010 project. We created a matrix to match the expenditures by HRCS with the values from the Global Burden of Disease project.
RESULTS: Disease-specific research funding increased with the Norwegian burden of disease measured as years of life lost (correlation coefficient = 0.73). Similar findings were done when the Norwegian disease burden was measured as DALYs (correlation coefficient = 0.62). The correlation between research funding and the global disease burden was low both when years of life lost (correlation coefficient = 0.11) and DALYs (correlation coefficient = 0.12) were used. Generally, when the disease burden was relatively high in Norway compared with the rest of the world, research investments were also high.
CONCLUSIONS: Across therapeutic areas, the Norwegian research investments appeared aligned with the Norwegian disease burden. The correlation between the Norwegian research investments and the global disease burden was much lower."
25427948,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25427948/,"BACKGROUND: Thyroid Metastases (TM) represent a rare entity with an estimated variability ranging between 0 and 24%. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) might be useful in discriminating between primary and TM nodules especially when ancillary techniques (i.e., immunocytochemistry-ICC) are carried out.
METHODS: We herein appraised a series of 20 TM on FNAC analyzed between 2000 and 2013. We included eight male and 12 female patients. The cytological cases were processed with both liquid based (LBC) and conventional cytology.
RESULTS: We reported 2.2% TM out of 910 malignancies. Our TM cases resulted as: six lung (LG), five gastro-intestinal (GI), five breast (B), three larynx (LX), and one clear cell renal carcinoma (CCRC) metastases. All the patients had a previous known cancer history. Although the cytological features were likely to suspect a TM, the application of ICC panels was contributive in 100% cases. None of TMs resulted as a unique localization whereby two cases underwent total thyroidectomy (including one B and one CCRC) and 18 TM were treated with radio-chemotherapy approaches.
CONCLUSIONS: FNAC empowered the diagnostic workup of patients with TM avoiding useless surgical approach. The low sensitivity of cytology might be reinforced by the application of ancillary techniques. In contrast with the reported predominant rate of kidney metastatic carcinomas, our findings underlined that intestinal cancer as well as lung and breast are the most common TM. TM are frequently multifocal and in a contest of a systemic disease so that a tailored therapy seems to be the best treatment."
25428114,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25428114/,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Little is known about the association of binge drinking with impulsivity related to trait- or state-like aspects of behavior. The aim of the present study was therefore to investigate whether binge drinkers show an impairment of inhibitory control in comparison to non-binge drinkers when confronted with alcohol-associated or control stimuli, and whether this is reflected in self-reported impulsivity.
METHODS: A go/no-go task with pictures of alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages as well as control stimuli was administered to binge drinkers and a gender-matched group of non-binge drinkers. All participants also completed the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11).
RESULTS: We found an alcohol-specific impairment of response inhibition for binge drinkers only, while the groups did not differ with regard to overall response inhibition to the experimental stimuli or self-reported impulsiveness (BIS-11). In addition, the number of commission errors in response to alcohol-associated stimuli was the only significant predictor of binge drinking.
CONCLUSION: The findings of the present study suggest that when young adults have established binge drinking as a common drinking pattern, impairment of inhibition in response to alcoholic stimuli is the only significant predictor of binge drinking, but not general impulsive behavior."
25428625,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25428625/,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the occurrence of chromosomal abnormalities, through micronuclei, and apoptosis by the sum of karyorrhexis, pyknosis and condensed chromatin in individuals with chronic periodontitis, gingivitis associated with biofilm and no periodontal disease.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 72 individuals divided into three groups: gingivitis (n = 21), periodontitis (n = 24) and control (n = 27). Information on sociodemographic characteristics, health and lifestyle was obtained. Full mouth clinical examination was performed to define the periodontal condition. Exfoliated cells from gingival mucosa were collected for computation of micronuclei and nuclear changes indicative of apoptosis. The differences in the occurrence of endpoints (micronucleus, karyorrhexis, pyknosis and condensed chromatin) were evaluated using the conditional test to compare proportions in a rare events situation.
RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in the occurrence of micronucleus (p > 0.1) between gingivitis, periodontitis and control groups. The occurrence of apoptosis was significantly higher among individuals with periodontitis compared to individuals with gingivitis (p < 0.05) and controls (p < 0.025).
CONCLUSIONS: The findings showed that the inflammatory process generated by gingivitis and periodontitis is not related to a higher occurrence of chromosomal damage. However, the higher occurrence of apoptosis in individuals with periodontitis points to genotoxic effects induced by periodontal infection."
25428723,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25428723/,"PURPOSE: Women tend to have smaller lungs than men of the same size as well as narrower airways compared to men when matched for the same lung size. Additionally, women with smaller airways relative to lung size are more likely to experience expiratory flow limitation (EFL) as well as exercise-induced arterial hypoxemia (EIAH). One of the possible causes of EIAH includes excessive widening in the alveolar-to-arterial oxygen pressure difference (A-aDO2) due to diffusion limitation. This study investigated if lung diffusing capacity (D LCO) is lower in women with EFL compared to non-flow limited (NEFL) women during exercise.
METHODS: D LCO was measured using the rebreathing technique at rest and at 40, 60, and 80 % of [Formula: see text] on a treadmill in healthy women with EFL (n = 7; 21.6 ± 2.3) and without EFL (NEFL, n = 9; 21.2 ± 2.3). Arterial oxygen saturation was measured using pulse oximetry (SpO2).
RESULTS: There was no difference (p > 0.05) in D LCO between groups at rest or during exercise; however, SpO2 was significantly lower in the EFL females compared to NEFL females during exercise.
CONCLUSION: Due to the lack of differences in D LCO between women with EFL and without EFL, our results suggest that this is not a possible cause for the significant differences in SpO2 between the two groups."
25428752,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25428752/,"OBJECTIVE: This study investigated urodynamic findings in prostate cancer patients with self-reported persistent severe postprostatectomy urinary incontinence (PPI) as well as the outcome of incontinence surgery. The main aim was to evaluate the ability of preoperative urodynamic dysfunctions to predict the outcome of incontinence surgery. The hypothesis was that preoperative bladder dysfunction was predictive of an unsuccessful surgical outcome.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Based on patient-reported adverse effects after radical prostatectomy (RP) in 2005-2009, 94 men with persistent severe PPI were invited in 2011 to a clinical examination including urodynamics. When indicated, surgery for PPI was offered, and by January 2014, 46 patients had been operated on with either an artificial urinary sphincter or a sling. The outcome of PPI surgery was evaluated with a follow-up questionnaire. Successful outcome was defined in two ways: patient-reported satisfaction and using one or fewer pads/day.
RESULTS: Of the 94 men with severe PPI more than 12 months after RP, 76 patients (81% response rate) met for clinical examination. Among them, 99% had intrinsic sphincter deficiency, in 67% coexisting with urodynamic bladder dysfunction. The presence of preoperative bladder dysfunction was not predictive of the outcome of PPI surgery. Preoperative use of fewer pads, less severe PPI, and a longer interval between RP and PPI surgery were associated with the successful outcome of one or fewer pads/day. Longer duration from RP to PPI surgery was the only preoperative factor associated with the successful outcome of satisfaction.
CONCLUSIONS: The hypothesis was not supported as the presence of preoperative urodynamic bladder dysfunction was not predictive of the outcome of PPI surgery in this study."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The inclusion criteria for the PRIAS study are as follows: clinical stage T1c/T2, PSA ≤ 10 ng/ml, PSA density (PSAD) < 0.2 ng/ml per milliliter, one or two positive biopsy cores, and Gleason score (GS) ≤ 6 at initial diagnostic biopsy. Baseline clinical characteristics and prostate-specific antigen doubling time (PSADT) at the time of re-Bx were analyzed via multivariate logistic regression with respect to reclassification and 'no cancer' status on the 1-year re-Bx.
RESULTS: A total of 386 patients were enrolled in PRIAS-JAPAN by the end of 2013. Of these, 216 underwent re-Bx at 1 year. A total of 73 patients (33.8 %) were reclassified, whereas 74 (34.3 %) had no cancer. Older age, a higher PSAD, a higher positive core rate, and a shorter PSADT were significant predictors of reclassification. The positive core rate was the predictor common to reclassification, no cancer, and high GS, upon re-Bx.
CONCLUSIONS: An interim analysis of a Japanese AS cohort participating in PRIAS revealed that the positive core rate was strongly associated with reclassification at the 1-year re-Bx. However, although amendment of the PRIAS inclusion criteria to incorporate a positive core might reduce any concern about underestimation, this would also reduce the number of patients undergoing AS."
25428840,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25428840/,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the heredity factor of the chronic venous disorders and odds ratio linked to maternal or paternal heredity.
METHODS: Cross-sectional epidemiological study conducted in daily practice of medical practitioners on all patients consulting them. The practitioners described the venous status of all patients consulting them and recorded the familial past history of venous disease.
RESULTS: Among 21319 patients, 60.4% have a familial history of chronic venous disorder: unilateral paternal 7.5%, unilateral maternal 40.9% and bilateral: 12.0%. Chronic venous disorder prevalence is 58.8% in the global population, 38.2% in the absence of parental history, 67.0% for unilateral paternal, 71.3% for unilateral maternal and 79.2% for bilateral (p < 0.0001). After adjustment on age and sex, results show significant (p < 0.0001) odds ratio of 3.2 for unilateral paternal, of 3.4 for unilateral maternal and of 5.6 for a history in both parents. In the context of a history in both parents, the odds ratio increased to 5.6 for women and 8.4 for men.
CONCLUSION: This large cross-sectional study confirms the association between heredity and venous disease, but its results could call into question the maternal predominant character of the chronic venous disorder heredity."
25428957,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25428957/,"BACKGROUND: The incidence of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries is 2 to 9 times higher in women than in men. In addition, in vitro studies have demonstrated that ACL is an estrogen target tissue, and some studies have therefore suggested a protective association between oral contraceptives (OC) and the likelihood of sustaining ACL injury.
HYPOTHESIS: There is a protective association between OC use and the likelihood of operatively treated ACL injury.
STUDY DESIGN: Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3.
METHODS: The study population included 4497 women with an operatively treated ACL injury registered in the Danish Knee Ligament Reconstruction Registry for the 2005 to 2011 period and 8858 age-matched controls with no ACL injury. The study evaluated exposure to OC use at the time of ACL injury (index date) and in the 5 previous years (""ever user"") or no OC use (""never user""). Ever users were further classified as either new users (patients who redeemed their first prescription within the first year before the index date), long-term users (redeemed additional prescriptions 1 to 5 years before the index date), or recent users (redeemed their most recent prescription >1 year before the index date). Finally, a dose-response analysis of OC use was performed. Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate the relative risk (RR) with a 95% CI of sustaining an operatively treated ACL injury according to OC use.
RESULTS: The adjusted RR associating OC with ACL injury was 0.82 (95% CI, 0.75-0.90) between ever users and never users. Furthermore, there was a decreased RR of sustaining ACL injury of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.74-0.91) in long-term users and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.72-0.89) in recent users. Using OC for more than 4 years did not seem to alter the likelihood of sustaining an operatively treated ACL injury.
CONCLUSION: This population-based pharmacoepidemiological study including 13,355 women indicates that a protective association exists between OC use and the likelihood of sustaining an operatively treated ACL injury. Although this study does indicate a protective association of OC use, OC should not be used as a prophylactic measure before additional clinical studies have further clarified the biological and causal association between OC use and the likelihood of sustaining operatively treated ACL injury."
25429385,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25429385/,"OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors, particularly modifiable, associated with brachial plexus injury.
STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective case-control study conducted at a single hospital between the years 1993 and 2012. All neonates who were diagnosed of brachial plexus injury were included. A control group matched at a ratio of 1:2 was randomly selected. Demographic and obstetric data were obtained from the hospital discharge register with ICD-9 codes and crosschecked with the labor medical records. All medical files were manually checked and validated. A stepwise logistic regression model was performed to identify independent predictors for brachial plexus injury before delivery among those found significant in the univariate analysis.
RESULTS: Of all 83 806 deliveries that took place during this period, 144 cases of brachial plexus injury were identified (1.7/1000 deliveries). Overall, 142 cases and 286 controls had available data. Among the study group, 41 (28.9%) had documented shoulder dystocia compared with 1 (0.4%) among the controls (P<0.0001). Logistic regression analysis revealed that maternal age above 35 years (P=0.01; odds ratio (OR) 2.7; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3 to 5.7), estimated fetal weight before delivery (P<0.0001; OR 2.5; 95% CI 1.7 to 3.8, for each 500 g increase), vaginal birth after cesarean (P=0.02; OR 3.3; 95% CI 1.2 to 8.8) and vacuum extraction (P=0.02; OR 3.6; 95% CI 1.2 to 10.3) were all found to be independent predictors for developing brachial plexus injury. When stratifying the analysis according to parity, vacuum delivery was found to be an independent risk factor only among primiparous women (OR 6.0; 95% CI 1.7 to 21.6).
CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that very few factors contributing to brachial plexus injury are modifiable. For that reason, it remains an unpredictable and probably an unavoidable event."
25429418,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25429418/,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study was to evaluate whether strong background parenchymal enhancement (BPE) would be a significant independent factor associated with positive resection margin in patients treated initially with breast-conserving surgery (BCS).
METHODS: Retrospective evaluation of breast MRI examinations of 314 patients with breast cancer was carried out. Breast cancer was histologically confirmed in all patients who underwent BCS from January 2008 to December 2010. BPE was dichotomized into weak (minimal or mild) and strong (moderate or marked) enhancement for statistical analysis. Histopathological features of attained specimens were evaluated by an experienced pathologist and were also dichotomized for statistical analysis.
RESULTS: On univariate analysis, positive extensive intraductal component (p < 0.001), strong BPE (p = 0.001) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positivity (p = 0.08) had significant association with positive surgical margin. Tumour size, axillary lymph node metastasis, nuclear grade, histological grade, lymphovascular invasion, oestrogen receptor and progesterone receptor did not show significant correlation with positive surgical margin. On multivariate analysis, the significant independent predictors were extensive intraductal component [odds ratio, 5.68; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.72-11.82] and strong BPE (odds ratio, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.20-4.78).
CONCLUSION: Strong BPE is a significant independent factor for positive resection margin along with positive extensive intraductal component, and performing MRI during the period of lower parenchymal enhancement is needed in patients with strong BPE.
ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: As far as we know, this is the first study to reveal that BPE is a significant independent factor associated with positive resection margin."
25430401,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25430401/,"OBJECTIVE: This study is important for the determination of branches and segments of the first atherosclerotic coronary artery. The objective was to examine the role of epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) volume in estimating the presence and localization of plaque of coronary arteries.
METHODS: Our study is a retrospective study, consisting of 50 male (mean age: 45.5 ± 12 yrs) and 58 female (mean age: 52.5 ± 11.6 yrs). A total of 108 consecutive patients underwent coronary computerized tomography (CT) angiography. Each coronary artery segment was assessed for the presence of atherosclerotic plaque. According to the plaque-involved vessel, patients were grouped as without plaque; plaque-involved left anterior descending artery (LAD), right coronary artery (RCA), or circumflex artery (Cx); and mixed (two or more vessels).
RESULTS: The differences in mean values between the two groups were compared using the independent samples t test. Mann-Whitney U test was used for the comparison of continuous variables among groups. While EAT volume was found to be higher in the group with plaque, the difference between the two groups was statistically significant (88.6 ± 9.2 cm(3), 67.4 ± 7.2 cm(3), respectively, p=0.001). EAT volume was 67.3 ± 7.1 cm(3) in the without plaque group, 97.7 ± 22.8 cm(3) in LAD, 79.7 ± 10.1 cm(3) in RCA, 70.7 ± 8.9 cm(3) in Cx, and 101.9 ± 18.6 cm(3) in mixed vessels. In the intragroup comparison, the EAT volume of plaque-involved LAD and mixed vessels was significantly higher than in the other groups. The EAT volume of plaque-involved RCA was significantly higher (p=0.015) than in plaque-involved Cx.
CONCLUSION: Increased EAT volume is directly proportional to the presence of coronary artery plaques, especially in LAD and with more than one artery."

METHODS: Two hundred fifty-eight consecutive patients were enrolled for this observational study in a tertiary care heart center of Pakistan who had a Wilkins score of ≤ 8. Patients with more than mild mitral regurgitation (MR) or having a clot in the left atrium were excluded. The Bonhoeffer multi-track system was used as a default technique. Successful PTMC was defined as achieving a mitral valve area (MVA) of ≥ 1.5 cm(2) with no more than mild MR.
RESULTS: Out of 258 PTMC procedures, 197 were successful. The Bonhoeffer multi-track system was used in ~94% cases. Among unsuccessful procedures, 41 patients did not achieve the required valve area, and 21 patients developed more than mild MR, including those 8 patients who did not achieve the required valve area and had more than mild MR. Bigger mean annulus size (33.5 ± 2.6 versus 32.8 ± 2.1 mm; p=0.02) and preprocedure MVA (0.93 ± 0.1 versus 0.87 ± 0.1 cm(2); p=0.002) had a significant effect on successful PTMC. Lower mean preprocedure systolic right ventricular pressure on echo (65.4 ± 19.4 versus 75.3 ± 18 mm Hg; p=0.000) and on cath (74 ± 21.5 versus 81.5 ± 24.6 mm Hg; p=0.002), lower grade of left ventricular dysfunction (p=0.04), and tricuspid regurgitation on echo (p=0.003) also had positive effects on the outcome.
CONCLUSION: Bigger preprocedure mitral valve annulus size and mitral valve area, and better left and right ventricular hemodynamics are correlated with successful PTMC."
25430405,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25430405/,"OBJECTIVE: The prognostic value of a high platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) has been reported in patients with non-ST elevated myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and different oncologic disorders. We aimed to evaluate the predictive value of the PLR for left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) in patients with non-ST elevated acute coronary syndrome (NST-ACS).
METHODS: A total of 220 patients with NST-ACS were included in the study. The study population was divided into tertiles based on admission PLR values. High (n=73) and low PLR (n=147) groups were defined as patients having values in the third tertile (>135.6) and lower 2 tertiles (≤ 135.6), respectively. Left ventricular dysfunction was defined as ejection fraction ≤ 40%, and related variables were evaluated by backward conditional binary logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: The patients in the high PLR group were older (p<0.001) and had a higher rate of previous myocardial infarction and NSTEMI (p=0.046, p=0.013, respectively). There were significantly more coronary arteries narrowed (p=0.001) and lower left ventricular ejection fraction (p<0.001) in the high PLR group. Baseline platelet levels were significantly higher (p<0.001) and triglyceride and lymphocyte levels were significantly lower (p=0.009 and p<0.001, respectively) in the high PLR group. PLR >135.6 was found to be an independent predictor of systolic dysfunction in the multivariate analyses (β: 0.306, 95% confidence interval: 0.151-0.619; p=0.001).
CONCLUSION: A high PLR is a strong and independent predictor for LVSD in patients with NST-ACS."
25430597,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25430597/,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this work was to investigate whether adapting gantry and collimator angles can compensate for roll and pitch setup errors during volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) delivery.
METHODS: Previously delivered clinical plans for locally advanced head-and-neck (H&N) cancer (n = 5), localized prostate cancer (n = 2), and whole brain with simultaneous integrated boost to 5 metastases (WB + 5M, n = 1) were used for this study. Known rigid rotations were introduced in the planning CT scans. To compensate for these, in-house software was used to adapt gantry and collimator angles in the plan. Doses to planning target volumes (PTV) and critical organs at risk (OAR) were calculated with and without compensation and compared with the original clinical plan. Measurements in the sagittal plane in a polystyrene phantom using radiochromic film were compared by gamma (γ) evaluation for 2 H&N cancer patients.
RESULTS: For H&N plans, the introduction of 2°-roll and 3°-pitch rotations reduced mean PTV coverage from 98.7 to 96.3%. This improved to 98.1% with gantry and collimator compensation. For prostate plans respective figures were 98.4, 97.5, and 98.4%. For WB + 5M, compensation worked less well, especially for smaller volumes and volumes farther from the isocenter. Mean comparative γ evaluation (3%, 1 mm) between original and pitched plans resulted in 86% γ < 1. The corrected plan restored the mean comparison to 96% γ < 1.
CONCLUSION: Preliminary data suggest that adapting gantry and collimator angles is a promising way to correct roll and pitch set-up errors of < 3° during VMAT for H&N and prostate cancer."

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis.
SETTING: University fertility center.
PATIENTS: 426 CC-IUI cycles from 292 patients with unexplained infertility.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients were treated with micronized intravaginal progesterone 100 mg twice daily beginning approximately three days after CC-IUI.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Clinical pregnancy per initiated cycle as defined by presence of fetal heart rate on ultrasound.
RESULTS: Clinical pregnancy rate was higher in patients receiving luteal phase support compared to patients not receiving luteal phase support (odds ratio: 2.04; 95% confidence interval: 1.01-4.14) after adjusting for all factors in the analysis using a multivariate logistic regression model. Age at the start of the cycle, BMI and CC dose were not shown to have an effect on clinical pregnancy rates. Patients with endometrial lining (EML) thickness 6-8 mm and >8 mm had increased clinical pregnancy rates compared to EML <6 mm independent of luteal phase progesterone use. Patients who appear to receive the greatest benefit of progesterone supplementation are in the 6-8 mm EML cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: Luteal phase progesterone supplementation in CC-IUI cycles can improve endometrial receptivity as judged by the improved clinical pregnancy rates as the primary outcome."
25430738,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25430738/,"BACKGROUND: The cigarette excise taxes and the price of a typical pack of cigarettes in Korea have not increased since 2005, and effective tax rate as a fraction of price and real price of cigarettes have both been falling. As smoking prevalence is higher among lower income people than among higher income people in Korea, the regressivity of cigarette excise taxes is often cited as a barrier to tobacco tax and price policy. While studies in several other high-income countries have shown that higher income individuals are less price sensitive, few studies have examined the differential impact of cigarette tax increases by income group in Korea. Most of the Korean literature has estimated the demand for cigarettes using time-series aggregate sales data or household level survey data, which record household cigarette expenditures rather than individual cigarette consumption. Studies using survey data often lack time-series variation and estimate cigarette demand using household expenditure data, while studies using time-series aggregate sales data lack cross-sectional variation.
OBJECTIVE: I examine differences in the effects of cigarette price on the cigarette consumption of various income groups using individual-level cigarette consumption records from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KHNNES). I also analyse the implications of cigarette taxes and price increases on the relative tax burdens of different income groups.
DESIGN: I use pooled data from the KNHNES for the 1998-2011 period to estimate the price elasticity of cigarette consumption of four income groups. Treating cigarette consumption as a latent variable, I employ an econometric procedure that corrects for non-random sample selection, or the fact that some non-smokers might have smoked at a low enough price, and estimate the price elasticity of cigarette consumption by income group. The estimated price elasticities include the responsiveness of potential smokers as well as current smokers.
RESULTS: Lower income Korean smokers are more responsive to changes in the price of cigarettes. While the overall price elasticity of cigarettes is estimated to be -0.425, the price elasticity of the lowest income quartile is estimated to be -0.812, whereas that of the highest income quartile is estimated to be -0.325.
CONCLUSIONS: The estimated price elasticities of different income groups imply that the cigarette tax and price increases in Korea would reduce smoking more in those with lower incomes. For a given price increase, the percentage reduction in cigarette consumption among smokers in the lowest income quartile is 2.5 times greater than among smokers in the top income quartile. The simulated tax burdens of different income groups show that the additional burden of a tax increase and the associated price rise is largely borne by higher income smokers."
25430820,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25430820/,"OBJECTIVE: To examine whether bipolar disorder patients who stop cannabis use during a manic/mixed episode have better clinical and functional outcomes than continued use or never use.
METHOD: Data from the European Mania in Bipolar Longitudinal Evaluation of Medication (EMBLEM), a 2-year prospective observational study in adults with a manic/mixed episode of bipolar disorder, was used. Three cannabis use groups were: current use (between 12-week and 24-month visits); no current but previous use (during first 12 weeks); and never use. Associations between cannabis use and outcomes were analyzed using regression models.
RESULTS: Of 1922 patients analyzed, 6.9% were current users, 4.6% previous users, and 88.5% never users. Clinical outcomes differed between groups (P<0.019): previous users had highest rates of remission (68.1%) and recovery (38.7%), and lowest rates of recurrence (42.1%) and relapse (29.8%). Logistic regression showed previous users had similar outcomes to never users (all P>0.05), whereas current users had lower recovery (P=0.004) and remission (P=0.014), higher recurrence (P=0.014), greater work impairment (P=0.016), and were more likely not to be living with partner (P=0.006) than never users.
CONCLUSION: Bipolar patients who stop using cannabis during manic/mixed episode have similar clinical and functional outcomes to never users, while continued use is associated with higher risk of recurrence and poorer functioning."

METHODS: The Victorian Emergency Registrar Study was published at the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine (ACEM) annual scientific meeting in Adelaide in November 2013. As a follow on, ACEM provided the authors with data regarding country of primary degree for international medical graduates (IMG) working as registrars in Australasian EDs.
RESULTS: UK and Irish EM registrars make up the largest proportion of IMGs working in Australian and New Zealand EDs. These figures have increased from 34% in 2008 to 45% in 2013. In 2013, there was the highest yearly intake of UK and Irish ED IMG registrars, representing 41% of registrars joining the Australasian EM training programme. Current data show that >25% of all ED registrars working in Australasian EDs studied for their primary medical degree in a university either in Ireland or the UK.
CONCLUSIONS: While there have been anecdotal reports of increased outflow of junior EM doctors from the UK and Ireland, we provide quantitative data on the extent of the recent (5-year trend data) emigration of UK/Irish EM trainees to Australia and New Zealand and discuss the impact of this on both the UK/Irish and Australasian health systems."

RESULTS: The IPD-related symptoms improved significantly in both groups with respect to the UPDRS III score (conventional 69.6% vs. 72.4% Starfix®). After surgery significant reductions of L-dopa and LED were seen in both groups. Inherent advantages of the Starfix® platform included simultaneous positioning of the stimulating electrodes and a significant reduction in surgical time.
CONCLUSION: In summary, both stereotactic procedures are reliable and safe procedures for the placement of stimulating electrodes as well as the stimulation effect achieved. The logistical uncoupling of presurgical planning from surgical therapy emphasizes the benefits of the individualized stereotactic procedure."
25431139,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25431139/,"OBJECTIVES: To assess an association of Socio-economic status with utilization of health care services between years 2002 and 2008 in Israel.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the utilization of health care services in a cohort of 100,000 members, 21 years and older, of a Clalit Health Services. The research compared utilization according to the neighborhood SES status; and clinic's location as another SES proxy. Data included: Charlson Score morbidity factor, utilization of health care services (visits to primary physicians and specialists, purchase of pharmaceuticals, number of hospitalization days, visits to ED, utilization of laboratory tests and imaging). The analysis was performed using Generalized Linear Model (GLM) technique.
RESULTS: People with lower SES visited more the ED and primary physicians and were hospitalized for longer periods. People with higher SES visited more specialists, bought more prescription drugs and used more medical imaging. The associations between SES and most of the services we analyzed did not change between 2002 and 2008. However, the gap between lower and higher SES levels in ED visits and the use of prescription drugs slightly increased over time, while the gap in visits to specialists decreased.
CONCLUSIONS: The research shows that even in a universal health care system SES is associated with utilization of health care services. In order to improve equity in utilization of services the Israeli public health should reduce economic barriers and in parallel invest in making information accessible to improve ""navigation skills"" for all."
25431459,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25431459/,"AIM: The aim of this study was to analyse the relationship between early unemployment (ages 16-21 years) and adult hypertension after controlling for earlier hypertension, unemployment in adult life, risk factors for hypertension and confounders.
METHODS: A cohort of 927 (86.6% of the original cohort) 9th grade school-leavers was followed from 1981 until 2008. Data were collected through questionnaires, health examinations, and national registers. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used as primary statistical methods.
RESULTS: At ages 21 and 43, hypertension was significantly more prevalent among men than women (p < .001). Unemployment between the ages of 16 and 21 was related to hypertension at age 43 among women but not men. The odds ratio (OR) was persistently high (OR 3.16 [95% confidence interval 1.45-6.89]) after controlling for late unemployment, hypertension at age 16, risk factors for hypertension and confounders. There was no significant relationship between exposure to early unemployment and hypertension at age 21 for women or men.
CONCLUSIONS: From a public health perspective, youth unemployment is a societal problem in need of more attention and intervention in order to prevent long-term adverse health outcomes."
25432449,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25432449/,"PURPOSE: Lasers have been extensively used in dentistry for several applications. We investigated and compared the use of an erbium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser and conventional rotary instruments for bone removal in third molar surgery.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We implemented a randomized, split-mouth clinical trial. Patients with bilateral and symmetrical third molar impaction referred to the Department of Oral and Maxillo-Facial Sciences, ""Sapienza"" University of Rome, were enrolled in the study. Each patient was treated once with the erbium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser and once with conventional rotary instruments for bone removal during third molar surgery. Pain, swelling, and trismus were taken into account to match the 2 techniques.In addition, the times required to complete osteotomy and for the full operation were recorded. Descriptive and bivariate statistics were computed, and the P value was set at .05.
RESULTS: The sample was composed of 15 patients (8 men and 7 women) ranging in age from 18 to 30 years. Pain perceived in the laser-treated group was significantly less than that in the conventional group(P = .0013). This also was true for trismus (P = .0002) and swelling. The operating time for osteotomy was longer in the laser group.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that the laser could be an interesting alternative to conventional rotary instruments. Future studies with a larger number of patients are required to confirm the conclusions achieved from this work."
25432540,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25432540/,"PURPOSE: Modern radiation oncology treatments are typically associated with a certain level of acute or long-term complications. Whenever a new treatment is introduced into clinical practice, a clinician may have reason to question whether certain side effects occur more frequently in his or her patients than reported in the published literature. However, the clinician, lacking rigorous statistical methods to answer this question, may not draw the correct conclusion until treating a larger number of patients than necessary.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: We propose a Bayesian framework to calculate (1) the probability that the rate of an adverse event (AE) is above a certain threshold and (2) the number of AEs to be observed before we can conclude with a certain confidence level that the AE rate is above a threshold. Both questions will be answered based on the formulation of a posterior distribution of the AE rate given the observed data. The proposed method does not rely on large sample assumptions, and the computation of the solution is quick and straightforward. The proposed methods are illustrated in 2 clinical scenarios.
RESULTS: We tabulated the probability that an AE rate is greater than a threshold for a given number of patients experiencing events from an observed number of patients. In addition, we developed a free online interactive tool to facilitate the implementation of the method.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method, including the presented tables and the online tool, provides clinicians with a practical means of determining if his or her patients are experiencing a greater (or lower) number of complications than expected. How to use the statistical result to guide a clinical decision depends upon the specifics of the clinical condition and the available treatment alternatives."
25432823,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25432823/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine if utilization of surveillance or adjuvant chemotherapy has increased compared with that of adjuvant radiotherapy (ART) in clinical stage I seminoma (CSIS) and to estimate the impact of this utilization trend on secondary malignancies.
METHODS: The National Cancer Data Base, a web-based data analysis tool was examined for first-course adjuvant therapy management in CSIS from 2000 to 2008. We assessed the utilization in academic vs community practice settings and changes in tumor stage. We also estimated the number of secondary malignancies based on the change in practice.
RESULTS: There were 52,672 patients of testicular cancer diagnosed. Of those, 28,974 (55.0%) patients had seminoma with 22,210 (84.2%) patients classified as CSIS. Overall, 14,005 (65.4%), 6430 (30.1%), and 951 (4.4%) patients received ART, surveillance, and adjuvant chemotherapy (AC), respectively. In 2000, most patients received ART (71.7%), followed by surveillance (26.5%), and AC (1.9%). In 2008, the majority of patients still received ART (47.7%) but surveillance (39.6%) and AC (12.6%) totaled a larger proportion. We calculated that this ART utilization rate would lead to an additional 372 solid tumor cases per year, 40 years later, whereas the current surveillance rate would lead to 34 cases of secondary malignancy annually in the United States.
CONCLUSION: ART was the leading adjuvant management strategy for CSIS, but its share drastically decreased with a concomitant increase in surveillance and AC, particularly after 2004. These trends were similar in both academic and community settings. The current level of ART, although decreasing, may nevertheless lead to additional cases of solid cancer comparable with testicular cancer deaths."
25432837,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25432837/,"OBJECTIVE: To perform an anatomic study of the dorsal vascular complex (DVC) and the underlying striated sphincter (SS) to investigate if the SS might be harmed by standard suture ligation in radical prostatectomy.
METHODS: Transverse wholemount serial sections were created from adult male autopsy cadavers. The total surface area of the DVC and the SS were measured at the prostatic apex and 5 mm distal to it using the ImageJ software. The dorsal boundary of the DVC and the ventral border of the SS were defined digitally. The percentage of the surface area of the SS that would be entrapped by a ligation stitch including the entire DVC was then calculated. In addition, 3-dimensional reconstruction of the lower urinary tract was performed using the SURFdriver software.
RESULTS: Five adult male cadavers were investigated. The mean surface area of the SS was 116.1 ± 80.7 and 78.0 ± 63.3 mm(2) at the apex and 5 mm distal to it, respectively. On average, 36.7% (42.6 ± 41.4 mm(2)) and 29.9% (23.3 ± 13.6 mm(2)) of the surface area of the SS were located ventral to the lower boundary of the DVC at the apex and 5 mm distal to it, respectively, and would thus be entrapped by standard suture ligation.
CONCLUSION: Our anatomic findings suggest that standard suture ligation of the DVC is associated with the risk of affecting sphincter tissue. Our study is in accordance with recent clinical studies showing improved early postoperative continence rates by primary transection of the DVC followed by selective suture ligation."

Patients transferred to palliative care unit (PCU) after discontinuation of chemotherapy were assigned to standard care (SC) group. We evaluated quality of palliative care using Support Team Assessment Schedule, quality of life (QOL) using Good Death Inventory, and short-term mortality in PCU.
RESULTS: A total of 28 and 63 patients patients were assigned to PC and SC groups, respectively. Physical symptoms, anxiety, communication scores, and QOL scores were significantly higher in the PC group (P < .001).

25433140,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25433140/,"BACKGROUND: Urine culture is the most frequently requested test for a Microbiology Lab. A reliable screening tool would be of paramount importance both to clinicians and laboratorians, provided that it could get fast and accurate negative results in order to rule-out urinary tract infection (UTI).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated 1907 consecutive urine samples from outpatients. Culture was performed on chromogenic agar with 1μL loop, using 10(5)CFU/mL as a limit of positive growth. Using Sysmex Uf-1000i analyzer we evaluated bacteria forward scatter (B_FSC) and fluorescent light scatter (B_FLH) in a preliminary discrimination step for UTI caused by Gram+ or Gram- bacteria.
RESULTS: We got 512 positive samples. A mono-microbial infection was observed in 490 samples; two bacterial strains were isolated in 22 samples, so 534 bacterial strains were found: 392 Gram-, 133 Gram+ and 9 yeasts. Comparing Gram+ and Gram- bacteria we observed a statistically significant difference for B_FSC but not for B_FLH. In this application experimental cut-off value for B_FSC was 25ch. Using this cut-off to perform a presumptive identification of UTI sustained by Gram-+ bacteria, we observed a SE 0.68, SP 0.84.
CONCLUSION: Our data although preliminary suggest that B_FSC could be useful in presumptive exclusion of UTI caused by Gram-positive bacteria."

METHODS: A total of seven infants (five boys and two girls), aged from 5 to 12 months, underwent urgent PNL for calculus anuria from September 2011 to March 2013. The initial blood test revealed acute renal injury in all infants. After correcting electrolyte imbalance and acid-base status through medical treatment in a short time without dialysis, all urgent PNL procedures were performed with 16F percutaneous access and small-diameter nephroscopes designed specifically for pediatric surgery on the side with the more dilated pelvis. Stones were fragmented with a pneumatic lithotripter.
RESULTS: Stones were completely removed from the operative side kidneys. The operating time ranged from 35 to 57 min. Blood BUN, serum creatinine, and electrolyte levels returned to normal on postoperative 36 h. There were no major perioperative or postoperative complications and deaths.
CONCLUSIONS: When performed by experienced endourologists, urgent PNL is a safe and effective procedure in infants for acute kidney injury secondary to bilateral upper urinary stones."
25433668,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25433668/,"OBJECTIVE: Patients may fear the symptoms and consequences associated with hypoglycemia. We tested whether fear of hypoglycemia is independently associated with poorer health-related quality of life (HRQOL).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data were collected using direct-mail survey and enrollment information from adult commercial health plan enrollees with type 2 diabetes during a 12-month period (12/01/2008 to 11/30/2009). HRQOL was evaluated by the EuroQol (EQ)-5D index and 12-item Short Form Health Survey Mental Component Summary (SF-12 MCS) and Physical Component Summary (SF-12 PCS). Fear of hypoglycemia was assessed using the Hypoglycemia Fear Survey (HFS). Two ordinary least-squares (OLS) models of HRQOL controlling for demographics and illness characteristics were specified, and OLS regression coefficients and statistical inferences were compared. Model 1 included 1 variable of hypoglycemia symptoms; Model 2 included both hypoglycemia symptoms and HFS score.
RESULTS: Of 3999 patients contacted, 813 responded to the survey. Model 1: hypoglycemia symptoms alone were associated with worse HRQOL (SF-12 MCS and SF-12 PCS scores and EQ-5D utility score; all P < 0.05). Model 2: hypoglycemia symptoms were significantly associated only with SF-12 MCS score. HFS total score was significantly associated with all 3 HRQOL scores. Hypoglycemia symptoms, Hispanic ethnicity, and longer diabetes duration were associated with greater hypoglycemia fear. Higher income, white race, and treatment without sulfonylurea or insulin were associated with less hypoglycemia fear (all P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: In addition to the effect of symptomatic hypoglycemia on HRQOL, fear of hypoglycemia was independently associated with lower overall health status and mental and physical health."
25433818,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25433818/,"BACKGROUND: High-grade internal rectal prolapse appears to be one of the contributing factors in the multifactorial origin of faecal incontinence. Whether it affects the outcome of sacral neuromodulation is unknown. We compared the functional results of sacral neuromodulation for faecal incontinence in patients with and without a high-grade internal rectal prolapse.
METHOD: One hundred six consecutive patients suffering from faecal incontinence, who were eligible for sacral neuromodulation between 2009 and 2012, were identified from a prospective database. All patients underwent preoperative defaecating proctography, anorectal manometry and ultrasound. Symptoms were assessed preoperatively and at 12 months after operation using a standardized questionnaire incorporating the Faecal Incontinence Severity Index (FISI range = 0-61) and the Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI). Success was defined as a decrease in the FISI score of 50 % or more.
RESULTS: High-grade internal rectal prolapse (HIRP) was found in 36 patients (34%). The patient characteristics were similar in both groups. Temporary test stimulation was successful in 60 patients without HIRP (86%) and in 25 patients with HIRP (69 %) (p = 0.03). A permanent pulse generator was then implanted on these patients. After 1-year follow-up, the median FISI was reduced in patients without HIRP from 37 to 23 (p < 0.01). No significant change in FISI score was observed in patients with a HIRP (FISI, 38 to 34; p = 0.16). Quality of life (GIQLI) was only improved in patients without HIRP. A successful outcome per protocol was achieved in 31 patients without HIRP (52%) versus 4 patients with HIRP (16%) (p < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: The presence of a high-grade internal rectal prolapse has a detrimental effect on sacral neuromodulation for faecal incontinence."
25433829,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25433829/,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate if there are clinical signs which allow detection of malposition of the vertex on admission to the delivery unit, or when crossing the action line on the partogram.
STUDY DESIGN: Case-control study from 2007 to 2010 conducted on the delivery unit of Nordland Hospital, Bodø. Labours with malposition of the vertex (n = 171) were compared with a group with normal vertex presentation (n = 165). The positive predictive value was estimated for each sign using Bayes' rule.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Magnitude of positive predictive value for each clinical sign.
RESULTS: The positive predictive values for malposition were 9% if the foetus were in a right position, 11% if the labour was induced, 5% if the foetus was above the ischial spines, 4% if the reason for admission was contractions and 6% if cervix was <3 cm.
CONCLUSION: The ability of clinical assessment to predict malposition, either on admission or when crossing the action line on the partogram, was poor. Diagnosing malposition of the vertex requires other methods with a higher predictive value."
25433832,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25433832/,"BACKGROUND: Women's negative experiences in the delivery room can have significance for later fear of childbirth. Therefore, it is important to critically evaluate the care during childbirth. The aim was to gain a deeper understanding of women's negative experiences in the delivery room.
METHODS: This study is based on original data from three qualitative studies on Swedish women's experiences of fear of childbirth. Data were collected from interviews with 21 women; 15 pregnant women (6 + 9) with intense fear of childbirth, and six women who had experienced intense fear of childbirth 7-11 years prior to the interview. The analysis had a hermeneutic approach, with focus on the women's descriptions of their previous negative birth experiences.
FINDINGS: The interpretation showed that in the delivery room the women were objects of surveillance, and they endured suffering related to the care during childbirth. This involves experiences of midwives as uncaring, feelings of being suppressed, unprotected and lacking safety, of feeling disconnected and of the body as incompetent in giving birth. The birth environments are understood as power structures, containing views of women's birthing bodies as machines, and delivery rooms as surveillance environments, involving interventions such as foetal heart monitoring, induction and augmentation of labour.
CONCLUSIONS: The delivery room was, for these women, a place creating fear of childbirth. To avoid negative birth experiences and future fear, women must be offered not only medical, but also emotional and existential safety in the delivery room."
25434658,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25434658/,"BACKGROUND: Endoscopic radiofrequency ablation (RFA) appears to be a safe and effective treatment for flat-type noninvasive squamous neoplasia of the esophagus. However, if RFA is applied to lesions containing invasive cancer (esophageal squamous cell carcinoma [ESCC]), histological features associated with lymph node metastases may remain undetected. In addition, extension of neoplasia down the ducts of esophageal submucosal glands (SMGs) may create a sheltered ""niche"" beyond the reach of ablation.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the RFA eligibility of flat-type ESCC.
DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data of ESCC patients.
SETTING: National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.
PATIENTS: Patients with flat-type ESCC larger than 3 cm removed by endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD).
INTERVENTIONS: Three endoscopists involved in RFA studies in China reviewed endoscopic images to select lesions eligible for RFA. Corresponding ESD resection specimens were histologically examined.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: The presence of poor histological features (ie, invasion in m3 or deeper, poor tumor differentiation, or lymphovascular invasion) and the number of involved esophageal SMGs and ducts.
RESULTS: Sixty-five lesions were included, 17 (26%) of which qualified as RFA eligible by RFA endoscopists. Interobserver agreement for this assessment was poor (κ = 0.09). Six of the 17 specimens (35%) showed relevant disease: 4 lesions invaded in the muscularis mucosae, 1 of which also showed lymphovascular invasion; 2 lesions showed extension of neoplasia into SMGs.
LIMITATIONS: Limited number of cases. RFA eligibility status was based on analysis of still images.
CONCLUSIONS: One third of flat-type ESCC, deemed eligible for RFA, demonstrated histological features that are considered (relative) contraindications to endoscopic treatment. Because it appears difficult for endoscopists to identify low-risk ESCC, conservative use of RFA for flat-type ESCC is advocated until long-term follow-up data are available."
25434719,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25434719/,"PURPOSE: Tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) is a noninvasive measure that reflects changes in tissue perfusion. Rapid response teams (RRTs) assess sick inpatients to determine need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission. This determination is subjective based on parameters such as systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and pulse oximetry. Our objective was to determine if parameters readily available at RRT bedside assessment (vital signs and StO2) can predict ICU admission and inhospital mortality.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All inpatients assessed by RRT at a tertiary Canadian hospital were consecutively sampled for 3 months. After clinical assessment, the RRT physician (blinded to StO2) made the ultimate ICU admission decision.
RESULTS: In 134 included patients, mean age was 65.5 ± 15.2 years, and 53% (n = 71) were males. There were 49 ICU admissions (36.6%) and 31 mortalities (23.1%). Two multivariable models significantly predicted ICU admission and inhospital mortality. The only independent predictor of ICU admission was pulse oximetry (adjusted odds ratio, 0.88; 95% confidence interval, 0.80-0.96; P = .007). Tissue oxygen saturation did not predict ICU admission but was the only independent predictor of mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.12; P = .04).
CONCLUSIONS: Tissue oxygen saturation may identify critical illness in patients who would not traditionally meet ICU admission criteria and thus may identify patients who benefit from closer monitoring."
25435298,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25435298/,"BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) is the current ""gold standard"" bariatric procedure in the United States. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) has recently become a commonly performed procedure for many reasons, including patients' perception that LSG has less complexity and invasiveness, and lower risk. Our objective was to review the literature and compare the leak rates, morbidity, and mortality for LRYGB versus LSG.
METHODS: Publications from 2002 to 2012 with n greater than or equal to 25 and postoperative leak rate reported were included. Statistical analysis included chi-square according to patient number.
RESULTS: Twenty-eight (10,906 patients) LRYGB and 33 (4,816 patients) LSG articles were evaluated. Leak rates after LRYGB versus LSG were 1.9% (n = 206) versus 2.3% (n = 110), respectively (P = .077). Mortality rates were .4% (27/7,117) for LRYGB and .2% (7/3,594) for LSG (P = .110). Timing from surgery to leak ranged from 1 to 12 days for LRYGB versus 1 to 35 days for LSG.
CONCLUSIONS: Leak and mortality rates after LRYGB and LSG were comparable. The appropriate procedure should be tailored based on patient factors, comorbidities, patient and surgeon comfort level, surgeon experience, and institutional outcomes."

METHODS: An institutional review board-approved retrospective review of patients undergoing a laparoscopic cholecystectomy while on clopidogrel from 2008 to 2012 was performed. These patients were then matched with a nonclopidogrel cohort based on American Society of Anesthesiologists score and emergent or elective surgery. Intraoperative estimated blood loss, operative time, length of stay, and 30-day morbidity were compared.
RESULTS: Thirty-six clopidogrel and 36 control patient records were analyzed. There were no significant differences in age, body mass index, sex, or incidence of coronary artery disease, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and congestive heart failure. Estimated blood loss averaged 50 mL in the clopidogrel group and 47 mL in the control group (P = nonsignificant). There were no significant differences in operative time, 30-day morbidity, or length of stay between the 2 groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed on patients maintained on clopidogrel during the perioperative period did not produce an increase in blood loss, operative time, 30-day morbidity, or length of stay."
25435333,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25435333/,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: We have previously reported that obsessive-compulsive individuals perform more poorly on tasks that require accurate perception of internal states. As these individuals are also characterized by elevated levels of doubt regarding internal states, the causal relationship between doubt and accurate perception remained unclear. The presented study examines whether undermining participants' confidence in their ability to accurately produce a specific internal state would affect their performance on a task that requires accurate perception of this state.
METHODS: Participants were trained to produce specific levels of forearm muscle tension and then required to produce various tension levels in four experimental phases. The first three alternated in terms of whether the participants viewed a biofeedback monitor while the fourth offered participants several times the choice to view the monitor. Prior to the task, half of the participants received instructions that undermined their confidence in their ability to accurately assess their own muscle tension. We measured participants' accuracy in producing the required muscle tension levels and the number of times they requested to view the monitor in the final phase.
RESULTS: Undermined confidence participants were less accurate in producing the required muscle tension levels in the absence of biofeedback, and were also more likely to request the monitor in the final phase.
CONCLUSIONS: Doubt can affect performance on tasks that require perceiving and experiencing internal states. This finding supports the possibility that access to internal states in OCD is attenuated due to elevated levels of doubt regarding these states."
25435394,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25435394/,"BACKGROUND: Duration of surgery has not been much explored as a possible risk factor for complications in neurosurgery.
OBJECTIVE: To explore the possible impact of duration of surgery on the risk of developing extracranial complications and surgical site infections following intracranial tumor surgery.
METHODS: Retrospective review of 1,000 consecutive patients who underwent planned surgery for intracranial tumors at a single institution. Complications within 30 days of surgery were registered.
RESULTS: Of all patients, 18.6 % acquired extracranial complications, and they were seen in 14.3, 17.7, 22.1 and 37.4 % after operations lasting <2, 2-4, 4-6 and ≥6 h (p = 0.025). In multivariate analyses, duration of surgery per hour [OR 1.14 (1.04-1.25)], ASA 3-4 [OR 1.37 (1.14-1.63)] and acquired neurological deficits [OR 1.47 (1.02-2.11)] were associated with extracranial complications. For surgical site infections, there was a significant association between increased risk and increased duration of surgery (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Duration of surgery together with comorbidity and acquired neurological deficits is an independent risk factor for extracranial complications after brain tumor surgery. Duration of surgery is also associated with surgical site infections. Knowledge about the potential harm of slow surgery should be of interest to neurosurgeons when deciding on various surgical approaches, surgical tools or providing training. Also if acquiring ethical approval or informed consent in technical research projects, the risks associated with prolonging brain surgery should be considered. Special consideration should be warranted in patients with significant comorbidity, planned long surgery and higher risk of acquiring neurological deficits after surgery."

METHODS: We surveyed a large cohort of consultant surgeons in a questionnaire based study in order to assess the indications for patella resurfacing and to correlate practice with degree of specialization, experience and volume of procedures performed.
RESULTS: Six hundred and nineteen surgeons were included. The main indication for patella resurfacing was patellofemoral arthritis. The ratio of those who always:sometimes:never resurfaced was 1:2:1 irrespective of experience or volume performed. There was no difference between knee specialists and non-specialists (p = 0.977) or between high and lower volume surgeons (p = 0.826). Senior and high volume surgeons tended to always resurface.
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of surgeons only sometimes resurfaced the patella. The number who always and never resurfaced were similar. There was a tendency for more experienced and high volume surgeons to always resurface."

Their respiratory characteristics did not differ from predicted values. The WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire, Oswestry Disability Questionnaire, and pain scale (VAS) were applied.
RESULTS: The transformed WHOQOL-BREF scores ranged from 54.6 ± 11.19 in the physical domain in the mild scoliotic subgroup to 77.1 ± 16.05 in the social domain in the able-bodied subgroup. The ODQ values did not generally exceed 5.3 ± 7.53. Inter- and intragroup differences were nonsignificant. Age, marital status, education, and gender were significantly associated with the ODQ scores. Significant association between the ODQ and WHOQOL-BREF social relationships domain scores with the participation in exercise treatment was found.
CONCLUSIONS: Participants with the history of exercise treatment generally did not differ significantly from their peers who were only under observation. This study cannot conclude that scoliosis-specific exercise treatment in adolescence alters quality of life in adulthood."

METHODOLOGY: We reviewed the medical records of 30 patients who underwent endoscopy and diagnosed with GRC between 1999 and 2009. We analyzed the clinical features, tumor characteristics, regular endoscopic surveillance, treatment, and survival outcomes.
RESULTS: The median time interval between first operation and diagnosis of GRC was 36 months. Fifteen patients (50%) had GRC at non-anastomotic sites. Seventeen patients (56.7%) underwent annual endoscopic surveillance and nine patients (30%) had no symptom at the time of diagnosis of GRC. GRC were detected earlier in patients with annual endoscopic surveillance than those without surveillance (p=0.0014). The median overall survival (OS) after the diagnosis of GRC for all patients was 35.9 months. The median OS of patients with curative resection including endoscopic resection for early gastric cancer was longer than those without resectability (46.3 vs. 13.6 months, p=0.0026).
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that annual endoscopic surveillance program after gastric partial resection would be helpful to detect early cancer of remnant stomach for curative resection."
25436357,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25436357/,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: The association between systemic inflammatory response and tumor biology has been well documented over the last decade. The aim of this study is to investigate the prognostic role of neutrophilto- lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs).
METHODOLOGY: A prospectively recorded database of 67 patients who underwent surgical resection for GIST was reviewed. High and low NLR were defined with respect to the sample median, which was 1.92. Demographical, clinicopathological, and surgical characteristics were analyzed as well as disease free survival (DFS) rates according to NLR classification.
RESULTS: We observed better disease free survival rates in patients with low NLR compared to patients with high NLR (85.7% and 69%, respectively; p=0.037). Estimated five-year overall and disease free survival rates were 95.1% and 78.7%, respectively. In univariate analysis synchronous sarcomatosis, tumor size, mitotic rate, presence of necrosis, lymph node metastasis, surgical margin status, risk category and NLR were associated with DFS. On multivariate analysis sarcomatosis (HR: 30.455), surgical margin status (HR: 4.228) and necrosis (HR: 4.415) were found as independent prognostic factors for DFS.
CONCLUSIONS: NLR can give information about inflammatory status, tumor aggressivity and prognosis in GIST patients. It could be a new prognostic factor for GIST patients."
25436480,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25436480/,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether simple bone cysts (SBC) resolve with age.
METHODS: Twenty four subjects with SBC who participated in a prior randomized clinical trial but had not healed at trial conclusion were evaluated for cyst healing. The following clinical and radiographic data were evaluated: age, sex, pain (Visual Analogue Scale), functional health (Short Form 36), subsequent fracture, involved bone, cyst area (cm), distance from physis (cm), endosteal thickening (yes/no), scalloping (no new scalloping/new scalloping), opacity/radiolucency (as is), loculation (yes/no), trabeculation (yes/no), tubulation (yes/no), transition zone (sharp/wide), geographic borders (geographic nonpermeative/nongeographic permeative), radiodense rim (>50%/no rim), and growth plate status (open/closed). Cyst healing was graded as: 1-cyst clearly visible; 2-cyst visible but multilocular and opaque; 3-sclerosis around or within a partially visible cyst; or 4-complete healing with obliteration of cyst. Healing was defined as grade 4.
RESULTS: Of 24 subjects, 15 (63%) were male, 18 (75%) cysts were located in the humerus, and 4 (25%) in the femur. Patients were followed for 7.0±1.0 years following initial treatment with a mean age at follow-up of 17.2±3.2 years and 14 (87%) of growth plates were closed. Pain was minimal (0.6/10), function was high (91/100), and none of the patients had experienced subsequent fractures. Although distance from physeal scar had increased (P<0.0001), cyst area reduction (P<0.1) and overall cyst healing (P<0.2) had not changed. Of the 24 subjects, none were graded as healed at time of follow-up. Of the remaining radiographic variables, only decreased loculation (P<0.02) and increased endosteal thickening (P<0.04) showed significant changes.
CONCLUSION: Despite the assumption that most SBC will resolve with skeletal maturity, this study indicates that none of the cysts were graded as completely healed although 87% of growth plates were closed.
SIGNIFICANCE: Growth plate closure may not signify healing of SBC and although symptoms and fractures are rare, further studies are needed to follow patients with SBC through early adulthood."
25436822,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25436822/,"INTRODUCTION: HIV-related stigma and discrimination and disrespect and abuse during childbirth are barriers to use of essential maternal and HIV health services. Greater understanding of the relationship between HIV status and disrespect and abuse during childbirth is required to design interventions to promote women's rights and to increase uptake of and retention in health services; however, few comparative studies of women living with HIV (WLWH) and HIV-negative women exist.
METHODS: Mixed methods included interviews with postpartum women (n = 2000), direct observation during childbirth (n = 208), structured questionnaires (n = 50), and in-depth interviews (n = 18) with health care providers. Bivariate and multivariate regressions analyzed associations between HIV status and disrespect and abuse, whereas questionnaires and in-depth interviews provided insight into how provider attitudes and workplace culture influence practice.
RESULTS: Of the WLWH and HIV-negative women, 12.2% and 15.0% reported experiencing disrespect and abuse during childbirth (P = 0.37), respectively. In adjusted analyses, no significant differences between WLWH and HIV-negative women's experiences of different types of disrespect and abuse were identified, with the exception of WLWH having greater odds of reporting non-consented care (P = 0.03). None of the WLWH reported violations of HIV confidentiality or attributed disrespect and abuse to their HIV status. Provider interviews indicated that training and supervision focused on prevention of vertical HIV transmission had contributed to changing the institutional culture and reducing HIV-related violations.
CONCLUSIONS: In general, WLWH were not more likely to report disrespect and abuse during childbirth than HIV-negative women. However, the high overall prevalence of disrespect and abuse measured indicates a serious problem. Similar institutional priority as has been given to training and supervision to reduce HIV-related discrimination during childbirth should be focused on ensuring respectful maternity care for all women."
25437509,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25437509/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether total knee arthroplasty recipients demonstrating comparatively poor mobility at entry to rehabilitation and who received supervised therapy, had better rehabilitation outcomes than those who received less supervision.
DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of randomized trial data.
PATIENTS: Total knee arthroplasty participants randomized to supervised (n = 159) or home-based therapy (n = 74).
METHODS: Participants were dichotomized based on mean target 6-min walk test (6MWT) pre-therapy (second post-surgical week). Absolute and change in 6MWT and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Pain and Function subscales amongst low performers in the supervised (n = 89) and unsupervised (n = 36) groups were compared, as were high performers in the supervised (n = 70) and unsupervised (n = 38) groups.
RESULTS: Low performers in the unsupervised compared with the supervised group demonstrated significantly poorer 6MWT scores (absolute δ = 8.5%, p = 0.003; change δ = 8.1%, p = 0.007) when therapy ceased (10 weeks post-surgery). No differences in 6MWT were observed between the high performing subgroups or in the recovery of WOMAC subscales between any subgroups.
CONCLUSION: Individuals manifesting comparatively poor mobility at the commencement of physiotherapy may recover their mobility, but not perceived function, more quickly if streamed to supervised therapy."
25437838,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25437838/,"BACKGROUND: The use of botulinum toxin injection in the salivary gland, is taking an increasing significance in the treatment of functional hypersalivation today. With due regard to the off -label use and the prospect of success, dosage levels are not yet standardized.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a retrospective study, 54 patients resp. 117 treatments were analysed over a period of 5 years according to their dosage levels of botulinum toxin, outcome and side effects.
RESULTS: In 90% of the cases, a reduction of saliva after botulinum toxin injections was reported, although a significant number of patients wished for an even greater effect. Compared to the first botulinum toxin injection, we therefore used a higher dosage plan in the following treatment in order to achieve better clinical results. Besides not enough saliva reduction, the main side effects were swallowing problems and thick or sticky saliva in patients with a tracheal cannula. With the exception of insufficient saliva reduction, the other described side effects were irrespective to the dosage level.
CONCLUSIONS: Botulinum toxin injection as a treatment of hypersalivation is an effective method with only minor side effects, even in increased dosage levels. Nevertheless, certain modifications according to each individual treatment are required. Possible side effects such as swallowing problems or non-responding situations should always be part of informed consent, especially as the latter is even possible for higher dosage levels."
25438025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25438025/,"OBJECTIVES: Celiac disease (CD) and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) are 2 distinct disease entities affecting the gastrointestinal tract of pediatric patients. Recently it has been suggested that EoE is more prevalent in patients with celiac disease than in the general population. We studied the association between these 2 disease entities in our pediatric patients.
METHODS: We reviewed our hospital files for suspected or confirmed cases of CD. Only cases with both duodenal and esophageal biopsies in pediatric patients were included. A total of 120 patients who met these criteria were included as the disease group. We also selected 100 patients with no clinical suspicion of CD and included them as a control group. Slides were reviewed using established criteria for diagnosis of both conditions. Duodenal biopsies were categorized as positive, negative, and suspicious for CD, whereas esophageal biopsies were classified as either positive or negative for esophageal eosinophilia (EE). Serologic and clinical data were additionally collected.
RESULTS: Sixty-two (62) cases were considered positive for CD in the disease group; among those 4 (6.5%) showed EE. In the control group, 91 cases were negative for CD, histologically, and 7 of those had EE (7.7%). Although 6 patients in the control group were histologically suspicious for CD, none of them had evidence of EE.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that, in our patient population, patients with CD are not more likely to have EE than patients undergoing upper endoscopy for other reasons. Therefore, we suggest that the association between CD and EE is likely incidental and not causal."
25438162,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25438162/,"BACKGROUND: The urban low income has often been assumed to have the greatest dental treatment needs compared to the general population. However, no studies have been carried out to verify these assumptions. This study was conducted to assess whether there was any difference between the treatment needs of an urban poor population as compared to the general population in order to design an intervention programme for this community.
METHODS: A random sampling of living quarters (households) in the selected areas was done. 586 adults over 19 years old living in these households were clinically examined using World Health Organization (WHO) Oral Health Survey criteria 4th edition (1997).
RESULTS: The overall prevalence of dental caries, periodontal disease, denture wearers and temporomandibular joint problems were 70.5%, 97.1%, 16.7% and 26%, respectively. The majority (80.5%) needed some form of dental treatment. The highest treatment needs were found in the oldest age group while the lowest were in the youngest group (19-29 years) (p = 0.000). The most prevalent periodontal problem was calculus; regardless of gender, ethnicity and age. Significantly more females (20.5%) wore prosthesis than males (11.1%) (p = 0.003). Prosthetic status and need significantly increased with age (p = 0.000). About one in four adults had Temporo-Mandibular Joint (TMJ) problems. Overall, it was surprising to note that the oral disease burden related to caries, prosthetic status and treatment need were lower in this population as compared to the national average (NOHSA, 2010). However, their periodontal disease status and treatment needs were higher compared to the national average indicating a poor oral hygiene standard.
CONCLUSIONS: The evidence does not show that the overall oral disease burden and treatment needs in this urban disadvantaged adult population as higher than the national average, except for periodontal disease. The older age groups and elderly were identified as the most in need for oral health intervention and promotion. An integrated health intervention programme through a multisectoral common risk factor approach in collaboration with the Faculties of Medicine, Dentistry and other agencies is needed for the identified target group."
25438271,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25438271/,"PURPOSE: Although there are Occupational Safety and Health Administration guidelines for the proper disposal of hazardous waste in the dental office, there are no guidelines for patients regarding the disposal of the gauze packs that are usually placed after tooth extraction or other dental surgery. Thus there is the possibility of cross contamination by patients with undiagnosed blood-transmitted viral diseases. The purpose of this study was to determine what, if any, instructions are given by oral and maxillofacial surgeons (OMSs) and if such instructions are adequate.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 5-question survey was sent electronically to 375 randomly selected OMSs, and there was a 17% response. They were asked whether they provided written and verbal postoperative instructions, whether these included instructions about gauze pack disposal, and whether they gave special instructions to patients with known viral diseases such as hepatitis or human immunodeficiency virus infection.
RESULTS: All respondents indicated that they provided both written and verbal postoperative instructions. However, only 1 respondent's instructions indicated how to dispose of the gauze pack, and only 1 gave special instructions to patients with known viral infections.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for OMSs to provide specific instructions to all patients about the proper disposal of blood-soaked sponges to avoid potential cross contamination."
25438272,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25438272/,"PURPOSE: The authors hypothesized that a muscle relaxant would have no meaningful difference in intubation conditions during nasal intubation under remifentanil and propofol anesthesia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This parallel-group, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial included 44 patients who received saline (S group; n = 22) or rocuronium (R group; n = 22). In addition to remifentanil 0.5 μg/kg per minute and propofol 5 mg/kg per hour, propofol 0.5 mg/kg was administered until loss of consciousness. Nasal intubation was performed 10 minutes after administration of R or S 0.6 mg/kg. Significant differences in intubation conditions and salivary amylase levels before and after intubation were tested (P < .05).
RESULTS: Vocal cord status (P = .003) and response to intubation or cuff filling (P = .008) were significantly different, but intubation conditions were not. Salivary amylase level was significantly lower with R administration (P = .022). No patient complained of postoperative throat pain and hoarseness.
CONCLUSION: Muscle relaxants during nasal intubation performed after bolus administration of propofol 0.9 mg/kg in addition to 10 minutes of remifentanil 0.5 μg/kg per minute plus propofol 5 mg/kg per hour are unnecessary."
25438274,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25438274/,"PURPOSE: To date, studies have not agreed on the effects of irradiation on bone mineral density. The aim of our study was to investigate the changes in mandibular bone mineral density after irradiation at various doses with and without surgery.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We implemented a descriptive animal experiment. The sample included 16 female Göttingen Minipigs, randomly assigned to 4 groups and irradiated with equivalent doses of 0, 25, 50, and 70 Gy to the mandibular region. At 3 months after irradiation, the mandibular left premolars and molars were removed, and dental implants were placed. Computed tomography scans were taken before and 6 months after irradiation. The measured bone density was related to a bone phantom to calculate the bone mineral density quotient (BMDQ). The outcome variable was the BMDQ. Other study variables were the radiation dose and surgery. Descriptive and univariate analyses were computed, and significance was set at P ≤ .05.
RESULTS: In the left hemimandible, compared with the control group, a significant decrease in BMDQ was observed: 0.01 at 0 Gy, -0.01 at 25 Gy, -0.06 at 50 Gy, and -0.11 at 70 Gy (P = .023). The right hemimandible compared with the control group also showed a significant decrease in BMDQ: -0.02 at 0 Gy, -0.08 at 25 Gy, -0.09 at 50 Gy, and -0.11 at 70 Gy (P = .007).
CONCLUSIONS: The present study used a large animal model to simulate the tissue reactions induced by various radiation doses in the mandible. We found a significant decrease in the BMDQ after irradiation, but no significant correlation could be found between the irradiation dose and a decrease in the BMDQ."
25438871,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25438871/,"AIMS: We investigated the risk of developing diabetes across various metabolic phenotypes by considering the presence of overall adiposity or abdominal adiposity and the number of metabolic abnormalities and aimed to clarify whether a 'healthy overweight' phenotype, that is, overweight with no metabolic abnormalities, was protective of the development of diabetes.
METHODS: We studied 29 564 Japanese individuals without diabetes. The 5-year incidence of diabetes was assessed according to a combination of either overweight (BMI ≥ 25.0 kg/m(2) ) or abdominal obesity (waist circumference ≥ 90 cm in men and ≥ 80 cm in women) and the number of metabolic factors present (hypertension, elevated triglyceride concentration, low HDL cholesterol concentration and impaired fasting glucose).
RESULTS: A total of 1188 individuals developed diabetes. Compared with normal weight individuals with none of the four metabolic abnormalities, in overweight individuals with none of the four abnormalities there was an odds ratio (OR) of 2.32 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.50, 3.59] for diabetes; having any one metabolic abnormality increased the risk of developing diabetes among normal weight individuals [OR 3.23 (2.55, 4.10)] and overweight individuals [OR 5.00 (3.77, 6.63)]. Among overweight individuals, the presence of impaired fasting glucose alone substantially elevated the risk of diabetes by 8.98-fold (5.52, 14.6) in comparison with the absence of the four metabolic factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Being 'healthy overweight' was associated with a higher OR of developing future diabetes among Japanese individuals than normal weight individuals with no metabolic abnormalities, and being overweight with one or more abnormalities had a further elevated OR compared with 'healthy overweight' people."
25438976,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25438976/,"AIMS OF THE STUDY: The scope of individuals' motor repertoire and expertise influences the way they perceive the actions of others. When observing skilled actions, experts recruit the cortical network subserving action perception (action observation network, AON) to a greater extent than non-experts. However, it remains unknown whether and how a temporary motor injury affects activation within the AON.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: To investigate this issue, brain hemodynamic activity was recorded twice in thirteen national female gymnasts suffering from a lower extremity injury at the onset of the experiment. The gymnasts were scanned one month after the injury and were shown gymnastics routines they were able and temporarily unable to perform. Six months later, after complete recovery, they were scanned again and shown the same routines they were now able to practice.
RESULTS: Results showed: first, that the level of activity within the inferior parietal lobule and MT/V5/EBA (extrastriate body area), areas constitutive of the AON, was independent of the gymnasts' physical condition. Second, when gymnasts were hurt (vs. when recovered), higher activity in the cerebellum was detected.
CONCLUSION: The equal contribution of MT/V5/EBA and inferior parietal lobule during the observation of movements the gymnasts were able or unable to practice suggests respectively that physical provisional incapacity does not interfere with the perceptual processing of body shape and motion information, and that motor expertise may prevent the decay of sensorimotor representations. Higher activations in the cerebellum may suggest that this structure plays a role in dissociating perceived physically feasible movements from those that are provisionally unfeasible."
25439179,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25439179/,"OBJECTIVE: During laparoscopic surgery distractions often occur and multitasking between surgery and other tasks, such as technical equipment handling, is a necessary competence. In psychological research, reduction of adverse effects of distraction is demonstrated when specifically multitasking is trained. The aim of this study was to examine whether multitasking and more specifically task-switching can be trained in a virtual-reality (VR) laparoscopic skills simulator.
DESIGN: After randomization, the control group trained separately with an insufflator simulation module and a laparoscopic skills exercise module on a VR simulator. In the intervention group, insufflator module and VR skills exercises were combined to develop a new integrated training in which multitasking was a required competence. At random moments, problems with the insufflator appeared and forced the trainee to multitask. During several repetitions of a different multitask VR skills exercise as posttest, performance parameters (laparoscopy time, insufflator time, and errors) were measured and compared between both the groups as well with a pretest exercise to establish the learning effect. A face-validity questionnaire was filled afterward.
SETTING: University Medical Centre Utrecht, The Netherlands.
PARTICIPANTS: Medical and PhD students (n = 42) from University Medical Centre Utrecht, without previous experience in laparoscopic simulation, were randomly assigned to either intervention (n = 21) or control group (n = 21).
RESULTS: All participants performed better in the posttest exercises without distraction of the insufflator compared with the exercises in which multitasking was necessary to solve the insufflator problems. After training, the intervention group was significantly quicker in solving the insufflator problems (mean = 1.60Log(s) vs 1.70Log(s), p = 0.02). No significant differences between both the groups were seen in laparoscopy time and errors.
CONCLUSION: Multitasking has negative effects on the laparoscopic performance. This study suggests an additional learning effect of training multitasking in VR laparoscopy simulation, because the trainees are able to handle a secondary task (solving insufflator problems) quicker. These results may aid the development of laparoscopy VR training programs in approximating real-life laparoscopic surgery."
25439361,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25439361/,"BACKGROUND: The Asthma Predictive Index (API) and persistent wheezing phenotypes are associated with childhood asthma, but previous studies have not assessed their ability to predict objectively confirmed asthma.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the University of Cincinnati API Index (ucAPI) and/or persistent wheezing at age 3 can accurately predict objectively confirmed asthma at age 7.
METHODS: Data from the Cincinnati Childhood Allergy and Air Pollution Study, a high-risk prospective birth cohort, was used. Asthma was defined as parent-reported or physician-diagnosed asthma objectively confirmed by a change in FEV1 of ≥12% after bronchodilator or a positive methacholine challenge (PC20 ≤ 4 mg/mL); or as prior treatment with daily asthma controller medication(s). Multivariate logistic regression was used to investigate the relationship between confirmed asthma at age 7 and a positive ucAPI (adapted and modified from prior published API definitions) and persistent wheezing at age 3.
RESULTS: At age 7, 103 of 589 children (17.5%) satisfied the criteria for asthma. Confirmed asthma at age 7 was significantly associated with a positive ucAPI (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 13.3 [95% CI, 7.0-25.2]; P < .01) and the persistent wheezing phenotype (aOR 9.8 [95% CI, 4.9-19.5]; P < .01) at age 3. Allergic persistent wheezing was associated with a significantly higher risk of asthma (aOR 10.4 [95% CI, 4.1-26.0]; P < .01) than nonallergic persistent wheezing (aOR 5.4 [95% CI, 2.04-14.06]; P < .01).
CONCLUSION: Both a positive ucAPI and persistent wheeze at age 3 were associated with objectively confirmed asthma at age 7; however, the highest risk was associated with ucAPI. These results demonstrate the ucAPI as a clinically useful tool for predicting future asthma in school-age children."
25439411,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25439411/,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incidence of coagulopathy in patients with intrahepatic cholestasis inhepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP).
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort investigation.
SETTING: University medical center.
MEASUREMENTS: The records of 319 parturients who met study inclusion criteria were reviewed for various laboratory values. The primary outcome was the incidence of abnormal hemostasis, defined as prothrombin time (PT) greater than 14.5 seconds (INR>1.2). The incidence of postpartum hemorrhage was evaluated as a secondary outcome.
MAIN RESULTS: The incidence (95% CI) of abnormal PT was 0% (0 to 1.8). Other coagulation tests [partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and platelet count] were also normal, even in study subjects with significant (>5 times) elevation of liver enzymes. The incidence of postpartum hemorrhage after vaginal delivery was 2.4% (4 of 208 pts) and 6.3% (7 of 111 pts) after Cesarean delivery.
CONCLUSIONS: Coagulation abnormalities are rare in pregnant patients with ICP, even when a strict criterion is utilized (INR<1.2). The use of neuraxial anesthesia and/or analgesia may not necessarily be delayed in parturients with isolated ICP."
25439772,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25439772/,"OBJECTIVE: Small early postoperative hemodynamic differences were noted in a randomized comparison of 3 current-generation bioprosthetic aortic valves. Whether these differences persist and influence clinical outcomes 1 year following implantation is unknown.
METHODS: Three hundred adults with severe aortic stenosis undergoing valve replacement were randomized to receive the Epic (St Jude, St Paul, Minn) (n = 99), Magna (Edwards LifeSciences Inc, Irvine, Calif) (n = 100), or Mitroflow (Sorin Biomedica Spa, Saluggio, Italy) (n = 101) bioprostheses. Hemodynamic valve performance was examined by echocardiography at 1 year, and clinical outcomes were assessed in 241 patients (79 Epic, 77 Magna, and 85 Mitroflow; P = .437).
RESULTS: Mean age was 75 ± 8 years and 164 were men (68%). Between dismissal and 1 year there were 9 deaths (3.7%) (Epic: 3.7%, Magna: 5.0%, and Mitroflow: 2.3%; P = .654), 6 episodes of heart failure (2.5%) (Epic: 1.3%, Magna: 1.3%, and Mitroflow: 5.8%; P = .265), 27 instances of atrial fibrillation/flutter (11.2%) (Epic: 8.1%, Magna: 11.0%, and Mitroflow: 7.9%; P = .577) and no strokes/transient ischemic attacks. One-year echocardiography demonstrated small hemodynamic differences between Epic, Magna, and Mitroflow bioprostheses in mean gradient (15.2 ± 5.5, 12.3 ± 4.3, and 16.2 ± 5.7 mm Hg, respectively; P < .001) and indexed aortic valve area (0.93 ± 0.28, 1.04 ± 0.28, and 0.96 ± -0.26 cm(2)/m(2), respectively; P = .015). Several early trends persisted when stratifying data by echocardiographic annulus diameter, universal annulus size, and implant size, particularly with annular size ≥23 mm. Overall left ventricular mass index regression between dismissal and 1 year was -16.5 ± 28.1 g/m(2), and was similar among groups (P = .262). There were no aortic valve reoperations.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite midterm persistence of small hemodynamic differences amongst current-generation porcine and pericardial aortic valves, our prospective randomized comparison reveals that clinical outcomes and mass regression are equivalent between devices at 1 year. These encouraging trends must continue to be assessed during longitudinal follow-up."
25439780,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25439780/,"OBJECTIVES: Surgical aortic valve replacement is challenging in patients with severe aortic calcification. Some patients undergo sternotomy and have the operation aborted because of intraoperative discovery of severe calcification. Hypothermic circulatory arrest and transcatheter aortic valve replacement offer clampless treatment options for aortic stenosis. The study objectives are to characterize patients who are referred after sternotomy was aborted for porcelain aorta and to describe the treatment outcomes.
METHODS: From 2001 to 2013, 19 patients presented after attempt at surgical aortic valve replacement was aborted because of porcelain aorta. Patients presented with aortic stenosis (n = 16), regurgitation (n = 1), or both (n = 2). Off-pump coronary bypass was performed in 10 patients. At the Cleveland Clinic, patients underwent surgical aortic valve replacement (n = 7) or transcatheter aortic valvve replacement (n = 12). The median interval between aborted aortic valve replacement and definitive treatment was 9.6 months. The mean age was 74 ± 11 years. The mean transvalvular gradient was 51 ± 18 mm Hg, and area was 0.6 cm(2). Axillary cannulation was used in all patients undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement, but only 4 required circulatory arrest. The transcatheter aortic valve replacement approach was transfemoral (n = 5), transapical (n = 6), or transaortic (n = 1).
RESULTS: The mean postoperative gradient was 13 ± 4 mm Hg. There was no mortality, stroke, renal failure, or reoperation for bleeding. One patient required a second valve implantation for paravalvular leak. The median hospital length of stay was 8 days. Five late noncardiac deaths occurred at a median follow-up of 16 months.
CONCLUSIONS: Both surgical aortic valve replacement and transcatheter aortic valve replacement are safe and effective options after aborted sternotomy in patients with porcelain aorta who are referred to a high-risk valve center. Procedure selection may be tailored to individual patients on the basis of aortic morphology and comorbidities. Patients with aortic stenosis at risk for calcific aortic disease should be screened with cross-sectional imaging preoperatively."

The study evaluates the expression of type I collagen, pro-inflammatory interleukin (IL) 1β, anti-proliferative interferon-γ (IFN-γ), and pro-proliferative IL-4 and IL-13 cytokines along a 1-cm section taken from the edge of a torn supraspinatus tendon. Three sections were taken: 3 mm distal to the tear, 3 mm proximal to the tear, and the 4-mm middle section between them.
METHODS: Nine patients (average age, 58 years) were included in the study. All fulfilled strict inclusion criteria regarding tear morphology and reconstruction technique. Samples were taken from the ruptured supraspinatus tendon at the time of arthroscopic repair. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay was used for analysis.
RESULTS: The expression of type I collagen, IL-4, and IL-13 significantly increased and that of IL-1β and IFN-γ decreased from the distal to the proximal parts of the tendon edge (P < .05).
CONCLUSIONS: The expression of type I collagen is dependent on the distance from the edge of the torn supraspinatus tendon, the balance between anti-proliferative IFN-γ and pro-proliferative IL-4 and IL-13, and the expression of pro-inflammatory IL-1β. Hence, whereas resection of the distal 3 mm of the torn supraspinatus tendon edge eliminates its least valuable part, resection between 4 and 7 mm may enhance the healing process by reaching a reasonable compromise between the mechanical features of the tendon characterized by collagen type I expression and the technical abilities of reconstruction."
25440346,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25440346/,"BACKGROUND: Stroke is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. There is a paucity of data from South Asia where stroke is highly prevalent. Validated tools administrable by community health workers (CHWs) are required to identify stroke in the community in a resource-strapped region such as this.
METHODS: The study was conducted in a transitional slum in Karachi, Pakistan. Questionnaire to Verify Stroke-Free Status (QVSFS) was adapted and translated into Urdu. Two CHWs, trained by a neurologist, selected 322 community-dwelling subjects using purposive sampling. Each CHW collected data independently, which was validated by a vascular neurologist who directly examined each participant. To assess the effect of audit and feedback, data from the final 10% of the subjects were collected after a second training session for the CHWs. Sensitivity, specificity, and Cohen kappa were determined for the CHW-administered questionnaire against neurovascular assessment.
RESULTS: Mean age of participants was 56.5 years with 71% of participants being women. The sensitivity and specificity of the questionnaire of detecting stroke was 77.1% (confidence interval [CI], 64.1-86.9) and 85.8% (CI, 83.5-87.5), respectively. The chance-corrected agreement using the Cohen kappa statistic was .51 (CI, .38-.60). Kappa ranged from .37 to .58 for each of the 7 stroke symptoms. Hemianesthesia (72.9%) and hemiplegia (64.6%) were the most sensitive symptoms. The performance and agreement improved from moderate to substantial after audit and feedback.
CONCLUSIONS: We found a reasonable sensitivity and specificity and moderate agreement between CHW-administered QVSFS and assessment by a vascular neurologist."
25440349,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25440349/,"PURPOSE: Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) are small dot-like lesions appearing as hyposignals on gradient echo (GRE) T2* magnetic resonance (MR) sequences, whereas the leukoaraiosis (LA) indicates the presence of patchy areas of hypersignal on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MR sequences in the periventricular white matter. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the association between LA and CMBs.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eighty-five consecutive (men 55; median age 64 years) patients were retrospectively analyzed using a 1.5 T system; CMBs were studied using a T2*-weighted GRE sequence and classified as absent (grade 1), mild (grade 2; total number of microbleeds, 1-2), moderate (grade 3; total number of microbleeds, 3-10), and severe (grade 4; total number of microbleeds, >10). LA was assessed with FLAIR MR sequences and was graded based on the European Task Force on Age-Related White Matter Changes as follows: 1 (no lesions), 2 (focal lesions > 5 mm), 3 (early confluent lesions), and 4 (diffuse involvement of an entire brain region).
RESULTS: We considered 170 cerebral hemispheres. The prevalence of CMBs was 24.7% (42 of 170), whereas the prevalence of LA was 27.1% (46 of 170). A statistically significant correlation was observed between LA and CMBs (correlation rho = .495, P value = .001). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed an association between CMBs and cerebrovascular symptoms (P = .0023).
CONCLUSION: Results of this study suggest an association between CMBs and LA. Moreover, we found that LA is associated with the presence of cerebrovascular symptoms."
25440367,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25440367/,"BACKGROUND: Large vessel occlusion (LVO) is associated with poor functional outcome in acute ischemic stroke. Given the uncertainty whether LVO has the same significance in mild and severe stroke, we compared functional outcomes after intravenous thrombolysis, based on severity and LVO.
METHODS: Ischemic stroke patients were thrombolyzed in less than 4.5 hours after onset between 2007 and 2013. LVO was defined as occlusion of one of the following arteries: internal carotid, middle cerebral (M1/M2), anterior cerebral (A1), posterior cerebral (P1), basilar, or vertebral (V4) arteries on prethrombolysis computed tomography angiography. Mild stroke was defined as baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score 0-6. Favorable outcome was defined as modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 0-1 at 3 months or equal to the prestroke mRS.
RESULTS: There were 175 acute stroke patients, median age 74 years (interquartile range [IQR], 64-83), median baseline NIHSS = 11 (IQR, 5-16), and 63 of 175 patients (36%) with mild stroke. LVO was associated with worse outcome in severe stroke (age-adjusted odds ratio [OR] of favorable outcome, .42; 95% confidence interval [CI], .19-.93; P = .033) and mortality (age-adjusted OR, 3.52; 95% CI, 1.08-11.48; P = .037). Although the difference in favorable outcome between mild stroke patients with and without LVO was not significant (55.6% vs. 74.1%, P = .262; age-adjusted OR of favorable outcome, .42; 95% CI, .1-1.84; P = .251), the similarity of effects across both subgroups cannot be excluded (LVO-by-stroke severity interaction test, P = .906).
CONCLUSIONS: LVO is associated with worse functional outcome and mortality in severe stroke after intravenous thrombolysis. Although significant association between LVO and outcome in mild stroke was not found, there were similar effects on outcome and a larger study might well confirm a relationship."
25440370,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25440370/,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have reported that women with stroke often present different stroke symptoms than men. The aim of our study was to assess for the relevance of these differences from a large case series.
METHODS: Consecutive patients admitted to the Stroke Unit at the University of Perugia, with acute stroke or transient ischemic attack between 1 June, 2005, and May 2012, and recorded in Perugia Stroke Registry were prospectively included. Associations between the recorded symptoms and sex were assessed by preliminary cross-tabulations with the Chi-square test or Fisher exact test with Yate correction when appropriate. Multivariable regression analysis was used to identify independent predictors of a single symptom including sex as an independent variable.
RESULTS: Overall, 1072 men and 811 women were included in this study. Women had a higher average age at onset (75.40 ± 12.90 years in women and 70.14 ± 12.61 years in men) and presented more severe strokes with higher National Institute of Health Stroke Scale scores than men, whereas men were more likely to have a posterior stroke.Regarding symptoms, multivariate analysis revealed correlations between postural instability and male sex and between dysphagia and female sex.
CONCLUSIONS: We found no differences in the clinical presentation of stroke between the sexes, except that men were more likely to have postural instability and females were more likely to have dysphagia. These findings suggest that stroke locations and stroke severity were associated with sex."
25440470,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25440470/,"BACKGROUND: A collateral circulation which supplies a myocardial territory, subtended by a chronic total occlusion (CTO), may be observed at invasive coronary angiography. The prognostic and protective role of such collateralisation is well demonstrated suggesting that a good collateral circulation may be a predictor of myocardial viability, but current evidence is discrepant. The aim of this study is to assess the relationship between collateralisation from the contralateral epicardial vessels and myocardial viability by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR).
METHOD: Consecutive patients with CTO having had both CMR and invasive coronary angiography were retrospectively identified. The collateral circulation was graded with the Cohen and Rentrop classification. CMR images were graded per segment for wall motion (1: normal/hyperkinetic, 2: hypokinetic, 3: akinetic, or 4: dyskinetic) and wall motion score index (WMSI) was calculated. The segmental transmurality of late gadolinium enhancement was scored as 1 (0%), 2 (1-25%), 3 (26-50%), 4 (51-75%) and 5 (76-100%).
RESULTS: A good collateral circulation was more likely to supply viable myocardium (p=0.01). There was no relationship between collateral circulation supply and wall motion score index (WMSI), however, increasing transmurality of LGE was significantly associated with higher mean WMSI representing increasing dysfunctional myocardium (p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: The presence of collateral coronary circulation at angiography predicts the presence of viability on cardiovascular MRI, with a gradation of greater viability associated with improving Rentrop grade. A collateral circulation at angiography should, therefore, prompt more formal assessment of viability and consideration of revascularisation in order for the patient to obtain the associated functional and prognostic improvement."
25440478,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25440478/,"BACKGROUND: The urgency of laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis is under debate. We hypothesized that nighttime cholecystectomy is associated with decreased length of stay.
METHODS: Retrospective review of 1,140 patients at 2 large urban referral centers with acute cholecystitis who underwent daytime (7 am to 7 pm) versus nighttime (7 pm to 7 am) cholecystectomy was conducted.
RESULTS: Nighttime cholecystectomy did not affect the overall length of stay (3.7 vs 3.8 days, P = .08) or complication rate (5% vs 7%, P = .5) versus daytime cholecystectomy. Nighttime cholecystectomy was associated with a higher conversion rate to open cholecystectomy (11% vs 6%, P = .008). On multivariable analysis, independent predictors of conversion to open surgery were nighttime cholecystectomy, age, and gangrenous cholecystitis (P = .01). The only predictor of complications was gangrenous cholecystitis (P = .02).
CONCLUSIONS: Nighttime cholecystectomy is associated with an increased conversion to open surgery without decrease in length of stay or complications. These findings suggest that laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis should be delayed until normal working hours."
25440485,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25440485/,"BACKGROUND: Many programs rely extensively on United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) scores for interviews/selection of surgical residents. However, their predictive ability remains controversial. We examined the association between USMLE scores and success in surgical residency.
METHODS: We compared USMLE scores for 123 general surgical residents who trained in the past 20 years and their performance evaluation. Scores were normalized to the mean for the testing year and expressed as a ratio (1 = mean). Performances were evaluated by (1) rotation evaluations; (2) ""dropouts;"" (3) overall American Board of Surgery pass rate; (4) first-time American Board of Surgery pass rate; and (5) a retrospective comprehensive faculty evaluation. For the latter, 16 surgeons (average faculty tenure 22 years) rated residents on a 1 to 4 score (1 = fair; 4 = excellent).
RESULTS: Rotation evaluations by faculty and ""drop out"" rates were not associated with USMLE score differences (dropouts had average above the mean). One hundred percent of general surgery practitioners achieved board certification regardless of USMLE score but trainees with an average above the mean had a higher first-time pass rate (P = .04). Data from the comprehensive faculty evaluations were conflicting: there was a moderate degree of correlation between board scores and faculty evaluations (r = .287, P = .001). However, a score above the mean was associated with a faculty ranking of 3 to 4 in only 51.7% of trainees.
CONCLUSION: Higher USMLE scores were associated with higher faculty evaluations and first-time board pass rates. However, their positive predictive value was only 50% for higher faculty evaluations and a high overall board pass rate can be achieved regardless of USMLE scores. USMLE Step 1 score is a valid tool for selecting residents but caution might be indicated in using it as a single selection factor."
25440489,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25440489/,"BACKGROUND: Purpose of this study is to determine strategies to decrease catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) in intensive care unit (ICU) patients.
METHODS: ICU patients with an indwelling urinary catheter (UC) in one tertiary hospital were monitored for CAUTI. Interventions were implemented sequentially with quarterly data collection. Outcome measures were infection ratio (IR = number of infections/catheter days [CD] × 1000) and device utilization rate (DUR = catheter days/patient days).
RESULTS: CDs and DUR decreased (fiscal year 2008: CD, 11,414; DUR, .85 vs fiscal year 2013: CD, 8,144; DUR, .70). IR increased with suspension of prepackaged baths (IR, 3.2 to 3.5 to 4.9 to 5.0), twice daily UC care (IR, 4.8 to 6.7), emptying UC bags at 400 mL (IR, 6.7 to 9.2). Two-person UC placement (IR, 5.6 to 4.8), physician notification of CAUTI (IR, 6.1 to 4.8), and reinstitution of prepackaged baths and daily UC care (IR, 4.8 to 3.7) decreased CAUTI rates.
CONCLUSIONS: Decreasing CAUTI in the ICU requires diligent monitoring and constant practice re-evaluation. Elimination of CAUTI in the ICU may not be possible."
25440492,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25440492/,"BACKGROUND: Over the last 10 years, the paradigm of damage control resuscitation (DCR) has been associated with improved patient outcomes. This study investigates the outcomes of both closed and open pelvic ring fractures at a single institution before and after the formal implementation of DCR principles.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed in an urban level I trauma center of all patients who sustained open or closed pelvic ring fractures between 2002 and 2012.
RESULTS: Two thousand two hundred forty-seven patients presented with pelvic fractures between 2002 and 2012. Overall mortality was 10% (n = 212). Only 8% of all patients with closed fractures required DCR compared with 28% of patients with open fractures. There was no difference in mortality when comparing DCR and pre-DCR cohorts for either open or closed pelvic fractures.
CONCLUSIONS: Interestingly, although DCR seems to lead to more efficient initial resuscitations, further improvements in patient mortality were not realized with formal implementation of DCR principles."

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility and safety of ESD for giant colorectal LSTs ≥ 10 cm.
DESIGN: Retrospective study.
SETTING: Tertiary-care center.
PATIENTS: A total of 163 patients underwent colorectal ESD between 2009 and 2014 by a single expert ESD endoscopist at Gangnam Severance Hospital, Seoul, Korea. Among them, 9 patients had giant colorectal LSTs ≥ 10 cm.
INTERVENTIONS: Review of records.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Clinicopathologic factors and oncologic outcome associated with ESD between giant colorectal LSTs and others.
RESULTS: Colorectal LSTs ≥ 10 cm were classified as giant colorectal LSTs. Nine giant colorectal LST lesions were localized to the following regions: descending colon (n = 1), sigmoid colon (n = 1), and rectum (n = 7). The average maximal diameter of giant colorectal LSTs was 120.8 mm, and the procedure time was 270.0 minutes. Two lesions were of the whole nodular type, and 7 were focal nodular lesions. The en bloc and curative resection rates for ESD for giant colorectal LSTs were 88.9% and 100%, respectively. The adverse event rate was 44.4%. No strictures, local recurrences, or distant metastases occurred over a mean follow-up period of 27.1 months.
LIMITATIONS: Retrospective, single-center study.
CONCLUSIONS: ESD of giant colorectal LSTs appears to be a feasible and curative treatment, even though it is associated with a higher adverse event rate, higher degree of technical difficulty, and longer procedure time."
25440733,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25440733/,"OBJECTIVE: Dysfunctional thinking about sleep is a central aspect in the perpetuation of primary insomnia and a target symptom of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). Insomnia symptoms also occur in other sleep disorders, but it is not known to what extent it is related to dysfunctional thinking about sleep.
METHODS: The Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Scale (DBAS) was administered to inpatients at a sleep center. The following groups were included: 34 patients with primary insomnia (PI), 30 patients with sleep apnea syndrome (SAS), 31 patients with restless legs syndrome (RLS), 26 patients with SAS comorbid with RLS (SAS + RLS), and 24 patients with idiopathic hypersomnia or narcolepsy. Eighty-four healthy subjects served as a control group. The DBAS scores were compared across the different sleep disorders and correlated with polysomnographic (PSG) variables, subjective sleep parameters, scores of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and the Regensburg Insomnia Scale (RIS; measuring psychological symptoms of insomnia).
RESULTS: Compared to healthy controls, DBAS scores were increased in PI, RLS and RLS + SAS. There was a low correlation between DBAS scores and PSG variables, moderate correlations between DBAS and subjective sleep parameters and BDI scores (r = 0.528), and a high correlation between DBAS and the RIS score (r = 0.603).
CONCLUSION: The observation of increased DBAS scores in other sleep disorders besides primary insomnia underscores the usefulness of a broadened diagnostic procedure and suggests that CBT-I modules may be a complementary treatment tool for these disorders."

METHODS: A total of 150 patients with asymptomatic lower calyceal stones were randomized into F-URS (group 1), SWL (group 2), and observation (group 3) groups. The main criteria for patient enrollment were having asymptomatic single lower pole stones <1 cm.
RESULTS: In F-URS, the mean stone-free rate was 92% (46 of 50). The mean number of sessions for the SWL group was 1.48 ± 0.65. Stone-free rate was 90% (45 of 50). In the observation group, patients were followed up for a mean of 21.02 ± 3.65 months. Three stones passed spontaneously without any symptoms. Pain developed in 3 patients during follow-up, and 2 of them passed a stone and responded to analgesics without further treatment. Complication rates for groups 1 and 2 were similar, but group 2 had higher Clavien grades.
CONCLUSION: For asymptomatic small-sized lower calyceal stones, SWL and F-URS are established treatment modalities. However, with low auxiliary treatment rates, observation may be an option for the management of nonsymptomatic small-sized lower pole kidney stones."

METHODS: From January 1990 to December 2013, we have performed percutaneous nephrolithotomy in 26 patients with USG-guided punctures. The stones were solitary in 15 patients (58%) and multiple in 11 patients (42%). The mean stone size was 22 mm (range, 10-50 mm), including 3 staghorn calculi. All procedures were performed in an oblique-supine position, and the intraoperative complications as the postoperative outcome were reviewed.
RESULTS: The mean operative time was 93 minutes, achieving complete stone clearance in 22 (88%) of the patients. One of the patients had urine leakage after removing nephrostomy, needing postoperative double J stenting. One patient had significant intraoperative bleeding requiring staging of the procedure and blood transfusion. No bowel injuries were identified. Mean hospitalization time was 5.6 days.
CONCLUSION: USG-guided puncture is a safe and effective approach to the collecting system even in renal anomalies like in pelvic ectopic kidneys when performed in experienced hands."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approved our retrospective study; requirement for informed consent was waived. 56 patients with histologically proven EC who underwent preoperative MRI and surgery at our Institution over a 34 months period were included. Two radiologists independently evaluated T2-WI+CE T1-WI and T2-WI+DWI of each patient. Confidence in imaging evaluation (0-3), depth of myometrial invasion (</≥50%) and presence of cervical stromal infiltration (Yes/No) were assessed. MRI findings were compared with pathological ones.
RESULTS: Confidence in imaging evaluation was higher for T2-WI+CE T1-WI (2.83/3) than for T2-WI+DWI (2.62/3). T2-WI+DWI showed a better diagnostic performance than T2-WI+CE T1-WI in recognizing deep myometrial infiltration by EC (accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 0.89, 0.89 and 0.89 vs. 0.86, 0.84, 0.86; p>0.05) whereas both imaging sequences combinations showed the same diagnostic performance in recognizing cervical stromal infiltration (accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 0.95, 0.98 and 0.80, p>0.05).
CONCLUSION: T2-WI+DWI can reliably replace the ""classical"" combination T2-WI+CE T1-WI for local staging of endometrial carcinoma."

METHOD: Older participants completed baseline measures of memory and executive function, health, and baseline and post-treatment Hamilton Depression Scales (HAM-D) in a 12-week trial comparing psychotherapies (problem-solving vs. supportive; N = 46). We examined cognitive predictors to identify treatment responders (i.e., HAM-D scores reduced by ≥50%) and remitters (i.e., post-treatment HAM-D score ≤10).
RESULTS: Empirically derived decision trees identified poorer performance on switching (i.e., Trails B), with a cut-score of ≥82 predicting psychotherapy responders. No other cognitive or health variables predicted psychotherapy outcomes in the decision trees.
CONCLUSIONS: Psychotherapies that support or improve the executive skill of switching may augment treatment response for older patients exhibiting executive dysfunction in depression.

25441057,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25441057/,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Diode detectors are commonly used in dosimetry, but have been reported to over-respond in small fields. Diode correction factors have been reported in the literature. The purpose of this study is to determine whether correction factors for a given diode type can be universally applied over a range of irradiation conditions including beams of different qualities.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A mathematical relation of diode over-response as a function of the field size was developed using previously published experimental data in which diodes were compared to an air core scintillation dosimeter. Correction factors calculated from the mathematical relation were then compared those available in the literature.
RESULTS: The mathematical relation established between diode over-response and the field size was found to predict the measured diode correction factors for fields between 5 and 30 mm in width. The average deviation between measured and predicted over-response was 0.32% for IBA SFD and PTW Type E diodes. Diode over-response was found to be not strongly dependent on the type of linac, the method of collimation or the measurement depth.
CONCLUSIONS: The mathematical relation was found to agree with published diode correction factors derived from Monte Carlo simulations and measurements, indicating that correction factors are robust in their transportability between different radiation beams."
25441332,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25441332/,"BACKGROUND: Novel echocardiographic techniques based on myocardial deformation have not been extensively evaluated to assess right ventricular (RV) and left ventricular (LV) response after pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) in patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot.
METHODS: Between 2003 and 2012, 133 patients undergoing first-time PVR after tetralogy of Fallot repair underwent echocardiographic assessment at Mayo Clinic. The last echocardiogram before PVR and 1 year after surgery were retrospectively analyzed with Velocity Vector Imaging.
RESULTS: Mean age at PVR was 35.5 ± 16.2 years (54% women). Longitudinal peak systolic strain and strain rate before PVR were low: for the left ventricle, -14.8 ± 3.5% and -0.8 ± 0.2 sec(-1), and for the right ventricle, -16.2 ± 4.1% and -0.9 ± 0.3 sec(-1), respectively. There was no significant change in either parameter after surgery. A close correlation between LV and RV deformational parameters was found before PVR and was maintained after surgery. In the multivariate analysis, patients with better LV and RV peak systolic strain preoperatively were found to have better LV and RV peak systolic strain after surgery (P = .004 and P = .006, respectively). However, patients with the most improvement in deformation were those with worse RV function preoperatively (P = .002). Mean New York Heart Association class at early follow-up improved from 2.2 ± 0.8 to 1.2 ± 0.6 (P < .0001); RV peak systolic strain was the only factor associated with symptomatic improvement.
CONCLUSION: LV and RV systolic and diastolic deformational parameters were decreased in patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot undergoing PVR, and there was no significant change after surgery. However, preoperative systolic deformational parameters were predictive of postoperative ventricular function and New York Heart Association class after PVR and may be helpful to identify optimal timing for surgical intervention in this cohort."

Students worked directly with community members to identify health issues, implement educational workshops addressing those issues, and evaluate health outcomes.
DESIGN AND SAMPLE: This is a qualitative, descriptive study. Thematic analysis was conducted using a written questionnaire completed one or more years postimmersion. The sample was 41 nursing students who participated in a 10-day immersion experience in remote Honduras.
RESULTS: Four themes emerged revealing evidence of long-term learning. Three of these themes, Embracing Other, Gaining Cultural Competencies, and Experiencing an Ethnocentric Shift, are supported in the literature. The fourth theme, Negotiating Ethical Dilemmas, offers a new finding.
CONCLUSION: Although educators have questioned ethical consequences of study abroad programs, there is a paucity of literature indicating that students are the ones doing the questioning. Implications for educators and community members alike include facilitating dialog about collective worldviews related to global health ethics when designing study abroad programs."
25441556,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25441556/,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this cohort study was to compare scapular notching rates, range of motion, and functional outcomes between patients who underwent a standard Grammont-style reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) and patients who underwent bony increased-offset reverse shoulder arthroplasty (BIO-RSA) at a minimum of 2 years' follow-up. We hypothesized that the BIO-RSA cohort would have lower notching rates and improved rotational range of motion; however, validated outcome scores between cohorts would be no different.
METHODS: A comparative cohort study was designed after a sample size calculation. A total of 40 patients were studied with 20 in each cohort (RSA vs BIO-RSA). All patients underwent an interview and physical examination. Outcomes included range of motion; shoulder strength; Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score; American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score; Simple Shoulder Test score; Constant score; and Global Rating of Change scale score. Radiographs were obtained for all patients and examined for scapular notching.
RESULTS: When we compared demographic characteristics between the standard RSA and BIO-RSA cohorts, including age, sex, and follow-up duration, there were no significant differences between groups (P > .05). In addition, there were no significant differences between cohorts when we compared forward elevation (P = .418); external rotation (P = .999); internal rotation (P = .071); strength (P > .376); Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score (P = .229); American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score (P = .579); Simple Shoulder Test score (P = .522); Constant score (P = .917); or Global Rating of Change scale score (P = .167). The frequency of scapular notching, however, was significantly higher (P = .022) in the RSA cohort than in the BIO-RSA cohort: 75% versus 40%.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the scapular notching rate was significantly higher in the standard RSA group, no other outcome measures were statistically different, including range of motion, strength, and validated outcome scores."
25442065,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25442065/,"BACKGROUND: In the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP), pancreatic fistula has not been monitored, although organ space infection (OSI) data are collected. Therefore, the purpose of this analysis was to determine the relationship between ACS NSQIP organ space infection and pancreatic fistulas.
STUDY DESIGN: From 2007 to 2011, 976 pancreatic resection patients were monitored via ACS NSQIP at our institution. From this database, 250 patients were randomly chosen for further analysis. Four patients were excluded because they underwent total pancreatectomy. Data on OSI were gathered prospectively. Data on pancreatic fistulas and other intra-abdominal complications were determined retrospectively.
RESULTS: Organ space infections (OSIs) were documented in 22 patients (8.9%). Grades B (n = 26) and C (n = 5) pancreatic fistulas occurred in 31 patients (12.4%); grade A fistulas were observed in 38 patients (15.2%). Bile leaks and gastrointestinal (GI) anastomotic leaks each developed in 5 (2.0%) patients. Only 17 of 31 grade B and C pancreatic fistulas (55%), and none of 38 grade A fistulas were classified as OSIs in ACS NSQIP. In addition, only 2 of 5 bile leaks (40%) and 2 of 5 GI anastomotic leaks (40%) were OSIs. Moreover, 3 OSIs were due to bacterial peritonitis, a chyle leak, and an ischemic bowel.
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis suggests that the sensitivity (55%) and specificity (45%) of organ space infection (OSI) in ACS NSQIP are too low for OSI to be a surrogate for grade B and C pancreatic fistulas.

The objective of the study was to determine the interest of the drainage after pre-pectoral breast implants pre, analyzing the risk of hematoma and capsular contracture.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 400 patients who underwent a first aesthetic breast augmentation by pre-pectoral silicone gel implants. Patients were followed with a maximum of nine years and a minimum of one year.
RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 37 years (18-64). Ninety-two percent (368 cases) had no drainage (patients ""low risk of bleeding"") and 8% (32 cases) underwent a bilateral drainage (patients ""high risk of bleeding""). We recorded 1.75% hematoma (7 cases) and 2% of capsular contracture (8 cases).
CONCLUSION: We believe that the drainage should not be systematic for pre-pectoral breast implants. In patients at high risk of bleeding that we drained, it does not prevent the occurrence of a possible hematoma. In patients at low risk of bleeding that we have not drained, we do not observed more hematoma or capsular contracture than data published for drained patients."
25442503,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25442503/,"AIMS: To investigate whether the oncological outcomes of patients with osteosarcomas in the upper distal extremity are similar to other sites and assess if limb-salvage surgery is safe in this location.
METHODS: The centre database was used to identify all patients with osteosarcomas in the lower humerus and distally between 1985 and 2012. Patient, tumor, treatment and outcome data was collected.
RESULTS: Twenty-six patients were included in this study. There were 9 males and 17 females with a mean age of 33 years (9-90). Seventeen osteosarcomas were located in the forearm bones (65%), six in the distal humerus (23%), and three (12%) in the hand. The three most common sub-diagnoses were parosteal 7/21 (33%), fibroblastic 4/21 (19%) and osteoblastic osteosarcomas 3/21 (14%). 2 patients (8%) had Paget's disease and 19 patients (73%) had high-grade tumors. Local excision was carried out in 12 patients (48%), 4 patients underwent endoprosthetic replacement (16%) and 9 underwent amputation (36%). The overall risk of local recurrence was 4% in our series. The five-year overall survival rate was 67%, with low tumor grade and parosteal type of osteosarcoma being positive predictors of survival.
CONCLUSION: This series has shown that patients with high-grade osteosarcomas of the upper distal extremities have a higher amputation risk than other limb sites but have favorable outcomes with limb-salvage surgery, comparable to other anatomical sites. Parosteal osteosarcomas in particular have a good prognosis."
25442725,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25442725/,"INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this prospective randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was to determine the effects of a combination dose of 1000 mg acetaminophen/10 mg hydrocodone on cold pulpal testing in patients experiencing symptomatic irreversible pulpitis.
METHODS: One hundred emergency patients in moderate to severe pain diagnosed with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis of a mandibular posterior tooth randomly received, in a double-blind manner, identical capsules of either a combination of 1000 mg acetaminophen/10 hydrocodone or placebo. Cold testing with Endo-Ice (1,1,1,2 tetrafluoroethane; Hygenic Corp, Akron, OH) was performed at baseline and every 10 minutes for 60 minutes. Pain to cold testing was recorded by the patient using a Heft-Parker visual analog scale. Patients' reaction to the cold application was also rated.
RESULTS: Cold testing at baseline and at 10 minutes resulted in severe pain for both the acetaminophen/hydrocodone and placebo groups. Although pain ratings decreased from 20-60 minutes, the ratings still resulted in moderate pain. Patient reaction to cold testing showed that 56%-62% had a severe reaction. Although the reactions decreased in severity over the 60 minutes, 20%-34% still had severe reactions at 60 minutes. Regarding pain and patients' reactions to cold testing, there were no significant differences between the combination acetaminophen/hydrocodone and placebo groups at any time period.
CONCLUSIONS: A combination dose of 1000 mg of acetaminophen/10 mg of hydrocodone did not statistically affect cold pulpal testing in patients presenting with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis. Patients experienced moderate to severe pain and reactions to cold testing."
25443105,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25443105/,"OBJECTIVES: Little is known about the impact closing a health care facility has on immunization coverage of children utilizing that facility as a medical home. The authors assessed the impact of closing a Medicaid managed care facility in Philadelphia on immunization coverage of children, primarily low income children from racial/ethnic minority groups, utilizing that facility for routine immunizations.
STUDY DESIGN: Observational longitudinal cohort case study.
METHODS: Eligible children were born 03/01/05-06/30/07, present in Philadelphia's immunization information system (IIS), and were active clients of the facility before it closed in September 2007. IIS-recorded immunization coverage at ages 5, 7, 13, 16 and 19 months through January 2009 was compared between clinic children age-eligible to receive specific vaccines before clinic closing (preclosure cohorts) and children not age-eligible to receive those vaccines prior to closing (postclosure cohorts).
RESULTS: Of 630 eligible children, 99 (16%) had no additional IIS-recorded immunizations. Third dose DTaP vaccine coverage at age seven months among preclosure cohorts was 54.4% vs. 40.3% among postclosure cohorts [risk ratio 1.31 (1.15,1.49)]. Fourth dose DTaP coverage at 19 months was 65.9% vs. 57.7% [risk ratio 1.24 (1.08,1.42)]. MMR coverage at 16 months was 79.5% vs. 69.9% [risk ratio 1.47 (1.22, 1.76)]. Coverage for the 431331 vaccination series at 19 months was 63.8% vs. 53.8% [risk ratio 1.28 (1.12,1.88)].
CONCLUSIONS: Immunization coverage declined at key age milestones for active clients of a Medicaid managed care that closed as compared with preclosure cohorts of clients from the same facility. When a primary health care facility closes, efforts should be made to ensure that children who had received vaccinations at that facility quickly establish a new medical home."
25443109,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25443109/,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relationship between access to off-license alcohol outlets and areas with dual treatment for alcohol/drug abuse and anxiety/mood disorder compared to areas with anxiety/mood disorder only in an urban setting in New Zealand.
STUDY DESIGN: Ecologic study.
METHODS: Within small areas (2840 meshblocks, mean size 0.05 km(2)) in the city of Auckland, New Zealand, counts of adults receiving anxiety/mood disorder treatment (2008-9) were identified and the proportions of these individuals also receiving treatment for alcohol/drug abuse were generated. Access to off-license alcohol outlets were defined as: 1) shortest road distance from the population-weighted centroid of each small area to an outlet; 2) count of outlets within a 3 km road network buffer; and 3) relative density of outlets across Auckland (determined through kernel density estimates). To test for the relationship between access to alcohol outlets and dual diagnosis, meshblocks without any cases of anxiety/mood disorder were excluded from analyses. Remaining meshblocks were dichotomized into any or no dual diagnosis. Logistic regression was used to estimate the association between access to alcohol outlets and treatment for the dual conditions.
RESULTS: Neighbourhoods with dual diagnosis were generally similar to those with anxiety/mood disorder only, in terms of ethnic and gender/age composition. Regression analyses indicated statistically significant decreased risk of dual diagnosis for those areas with the lowest density (using a buffer) of alcohol outlets (OR = 0.75, P-value = 0.027) compared with areas with the highest density, after adjustment for deprivation and population density. All access measures also indicated significant linear trends where dual diagnosis was more likely in areas with greater access.
CONCLUSIONS: Generally, decreased access to alcohol outlets was associated with decreased odds of dual diagnosis of alcohol/drug abuse and anxiety/mood disorder. Measures to control access to alcohol outlets may be an important area for alcohol/substance abuse intervention, particularly for vulnerable sub-populations."
25443260,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25443260/,"BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease is now regarded as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The impact of occupational or non-occupational physical activity (PA) on moderate decreases of renal function is uncertain.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to identify the potential association of PA (occupational and leisure-time) on early decline of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and to determine the potential mediating effect of PA on the relationship between eGFR and heart disease.
METHODS: From the PRIME study analyses were conducted in 1058 employed men. Energy expended during leisure, work and commuting was calculated. Linear regression analyses were used to determine the link between types of PA and moderate decrements of eGFR determined with the KDIGO guideline at the baseline assessment. Cox proportional hazards analyses were used to explore the potential effect of PA on the relationship between eGFR and heart disease, ascertained during follow-up over 10 years.
RESULTS: For these employed men, and after adjustment for known confounders of GFR change, more time spent sitting at work was associated with increased risk of moderate decline in kidney function, while carrying objects or being active at work was associated with decreased risk. In contrast, no significant link with leisure PA was apparent. No potential mediating effect of occupational PA was found for the relationship between eGFR and coronary heart disease.
CONCLUSION: Occupational PA (potential modifiable factors) could provide a dual role on early impairment of renal function, without influence on the relationship between early decrease of e-GFR and CHD risk."
25443379,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25443379/,"PURPOSE: Flap complications still present challenges in the field of microsurgical reconstruction. The aim of this study was to explore the role of diabetes mellitus in free flap prognosis in elderly patients (≥60 years) after oral tumor resection.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The data of aged oral cancer patients who had undergone reconstructions with free flaps in our institution were gathered in this retrospective cohort study. The samples were classified into diabetic and nondiabetic groups. The predictive roles of diabetes status and other factors in free flap prognosis were analyzed. The primary outcome variable was the presence of flap complications, which was subdivided into major (requiring re-exploration or local surgery) and minor (dressing or drug treatment) groups. Major complications were defined as the second outcome variable. Univariate and multivariable analyses were used for data statistics.
RESULTS: A total of 309 patients (176 men [57%] and 133 women [43%]) aged 60 years or older were included in this study. There were 105 diabetic patients (34%) and 204 nondiabetic patients (66%). A total of 75 flap complications occurred during the perioperative period, with an overall incidence of 24.3% (44 diabetic patients [41.9%] and 31 nondiabetic patients [15.2%], P ≤ .001). The odds of susceptibility for flap complication development in elderly diabetic patients was 3.413 times that of nondiabetic patients (odds ratio, 3.413; P ≤ .001). Of 75 flap complications, 43 (13.9%) were deemed major complications (24 diabetic patients [22.9%] and 19 nondiabetic patients [9.3%], P ≤ .001). This statistical association was further confirmed by multivariate analysis (odds ratio, 2.885; P = .002).
CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes mellitus increases the risk of the development of free flap complications in elderly patients when dealing with oral reconstruction after tumor removal."
25443387,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25443387/,"OBJECTIVES: Obesity is a national epidemic that imposes direct medical and indirect economic costs on society. Recent scholarly inquiries contend that obesity also contributes to global warming. The paper investigates the relationship between greenhouse gas emissions and obesity.
STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional state-level data for the year 2010.
METHODS: Multiple regression analysis using least squares with bootstrapped standard errors and quantile regression.
RESULTS: States with higher rates of obesity are associated with higher CO2 and CH4 emissions (p < 0.05) and marginally associated with higher N2O emissions (p < 0.10), net of other factors. Reverting to the obesity rates of the year 2000 across the entire United States could decrease greenhouse gas emissions by about two percent, representing more than 136 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent.
CONCLUSIONS: Future studies should establish clear causality between obesity and emissions by using longitudinal data while controlling for other relevant factors. They should also consider identifying means to net out the potential effects of carbon sinks, conversion of CH4 to energy, cross-state diversion, disposal, and transfer of municipal solid waste, and potentially lower energy consumption from increased sedentariness."
25443560,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25443560/,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the percentage of patients that fulfill the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1990 as well as the ACR 2010 classification criteria, to evaluate whether there is a correlation between tender points and the Widespread Pain Index (WPI) as well as signs and symptoms that predict a fibromyalgia (FM) subtype and to identify those which have greater impact on functioning.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional comparative study of 206 patients with previous clinical diagnosis of FM. The studied variables were age, sex, years of disease, tender points, control points, WPI, Symptom Severity Score, subtype of FM, presence of other rheumatic disorders and the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) score.
RESULTS: The new diagnostic criteria of FM correctly classified 87,03% of patients who satisfied the ACR 1990 criteria. Both criteria were equally effective in assessing the impact of the disease. FM had a severe impact on the quality of life in 74,87% of patients. Somatoform disorder was the predominant subtype. Hyperalgesic FM had a significantly lower FIQ score than the somatoform disorder and depressive subtypes.
CONCLUSION: The ACR 2010 criteria are a simple evaluation tool to use in the primary care setting, that incorporate both peripheral pain and somatic symptoms. New and old criteria should coexist; they enable a major comprehension and ease the management of this prevalent disease."
25443752,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25443752/,"OBJECTIVE: The glossopharyngeal insufflation maneuver (lung packing) is largely performed by competitive breath-hold divers to improve their performance, despite observational evidence of fainting and loss of consciousness in the first seconds of apnea.
METHODS: We describe here the time course of hemodynamic changes, induced by breath-holding with and without lung packing, in 2 world-class apnea competitors.
RESULTS: When compared with apnea performed after a deep breath (100% vital capacity), lung packing leads to a decrease in cardiac output, blood pressure, and cerebral blood flow during the first seconds after the beginning of apnea. The major hemodynamic disorders were observed in diver 1, who exhibited the greater increase in pulmonary volume after lung packing (+22% for diver 1 vs +10% for diver 2). After the initial drop in both cardiac output and blood pressure, the time course of hemodynamic alterations became quite similar between the two apneas.
CONCLUSIONS: Some recommendations, such as limiting the number of maneuvers and performing lung packing in the supine position, should be expressed to avoid injuries secondary to the use of glossopharyngeal insufflation."
25443917,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25443917/,"OBJECTIVE: To quantitate the risk of clinically significant renal function deterioration after radical cystectomy (RC), which could result in supratherapeutic levels of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and increased risk of bleeding events with the use of extended pharmacologic venous thromboembolism prophylaxis (EPVTEP) after hospital discharge.
METHODS: Patients undergoing RC between 2006 and 2011 were identified from the institutional registry. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated and categorized as preoperative, discharge, and nadir. Perioperative eGFR trends in patients who would have been candidates for EPVTEP were evaluated.
RESULTS: Three hundred four patients with eGFR >30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) at the time of hospital discharge were included in the analysis as potentially eligible for EPVTEP. Large portion of patients (43%) exhibited decline in eGFR after discharge. Importantly, 13.0% of patients (n = 40), who would have qualified for EPVTEP at discharge, experienced nadir GFR below the 30-mL/min/1.73 m(2) threshold value at which LMWH would have become supratherapeutic. The odds ratio for developing a GFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) was 9.1 (95% confidence interval, 4.3-19.3; P <.001), comparing those with a discharge GFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) with those with a discharge GFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2).
CONCLUSION: More than 10% experienced an eGFR, which would have rendered LMWH supratherapeutic and potentially would have placed the patient at risk for clinically significant bleeding. Although postoperative venous thromboembolic event after RC is a recognized concern, a better understanding of the risks of EPVTEP is needed before this strategy is universally adopted in patients undergoing RC."
25444028,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25444028/,"BACKGROUND: Delayed hematoma expansion is common in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) patients using warfarin. Dabigatran induces fewer hemorrhagic complications compared with warfarin. However, the natural history of dabigatran-related ICH remains unclear. This study aims to clarify whether dabigatran increases the risk of delayed hematoma expansion in a rat ICH model.
METHODS: Male Wistar rats were treated with 2 dosages of dabigatran etexilate (DE: 10 mg/kg, n = 4; 20 mg/kg, n = 3) 30 minutes before ICH induction using intraparenchymal collagenase infusion. Five rats that received saline were used as controls. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed 24 and 48 hours after ICH induction, and serial hematoma volume measurements were obtained using T2-weighted images. Expanded hematoma volumes were calculated by subtracting hematoma volumes at 48 hours from those at 24 hours; the hematoma expansion rate was defined as the ratio of the expanded hematoma volume to that at 24 hours.
RESULTS: The mean hematoma volumes (mm(3)) at 24 hours were 13.3 ± 3.3 in the control group, 14.9 ± 2.0 in the 10 mg/kg DE group, and 18.9 ± 7.6 in the 20 mg/kg DE group with no significant intergroup differences (P = .26). The mean hematoma volumes at 48 hours (mm(3)) were 21.7 ± 4.9 in the control group, 22.1 ± 5.0 in the 10 mg/kg DE group, and 23.4 ± 5.8 in the 20 mg/kg DE group with no significant intergroup differences (P = .90). Consequently, there were no significant intergroup differences in the hematoma expansion rates (P = .33).
CONCLUSIONS: This experimental study of a rat ICH model indicates that dabigatran-related ICH may not increase the risk of delayed hematoma expansion."
25444439,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25444439/,"INTRODUCTION: There is an average of 25 cases of penile cancer in the Republic of Ireland each year. Due to the low volume of cases, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence recommends that treatment is centralised to allow the best standardised treatment for primary tumours and nodal disease.
OBJECTIVES: To determine whether outcomes for patients with penile cancer differed significantly between secondary and tertiary referral centres in the Republic of Ireland.
METHODS: Between 2001 and 2014, 36 patients were treated in the Mercy University Hospital (MUH) with penile cancer. Twenty patients were treated primarily in MUH and 16 patients underwent initial management in a secondary referral centre (SRC) with subsequent referral to the MUH. A retrospective matched case-control study was performed on this patient cohort.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in length of follow-up or risk factors for the development of penile cancer between both groups (p = 0.6 and p = 0.5 respectively) Ultimately, the incidence of high risk disease, nodal metasases, high grade disease and pelvic lymph node dissection were significantly greater in patients that were initially managed in a SRC (p = 0.02, p = 0.03, p = 0.004 and p = 0.028 respectively). Patients undergoing initial treatment in a SRC had a non-significantly reduced rate of cancer specific survival (88 Vs 66%, MUH Vs SRCs, p = 0.495) and recurrence free survival (85 Vs 46%, MUH Vs SRCs, p = 0.24).
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that managing penile cancer in special interest centres may improve oncological outcome."
25444572,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25444572/,"BACKGROUND: Identification of the risk of recurrent falls is complex in older adults. The aim of this study was to examine the efficiency of 3 artificial neural networks (ANNs: multilayer perceptron [MLP], modified MLP, and neuroevolution of augmenting topologies [NEAT]) for the classification of recurrent fallers and nonrecurrent fallers using a set of clinical characteristics corresponding to risk factors of falls measured among community-dwelling older adults.
METHODS: Based on a cross-sectional design, 3289 community-dwelling volunteers aged 65 and older were recruited. Age, gender, body mass index (BMI), number of drugs daily taken, use of psychoactive drugs, diphosphonate, calcium, vitamin D supplements and walking aid, fear of falling, distance vision score, Timed Up and Go (TUG) score, lower-limb proprioception, handgrip strength, depressive symptoms, cognitive disorders, and history of falls were recorded. Participants were separated into 2 groups based on the number of falls that occurred over the past year: 0 or 1 fall and 2 or more falls. In addition, total population was separated into training and testing subgroups for ANN analysis.
RESULTS: Among 3289 participants, 18.9% (n = 622) were recurrent fallers. NEAT, using 15 clinical characteristics (ie, use of walking aid, fear of falling, use of calcium, depression, use of vitamin D supplements, female, cognitive disorders, BMI <21 kg/m(2), number of drugs daily taken >4, vision score <8, use of psychoactive drugs, lower-limb proprioception score ≤5, TUG score >9 seconds, handgrip strength score ≤29 (N), and age ≥75 years), showed the best efficiency for identification of recurrent fallers, sensitivity (80.42%), specificity (92.54%), positive predictive value (84.38), negative predictive value (90.34), accuracy (88.39), and Cohen κ (0.74), compared with MLP and modified MLP.

25444573,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25444573/,"OBJECTIVES: Dehydration in older adults contributes to increased morbidity and mortality during hospitalization. As such, early diagnosis of dehydration may improve patient outcome and reduce the burden on healthcare. This prospective study investigated the diagnostic accuracy of routinely used physical signs, and noninvasive markers of hydration in urine and saliva.
DESIGN: Prospective diagnostic accuracy study.
SETTING: Hospital acute medical care unit and emergency department.
PARTICIPANTS: One hundred thirty older adults [59 males, 71 females, mean (standard deviation) age = 78 (9) years].
MEASUREMENTS: Participants with any primary diagnosis underwent a hydration assessment within 30 minutes of admittance to hospital. Hydration assessment comprised 7 physical signs of dehydration [tachycardia (>100 bpm), low systolic blood pressure (<100 mm Hg), dry mucous membrane, dry axilla, poor skin turgor, sunken eyes, and long capillary refill time (>2 seconds)], urine color, urine specific gravity, saliva flow rate, and saliva osmolality. Plasma osmolality and the blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio were assessed as reference standards of hydration with 21% of participants classified with water-loss dehydration (plasma osmolality >295 mOsm/kg), 19% classified with water-and-solute-loss dehydration (blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio >20), and 60% classified as euhydrated.
RESULTS: All physical signs showed poor sensitivity (0%-44%) for detecting either form of dehydration, with only low systolic blood pressure demonstrating potential utility for aiding the diagnosis of water-and-solute-loss dehydration [diagnostic odds ratio (OR) = 14.7]. Neither urine color, urine specific gravity, nor saliva flow rate could discriminate hydration status (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.49-0.57, P > .05). In contrast, saliva osmolality demonstrated moderate diagnostic accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.76, P < .001) to distinguish both dehydration types (70% sensitivity, 68% specificity, OR = 5.0 (95% confidence interval 1.7-15.1) for water-loss dehydration, and 78% sensitivity, 72% specificity, OR = 8.9 (95% confidence interval 2.5-30.7) for water-and-solute-loss dehydration).
CONCLUSIONS: With the exception of low systolic blood pressure, which could aid in the specific diagnosis of water-and-solute-loss dehydration, physical signs and urine markers show little utility to determine if an elderly patient is dehydrated. Saliva osmolality demonstrated superior diagnostic accuracy compared with physical signs and urine markers, and may have utility for the assessment of both water-loss and water-and-solute-loss dehydration in older individuals. It is particularly noteworthy that saliva osmolality was able to detect water-and-solute-loss dehydration, for which a measurement of plasma osmolality would have no diagnostic utility."
25444630,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25444630/,"OBJECTIVE: To report our experience with different approaches for management of pouch stones in children with ileal-based urinary reservoir.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Charts of children who underwent ileal-based urinary reservoirs between 2000 and 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients who were diagnosed with reservoir calculi were identified; medical records were reviewed for patients' demographics, diversion details, stone criteria, mode of treatment, perioperative complications, and recurrence rate.
RESULTS: We identified 26 children with pouch stones after urinary diversion. There were 11 boys (42%) and 15 girls (58%). Mean age was 11 years (range, 4-16 years). Mean time for diagnosis was 42 months (24-120 months). Pouch stones were asymptomatic in 10 patients (38%). Fifteen cases were postbladder augmentation and 11 cases postcontinent cutaneous diversion. The mean stone size was 4 cm (range, 1-10 cm), and mean Hounsfield Unit was 585 (205-1090). Seventeen children (65%) had positive urine culture result, whereas 9 children were sterile. Seven children (27%) required open poucholithotomy, whereas 19 patients (73%) were managed endoscopically. Percutaneous approach was done in 5 children, whereas urethral access was used in 7 children. Mechanical extraction was performed in 12 cases, and stone disintegration was required in 7 cases. Eight children developed stone recurrence. Mean time for recurrence was 11 months (range, 3-19 months). Six children were after endoscopic disintegration, and all required redo endoscopic extraction. Stone analysis was available in 15 patients (struvite stones in 10 cases and calcium phosphate in 5 cases).
CONCLUSION: Pouch stones are established long-term complication of urinary diversion. Open and endoscopic approaches are valid treatment strategies."

DESIGN: Cross-sectional.
METHODS: Sixty-six individuals, 5-12 years following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, with (n=30) and without (n=36) knee osteoarthritis were included. Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score quality-of-life question (Q3), assessed knee confidence and Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia assessed kinesiophobia. In the osteoarthritis group, knee-related symptoms (International Knee Documentation Committee and Anterior Knee Pain Scale), self-reported function (Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score activities daily living), sport/recreation (Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score-sport and recreation), and performance-based function (hopping, one leg rise tasks) were assessed. Between-group differences in knee confidence and kinesiophobia were evaluated with the Chi square test and analysis of variance, respectively. In the osteoarthritis group, between-group differences (none, mild/moderate and severe/extreme problems with knee confidence) in kinesiophobia, symptoms and function were determined with analysis of variances: p<0.05.
RESULTS: Following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, participants with knee osteoarthritis had significantly worse knee confidence (p=0.010) and greater kinesiophobia (p=0.006) than those without osteoarthritis. In those with knee osteoarthritis, poorer knee confidence was significantly associated with worse symptoms (Anterior Knee Pain Scale, p=0.001; International Knee Documentation Committee, p<0.001), kinesiophobia (p=0.030), Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score-activities of daily living (p=0.005), Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score-sport and recreation (p=0.001), single-leg hop (p=0.011), side-to-side hop (p=0.013) and one leg rise (p=0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Psychological impairments are evident in people with knee osteoarthritis following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, compared to those without. Future studies should further investigate the psychological impairments associated with knee osteoarthritis after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction."
25444953,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25444953/,"PURPOSE: We evaluated whether stress levels in children and parents during radiological evaluation after febrile urinary tract infection are really lower using the top-down approach, where (99m)technetium dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scintigraphy is used initially, than the bottom-up approach, where voiding cystourethrography is initially performed and repeated examinations are easier for all.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively evaluated 120 children 3 to 8 years old. Pain ratings were obtained using the Faces Pain Scale-Revised, and conversation during the procedure was evaluated using the Child-Adult Medical Procedure Interaction Scale-Revised by 2 independent observers. To evaluate parental anxiety, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory form was also completed. Following a documented febrile urinary tract infection children were randomized to the top-down or bottom-up group. A third group of 44 children undergoing repeat voiding cystourethrography and their parents were also evaluated.
RESULTS: Child ratings of pain using the Faces Pain Scale-Revised were not significantly different between the top-down group following (99m)technetium dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scintigraphy (2.99 on a scale of 10) and the bottom-up group following voiding cystourethrography (3.21). Also the Faces Pain Scale-Revised was not significantly different in the repeat voiding cystourethrography group (3.35). On the Child-Adult Medical Procedure Interaction Scale-Revised there was negative correlation between child coping and child distress, as well as rate of child distress and adult coping promoting behavior. Parental state anxiety scores were significantly less in the top-down and repeat voiding cystourethrography groups than in the bottom-up group.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the top-down approach and repeat voiding cystourethrography cause less anxiety for caregivers, these values do not correlate to pain scale in children. This finding might be due to lack of appropriate evaluation tools of pediatric pain and anxiety. However, the theory that the top-down approach is less invasive, and thus less stressful, requires further research. The Child-Adult Medical Procedure Interaction Scale-Revised data indicate that influences in adult-child interaction are bidirectional."
25445470,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25445470/,"BACKGROUND: We investigated the clinical relevance of classic and new prognostic markers, immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable (IGHV) gene mutational status, and chromosomal abnormalities in clinical monoclonal B lymphocytosis (cMBL) compared with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) Rai stage 0.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed the clinical outcomes in terms of the time to the first treatment (TTFT) of a prospective cohort, including 125 patients with cMBL and 197 patients with CLL Rai stage 0.
RESULTS: In the overall patient population, prognostic parameters such as IGHV gene mutational status (P < .0001), CD38 expression (P < .0001), 70-kDa zeta-associated protein (ZAP-70) expression (P < .0001), and cytogenetic abnormalities (P = .01) predicted for TTFT on univariate analysis. IGHV gene identity was significant on multivariate analysis (P < .0001), regardless of the B-cell cutoff (5.0 or 10 × 10(9) B cells/L). A prognostic stratification using the combination of IGHV mutational status and absolute B-cell lymphocytosis identified 3 different groups that were significantly different with respect to the TTFT (P < .0001).
CONCLUSION: In the present series of patients with cMBL and CLL Rai stage 0, we have confirmed that IGHV mutation status appeared to be the best predictor of TTFT. In addition, when associated with the B-cell count, IGHV mutational status might help to better stratify patients into more precise subgroups."
25445835,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25445835/,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine whether the lateralization distance causes differences in the flattening ratio of the natal cleft, early complications, or recurrence rates in patients with sacrococcygeal pilonidal sinus disease undergoing the modified Limberg flap.
METHODS: This clinical study was conducted from March 2012 to April 2013. Forty patients with sacrococcygeal pilonidal sinus disease were divided into two groups of 20 patients, each according to the lateralization distance of the lower part of the Limberg flap incision (Group I, 1 cm lateralized; Group II, 2 cm lateralized). Early wound complications, recurrence rates, and the flattening ratio of the natal cleft were evaluated.
RESULTS: No statistically significant differences in operating time (mean 42.2 ± 5.7 and 42.3 ± 6.4 min, respectively; p = 0.855), drain removal time [median 3 (range 2-10) and 4 (range 2-14) days, respectively; p = 0.1], or length of hospitalization [median 1 (range 1-3) and 1 (range 1-4) days, respectively; p = 0.775] were found between the groups. The mean follow-up period was 12.8 ± 3.7 months. Recurrence was observed in only one patient of Group II. There were no statistically significant differences in the flattening ratio of the natal cleft, overall wound complications, or recurrence between the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: No statistically significant differences in early complications or recurrence rates were found between the two different lateralization distances in the modified Limberg flap procedure. Therefore, we conclude that 1-cm lateralization of the lower part of the incision is sufficient."
25446195,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25446195/,"OBJECTIVE: It is aimed to evaluate whether there is a difference in regional cerebral saturation of newborns measured by near infrared spectroscopy born either by general anesthesia or combined spinal epidural anesthesia during elective cesarean deliveries.
METHODS: After approval from the ethics committee of our hospital, and informed consents of the parturients were taken, 68 patients were included in the study. The regional cerebral oxygen saturations (RcSO2) of newborns were measured by near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measurements at 1st, 5th min after birth. In group I (n=32), general anesthesia was performed for the cesarean operation and in group II (n=36), combined spinal epidural anesthesia (CSEA) was the anesthetic management. The age of the mother, gestation, the problems related to the pregnancy, heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation (SpO2) of the mother had been recorded. The measurements of the newborn were; SpO2 of right hand, RcSO2 measured by NIRS, the delivery time (from incision to the cessation of circulation in the placental cord), Apgar score. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, California) and presented as mean +/- SD. Results obtained in different groups were compared using upaired t-test. Differences were statistically significant at p < 0.05.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the groups related to the mother's age, gestation week and baseline blood pressure. Both the systolic and diastolic blood pressures measured at 1st and 5th min after induction or start of the spinal block were significantly lower in the mothers who had undergone combined spinal epidural anesthesia. The heart rates of the mothers who had been under CSEA were significantly higher than the general anesthesia group. The Apgar at the 1st min were observed significantly higher in Group II. Oxygen saturation of the newborns were significantly higher in Group II. Regional cerebral oxygenation measured by NIRS were significantly higher in CSEA group.
CONCLUSION: Combined spinal epidural anesthesia, besides other known advantages, had been shown to be superior to general anesthesia as a means of regional cerebral oxygenation of the newborns."
25446480,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25446480/,"BACKGROUND: The splintering of general surgery into subspecialties in the past decade has brought into question the relevance of a continued emphasis on traditional general surgical training. With the majority of trainees now expressing a preference to subspecialise early, this study sought to identify if the requirement for proficiency in managing general surgical conditions has reduced over the past decade through comparison of general and specialty surgical admissions at a tertiary referral center.
METHODS: A cross-sectional review of all surgical admissions at Cork University Hospital was performed at three individual time points: 2002, 2007 & 2012. Basic demographic details of both elective & emergency admissions were tabulated & analysed. Categorisation of admissions into specialty relevant or general surgery was made using International guidelines.
RESULTS: 11,288 surgical admissions were recorded (2002:2773, 2007:3498 & 2012:5017), showing an increase of 81 % over the 10-year period. While growth in overall service provision was seen, the practice of general versus specialty relevant emergency surgery showed no statistically significant change in practice from 2002 to 2012 (p = 0.87). General surgery was mostly practiced in the emergency setting (84 % of all emergency admissions in 2012) with only 28 % elective admissions for general surgery. A reduction in length of stay was seen in both elective (3.62-2.58 bed days, p = 0.342) & emergency admissions (7.36-5.65, p = 0.026).
CONCLUSIONS: General surgical emergency work continues to constitute a major part of the specialists practice. These results emphasize the importance of general surgical training even for those trainees committed to sub-specialisation."

STUDY DESIGN: The study is a literature review and a retrospective analysis of clinical, radiographic, microscopic, and immunohistochemical features of five new cases of this condition.
RESULTS: The lesion has a predilection for the mandible in adults of variable ages, with the potential to become very large and destructive; however, it has a very low recurrence rate, if any, following surgical curettage.
CONCLUSION: We suggest that the ""central xanthoma of the jaws"" be considered a unique, although rare, clinicopathologic entity. It is unclear whether this lesion is a benign neoplastic process or a persistent reactive process."
25446598,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25446598/,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: This study examined how people classify plants in terms of their taste and smell, and how those organoleptic properties influence the differential use of medicinal plants for treating different diseases.
METHODS: We conducted an ethnobotanical survey of household heads in the community of Sucruiu, located in Barreiras, Bahia, Brazil. The head of each family was questioned concerning their knowledge and use of medicinal plants, as well as the therapeutic indications (TIs), taste, and smell of each plant. We then tested for associations between the therapeutic indications and taste attributes of various plants using the Chi-squared test on a contingency table with Monte Carlo simulations. The same analysis was performed for associations between TIs and smell.
RESULTS: The study participants provided more details when classifying tastes than when classifying smells. We considered only the most cited TIs and attributes, and found significant associations between both taste and therapeutic indications (p<0.001) and smell and therapeutic indications (p<0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that the taste and smell of a plant can influence its differential medicinal use, since plants with certain tastes and smells prevailed in the treatment of distinct diseases. However, our results are valid only for the most popular TIs and organoleptic attributes."
25446609,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25446609/,"PURPOSE: Previous reports have suggested that anemia increases rates of recurrence after radiation therapy for cervical cancer. However, these studies may not have fully corrected for confounding risk factors. Using a well-characterized cohort of cervical cancer patients, we examined the association between anemia and outcomes before and after the introduction of chemoradiation as standard of care.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: We reviewed the records of 2454 patients who underwent definitive radiation therapy from 1980 through 2011. Minimum hemoglobin level (Hgbmin) was recorded for 2359 patients (96%). Endpoints included freedom from central recurrence (FFCR), freedom from distant metastasis (FFDM), and disease-specific survival (DSS).
RESULTS: For the entire cohort, hemoglobin concentrations of 9, 10, and 12 g/dL before and during radiation were all significantly associated with FFCR, FFDM, and DSS (all P<.001) on univariate analysis. However, on multivariate analysis, only Hgbmin less than 10 g/dL during RT (RT-Hgb<10) remained significant, and it was correlated with lower DSS (P=.02, hazard ratio [HR] = 1.28) and FFDM (P=.03, HR = 1.33) but not with FFCR. In a subset analysis of patients receiving chemoradiation (n=678), RT-Hgb<10 was associated only with DSS (P=.008, HR = 1.49), not with FFCR or FFDM. In this subgroup, despite an association between RT-Hgb<10 and DSS, the use of transfusion was not correlated with benefit.
CONCLUSIONS: No evidence was found supporting anemia as an independent predictor of central recurrence in patients treated with definitive radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy. Less emphasis on correcting anemia in cervical cancer patients may be warranted."
25446667,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25446667/,"OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate the association between fetal cerebroplacental ratio (CPR) and intrapartum fetal compromise and admission to the neonatal unit (NNU) in term pregnancies.
STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective cohort study in a single tertiary referral center over a 14-year period from 2000 through 2013. The umbilical artery pulsatility index, middle cerebral artery pulsatility index, and CPR were recorded within 2 weeks of delivery. The birthweight (BW) values were converted into centiles and Doppler parameters converted into multiples of median (MoM), adjusting for gestational age using reference ranges. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify, and adjust for, potential confounders.
RESULTS: The study cohort included 9772 singleton pregnancies. The rates of operative delivery for presumed fetal compromise and neonatal admission were 17.2% and 3.9%, respectively. Doppler CPR MoM was significantly lower in pregnancies requiring operative delivery or admission to NNU for presumed fetal compromise (P < .01). On multivariate logistic regression, both CPR MoM and BW centile were independently associated with the risk of operative delivery for presumed fetal compromise (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52-0.87; P = .003 and adjusted OR, 0.994; 95% CI, 0.992-0.997; P < .001, respectively). The latter associations persisted even after exclusion of small-for-gestational-age cases from the cohort. Multivariate logistic regression also demonstrated that CPR MoM was an independent predictor for NNU admission at term (adjusted OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.33-0.92; P = .021), while BW centile was not (adjusted OR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.99-1.00; P = .794). The rates of operative delivery for presumed fetal compromise were significantly higher for appropriate-for-gestational-age fetuses with low CPR MoM (22.3%) compared to small-for-gestational-age fetuses with normal CPR MoM (17.3%).
CONCLUSION: Lower fetal CPR, regardless of the fetal size, was independently associated with the need for operative delivery for presumed fetal compromise and with NNU admission at term. The extent to which fetal hemodynamic status could be used to predict perinatal morbidity and optimize the mode of delivery merits further investigation."
25447749,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25447749/,"INTRODUCTION: In spatial neglect, the functional benefit of rehabilitation methods is subject to debate. A few studies have reported that galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) is efficacious in spatial neglect. The objective of the present study was to establish whether the effects of GVS persist after the end of stimulation.
MATERIALS: Four patients with pathological rightward deviation in a bisection task at least three months after right hemisphere stroke. A single-blind, randomized crossover design was used to assess the effects of GVS on performance in line bisection and star cancellation tasks under three different conditions (cathode-right, cathode-left and sham stimulation).
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the performance of either task following GVS (relative to sham stimulation).
CONCLUSION: Galvanic vestibular stimulation did not reduce spatial neglect symptoms in any of the stimulation conditions. Further studies are necessary to understand the disparity between our results and those reported in the literature. Repeated sessions, a higher current intensity and/or alternating-current stimulation may improve this method before it can be used clinically."
25448312,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25448312/,"OBJECTIVE: Communication skills can be trained alongside clinical reasoning, history taking or clinical examination skills. This is advocated as a solution to the low transfer of communication skills. Still, students have to integrate the knowledge/skills acquired during different curriculum parts in patient consultations at some point. How do medical students experience these integrated consultations within a simulated environment and in real practice when dealing with responsibility?
METHODS: Six focus groups were conducted with (pre-)/clerkship students.
RESULTS: Students were motivated to practice integrated consultations with simulated patients and felt like 'real physicians'. However, their focus on medical problem solving drew attention away from improving their communication skills. Responsibility for real patients triggered students' identity development. This identity formation guided the development of an own consultation style, a process that was hampered by conflicting demands of role models.
CONCLUSION: Practicing complete consultations results in the dilemma of prioritizing medical problem solving above attention for patient communication. Integrated consultation training advances this dilemma to the pre-clerkship period. During clerkships this dilemma is heightened because real patients trigger empathy and responsibility, which invites students to define their role as doctor.
PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: When training integrated consultations, educators should pay attention to students' learning priorities and support the development of students' professional identity."

METHODS: A cost-effectiveness decision model was constructed using recently published results from a Gynecologic Oncology Group phase III study, comparing a standard chemotherapy regimen (Chemo) to the experimental regimen (Chemo + Bev) consisting of the standard regimen+bevacizumab. Costs and adverse events were incorporated and sensitivity analyses assessed model uncertainties.
RESULTS: The cost of Chemo + Bev was $53,784 compared to $5,688 for the Chemo arm. The 3.7 month OS advantage with Chemo+Bev came at an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $155K per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Chemo + Bev becomes cost-effective with an ICER ≤ $100K in sensitivity analysis when the cost of bevacizumab is discounted >37.5% or the dose is reduced from 15 to 7.5 mg/kg, an effective dose in ovarian cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: With an ICER of $155K/QALY, the addition of bevacizumab to standard chemotherapy approaches common cost-effectiveness standards. Moderately discounting the cost of bevacizumab or using a smaller dose significantly alters its affordability."
25448493,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25448493/,"INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: To determine the correlation between levator ani deficiency (LAD) and urethral sphincter complex measurements as visualized on 3D endovaginal ultrasonography, and to compare the LAD score with continence status.
METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of patients seen at our institution between January 2011 and August 2013. Patients were dichotomized into those with urodynamic stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and those with no SUI. Levator ani status was evaluated using a validated scoring system yielding scores of 0 - 6 (normal levator ani/mild LAD), 7 - 12 (moderate LAD), and 13 - 18 (severe LAD). The length, horizontal diameter, and cross-sectional area of the urethra, and the length, width, and the area of the rhabdomyosphincter and smooth muscle sphincter were likewise measured using 3D ultrasound volumes.
RESULTS: Of the 80 patients included, 54 (67.5%) had SUI and 26 (32.5%) were continent. 18 (22.5%) had evidence of mild LAD, 54 (67.5%) had moderate LAD, and 8 (10.0%) had severe LAD. Among patients with SUI, those with normal levator ani muscles or mild LAD had greater urethral smooth muscle width than those with moderate and severe LAD (p = 0.0238). A greater proportion of patients with SUI also had moderate to severe LAD than continent patients (p = 0.0177, OR 3.59, 95% CI 1.21 - 10.65). There was no difference in LAD distribution by type of stress incontinence (presence or absence of intrinsic sphincter deficiency; p =  .2377).
CONCLUSIONS: LAD and urethral sphincter complex status, as visualized on 3D ultrasonography, are independent factors. Moderate to severe LAD is more prevalent in patients with SUI."
25448655,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25448655/,"INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical outcomes between 2 groups of elderly rectal cancer patients according to the time duration after which their diverting stoma can be reversed.
METHODS: We recruited 124 patients who were ≥65 years old and had undergone diverting stoma after rectal cancer surgery. In Group 1, the reversal of the stoma was predominantly performed after the sixth adjuvant chemotherapy. In Group 2, the reversal was predominantly performed after the third adjuvant chemotherapy.
RESULTS: The mean duration for which patients had a stoma was 28.6 ± 9.9 weeks in Group 1 and 17.1 ± 7.4 weeks in Group 2. The interval between stoma formation and stoma formation-related complications was slightly longer in Group 1 than in Group 2 (13.5 ± 9.7 vs. 8.0 ± 4.9 weeks, p = 0.075). There were 16 stoma-related complications in Group 1 (23.2%) and 10 in Group 2 (18.2%) (p = 0.516). There were 6 stoma closure-related complications in Group 1 (8.8%) and 6 in Group 2 (10.9%) (p = 0.766).
DISCUSSION: This study shows that stoma closure during adjuvant chemotherapy is no more harmful than stoma closure after termination of adjuvant chemotherapy.
CONCLUSION: It may be possible to limit the duration of diverting stoma following rectal cancer surgery, even if patients are elderly and undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy."
25448673,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25448673/,"INTRODUCTION: Management of the immunosuppressed patient with diverticular disease remains controversial. We report the largest series of colon cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and hospitalized for acute diverticulitis, to determine whether recent treatment with systemic chemotherapy is associated with increased risk for/increased severity of recurrent diverticulitis.
METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of adult patients hospitalized for an initial episode of acute colonic diverticulitis at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 1988-2004. Outcomes in patients receiving systemic chemotherapy within one month of admission for diverticulitis (""Chemo"") were compared to outcomes of patients not receiving chemotherapy within the past month (""No-chemo"").
RESULTS: A total 131 patients met inclusion criteria. Chemo patients did not differ significantly from No-chemo group in terms of severity of acute diverticulitis at index admission (13.2% vs. 4.4%, respectively, p = 0.12), resumption of chemotherapy (median 2 months), failure of non-operative management (13.2% vs 4.4%, respectively, p = 0.12), frequency of recurrence (20.5% vs 18.5%), hospital length of stay (p = 0.08), and likelihood of interval resection (24.0% vs. 16.2%, respectively, p = 0.39). Chemo patients recurred with more severe disease, were more likely to undergo emergent surgery (75.0% vs. 23.5%, respectively, p = 0.03), and were more likely to be diverted (100.0% vs. 25.0%, respectively, p = 0.03). Chemo patients were significantly more likely to incur a postoperative complication (100% vs 9.1% p < 0.01) following interval resection. Overall mortality was significantly higher in the Chemo vs. No-chemo group. Median survival in Chemo patients was 3.4 years; in No-chemo patients, median survival was not reached at 10 years.
CONCLUSION: Our data do not support routine elective surgery for acute diverticulitis in patients receiving chemotherapy. Non-operative management in the acute or interval setting appears preferable whenever possible."

AIM: To assess the validity of fluorescence diagnosis (FD) in the measurement of response to therapy in early MF, using in comparison flow cytometric technique of skin biopsies for CD4+/CD7- malignant T-cell count before and after therapy.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-two patients of histologically proven early MF (stages Ia, Ib, IIa) were subjected to fluorescence diagnosis of their most affected skin lesion before and after 12 weeks of phototherapy with or without combination therapy. In comparison flow cytometric assessment of skin biopsies for CD4+/CD7- malignant T-cell count was evaluated before and after therapy from skin biopsy of the same lesion.
RESULTS: All tested MF lesions showed varying degrees of fluorescence by FD at week zero, with a mean accumulation factor (AF), which is the fluorescence ratio between the tumor tissue and normal skin, of 2.2. After 12 weeks of therapy, the mean AF showed significant reduction to 1.94 (p=0.009). The percent of CD4+/CD7- cells dropped significantly after treatment (p=0.029). No correlation between CD4+/CD7- cell counts and the mean AF could be deduced.
CONCLUSION: In cases of mycosis fungoides, fluorescence diagnosis can represent an effective tool for evaluating the response to therapy. Changes in accumulation factor values can be used for follow-up of therapy in the same patient, but it should not be used as an absolute value."
25449196,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25449196/,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze whether frequent overhead-sports activity increases the risk for rotator cuff disease in patients with spinal cord injuries (SCIs) who are wheelchair dependent.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study, risk analysis.
SETTING: Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Trauma Surgery and Spinal Cord Injury.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients (N=296) with SCI requiring the full-time use of a manual wheelchair were recruited for this study. The total population was divided into 2 groups (sports vs no sports), among them 103 patients playing overhead sports on a regular basis (at least 1-2 times/wk) and 193 patients involved in overhead sports less than once a week or in no sports activity at all. The mean age of the sports group was 49.1 years. The mean duration of wheelchair dependence was 26.5 years. The mean age of the no-sports group was 48 years. The mean duration of wheelchair dependence was 25.2 years. Each individual completed a questionnaire designed to identify overhead-sports activity on a regular basis and was asked about shoulder problems. Magnetic resonance imaging scans of both shoulders were performed in each patient and analyzed in a standardized fashion.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Possible differences in continuous data between patients with and without rotator cuff tear were evaluated. The relative risk of suffering from a rotator cuff tear between patients playing overhead sports and those not playing overhead sports was calculated.
RESULTS: One hundred three patients played overhead sports regularly and 193 did not. There was no difference between groups regarding age, sex, level of SCI, and duration of wheelchair dependence. The body mass index was significantly lower in the sports group than in the no-sports group (P<.0001). A rotator cuff tear was present in 75.7% of the patients in the sports group and in 36.3% of the patients in the no-sports group (P<.0001). Rotator cuff tears were symptomatic in 92.6% of the patients. The estimated risk increase for the sports group to develop rotator cuff tears was twice as high as for the no-sports group (95% confidence interval, 1.7-2.6; P<.001). Similar results were found for the neurological level of lesion (T2-7/<T7), where the estimated risk was about 2.3 times higher in patients with a high neurological level of lesion (T2-7) than in those with a low neurological level of lesion (<T7) (95% confidence interval, 1.82-3.04; P<.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Overhead-sports activities have been identified as an additional risk factor, along with age and duration of wheelchair dependence, for developing rotator cuff disease in patients with paraplegia. A high frequency of sports activity shows physiological benefits as well as improves the psychological status and quality of life in patients with SCI. The dilemma is how to increase physical activity to gain physiological and psychological health benefits without further increasing overuse of the upper extremities, particularly the shoulder, in patients with paraplegia. The data from this study may be helpful in elucidating the etiology of rotator cuff tear in athletes with paraplegia and in counseling patients with SCI regarding shoulder and upper extremity activity level and provide support for developing preventive strategies."

After detection, a referral is made to the Reporting Center for Child Abuse and Neglect (RCCAN). This study investigates whether implementing this Protocol will lead parents to avoid medical care.
METHOD: We compared the number of patients (for whom the Protocol applied) who attended the ED prior to implementation with those attending after implementation. We conducted telephone interviews (n = 14) with parents whose children were referred to the RCCAN to investigate their experience with the procedure.
RESULTS: We found no decline in the number of patients, included in the Protocol, visiting the ED during the 4 year implementation period (2008-2011). Most parents (n = 10 of the 14 interviewed) were positive and stated that they would, if necessary, re-attend the ED with the same complaints in the future.
CONCLUSION: ED nurses and doctors referring children based on parental characteristics do not have to fear losing these families as patients."
25449554,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25449554/,"OBJECTIVE: The proportion of circulating cell free DNA derived from the feto-placental unit (fetal fraction or FF) correlates with test success and interpretation reliability. Some fetal disorders are associated with systematically lower FF, sometimes resulting in noninformative results.
METHODS: We analyzed results from pregnancies tested in a nested case/control study derived from a cohort of 4664 high-risk pregnancies. Low FF was defined before and after adjusting for maternal weight and gestational age.
RESULTS: Compared with euploid pregnancies, the median FF was significantly higher in Down syndrome pregnancies (ratio 1.17) and significantly lower in trisomy 18 and triploid pregnancies (ratios 0.71 and 0.19, respectively). Among 2157 pregnancies tested, 13 (0.6%) had FF <3.0% (all noninformative), including three trisomy 18 and three triploidy fetuses. After adjustment, 16 pregnancies (0.7%) had FF <0.3 multiples of the median (six informative), including one trisomy 18 and three triploidy fetuses. Modeled positive predictive values for low and high-risk populations were 7% and 30%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Among women with noninformative results attributable to low FF, trisomy 18 and/or triploidy risk are sufficiently high to warrant offering additional assessments (e.g. ultrasound).

25449564,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25449564/,"OBJECTIVE: There is a lack of consistent data regarding gynecologic oncology (GO) patients and the use of neuraxial anesthesia for post-operative pain management. Our objective was to compare the use of continuous epidural infusion (CEI) as part of post-operative pain management to more traditional management schemes.
METHODS: GO patients undergoing laparotomy from July 1st, 2011 through July 31st, 2012 were identified. Patient demographic data and peri-operative details were abstracted from the medical record. The primary outcome was a mean patient visual analog pain score. Secondary outcomes included length of stay, post-operative urinary tract infection (UTI) and venous thromboembolic (VTE) events.
RESULTS: There were 237 laparotomies during the study time period. Fifty-six women had CEI for post-operative pain management and 181 did not. Patients with CEI had lower pain scores on POD #0 (3.8 vs 5.3, p < 0.01), #1 (2.6 vs 4.0, p < 0.01) and #2 (2.5 vs 3.5, p < 0.01) compared to women without CEI. There was no difference in the length of stay between those with and without CEI (103 vs 94 h, p = 0.32). Women with CEI did have a longer length of urinary catheterization (56 vs 26 h, p = 0.01) but not an increased rate of UTI (5.5% vs 1.8%, p = 0.24). There was a higher rate of post-operative VTE events among women with CEI (8.9% vs 1.7%, p = 0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: In this small series, GO patients undergoing laparotomy had improved post-operative pain control when their analgesia regimen included CEI. However, the higher rate of VTE events among CEI users is concerning and merits further investigation."
25449642,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25449642/,"PURPOSE: To study postoperative macular thickness fluctuations measured by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and to investigate a potential correlation among macular edema (ME) incidence, cumulative dissipated energy (CDE) released during phacoemulsification, and vitreoretinal interface status.
METHODS: This is a prospective, cross-sectional study of 106 cataract patients with no macular disorder who underwent phacoemulsification. Best-corrected visual acuity measurement, slit-lamp examination, OCT scans were performed preoperatively and 30 and 90 days postoperatively. The intraoperative parameters measured were CDE and total phacoemulsification time. The SD-OCT parameters assessed were central subfield thickness (CST), cube average thickness (CAT), cube macular volume, vitreoretinal interface status, and presence of cystoid or diffuse ME.
RESULTS: Four patients (3.8%) developed subclinical ME. Regarding ME, there was no significant difference between patients with presence or absence of posterior vitreous detachment (chi-square, p = 0.57), although 75% of ME cases were observed in patients with attached posterior vitreous. With regard to comparison between eyes with and without subclinical CME incidence, CDE (p = 0.05), phacoemulsification time (p = 0.001), CST at month 1 (p = 0.002), cube macular volume at month 1 (p = 0.039), and CAT at month 1 (p = 0.050) were significantly higher in the subclinical CME group.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that OCT macular thickness parameters increase significantly at first and third month postoperatively and that the incidence of pseudophakic ME can be affected by CDE."
25449982,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25449982/,"BACKGROUND: The incidence of end-stage renal disease is increasing most rapidly in patients aged older than 75 years. Meanwhile, their 5-year survival rate remains the lowest of any dialysis cohort. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the benefit of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) construction in octogenarians, as the data regarding the effects of age on fistula success are conflicting.
METHODS: Using our hemodialysis database, we performed a retrospective review of all AVFs placed between 1 November, 2007, and 17 July, 2013, in patients aged 80 years or older. Patient demographics, presence of catheters, time to first fistula use, fistula interventions, fistula patency, and time to patient death were all evaluated.
RESULTS: We placed 32 fistulas in 31 patients. Our average patient was 82-year-old, men (75%) and Caucasian (71%). Three patients were excluded, as they never required dialysis. One patient required 2 fistulas; the second fistula was excluded from analysis. Of the remaining 28 patients, 22 (78%) were used for hemodialysis and 19 (68%) required catheter-based dialysis before fistula use. The mean length of catheter use was 166 days, and the median time to first fistula use was 109 days. Primary functional patency was 51% at year 1 and 38% at year 2, respectively. Secondary patency was 75% at year 1 and year 2. Of the 22 patients, 17 (77%) required intervention to achieve or maintain patency. The median time to death was 26 months.
CONCLUSIONS: With substantial effort, successful fistula utilization can be achieved in an extremely elderly patient population. Our patients experienced significant catheter utilization and over 3 quarters required secondary interventions to achieve or maintain fistula utilization. Given this group's limited survival and the fact that 21% of their survival time was spent dialyzing with a catheter, the benefit of a functioning fistula to a patient older than 80 years can be questioned."
25450490,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25450490/,"OBJECTIVE: In Europe, the demand for informal care is high and will increase because of the ageing population. Although caregiving is intended to contribute to the care recipient's health, its effects on the health of older European caregivers are not yet clear. This study explores the association between providing informal personal care and the caregivers' health.
METHOD: Data were used from the longitudinal cohort (2004/2005-2010/2011) of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) (n=7858). Generalized estimating equations were used to explore the longitudinal association of informal care and the caregiver's health using poor self-rated health (less than good), poor mental health (EURO-D score for depression ≥4), and poor physical health (≥2 health complaints).
RESULTS: Providing informal personal care was significantly associated with poor mental health (OR=1.23, 95% CI=1.04-1.47) and poor physical health (OR=1.18, 95% CI=1.01-1.38), after adjusting for various socio-demographic and health-related factors. No statistical significant association was found for self-rated health in the adjusted models.
CONCLUSION: Providing informal personal care may negatively influence the caregiver's mental and physical health. More awareness of the beneficial and detrimental effects of caregiving among policy makers is needed to make well-informed decisions concerning the growth of care demands in the ageing population."
25450535,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25450535/,"INTRODUCTION: Pregnancy is a thrombogenic state, increasing the risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE), and the risk of valve thrombosis amongst women with mechanical heart valves (MHV). While low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) are generally dosed based on weight (i.e., enoxaparin 1 mg/kg every 12 hours), data in pregnant women have shown that weight-based dosing does not consistently achieve target anti-Xa levels. In women with MHV, our practice includes titrating LMWH doses to target both trough and peak anti-Xa levels, while for those with VTE peak anti-Xa levels guide dosing.
MATERIALS/METHODS: This retrospective case series included pregnant women requiring LMWH treatment doses with at least 3 peak (+/-trough) anti-Xa levels. Our primary objective was to describe the actual LMWH dose required to achieve targeted anti-Xa levels relative to weight-based dosing in patients with MHV. Secondarily, we compared the same for VTE patients; compared actual dosing between those with MHV and VTE; and examined maternal and fetal outcomes.
RESULTS/CONCLUSION: Women with MHV (N=4) required greater than weight-based dosing of enoxaparin (1.35 mg/kg Q12H) to achieve targeted anti-Xa levels. Importantly, achieving target peak anti-Xa levels did not always ensure maintenance of minimum trough levels. VTE patients (N=12) did not require more enoxaparin (0.96 mg/kg Q12H) than weight based dosing. MHV patients received more enoxaparin compared to VTE patients (P<0.001). No bleeding or clotting complications were associated with LMWH administration. In pregnant women with MHV at high risk of thromboembolism, LMWH dosing guided by trough and peak anti-Xa levels should be considered."
25450656,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25450656/,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: The vertebral augmentation procedures, vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, can relieve pain and facilitate mobilization of patients with osteoporotic vertebral fractures. Kyphoplasty also aims to restore vertebral body height before cement injection and so may be advantageous for more severe fractures.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare the ability of vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty to restore vertebral height, shape, and mechanical function after severe vertebral wedge fractures.
STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: This is a biomechanical and radiographic study using human cadaveric spines.
METHODS: Seventeen pairs of thoracolumbar ""motion segments"" from cadavers aged 70-98 years were injured, in a two-stage process involving flexion and compression, to create severe anterior wedge fractures. One of each pair underwent vertebroplasty and the other kyphoplasty. Specimens were then compressed at 1 kN for 1 hour to allow consolidation. Radiographs were taken before and after injury, after treatment, and after consolidation. At these same time points, motion segment compressive stiffness was assessed, and intervertebral disc ""stress profiles"" were obtained to characterize the distribution of compressive stress on the vertebral body and neural arch.
RESULTS: On average, injury reduced anterior vertebral body height by 34%, increased its anterior wedge angle from 5.0° to 11.4°, reduced intradiscal (nucleus) pressure and motion segment stiffness by 96% and 44%, respectively, and increased neural arch load bearing by 57%. Kyphoplasty caused 97% of the anterior height loss to be regained immediately, although this reduced to 79% after consolidation. Equivalent gains after vertebroplasty were significantly lower: 59% and 47%, respectively (p<.001). Kyphoplasty reduced vertebral wedging more than vertebroplasty (p<.02). Intradiscal pressure, neural arch load bearing, and motion segment compressive stiffness were restored significantly toward prefracture values after both augmentation procedures, even after consolidation, but these mechanical effects were similar for kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty.
CONCLUSIONS: After severe vertebral wedge fractures, vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty were equally effective in restoring mechanical function. However, kyphoplasty was better able to restore vertebral height and reverse wedge deformity."
25451408,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25451408/,"BACKGROUND: Previously, we compared the hyperthymic scores of residents in Sapporo, Koshigaya, and Oita (which are located at latitudes of 43°N, 36°N, and 33°N in Japan, respectively) using the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego-auto questionnaire version (TEMPS-A). We found that residents who lived at lower latitudes had higher hyperthymic temperament scores; however, the mechanism of the effect of latitude on hyperthymic temperament remained unclear. The current study examined the mediators of the latitude effect in additional regions with different annual temperatures and amounts of ambient sunshine.
METHODS: The Japanese archipelago stretches over 4000 km from north to south and has four large islands: Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu. In addition to the TEMPS-A previously reported data collected at Sapporo (latitude 43°N), Koshigaya (36°N), and Oita (33°N), we collected the TEMPS-A data of 189 and 106 residents from Takaoka (36°N) and Obihiro (42°N), respectively. Taken together, these five regions have different patterns (i.e., highs and lows) of annual ambient total sunshine (hours) and mean temperature (°C). The effect of latitude, sunshine, and temperature on affective temperaments was analyzed for five Japanese regions.
RESULTS: Multiple regression analyses revealed that latitude predicted significant variance in hyperthymic temperament. Ambient temperature, but not sunshine, significantly affected hyperthymic temperament.
LIMITATIONS: The light exposure that residents actually received was not measured. The number of regions studied was limited. The findings might not generalize to residents across Japan or other countries.
CONCLUSIONS: The present findings suggest that latitude affects hyperthymic temperament, and ambient temperature might mediate this effect."
25451417,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25451417/,"BACKGROUND: Developing accurate and time-efficient tools to measure depressive symptoms in schizophrenia is important for research and clinical practice. This study tested the psychometric properties of the Chinese version of the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS-SR) in depressed schizophrenia patients.
METHODS: This study included 337 clinically stable patients with schizophrenia. The severity of depressive symptoms was assessed using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), QIDS-SR at baseline and 2 weeks later. Negative symptoms and extrapyramidal symptoms were measured with the negative symptom score of Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and the Simpson-Angus Scale of Extrapyramidal Symptoms (SAS), respectively.
RESULTS: Internal consistency (Cronbach׳s alpha) was 0.73 and 0.67 for QIDS-SR at the baseline and endpoint, respectively. The intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) for test-retest reliability over the two weeks was 0.77. Two domains (involvement and energy) at baseline and one domain (energy) at endpoint had the highest item-total correlations. The QIDS-SR total score was significantly correlated with the MADRS total score at baseline (r=0.44, p<0.01). Weak correlations of the QIDS-SR score with the scores of the BPRS negative (r=0.18) and the SAS (r=0.05) indicate good discriminant validity. The QIDS-SR showed unidimensional measurement properties in exploratory factor analysis at both baseline. The main limitation of the study is that only clinically stable schizophrenia patients were included.
CONCLUSIONS: The QIDS-SR has acceptable psychometric properties in stable schizophrenia patients and may be useful in both research and clinical practice."
25451734,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25451734/,"OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to evaluate recurrence and survival among patients who underwent intraoperative margin re-resection for colorectal cancer liver metastases (CRLM).
BACKGROUND: Among patients who receive intraoperative margin re-resection, the relation between final margin status, pattern of recurrence, and survival is largely unknown.
METHODS: Three hundred thirty-two patients who underwent hepatic resection for CRLM between 2000 and 2013 were identified. Demographics, operative data, pathologic margin status, site of recurrence, and long-term survival data were collected and analyzed. Patients were stratified in three groups based on their margin status: R0, R1, and R1 → R0.
RESULTS: R0 resections were achieved in 247 (74.4%) patients, 61 (18.4%) patients had an R1 resection, whereas 24 (7.2%) had an R1 → R0. Median survival for patients undergoing R0 resections was 50.2 (95% confidence interval (CI) 49.2-66.2) months versus 63.0 (95% CI 50.3-70.5) months for patients undergoing R1 resections versus 49.2 (95% CI 29.9-NA) months for patients undergoing intraoperative margin re-resection (P > 0.05). Differences in recurrence rate and pattern were not significant between the three groups (P > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: In the era of modern systemic chemotherapy, it seems that the impact of margin status on outcomes may be minimal compared to that of patient and tumor factors. In this scenario, margin re-resection to achieve R0 status does not improve long-term outcomes."
25451893,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25451893/,"AIMS: This research assessed the impact of area-level socio-economic factors on the prevalence and outcomes of type 2 diabetes in North Karelia, Finland.
METHODS: All type 2 diabetes patients (n=10,204) were analyzed from the regional electronic patient database during the years 2011 and 2012. The patient's individual laboratory data was used to assess whether hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was measured and whether the recommended level of HbA1c <7% (<53 mmol/l) was achieved. The variables describing socio-economic characteristics of postal code areas were retrieved from the database of Statistics Finland. Linear and logistic regression analyses were used to determine associations.
RESULTS: HbA1c had been measured in 83% of patients. Over 70% of those with HbA1c measured reached the recommended level of HbA1c. The worse the area-level socio-economic status, the more probably HbA1c was not measured. Achieving the recommended HbA1c level was associated with being female and having a better area-level socio-economic status. The age-adjusted prevalence of type 2 diabetes was not linearly dependent on the socio-economic circumstances of the postal code areas.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that socio-economic factors at the small area-level are associated with treatment outcomes. The information from the regional electronic patient database linked with area-level socio-economic information could be effectively utilized to improve diabetes care."
25452053,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25452053/,"INTRODUCTION: A drinking game (DG) is a high-risk, social drinking activity that consists of certain rules (i.e., when to drink and how much to consume) designed to promote inebriation and that requires each player to perform a cognitive and/or motor task (Zamboanga et al., 2013). Research suggests that non-White or female students who play DGs are at an increased risk of experiencing alcohol-related problems. Thus, this study examined whether the associations between DG participation and alcohol-related problems were similar for men and women and across ethnic groups.
METHOD: College students (N=7409; 73% women; 64% White, 8% Black, 14% Hispanic, 14% Asian) from 30 U.S. colleges/universities completed self-report questionnaires.
RESULTS: Controlling for age, site, Greek membership (i.e., membership in a fraternity or sorority), and typical alcohol consumption, results indicated that the association between DG participation and alcohol-related problems was stronger for men compared to women. With respect to ethnicity, the association between these variables was stronger among Black women than Black men.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this large-scale study highlight the need to closely investigate how gender and ethnicity moderate the associations between DG participation and alcohol-related problems. College intervention efforts designed to address high-risk drinking behaviors such as DG participation might consider paying close attention to ethnic minority populations, perhaps particularly Black women."
25452300,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25452300/,"BACKGROUND: It is unknown whether the physiological impact of a given blood pressure (BP) varies by body size. We explored interactions between higher vs. lower systolic BP (SBP) targets and anthropometric measures (body mass index (BMI), body surface area (BSA), height, weight) and recurrent stroke and death in the Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Strokes (SPS3) Trial.
METHODS: Patients with recent magnetic resonance imaging-proven lacunar infarcts were randomized to 2 BP targets (130-149 mm Hg vs. <130) in a prospective, open-label, blinded end-point design. Time to outcome was evaluated with Cox proportional hazard models and compared between targets. We examined multiplicative interactions between each anthropometric measure and target and mean difference in achieved BP 1 year after randomization between BP groups by quartile. We also computed rates of recurrent stroke and death by quartiles of anthropometrics.
RESULTS: Three thousand and twenty patients were followed over a mean of 3.7 (SD 2.0) years. Mean age was 63; 63% were male. Mean height was 167 (SD 11) cm, weight 81 (18) kg, BMI 29 (5.9) kg/m(2), and BSA 1.9 (0.25) m(2). Achieved BP at 1 year was comparable between quartiles for each anthropometric measurement. We found no consistent interactions between BP target and anthropometrics for either outcome, nor were there any significant associations between hazard of stroke or death when assessed by BMI, BSA, height, or weight.
CONCLUSIONS: We found no interactions between BP target groups and quartiles of anthropometrics for rates of stroke and death in SPS3. There is no evidence at this time supporting body size-based modifications to current BP targets for secondary prevention after lacunar stroke.

21870946,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21870946/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the predictive value of the mechanism-of-injury step of the American College of Surgeons Field Triage Decision Scheme for determining trauma center need.
METHODS: Emergency medical services (EMS) providers caring for injured adult patients transported to the regional trauma center in three midsized communities over two years were interviewed upon emergency department (ED) arrival. Included was any injured patient, regardless of injury severity. The interview collected patient physiologic condition, apparent anatomic injury, and mechanism of injury. Using the 1999 Scheme, patients who met the physiologic or anatomic steps were excluded. Patients were considered to need a trauma center if they had nonorthopedic surgery within 24 hours, had intensive care unit admission, or died prior to hospital discharge. Data were analyzed by calculating positive likelihood ratios (+LRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each mechanism-of-injury criterion.
RESULTS: A total of 11,892 provider interviews were conducted. Of those, one was excluded because outcome data were not available, and 2,408 were excluded because they met the other steps of the Field Triage Decision Scheme. Of the remaining 9,483 cases, 2,363 met one of the mechanism-of-injury criteria, 204 (9%) of whom needed the resources of a trauma center. Criteria with a +LR ≥ 5 were death of another occupant in the same vehicle (6.8; CI: 2.7-16.7), fall >20 feet (5.3; CI: 2.4-11.4), and motor vehicle crash (MVC) extrication time >20 minutes (5.1; CI: 3.2-8.1). Criteria with a +LR between >2 and <5 were intrusion >12 inches (4.2; CI: 2.9-5.9), ejection (3.2; CI: 1.3-8.2), and deformity >20 inches (2.5; CI: 1.9-3.2). The criteria with a +LR ≤ 2 were MVC speed >40 mph (2.0; CI: 1.7-2.4), pedestrian/bicyclist struck at a speed >5 mph (1.2; CI:1.1-1.4), bicyclist/pedestrian thrown or run over (1.2; CI: 0.9-1.6), motorcycle crash at a speed >20 mph (1.2; CI: 1.1-1.4), rider separated from motorcycle (1.0; CI: 0.9-1.2), and MVC rollover (1.0; CI: 0.7-1.5).
CONCLUSION: Death of another occupant, fall distance, and extrication time were good predictors of trauma center need when a patient did not meet the anatomic or physiologic conditions. Intrusion, ejection, and vehicle deformity were moderate predictors. Key words: wounds and injury; triage; emergency medical services; emergency medical technicians; predictors; mechanism of injury; trauma center."
21871027,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21871027/,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical value of transient elastography (TE) for high-risk esophageal varices (HREV) prediction in hepatitis-B-related cirrhosis patients.
METHODS: A total of 238 patients with hepatitis B cirrhosis were prospectively enrolled. All patients had undergone TE and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Diagnostic value was assessed by the area under ROC curve (AUROC), predictive value and likelihood ratio.
RESULTS: The size of esophageal varices correlated with liver stiffness with Kendall's tau_b 0.236 overall and 0.425 in patients with ALT ≥ 5 × upper limit of normal (ULN). The AUROC of TE predicting HREV was 0.73 (95% confidence interval 0.66-0.80) overall and 0.92 (0.82-1.01) for patients with ALT ≥ 5 × ULN. In patients with ALT ≥ 5 × ULN, cut-off 36.1 kPa predicted HREV with a 100% negative predictive value (NPV), an indefinite negative likelihood ratio (NLR), a 72.7% positive predictive value (PPV) and a positive likelihood ratio (PLR) of 9.3. The AUROC of HREV-predicting model, constructed by ultrasonography and TE (USLS), was 0.84 (0.77-0.90) in the training set and 0.85 (0.76-0.94) in the validating set. Cut-off 3.30 excluded HREV with NPV 0.946 and NLR 0.10, and cut-off 5.98 determined HREV with PPV 0.870 and PLR 10.24. Using USLS, nearly 50% of patients could avoid endoscopic screening. The model's predictive values were maintained at similar accuracy in the validation set. Differences of AUROC in USLS, liver stiffness/spleen diameter to platelet ratio score and ultrasonic score were not significant.
CONCLUSIONS: TE may predict HREV in patients with ALT ≥ 5 × ULN. Overall, the clinical values of TE and USLS for HREV prediction should be evaluated by further studies."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: • We selected patients undergoing first biopsy and re-biopsy of the prostate with a 14- and 18-core template using EF and SF transrectal probes, respectively. • We compared the cancer detection rate between the two probes on first biopsy and re-biopsy and gauged patient tolerance using a visual analogue scale (VAS).
RESULTS: • A total of 1705 patients were included in the first biopsy group, while 487 were in the re-biopsy group. • The overall detection rate of first biopsy was 37.2%; the overall detection rate of re-biopsy was 10.1%. • No significant difference was found between the two probes in the first biopsy and re-biopsy sets (38% vs 36.5%, P= 0.55; 10.8% vs 9.3%, P= 0.7). • The lack of any significant association between the type of probe used and prostate cancer detection was confirmed by univariable and multivariable analyses in both the first biopsy and re-biopsy sets after accounting for prostate-specific antigen values, per cent free prostate-specific antigen, digital rectal examination, and prostate and transition zone volumes. • The patient tolerance profile of the SF group was significantly better than that of the EF group (mean VAS 1.78 ± 2.01 vs 1.45 ± 2.21; P= 0.02).
CONCLUSION: • The prostate cancer detection rate does not depend on the type of probe used. However, the SF transrectal probe is associated with a better patient tolerance profile."
21871278,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21871278/,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine if orthotopic heart transplantation performed within 90 days of an initial heart transplant (re-Tx) should be a contraindication to retransplantation based on inferior outcomes when compared with primary orthotopic heart transplantation recipients (control).
METHODS: De-identified data were obtained from the United Network for Organ Sharing. The study population included all adult heart transplant recipients greater than 18 years old from 1995 to 2008 (n=26,804). Multivariable regression was performed in order to assess the simultaneous effect of multiple risk factors on posttransplant graft failure (PTGF) at 90 days. Secondary outcomes of interest included infection, stroke, and dialysis during the transplant hospitalization as well as primary nonfunction of the graft at 90 days.
RESULTS: Among the study cohort, there were 90 (0.34%) re-Tx patients. Median survival in this group was 1.6 years compared with 10.5 years for controls. Unadjusted PTGF, infection, dialysis, and primary nonfunction were significantly higher (p<0.001) in the re-Tx group. After risk adjustment, however, PTGF (p=0.545), infection (p=0.696), dialysis (p=0.664), stroke (p=0.115), and primary nonfunction (p=0.531), did not differ significantly between the 2 groups.
CONCLUSIONS: When controlling for pretransplant recipient characteristics, retransplantation within 90 days of a previous transplant is not associated with increased morbidity or mortality. However, unadjusted overall survival was significantly worse in the re-Tx group. This suggests that although retransplantation at 90 days alone is not a risk factor for inferior outcomes, given the significant comorbidities of these patients, the indications for retransplantation within 90 days are rare and must be critically examined."

STUDY DESIGN: This was a multicenter retrospective study. Records of TOP for fetal anomalies with normal karyotype were analyzed. Primary outcomes were modifications of genetic counseling and management of next subsequent pregnancies. Medical TOPs were compared with surgical TOPs.
RESULTS: In all, 59 pregnancies were included (30 aspirations, 29 inductions). Fetopathological examination modified genetic counseling for 22 patients: 62% for the medical induction group vs 13% in the vacuum aspiration group (P < .001). Management of subsequent pregnancies was modified in 17% in the medical induction group vs 3% in the aspiration group (P = .06).
CONCLUSION: Fetopathological examination for early TOP with normal karyotype is relevant, especially when an intact fetus is examined. Thanks to it, genetic counseling is often modified, as is management of the next pregnancy. Medical procedures should be preferred to surgical procedures."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 178 consecutive patients underwent a multiparametric MRI protocol prior to radical prostatectomy (RP). T2W images were acquired with the 3D sampling perfection with application optimized contrasts using different flip angle evolutions (SPACE) sequence (5mn acquisition time). Direct and indirect MRI signs of extracapsular extension (ECE) were evaluated to predict the pT stage. The likelihood of SVI (seminal vesicle invasion) was also assessed.
RESULTS: Histology showed ECE and SVI in 38 (21%) and 12 (7%) cases, respectively. MRI sensitivity and specificity to detect ECE were 55 and 96% if direct signs of ECE were used and 84 and 89% (p<0.05), if both direct and indirect signs were combined. D'Amico criteria did not influence MRI performance. Sensitivity and specificity for SVI detection were 83% and 99%.
CONCLUSIONS: 3D data sets acquired with the SPACE sequence provides a high accuracy for local staging of prostate cancer. The use of indirect signs of ECE may be recommended in low D'Amico risk tumors to optimise patient selection for active surveillance or focal therapy."

METHODS: One hundred and twenty-two consecutive patients with presumed temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) who underwent presurgical evaluation were prospectively studied. SPh and Silverman's electrodes were placed, in addition to routine electrodes in 10-20 international system. IEDs and ictal electroencephalography (EEG) were analyzed separately in bipolar and referential montages. The proportion of patients selected for surgery after adjusting for SPh placement based on the earlier ictal onset and IEDs were analyzed.
RESULTS: Of the 8701 IEDs in SPh, only 65% were seen over the scalp bipolar montage; 1392 (16%) IEDs were confined to SPh electrodes, and were not seen at scalp bipolar montage (p<0.001). Spike amplitudes were highest at SPh (p<0.001). Of the 592 seizures analyzed, 62 (61%) had simultaneous SPh and scalp onset, while in 26 (25%) SPh onset preceded the scalp.
CONCLUSIONS: Out of the 35 patients with unilateral mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) with additional neocortical changes and/or non-lateralized bitemporal IEDs and/or diffuse ictal onset (group 1), 27 were selected for surgery (77%). About 7% was selected for surgery in this group by SPh placement. Also, in patients with bilateral MTS (group 2), 25% (5/20) were chosen for anterior temporal lobectomy, SPh provided an additional benefit in 11% (p<0.001). Patients with normal magnetic resonance imaging (group 3) and temporal plus epilepsy (group 4) had a lower surgical yield, only 12% and 9.5% could undergo surgery. They were denied surgical candidacy with SPh (p<0.001).
SIGNIFICANCE: One-third of patients after SPh placement were selected for resective surgery obviating the need for invasive monitoring. The maximum yield was noted in unilateral MTS (associated with additional neocortical features or non-lateralized bilateral temporal interictal IEDs or diffuse ictal onset in scalp EEG) and in bilateral MTS. Those with normal MRI/temporal plus epilepsy could be excluded from direct resective surgery."
21871981,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21871981/,"BACKGROUND: Complex hepatobiliary surgical procedures for benign and malignant conditions are regularly performed at tertiary academic referral centers with excellent outcomes, but whether similar surgical outcomes are achievable in community hospitals is not well documented.
METHODS: Eighty-four patients underwent complex hepatobiliary surgery between December 2004 and December 2008. Data were prospectively analyzed, including patient demographics, operative procedures, perioperative parameters, pathology, complications up to 30 days postoperatively, and long-term outcomes.
RESULTS: The most frequent procedures performed were isolated segmentectomy or segmentectomies (n = 41 [49%]). Major hepatic resections (n = 32 [38%]) included 25 lobectomies (30%) and 7 trisegmentectomies (8%). Nine patients (11%) had surgical complications, and the most common indications for surgery was metastatic carcinoma (n = 42 [50%]).
CONCLUSIONS: Complex hepatobiliary surgery can be performed safely at a community-based teaching hospital with excellent outcomes. In the ongoing debate centering on mandatory referral and centralization of complex surgical procedures, tertiary community hospitals with well-determined outcomes should be included."
21872201,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21872201/,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to review the outcome of conservatively managed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 in women <25 years old.
STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective review that included women who were <25 years old with biopsy proven CIN2 between 2005 and 2009. Analysis was performed that compared women who had immediate treatment with women whose treatment was deferred >4 months. The primary outcome measure was spontaneous regression of CIN2. Secondary outcomes were treatment rates and loss to follow-up evaluation.
RESULTS: Of the 452 women who were identified, 256 women (57%) received immediate treatment; 157 women (35%) met the definition for conservative management, and 39 women (9%) had unknown subsequent management. Of the 157 women who were managed conservatively, 98 women (62%) showed spontaneous regression, with a median of 8 months observation. No conservatively managed women progressed to cancer.
CONCLUSION: Based on the 62% regression rate in this study, routine treatment may not be necessary for all women with CIN2 who are <25 years old."
21872216,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21872216/,"BACKGROUND: Previous research suggests a link between antidepressant use and diabetes, but it is unclear whether the association is causal or attributable to detection/ascertainment bias. To examine this, we assessed the associations of antidepressant use with change in glucose levels and incidence of undiagnosed and diagnosed diabetes.
METHODS: During an 18-year period, we monitored antidepressant use, glucose levels, and diabetes status in 5978 civil servants (70.9% male, age range 39-64 years) free of diabetes at baseline (the Whitehall II study). Use of medication and plasma glucose were assessed at four study screenings: 1991/1993, 1997/1999, 2003/2004, and 2008/2009. Incident diabetes cases were classified as either diagnosed (n = 294) if detected using self-report of physician diagnosis and/or the use of diabetes medication or undiagnosed (n = 346) if detected based on fasting and/or 2-hour postload glucose levels using an oral glucose tolerance test at the study screenings.
RESULTS: Incidence of diagnosed diabetes was higher among antidepressant users than nonusers (odds ratio 3.10, 95% confidence interval: 1.66-5.78). However, antidepressant use was not associated with undiagnosed diabetes at any follow-up examination nor with higher fasting or 2-hour postload plasma glucose levels or increasing glucose levels over time. Odds ratio for undiagnosed diabetes for antidepressant users versus nonusers was .88 (95% confidence interval: .45-1.72, p = .70). The mean difference in glucose changes between participants reporting antidepressant use at three screenings compared with those not on antidepressant treatment was .0 mmol/L.
CONCLUSIONS: The link between antidepressant use and diabetes risk may not be causal in nature."
21872334,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21872334/,"OBJECTIVE: Individuals with serious mental illness (SMI; e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder) experience disparities in mortality relative to the general population, mainly because of medical conditions (i.e., cardiometabolic disease).We assessed whether VA patients with SMI and receiving care from VA mental health facilities with colocated medical care were more likely to receive cardiometabolic risk assessments in accordance with clinical practice guidelines than patients from noncolocated facilities.
METHODS: Patients with SMI identified prescribed second-generation antipsychotic medications in fiscal year (FY) 2007 receiving care from VA mental health facilities completing the VA Mental Health Program Survey were included. VA administrative data were ascertained to assess receipt of the following tests every 6 months in FY 2007: body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, lipid profile and fasting glucose.
RESULTS: Out of 40,600 patients with SMI prescribed second-generation antipsychotics, 29% received all cardiometabolic tests (lipid, glucose, BMI and blood pressure). While 79% and 76% received blood pressure and BMI assessments, respectively, only 37% received a lipid test. Patients from colocated sites were more likely to receive all cardiometabolic tests (odds ratio=1.26, 95% confidence interval: 1.18-1.35, P<.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Colocated general medical providers in mental health clinics are more likely to provide cardiometabolic assessments for patients with SMI prescribed second-generation antipsychotics."
21872349,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21872349/,"INTRODUCTION: Although international research in recent years has often focused on elder abuse, its extent is not clear in community-based settings and even bigger mystery in nursing homes.
BACKGROUND: Until now in the literature it has in most cases only been assumed that nursing homes offer better protection from abuse for frail older people.
METHODS: A cross-sectional research design was applied by use of structured interviews. Those involved were frail older people (n=300) who were in need of some sort of professional nursing assistance.
RESULTS: Nursing home accommodation was extracted as the strongest predictor, significantly reducing the risk of physical abuse (odds ratio, OR 0.1, 95% confidence interval, 95% CI 0.0-0.3) and financial abuse (OR 0.2, 95% CI 0.1-0.4). Spouses and sons were revealed as the most regular perpetrators of physical and financial abuse. The results showed no statistical significance between settings as predictors of the occurrence of mental abuse (OR 0.9, 95% CI 0.5-1.6).
DISCUSSION: Results of the statistical analysis add to the general assumption that nursing home accommodation offers protection for frail older people in escaping physical and financial abuse.
CONCLUSION: In their clinical practice, community nurses should give special attention to frail older people who, besides their healthcare needs, are also heavily dependent in the activities of daily living (ADLs). In order to combat elder abuse, conditions in the family should be regularly verified."
21872488,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21872488/,"OBJECTIVES: This study is the first to systematically investigate whether multiple child maltreatment is associated with HIV risk behaviors and adverse mental health outcomes among Asian-American women.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of unmarried Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese women (n = 400), aged 18 to 35, who are identified as children of immigrants, using computer-assisted survey interviews.
RESULTS: Approximately 7 in 10 women reported having been maltreated as a child and 6.8% reported any type of sexual abuse. Only 15% of our sample reported having sex at age 16 or before, yet almost 60% had ever engaged with potentially risky sexual partners. Contrary to the findings from previous studies of White and Black women, sexual abuse plus other maltreatment was not associated with HIV risk behaviors among Asian-American women. However, it was associated with a marked increase in depression, lifetime suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts. A higher education level was associated with increased odds of HIV risk behaviors, including ever having had anal sex and ever having potentially risky sexual partners.
CONCLUSION: There was no evidence indicating that multiple child maltreatment was linked with HIV risk behaviors, but it exhibited a robust association with poor mental health outcomes. These empirical patterns of internalizing trauma, suffering alone, and staying silent are in accord with Asian-cultural norms of saving face and maintaining family harmony. The prevention of multiple child maltreatment may reduce high levels of depression and suicidal behaviors in this population. It is urgent to identify victims of multiple child maltreatment and provide culturally appropriate interventions."
21872515,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21872515/,"BACKGROUND: Cervicitis is widespread, but no studies have examined cervicitis in accordance with established guidelines for diagnosis and treatment. Study objectives were to describe adherence to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of cervicitis within an adolescent population and to compare factors associated with adherence to guidelines in a primary care setting and the Emergency Department.
METHODS: Data were collected as part of a retrospective chart review of evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of STI in adolescent women in an outpatient setting. Participant charts were eligible for review if they were 12-21 years of age and were given an ICD-9 and chart diagnosis of cervicitis. Two primary outcome variables: meeting cervicitis guidelines and correct treatment among those meeting cervicitis guidelines (no/yes) were utilized; the study controlled for age, race, venue, past infection with chlamydia or gonorrhea.
RESULTS: Subjects (n = 365) were examined for the primary outcome variables and 75.1% (274/365) met at least one criterion for cervicitis. Of these, 166 (60.9%: 166/274) subjects were found to meet criteria for cervicitis alone, versus subjects meeting criteria for both cervicitis and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) (39.4%: 108/274). The majority, 89.3%, (326/365) were treated for both chlamydia and gonorrhea, but only 64.7% (211/326) were treated correctly for both infections.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that knowledge deficits exist in diagnosis and treatment of cervicitis in adolescent patients and in differentiating between cervicitis and PID. Educational tools, simulated patient exercises, and order sets may be warranted for quality improvement to allow for improved care of this at risk sexually active population."
21872838,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21872838/,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate reported fatigue levels and gait deficits in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) to determine the relationships that may exist between fatigue in patients with MS and alterations in gait mechanics.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional.
SETTING: Biomechanics laboratory.
PARTICIPANTS: Subjects with MS (n=32) and age- and sex-matched controls (n=30).
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Modified Fatigue Index Scale (MFIS), and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) to assess fatigue and general health. Biomechanical gait analysis was performed to measure peak joint torques and powers in the sagittal plane at the ankle, knee, and hip. Correlations were performed between fatigue measures and degree of deficit within each patient with MS for each joint torque and power measure.
RESULTS: FSS score significantly correlated with deficits in ankle power generation at late stance and walking velocity. MFIS score significantly correlated with deficits in peak knee extensor torque and knee power absorption at early stance. SF-36 subscale scores correlated with several joint torque and power variables.
CONCLUSIONS: Subjective fatigue rating scale scores alone should not be used as an indicator of motor disability or disease progression as it affects walking performance of patients with MS."
21873038,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21873038/,"INTRODUCTION: Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a serious pathology that requires optimal management in very specialized health centers. French medical care organization is regionally based. Hence, evaluating local practices may help deliver clear information to parents before delivery. The aim of this study was to analyze the neonatal characteristics and the postnatal outcome of infants affected with CDH, treated within two different French perinatal health care networks.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of infants with CDH, cared for in the Lorraine perinatal health care network (Réseau Périnatal Lorrain [RPL]) or at Édouard-Herriot Hospital (HEH) in Lyon, between 1997 and 2007.
RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-seven newborns were included, 44 in the RPL and 83 in Lyon. Prenatal diagnosis of CDH was similar in RPL and at HEH; 47.7% of infants with CDH died in RPL vs 36.1% in HEH (P=0.2). Surgery delayed for more than 24h was more frequent in RPL (68.6% vs 31.7%; P<0.001), with a postoperative mortality rate of 31.4% vs 15.9%; P=0.08. In RPL, specialized medical follow-up was rare (33.3% vs 100%; P<0.001), while psychomotor retardation was more frequent (33.3% vs 5.7%; P=0.002).
CONCLUSION: This study brings to light the diversity of care and outcome for infants affected with CDH in two French perinatal health care networks. These results may help improve both centers' practices. In Lorraine for instance, the follow-up of these vulnerable children can be improved."
21873552,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21873552/,"OBJECTIVE: Chronic exercise and obesity both increase intramyocellular triglycerides (IMTGs) despite having opposing effects on insulin sensitivity. We hypothesized that chronically exercise-trained muscle would be characterized by lower skeletal muscle diacylglycerols (DAGs) and ceramides despite higher IMTGs and would account for its higher insulin sensitivity. We also hypothesized that the expression of key skeletal muscle proteins involved in lipid droplet hydrolysis, DAG formation, and fatty-acid partitioning and oxidation would be associated with the lipotoxic phenotype.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 14 normal-weight, endurance-trained athletes (NWA group) and 7 normal-weight sedentary (NWS group) and 21 obese sedentary (OBS group) volunteers were studied. Insulin sensitivity was assessed by glucose clamps. IMTGs, DAGs, ceramides, and protein expression were measured in muscle biopsies.
RESULTS: DAG content in the NWA group was approximately twofold higher than in the OBS group and ~50% higher than in the NWS group, corresponding to higher insulin sensitivity. While certain DAG moieties clearly were associated with better insulin sensitivity, other species were not. Ceramide content was higher in insulin-resistant obese muscle. The expression of OXPAT/perilipin-5, adipose triglyceride lipase, and stearoyl-CoA desaturase protein was higher in the NWA group, corresponding to a higher mitochondrial content, proportion of type 1 myocytes, IMTGs, DAGs, and insulin sensitivity.
CONCLUSIONS: Total myocellular DAGs were markedly higher in highly trained athletes, corresponding with higher insulin sensitivity, and suggest a more complex role for DAGs in insulin action. Our data also provide additional evidence in humans linking ceramides to insulin resistance. Finally, this study provides novel evidence supporting a role for specific skeletal muscle proteins involved in intramyocellular lipids, mitochondrial oxidative capacity, and insulin resistance."
21874334,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21874334/,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSES: Discordance between clinical and radiological profiles in knee osteoarthritis has been reported. We hypothesized that the discordance could be due to limited radiological variables studied. This study essentially analyzed many more radiological features than previous studies in order to seek an association between clinical and radiographic features.
METHODS: One hundred and eighty patients with knee osteoarthritis were enrolled as per the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines. Visual analog scale (VAS) for knee pain and the knee-specific Western Ontario Mac University (WOMAC) index for pain, stiffness, and disability were recorded. Five additional radiological features apart from those in the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) classification grading system were recorded by two authors who were blinded to the clinical diagnosis. The variables significantly associated were analyzed by linear regression model.
RESULTS: Pain was significantly associated with increasing KL grades; physical function was nearly significant and stiffness was not. On analysis of individual radiological features, WOMAC pain was significant with subchondral sclerosis, joint space width, and tibiofemoral alignment although the correlation was week. VAS pain was significant with the latter two and with articular incongruity. Functional disability was associated with medial joint-space narrowing, tibiofemoral alignment, loose bodies, and juxta-articular osteopenia. However, in the linear regression model, pain and stiffness were significantly associated with articular incongruity and functional disability and total clinical scores with juxta-articular osteopenia.
CONCLUSION: When the radiological features were extended beyond those included in KL grades, pain, stiffness, and disability correlated well with radiography; articular incongruity with pain and stiffness; and juxta-articular osteopenia with physical disability and clinical severity."
21874374,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21874374/,"BACKGROUND: The data of the German hospital nosocomial infection surveillance system (KISS) were used to investigate the association between the frequency of blood cultures (BC) and central venous catheter associated bloodstream infection (CVC-BSI) rates in intensive care units (ICU).
METHODS: A questionnaire on the frequency of BCs taken was sent to all ICUs participating in KISS and univariable and multivariable analyses were performed on the results.
RESULTS: A total of 223 ICUs provided data. The median number of BC pairs taken in 2006 was 60 with a huge variation from 3.2 to 680 per 1,000 patient days. The mean primary BSI rate was 0.90 per 1,000 patient days and 0.25 BSIs per 1,000 patient days were caused by coagulase negative Staphylococci (CNS). The mean CVC-BSI rate was 1.40 per 1,000 CVC days. In the univariable analysis the blood culture frequency had a significant influence on the CVC-associated BSI rate, considering either all pathogens (p=0.001) or only the subgroup of CNS-related cases (p=0.019). There was also a significant influence of the BC frequency on the CVC-BSI rate considering all pathogens (p=0.004) as well as the subgroup of CNS (p=0.018). Therefore the BC frequency was a significant factor affecting the incidence of BSI and CVC-BSI. According to the multivariable analysis an increase of the BC frequency of 100 BCs per 1,000 patient days leads to a 1.27-fold higher incidence density of CVC-BSI with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of 1.01-1.26. A further significant risk factor for CVC-BSI was the length of stay in the ICU with an adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) of 1.25 (95% CI 1.15-1.35). To have the status of an interdisciplinary ICU was a significant protective factor (IRR 0.64; 95% CI 0.45-0.92).
CONCLUSIONS: If an external benchmarking of ICU CVC-BSI rates is intended an adjustment according to the BC frequency is necessary. The BC frequency itself should be established as a quality indicator in intensive care."
21874390,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21874390/,"BACKGROUND: Surgical navigation in TKA facilitates better alignment; however, it is unclear whether improved alignment alters clinical evolution and midterm and long-term complication rates.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We determined the alignment differences between patients with standard, manual, jig-based TKAs and patients with navigation-based TKAs, and whether any differences would modify function, implant survival, and/or complications.
PATIENTS AND MATERIALS: We retrospectively reviewed 97 patients (100 TKAs) undergoing TKAs for minimal preoperative deformities. Fifty TKAs were performed with an image-free surgical navigation system and the other 50 with a standard technique. We compared femoral angle (FA), tibial angle (TA), and femorotibial angle (FTA) and determined whether any differences altered clinical or functional scores, as measured by the Knee Society Score (KSS), or complications. Seventy-three patients (75 TKAs) had a minimum followup of 8 years (mean, 8.3 years; range, 8-9.1 years).
RESULTS: All patients included in the surgical navigation group had a FTA between 177° and 182º. We found no differences in the KSS or implant survival between the two groups and no differences in complication rates, although more complications occurred in the standard technique group (seven compared with two in the surgical navigation group).
CONCLUSIONS: In the midterm, we found no difference in functional and clinical scores or implant survival between TKAs performed with and without the assistance of a navigation system.

21874620,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21874620/,"BACKGROUND: The size of congenital pulmonary malformation (CPM) in infants might interfere with the feasibility of thoracoscopic resection. This study was undertaken to evaluate the impact of the size of CPM on the applicability of video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) in infants.
METHODS: Twenty-two infants were operated on for CPM from November 2000 to June 2009. The intra- and postoperative course was analyzed retrospectively from patient charts. Preoperative scans were evaluated blindly by a radiologist to calculate the relation between the maximum size of the lesion and the thoracic diameter in VATS and open procedures.
RESULTS: VATS was performed in 14 (64%) of the 22 patients and thoracotomy in 8. VATS was successfully performed in 11 (79%) of the 14 patients, whereas VATS was converted to thoracotomy due to lack of overview in 3 (21%). The mean relative size of CPM at preoperative imaging was 0.34 ± 0.05 (range: 0.3-0.4) in patients who received successful VATS, 0.57 ± 0.06 (range: 0.5-0.6) in converted cases, and 0.68 ± 0.10 (range: 0.5-0.8) in infants who underwent thoracotomy. The relative CPM size was significantly lower in successful VATS than in cases of conversion (P<0.01) and thoracotomy (P<0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: The relative size of CPM at preoperative imaging might be useful information for a decision-making on the use of VATS in infants. A relative CPM size below 0.5, which is less than half of the thoracic diameter, indicates a good feasibility for thoracoscopic resection of CPM. A larger size may indicate that VATS might be technically difficult."

METHODS: This case-control study was performed among patients managed for chronic rhinosinusitis between January and April 2009 the ENT and Head and Neck Department General Hospital of Kinshasa, DRCongo. Cases were matched with controls according to gender and age. Logic regression analysis served to identify factors associated with presence of chronic rhinosinusitis.
RESULTS: The study population with 108 patients included 81 cases ofrhinosinusitis, 27 controls, 78 females, 30 males, 52 with HIV/AIDS and 56 HIV seronegatives. The mean age was 34+/-19 years (range 1 year-74 years). Only HIV/AIDS was identified as a significant and independent determinant of presence of chronic rhinosinusitis (OR= 19,6 95% CI 4,3 -88,9; P< 0,0001).
CONCLUSION: Early ENT evaluation and continuous follow-up of HIV-infected patients are suggested. Age upper 20 years and high education attainment were significantly associated with high risk of chronic rhinosinusitis among HIV-infected patients, respectively."
21874762,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21874762/,"UNLABELLED: Academic careers of individual doctors are commonly evaluated by examining the number and quality of authored publications. Similarly, the extent and quality of medical research may be assessed nationwide by measuring the number of publications originating from the country of interest over time. This in turn, may indicate on the quality of medicine practiced. To evaluate the extent and quality of IsraeLi publications we measured the rate and quality of medical publications originating from Israel for two decades in the fields of urology, cardiology and orthopedics, and compared the data to those of other countries.
METHODS: Leading journals in urology, cardiology, and orthopedics were selected. A Medline search (http://www.ncbi.ntm.nih.gov/sites/entrez] was conducted for all the publications originating in Israel between the years 1990-2009 in the selected journals. Data from Israel was compared to those from Italy, France, Germany, Egypt and Turkey. The change in rate of publications was tested using Linear regression. The quality of publications was calculated by multiplying the number of publications by the relevant impact factor.
RESULTS: While the urology publications rate in Israel increased by 32.7% in the second study decade as compared with the first, the urology publication rates during the same time period from Italy, France, Germany, Egypt and Turkey were 199%, 115%, 184%, 180% and 227% respectively. The regression coefficient for the urology publication rate was 0.51 for Israel, and 0.78, 0.95, 0.78, 0.87 and 0.97 for the other countries, respectively. The regression coefficient for the change in the quality of publications from Israel was 0.31 and 0.81, 0.75, 0.92, 0.73, and 0.92 for the other countries, respectively. In cardiology, the Israeli publication rate increased by 26% during the second study decade, whereas in the other countries the increments were 46%, 35%, 76%, 80% and 309% respectively. The regression coefficient for Israeli pubLication rate was 0.45, and 0.78, 0.54, 0.62, 0.13 and 0.75 for the other countries, respectively. The regression coefficient of the quality of publications in Israel was 0.3 as opposed to 0.47, 0.36, 0.48, 0.01, and 0.78 respectively. The Israeli publications in orthopedics increased by 9.3% during the second decade compared with the first. At the same time, other countries increased the publication rate in orthopedics by 69%, 121%, 173%, 140% and 296% respectively. The regression coefficient for the publication rate in orthopedics was 0.02 for Israel, and 0.62, 0.64, 0.78, 0.34 and 0.71 for the other countries, respectively. The regression coefficient of the quality of publications in Israel was 0.05 as opposed to 0.67, 0.62, 0.75, 0.31, and 0.66 in the other countries, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Israel lags behind Italy, France, Germany, Egypt and Turkey with regard to the increase of both the number and the quality of medical publications in urology and orthopedics. While the rate and quality of IsraeLi publications in cardiology surpasses those from Egypt, they lag in the number of publications in this medical field behind those of all the rest of the countries examined. In a world of rapid progress and expansion of medical research, Israel has been stagnant in publications in 3 medical specialties, rendering it inferior to other nations."
21875205,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21875205/,"OBJECTIVE: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a serious public health problem, due in part to low vaccination rates among high-risk adults, many of whom decline vaccination because of barriers such as perceived inconvenience or discomfort. This study evaluates the efficacy of a self-prediction intervention to increase HBV vaccination rates among high-risk adults.
METHOD: Randomized controlled trial of 1,175 adults recruited from three sexually transmitted disease clinics in the United States over 28 months. Participants completed an audio-computer-assisted self-interview, which presented information about HBV infection and vaccination, and measured relevant beliefs, behaviors, and demographics. Half of participants were assigned randomly to a ""self-prediction"" intervention, asking them to predict their future acceptance of HBV vaccination. The main outcome measure was subsequent vaccination behavior. Other measures included perceived barriers to HBV vaccination, measured prior to the intervention.
RESULTS: There was a significant interaction between the intervention and vaccination barriers, indicating the effect of the intervention differed depending on perceived vaccination barriers. Among high-barriers patients, the intervention significantly increased vaccination acceptance. Among low-barriers patients, the intervention did not influence vaccination acceptance.
CONCLUSIONS: The self-prediction intervention significantly increased vaccination acceptance among ""high-barriers"" patients, who typically have very low vaccination rates. This brief intervention could be a useful tool in increasing vaccine uptake among high-barriers patients."
21875538,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21875538/,"BACKGROUND: Guidelines from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program stipulate that multicomponent self-management interventions for asthma should include a written action plan (WAP). However the specific, independent effect of WAPs in improving outcomes remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To measure the association between WAP use during the previous year and improved asthma outcomes.
METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal quasi-experimental study using data from the Healthy Homes II (HH-II) randomized controlled trial in Seattle, WA. Action plan use during the previous year was measured at exit of HH-II. A participant was a WAP user if he used his action plan every day, almost every day, or once per week, and non-user if he did not meet these criteria. Sensitivity analyses explored less stringent criteria for WAP user designation. Prespecified outcomes were baseline-to-exit changes in asthma control in the previous 2 weeks, Pediatric Asthma Caregiver Quality of Life Scale score, and urgent health services utilization. We used robust linear and logistic regression to compare outcomes across groups.
RESULTS: Two hundred fifty-one patients participated: 112 WAP users; 139 non-users. After adjustment, no significant differences in outcomes were observed between WAP users and non-users. Among a subgroup of participants with recent urgent health services utilization, WAP users had better asthma control than non-users. Changing WAP user criteria to include those who simply owned an action plan, irrespective of use, did not alter our results.
CONCLUSION: WAP use during the previous year was not associated with improved outcomes compared with non-use. Additional studies are needed to assess the long-term, independent benefit of this universally recommended intervention."
21875732,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21875732/,"BACKGROUND: Good responses (ypStage I) after preoperative chemoradiation therapy (CRT) and curative resection for locally advanced rectal cancer are associated with excellent local control and improved disease-free survival. This study was conducted to evaluate whether this population has comparable oncologic outcomes with those for patients with early rectal cancer (pStage I).
METHODS: This prospective study included 123 patients with pathologic stage I rectal cancer that was located less than 7 cm from the anal verge and who underwent radical resection. Of the 123 patients, 30 patients underwent preoperative CRT followed by radical resection, while 93 underwent proctectomy with no preoperative treatment. The oncologic outcomes between the 2 groups were compared.
RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 78 months. The pretreatment clinical staging was significantly different between the 2 groups (P < .001). The 10-year overall and disease-free survival rates for the patients who received preoperative CRT were 48% and 75%, respectively, which were different from the rates for those patients who did not undergo preoperative CRT (83%; P = .001 and 93%; P = .001, respectively); however, the 10-year local recurrence rates did not significantly differ between the patients who received preoperative CRT and those who did not receive preoperative CRT (7% vs 5%, respectively, P = .381).
CONCLUSION: Good responses after preoperative CRT and curative resection for locally advanced rectal cancer may be associated with local control that is similar to that of the patients with early rectal cancer."
21876191,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21876191/,"BACKGROUND: Fatalistic beliefs about cancer have been implicated in low uptake of screening and delay in presentation particularly in low socioeconomic status (SES) groups, but no studies have systematically evaluated interrelationships between SES, fatalism, and early detection behaviors. We explored whether (i) fatalism is associated with negative attitudes toward early detection, (ii) lower SES groups are more fatalistic, and (iii) SES differences in fatalism partly explain SES differences in attitudes toward early detection.
METHODS: In a population-representative sample of adults in Britain using computer-based interviews in the home setting, respondents (N = 2,018) answered two questions to index fatalism (expectations of cancer survival and cure) and two items on early detection attitudes (the perceived value of early detection and fear of symptom reporting). SES was indexed with a social grade classification.
RESULTS: Fatalism was associated with being less positive about early detection (β = -0.40, P < 0.001) and more fearful about seeking help for a suspicious symptom (β = 0.24, P < 0.001). Lower SES groups were more fatalistic (β = -0.21, P < 0.001). Path analyses suggest that SES differences in fatalism might explain SES differences in attitudes about early detection.
CONCLUSIONS: In this population sample, SES differences in fatalism partly explained SES differences in the perceived value of early detection and fear of symptom presentation.
IMPACT: Fatalistic beliefs about cancer should be targeted to promote early presentation of cancer and this may be particularly important for lower SES groups."
21876239,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21876239/,"BACKGROUND: The immediate evaluation of microvascular tissue flaps with respect to microcirculation after transplantation is crucial for optimal monitoring and outcome. The purpose of our investigation was to evaluate the clinical value of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and contrast-enhanced MRI (ceMRI) for monitoring the integrity of tissue flaps in plastic surgery.
METHODS: To this end, we investigated 10 patients (47 ± 16 a) between postoperative day 7 and 14 who underwent flap surgery in order to cover tissue defects in various body regions. For CEUS we utilized the GE LOGIQ E9 equipped with a linear transducer (6-9 MHz). After application of 2.4 ml SonoVue, the tissue perfusion was detected in Low MI-Technique (MI < 0.2). The perfusion curves were quantitatively analyzed using digital video sequences (QONTRAST, Bracco, Italy) regarding peak % and relative blood flow (RBF). Furthermore, we investigated all tissue flaps using contrast-enhanced MRI (Magnetom Symphony TIM, Siemens) with a 3D-VIBE sequence and a time resolution of 7s. Thus, the transplants were completely captured in all cases. As perfusion parameters, the positive enhancement integral (PEI) as well as the maximum intensity projection time (MIP-time) were collected. For comparison of both applications, all parameters were displayed in color-coded resolution and analyzed by three independent readers. Depending on the flap thickness, 1-3 regions of interest (ROI) were investigated. Each ROI measured 1 × 3 cm.
RESULTS: The subcutaneous ROI-1 showed a significantly lower rating regarding RBF in the ceMRI compared to CEUS (Mann-Whitney Rank-Sum test, p < 0.05). ROI-2 and -3 did not show any significant differences between the two applications. The frequency distribution showed good accordance in both modalities. Both imaging techniques detected 1 partial flap necrosis within the random area of cutaneous and subcutaneous layers, 1 hematoma as well as 1 insufficient perfusion over all tissue layers. After subsequent reoperation, graft loss could be prevented.
CONCLUSION: At present, both technologies provide an optimal assessment of perfusion in cutaneous, subcutaneous and muscle tissue layers, whereby the detection of fatty tissue perfusion is currently more easily detected using CEUS compared to ceMRI."
21876358,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21876358/,"BACKGROUND: Alcohol consumption is a potential trigger for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) flare because of alcohol-induced oxidative stress and its deleterious effects on gut barrier function. Additionally, we have recently shown that alcohol consumption is associated with more symptoms in IBD. However, it is not known whether moderate daily alcohol consumption can modify IBD disease activity. To test what effects alcohol may have on patients with IBD, we evaluated the effect of moderate daily red wine for 1 week on two factors associated with recurrent IBD disease activity: intestinal permeability and stool calprotectin.
METHODS: To assess the effects of moderate daily alcohol consumption on intestinal permeability and inflammation, we recruited 21 patients: 8 with inactive ulcerative colitis (UC), 6 with inactive Crohn's disease (CD), and 7 healthy controls. All participants with IBD completed a validated questionnaire on disease activity (Crohn's disease activity index or ulcerative colitis clinical activity index), to confirm they had inactive disease. All subjects then underwent a baseline assessment that included a blood draw, urine collection after sugar challenge, and stool collection. Subjects then consumed 1-3 glasses of red wine a day for 1 week (approx. 0.4 g EtOH/kg), and repeated the three measures.
RESULTS: No subjects flared during the study. Moderate alcohol consumption did not significantly change either clinical disease activity scores or C-reactive protein. In contrast to healthy subjects, daily consumption of red wine significantly (1) decreased stool calprotectin in IBD subjects from baseline (p = 0.001) and (2) increased intestinal permeability as measured by urinary lactulose/mannitol excretion (marker of small bowel permeability) in CD (p = 0.028) or urinary sucralose secretion (marker of large bowel permeability) in UC (p = 0.012).
CONCLUSIONS: One week of moderate consumption of red wine in inactive IBD was associated with a significant decrease in stool calprotectin and a significant increase in intestinal permeability. Our data suggests that patients with inactive IBD who drink red wine daily may be at an increased long-term risk for disease relapse."
21876365,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21876365/,"OBJECTIVES: The use of an external pancreatic duct stent to prevent fistula formation of pancreatic anastomosis remains a matter of debate. This study is a meta-analysis of the available evidence.
METHODS: Articles published until the end of March 2011 comparing external stenting and non-stenting in pancreatic anastomosis were included. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and weighted mean differences (WMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated using either the fixed effects model or random effects model.
RESULTS: Six articles were identified for inclusion: 3 randomized controlled trials and 3 observational clinical studies. The meta-analysis revealed that the use of an external pancreatic duct stent was associated with a statistically significant reduction in overall postoperative morbidity (OR 0.56; 95% CI 0.39-0.81; p = 0.002), pancreatic fistula (OR 0.34; 95% CI 0.23-0.15; p < 0.001), severity of pancreatic fistula (OR 0.70; 95% CI 0.32-1.57; p = 0.04), delayed gastric emptying (OR 0.44; 95% CI 0.25-0.80; p = 0.007), and length of hospital stay (WMD -3.95; 95% CI -6.38 to -1.52; p = 0.001).

21876434,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21876434/,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to identify the risk factors that predict papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC)-related death in a large patient population to determine which patients need aggressive treatment.
BACKGROUND: The management of PTMC is controversial and ranges from observation to total thyroidectomy. The lack of consensus is predominantly due to the general excellent overall prognosis, thereby requiring a large cohort to delineate differences in outcome.
METHODS: All papillary thyroid cancer patients with tumor size of 1 cm or less in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Cancer Database from 1988 to 2007 were identified. Outcomes, including overall and disease-specific survival, were compared, and different risk groups were evaluated by multivariate analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 18,445 cases of PTMC with surgery were identified. The 10-year and 15-year overall survivals were 94.6% and 90.7%, respectively, while disease-specific survivals were 99.5% and 99.3%. Age greater than 45 years, male sex, African American or minority race, node metastases, extrathyroidal invasion, and distant metastases were stratified to be significant risk factors for overall survival. There were 49 thyroid cancer-related deaths. Forty-five (92%) of the 49 patients had at least 2 risk factors, and 51% of these 49 patients had 3 or more risk factors (vs 5.7% in the rest of the cohort, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Although PTMC is generally associated with an excellent prognosis, 0.5% patients may die of PTMC. The presence of 2 or more risk factors is strongly associated with cancer-related mortality and can help to identify patients who should be considered for more aggressive management."
21876501,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21876501/,"OBJECTIVES: To verify the relation between pregnancy duration and cervical length (CL) at 22-24 wks of spontaneous and IVF singleton gestations and to assess its predictive value for preterm delivery (< 37 wks).
MATERIAL & METHODS: CL at 22-24 wks was performed according to FMF recommendations in 344 women who conceived spontaneously and in 107 IVF singleton pregnancies. The results of CL in both groups were divided into subgroups: ≤ 29 mm, 30-34 mm; 35-39 mm; 40-44 mm; 45-49 mm and ≥ 50 mm. They were subsequently correlated with mean durations of gestation within subgroups and parameters of accuracy were calculated. Correlation and regression analysis was performed.
RESULTS: The average age of women in both groups was 28.1 y.o. (SD=4.2 years) and 33.4 y.o. (SD=4.1 years), respectively. The mean gestation age at delivery was 38.9 wks (SD=2.1 wks) vs. 37.9 wks (SD=2.3 wks) and the rate of prematurity equaled 7% vs. 15%, respectively. Regardless the method of conception there is a positive correlation between the CL and the duration of gestation. The regression analysis showed that the significant increase in pregnancy duration was correlated with CL ≥ 35 mm (correlation coefficient greater for spontaneous vs. IVF: rxy=0.418 vs rxy=0.341; p<0.001). All CL parameters of accuracy were better for spontaneous in comparison to IVF pregnancies.
CONCLUSIONS: IVF singleton pregnancy carries additional risk factors for preterm delivery. Therefore mid-gestational cervical length is less sensitive predictor than in spontaneous singleton gestations."
21876969,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21876969/,"OBJECTIVE: Immunosuppressed patients are at risk of microsporidiosis, and this parasitosis has an increased rate of dissemination in this population. Our objective was to evaluate the presence of microsporidiosis and other intestinal parasites in rheumatic disease patients undergoing anti-tumor necrosis factor/disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug treatment.
METHODS: Ninety-eight patients (47 with rheumatoid arthritis, 31 with ankylosing spondylitis and 11 with psoriatic arthritis) and 92 healthy control patients were enrolled in the study. Three stool samples and cultures were collected from each subject.
RESULTS: The frequency of microsporidia was significantly higher in rheumatic disease patients than in control subjects (36 vs. 4%, respectively; p<0.0001), as well as in those with rheumatic diseases (32 vs. 4%, respectively; p<0.0001), ankylosing spondylitis (45 vs. 4%, respectively; p<0.0001) and psoriatic arthritis (40 vs. 4%, respectively; p<0.0001), despite a similar social-economic class distribution in both the patient and control groups (p = 0.1153). Of note, concomitant fecal leukocytes were observed in the majority of the microsporidia-positive patients (79.5%). Approximately 80% of the patients had gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea (26%), abdominal pain (31%) and weight loss (5%), although the frequencies of these symptoms were comparable in patients with and without this infection (p>0.05). Rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis disease activity parameters were comparable in both groups (p>0.05). The duration of anti-tumor necrosis factor/disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs and glucocorticoid use were also similar in both groups.
CONCLUSION: We have documented that microsporidiosis with intestinal mucosa disruption is frequent in patients undergoing concomitant anti-tumor necrosis factor/disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug therapy. Impaired host defenses due to the combination of the underlying disease and the immunosuppressive therapy is the most likely explanation for this finding, and this increased susceptibility reinforces the need for the investigation of microsporidia and implementation of treatment strategies in this population."
21877126,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21877126/,"BACKGROUND: Orthopedic implant infections represent a serious complication for both patient and surgeon. In order to minimize this risk, it has become standard practice in surgery and orthopedics to add antimicrobial substances to the polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) bone cement. The aim of this study is to find new options for preventing infection by using alternative adjuvants in combination with PMMA. We hypothesized, that Octenidine, after being combined with PMMA, can be released in vitro and an antimicrobial efficacy of discharged Octenidine can be shown.
METHODS: The release of Octenidine from PMMA was assessed in high pressure liquid chromatography of the supernatant. In order to assess the efficacy of Octenidine on Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in vitro, a nutrient solution for these bacteria was incubated with a defined number of these bacteria (10(6) colony forming units) and cement pellets containing the antiseptic Octenidine for 24 h. After the incubation the number of bacteria in the solution was determined by counting the colony forming units on blood agar plates.
RESULTS: Octenidine was shown to be released in a concentration-dependent manner from PMMA in the elution experiment. The experimental procedure using S. aureus demonstrated a bactericidal effect for bone cement containing Octenidine. For P. aeruginosa, bone cement containing 5-8% Octenidine was associated with tenfold reduction in bacterial count.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that Octenidine is released after combining it with PMMA and reaches working concentrations in vitro. These findings suggest a new and effective alternative for prevention of infection in cemented implants. Further investigations on the biocompatibility of this combination is needed."
21877377,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21877377/,"INTRODUCTION: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been approved as an appropriate radiological modality for temporomandibular joint (TMJ) diagnosis, whereas the results of international multicenter studies impressively show the limitations of static three-dimensional MRI. The state of the art for dynamic imaging of the TMJ in real-time are TrueFISP sequences in one sagittal plane. In order to support the diagnostics, a computer-assisted visualization procedure has been developed by the authors for both the static and dynamic MRI.
METHODS: A number of validated sequences are available for the static 3D-MRI within the clinical routine. For dynamic MRI in real-time, True-FISP sequences in one sagittal plane with a slice thickness of 5-10 mm and 1.3 mm x 1.3 mm spatial resolution were applied. Both the dynamic and static MRI datasets are animated and visualized using the computer-assisted procedure.
RESULTS: The computer-assisted procedure reliably supported the clinical diagnosis, especially the visibility of the articular disc was enhanced. On the basis of the static MRI, a 60-year-old patient was diagnosed with anterior disc displacement without reduction. In contrast, by the dynamic MRI, it was recognized how the articular disc was firstly somehow stretched and flattened before the mandibular condyle again glided under the disc, thus resulting in an anterior disc displacement with reduction.
CONCLUSION: These results endorse the relevance of real-time diagnosis for the TMJ. The computer-assisted visualization has been approved as a reliable help for clinical diagnosis."
21878008,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21878008/,"INTRODUCTION: The Australian Government has provided $20 million to establish the Population Health Research Network (PHRN), with representation from all States and Territories to facilitate population health research through data linkage. Health LinQ is part of the Queensland node involving four Queensland universities, Queensland Health and the Australian e-Health Research Centre.
METHOD: This paper reviews the potential for using administrative databases to study the mental health experience of Indigenous Queenslanders. Researchers can define cohorts for study within the administrative data or link them to their own data. Robust protocols preserve confidentiality so that researchers only receive anonymized data. Indigenous status can be defined either through place of residence or through the recording of Indigenous status in datasets such as the Queensland Hospital Admitted Patient Data Collection.
RESULTS: Available data include hospital morbidity, mental health data and mortality. Indigenous status is correctly identified in about 89% of cases with variation by definition used.
CONCLUSIONS: Administrative data provide researchers and decision makers with accessible, cost-effective information without the intrusion and cost of additional data collection. These techniques are especially useful in studying regional, rural and remote populations where access may be difficult."
21878238,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21878238/,"BACKGROUND: The recommended therapy for mild gallstone pancreatitis is cholecystectomy on initial hospitalization.
METHODS: Using a 5% national Medicare sample (1996-2005), we evaluated adherence to current recommendations for gallstone pancreatitis (cholecystectomy rates on initial hospitalization and the use of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography [ERCP]/sphincterotomy). We evaluated predictors of cholecystectomy, gallstone-related readmissions, and 2-year mortality.
RESULTS: Adherence to current guidelines was low. Only 57% of 8,452 Medicare beneficiaries presenting to an acute care hospital with a first episode of mild gallstone pancreatitis underwent cholecystectomy on initial hospitalization. Of the patients who did not undergo cholecystectomy, 55% were never evaluated by a surgeon. Likewise, only 28% of patients who did not undergo cholecystectomy had a sphincterotomy. The 2-year readmission rates were higher among patients who did not undergo cholecystectomy (44% vs 4%; P < .0001), and 33% of these patients required cholecystectomy after discharge. In the no cholecystectomy group, ERCP prevented readmissions (hazard ratio, 0.53; 95% confidence interval, 0.47-0.61) and when readmissions occurred they were less likely to be for gallstone pancreatitis in patients who had an ERCP (27.8% vs 53.2%; P < .0001). On multivariate analysis, patients who were older, black, admitted to a nonsurgical service, lived in certain US regions, and had specific comorbidities were less likely to undergo cholecystectomy.
CONCLUSION: Adherence to current recommendations for the management of mild gallstone pancreatitis is low in older patients. Our data suggest that >40% of patients who did not undergo cholecystectomy would have benefited from early definitive therapy. Implementation of policies to increase adherence to guidelines would prevent gallstone-related morbidity and mortality in older patients."
21878481,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21878481/,"UNLABELLED: This work investigated whether (18)F-FDG PET standardized uptake value (SUV) is stable over time in the normal human liver.
METHODS: The SUV-versus-time curve, SUV(t), of (18)F-FDG in the normal human liver was derived from a kinetic model analysis. This derivation involved mean values of (18)F-FDG liver metabolism that were obtained from a patient series (n = 11), and a noninvasive population-based input function was used in each individual.
RESULTS: Mean values (±95% reliability limits) of the (18)F-FDG uptake and release rate constant and of the fraction of free tracer in blood and interstitial volume were as follows: K = 0.0119 mL·min(-1)·mL(-1) (±0.0012), k(R) = 0.0065·min(-1) (±0.0009), and F = 0.21 mL·mL(-1) (±0.11), respectively. SUV(t) (corrected for (18)F physical decay) was derived from these mean values, showing that it smoothly peaks at 75-80 min on average after injection and that it is within 5% of the peak value between 50 and 110 min after injection.
CONCLUSION: In the normal human liver, decay-corrected SUV(t) remains nearly constant (with a reasonable ±2.5% relative measurement uncertainty) if the time delay between tracer injection and PET acquisition is in the range of 50-110 min. In current clinical practice, the findings suggest that SUV of the normal liver can be used for comparison with SUV of suspected malignant lesions, if comparison is made within this time range."
21878819,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21878819/,"AIM: : To investigate the association of intraocular pressure (IOP) asymmetry with undiagnosed primary glaucoma in rural and urban populations of south India.
METHODS: Chennai Glaucoma Study is a population-based cross-sectional study. The participants were adults, 40 years or older. The prevalence of primary glaucoma was defined using International Society of Geographical and Epidemiological Ophthalmology classification. IOP asymmetry was diagnosed when the difference in IOP between 2 eyes was >3 mm Hg. Analysis included only bilaterally phakic subjects. We excluded subjects with known glaucoma, secondary glaucoma, pseudoexfoliation, ocular trauma, and ocular surgery.
RESULTS: Of 6310 subjects, 3052 (48.4%) were rural residents. The mean age was 52 (standard deviation: 9.5) years. The prevalence of IOP asymmetry increased steadily with increasing patient age. The prevalence of undiagnosed primary glaucoma was 3.4% (95% confidence interval, 2.9-3.8). Undiagnosed primary glaucoma was 3 times more common in subjects with IOP asymmetry than without (odds ratio 3.08, 95% confidence interval, 2.1-4.3). The specificity of IOP asymmetry in detecting undiagnosed primary glaucoma was 92%.
CONCLUSIONS: IOP asymmetry of >3 mm Hg has limited accuracy for the detection of undiagnosed primary glaucoma. The criterion should be combined with other indicators of glaucoma to build the pretest probability of the disease."
21878829,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21878829/,"OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the study were to investigate the attitudes and practices of pediatric emergency department (PED) physicians (MDs), MD extenders (MD's assistants [PAs], nurse practitioners [NPs]), and nurses (RNs) regarding their counseling of alcohol-using adolescent PED patients and to determine which, if any, PED clinician characteristics predict current counseling practice.
METHODS: An Internet-based survey of PED clinicians (MDs, PAs, NPs, and RNs) from 11 academic US PEDs was conducted. Respondents were asked about their counseling training, current counseling practices, confidence in their counseling skills, importance of counseling, attitudes and beliefs about counseling, and demographic information. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine the relationship between clinician characteristics and counseling practice.
RESULTS: Counseling practice was strongly associated with one's profession; PED MDs/PAs/NPs reported significantly higher rates of counseling alcohol-using adolescents than PED RNs. These 2 groups differed significantly in terms of counseling training and experience. Counseling training and experience remained significant predictors of counseling practice, even after controlling for profession and other covariates. Both groups had similar views on the importance of counseling, confidence in their ability to counsel, and counseling substance-using adolescent PED patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric ED MDs/PAs/NPs differ significantly from PED RNs in their counseling training, experience, and practice. These findings have important implications for the training and support necessary to successfully implement PED counseling. Specifically, formal training in counseling during professional schooling and garnering counseling experience after completing training may be critical factors in promoting PED counseling."
21879268,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21879268/,"BACKGROUND: The evaluation of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) from a patient with lobular breast cancer is challenging. Metastatic lobular cancer is difficult to identify in SLNs because of its low-grade cytomorphology and its tendency to resemble lymphocytes. Intraoperative imprint cytology (IIC) is a rapid, reliable method for evaluating SLNs intraoperatively. We sought to reexamine our experience with this technique in the identification of invasive lobular breast cancer SLN metastases.
METHODS: A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database of IIC results of 1010 SLN mapping procedures for breast cancer was performed. From this cohort we reviewed SLN cases of lobular cancer. The SLNs were evaluated intraoperatively by bisecting the SLN. Imprints were made of each cut surface and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Diff-Quik. Permanent sections were evaluated with up to 4 H&E-stained levels and cytokeratin immunohistochemistry. IIC results were compared with final pathologic results.
RESULTS: A total of 67 cases of pure invasive lobular cancer were identified. The sensitivity was 71%, specificity was 100%, and accuracy was 92%. No statistically significant differences in sensitivity, specificity, or accuracy were identified between the intraoperative detection of lobular carcinoma vs ductal carcinoma. The specificity has remained the same since 2004. However the accuracy (82% vs 92%; P = .09) and sensitivity (52% vs 71%; P = .02) has improved since 2004.
CONCLUSIONS: As we have previously shown, the sensitivity and specificity of IIC in evaluating lobular carcinoma is feasible and accurate. IIC continues to be a viable alternative to frozen section for intraoperative evaluation."
21879275,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21879275/,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of screening for the detection of Lynch syndrome (LS) in an unselected population undergoing surgery for a colorectal cancer.
METHODS: A total of 1,040 patients were prospectively included between 2005 and 2009. LS screening modalities included the Bethesda criteria, immunochemistry (IHC) for MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6, and microsatellite instability (MSI) by using pentaplex markers. Promoter methylation was assessed in tumors with a loss of MLH1 expression. Gene sequencing was offered to patients with abnormal IHC or MSI status without promoter methylation.
RESULTS: A total of 105 patients had an abnormal result: 102 (9.8%) exhibited a loss of protein on IHC and 98 (9.4%) had MSI. A discordant result was observed in 10 patients with eventual proven LS in 6 patients. Loss of MLH1 (n = 64) was due to promoter methylation in 43 patients (67.2%). Overall, of 62 patients with an abnormal result, 38 had genetic sequencing leading to 25 (65.8%) identified with a germ-line mutation. Loss of MSH2 on IHC was associated with a mutation in 78.3% (18 of 23) of cases. Among the 62 patients with abnormal results, 23 (37.1%) did not meet the Bethesda criteria.
CONCLUSIONS: Strict application of the Bethesda criteria does not lead to identification of all patients with LS. IHC and MSI testing are complementary methods and should be used in association to identify potential LS patients."
21879403,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21879403/,"BACKGROUND: The treatment of comminuted proximal humerus fractures in older patients is challenging. Variable values of functional outcomes scores, ROMs, patient satisfaction, and bony healing have been reported with conventional techniques, including open reduction and internal fixation, percutaneous pinning, and hemiarthroplasty. Another alternative is reverse total shoulder arthroplasty, although it is unclear whether this provides better ROM or function.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We (1) evaluated ROM, pain level, and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores of patients who had a reverse total shoulder arthroplasty for displaced three- and four-part proximal humerus fracture and (2) identified clinical and radiographic complications from the procedure.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 30 patients in three institutions who had undergone a primary reverse total shoulder arthroplasty for displaced three- or four-part proximal humerus fractures. Mean age was 77 years (range, 65-94 years). Minimum followup was 12 months (mean, 23 months; range, 12-36 months).
RESULTS: Mean postoperative American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score was 78 (range, 36-98), mean active forward flexion was 139° (range, 90°-180°), and mean active external rotation was 27° (range, 0°-45°). Mean American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons pain score was 0.7 (range, 0-5) and mean visual analog scale pain score was 1.1 (range, 0-5). Complications were identified in three of 30 patients (10%).
CONCLUSIONS: At short term, reverse total shoulder arthroplasty relieved pain and improved function. The complication rate compared favorably with those reported for other treatment alternatives.

21879410,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21879410/,"BACKGROUND: Total joint arthroplasty is widely performed in patients of all races with severe osteoarthritis. Prior studies have reported that African American patients tend to receive total joint arthroplasties in low-volume hospitals compared with Caucasian patients, suggesting potential racial disparity in the quality of arthroplasty care.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked whether (1) a hospital outcome measure of risk-adjusted mortality or complication rate within 90 days of primary TKA can be directly used to profile hospital quality of care, and (2) African Americans were more likely to receive TKAs at low-quality hospitals (or hospitals with higher risk-adjusted outcome rate) compared with Caucasian patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We developed a risk-adjusted, 90-day postoperative outcome measure to identify high-, intermediate-, and low-quality hospitals based on patient records in the Medicare Provider Analysis and Review files between July 1, 2002, and June 30, 2005 (the first cohort). We then analyzed a second cohort of African American and Caucasian patients receiving Medicare who underwent primary TKAs between July and December 2005 to determine the independent impact of race on admissions to high-, intermediate-, and low-quality hospitals.
RESULTS: The risk-adjusted postoperative mortality/complication rate varied substantially across hospitals; hospitals can be meaningfully categorized into quality groups. In the second cohort of admissions, 8% of African American patients (n = 4894) versus 9.2% of Caucasian patients (n = 86,705) were treated in high-quality hospitals whereas 14.7% of African American patients versus 12.7% of Caucasians patients were treated in low-quality hospitals. After controlling for patient demographic, socioeconomic, geographic, and diagnostic characteristics, the odds ratio for admission to low-quality hospitals was 1.28 for African American patients compared with Caucasian patients (95% CI, 1.18-1.41).
CONCLUSIONS: Among elderly Medicare beneficiaries undergoing TKA, African American patients were more likely than Caucasian patients to be admitted to hospitals with higher risk-adjusted postoperative rates of complications or mortality. Future work is needed to address the residential, social, and referring factors that underlie this disparity and implications for outcomes of care."
21879412,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21879412/,"BACKGROUND: Preventing pulmonary embolism is a priority after major musculoskeletal surgery. The literature contains discrepant data regarding the influence of anticoagulation on the incidence of pulmonary embolism after joint arthroplasty. The American College of Chest Physicians guidelines recommend administration of oral anticoagulants (warfarin), aiming for an international normalized ratio (INR) level between 2 and 3. However, recent studies show aggressive anticoagulation (INR > 2) can lead to hematoma formation and increased risk of subsequent infection.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked whether an INR greater than 2 protects against pulmonary embolism.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified 9112 patients with 10,122 admissions for joint arthroplasty between 2004 and 2008. All patients received warfarin for prophylaxis, aiming for an INR level of 2 or lower. We assessed 609 of 10,122 admissions (6%) for pulmonary embolism using CT, ventilation/perfusion scan, or pulmonary angiography, and 163 of 10,122 admissions (1.6%) had a proven pulmonary embolism.
RESULTS: Fifteen of 163 admissions (9%) had an INR greater than 2 before or on the day of workup compared to 35 of 446 admissions (8%) who were negative. We observed no difference between the INR values in patients with or without pulmonary embolism.
CONCLUSIONS: We found no clinically relevant difference in the INR values of patients who did or did not develop pulmonary embolism. The risk of bleeding should be weighed against the risk of pulmonary embolism when determining an appropriate target INR for each patient, as an INR less than 2 may reduce the risk of bleeding while still protecting against pulmonary embolism.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, therapeutic study. See Instructions to Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence."
21879424,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21879424/,"BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) epidemiology varies widely across surgical procedures. At present, there are few epidemiologic reports regarding VTE in Japan. Japanese VTE prophylaxis guidelines recommend a risk-based approach based on previous epidemiologic statistics. VTE includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). PE prevention is the main goal, although the relation between PE and DVT is still controversial.
METHODS: We collected administrative data for 1,016,496 surgical patients from 260 hospitals. We analyzed DVT and PE incidence and selected two subgroups for further analysis: gastroenterologic surgery and specific orthopedic surgery (high-frequency group).
RESULTS: Overall DVT incidence was 1947 (0.19%); and the PE incidence was 538 (0.05%). DVT case fatality rate was 3.44% (67/1947); that for PE was 22.86% (123/538). Both overall and subgroup incidences were comparable to those in previous reports. Subgroup analyses in the high-frequency group did not show a relation between DVT and PE. VTE prophylaxis did not show a relation between DVT and PE despite 82.0% [corrected] adherence.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results are consistent with established data regarding DVT and PE incidence. Administrative data available in Japan provides a powerful epidemiologic tool to characterize rare diseases such as DVT and PE. DVT is not a suitable quality indicator in Japan. However, PE is too rare to be considered a rate-based outcome indicator, and VTE prophylaxis is [corrected] widely applied to be used as a process indicator. VTE measurement is not a useful quality indicator in Japan to compare hospitals but provides a longitudinal self-survey."
21879469,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21879469/,"BACKGROUND: The relation between thyroid neoplasms and chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (CLT) is controversial. While it is accepted that focal lymphocytic thyroiditis develops secondarily to malignancy, it is not clear whether diffuse lymphocytic thyroiditis has a tendency to develop into thyroid cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the relation between CLT and malignant tumours of the thyroid and evaluate the surgical approach to CLT cases.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this study, 917 patients operated on for thyroid diseases were investigated retrospectively. Seventy-seven (8.4%) patients histopathologically diagnosed as having CLT (either non-specific or Hashimoto's thyroiditis) were investigated for any concurrent malignant neoplasm. Fifteen patients in whom CLT and thyroid malignancy were coexisting were included in the study.
RESULTS: In the pathological evaluation of 917 cases, malignancy in the thyroid was found in 97 (10.6%) cases. Seventy-seven cases were categorised as CLT. Of these 77, 16 (20.8%) were Hashimoto's thyroiditis (specific CLT) and the other 61 (79.2%) were non-specific CLT. In 15 cases, thyroid malignancy was found to be concurrent with CLT. Of the malignities, nine (60%) were papillary carcinoma, three (20%) medullar carcinoma, one (6.6%) follicular carcinoma, one (6.6%) Hurthle cell carcinoma, and one (6.6%) lymphoma. In our series, the rate of the development of malignancy against the background of CLT was 19.48%, while the rate in the groups without CLT was 9.76%, with a statistically significant difference between the groups (p = 0.008).
CONCLUSIONS: CLT cases should be evaluated more carefully in terms of malignancy. If a nodule is detected on thyroiditis, the minimal surgical intervention should be lobectomy. Total thyroidectomy should be considered as preferable to subtotal thyroidectomy because of its many advantages such as controlling thyroiditis, removing the probability of reoperation, and hormonal stability."
21879942,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21879942/,"PURPOSE: To examine if a mass media campaign influenced walking differently in people in different physical environments.
DESIGN: Quasi-experimental study. Setting . Wheeling, West Virginia.
PARTICIPANTS: Random sample of adults age 50 to 65 years, response rate: 72.1% (n  =  719 in intervention community, n  =  753 in comparison community).
INTERVENTION: Mass media campaign.
MEASURES: Self-reported measures were used in before and after telephone surveys for walking and the physical environment. Measures included 11 environmental walkability items, from which two subscales (i.e., usable sidewalks/aesthetics and facilities) were extracted.
ANALYSIS: Multiple linear regression.
RESULTS: Overall, walking increased by 2.7 minutes per week (standard deviation [SD]  =  231.1, not significant [NS]). When confined to those insufficiently active at baseline (i.e., <30 minutes per day) the minutes walked increased by 92.1 minutes (SD  =  152.9, p < .001). For the insufficiently active at baseline in the top half of the environmental factor of usable sidewalks, walking increased by 19 minutes more than in the bottom half (NS). For the factor of aesthetics and facilities, people in the more walkable environment increased walking by 87 minutes more than those in the bottom half (p < .001).
CONCLUSION: In this community-wide physical activity, intervention changes in walking after the campaign were significantly moderated by some environmental attributes. This contributes to the limited evidence on the impact of the environment in enhancing community physical activity interventions. This finding needs to be replicated in other community interventions with greater environmental variation."
21880024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21880024/,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the pattern of labor progression among second parous women who had a vaginal birth after a cesarean (VBAC) compared with primiparous and multiparous women who delivered vaginally.
DESIGN: Case-control study.
SETTING: University hospital in Israel, August 2005 through November 2008.
POPULATION: The cases were all 137 second parous women who had a VBAC during the study period. The control groups were: (1) 136 primiparous women; and (2) 137 women who had a second repeated vaginal delivery.
METHODS: Data were extracted from the electronic medical records at admission, labor charts and medical records at discharge. Controls were frequency-matched to the study group for maternal age, gestational age and the work shift during which the delivery occurred.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Length of the active phase of labor. Secondary outcomes were length of the second stage and incidence of vacuum extraction deliveries. Results. The length of the active phase was 176 ± 116, 207 ± 121 and 110 ± 66 minutes in the study, first and second control groups, respectively. The active phase and stage 2 of the study group were significantly shorter than in the first control group (p=0.02 and p=0.007, respectively) and longer than in the second control group (p=0.001 in both stages). The incidence of vacuum deliveries was higher (p=0.001) in the study group (13.9%) compared with the second control group (1.5%).
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the pattern of labor progression among second parous women undergoing a trial of labor after cesarean differs from second parous women undergoing a repeated vaginal delivery. Recognizing this dissimilarity may help in avoiding unnecessary, occasionally deleterious, interventions."
21880064,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21880064/,"REASONS FOR PERFORMING STUDY: Postural balance can be quantified using stabilographic variables derived from force plate data that describe movements of the horse's centre of pressure (COP) in the horizontal plane. Most force plates are not large enough to accommodate all 4 limbs of a standing horse, so the study was designed to assess whether representative stabilographic data could be collected from the forelimbs or hindlimbs.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether stabilographic data from either the forelimbs or the hindlimbs were representative of data for the total body.
METHODS: Stabilographic data (960 Hz) were collected from 17 sound horses standing with the forelimbs and the hindlimbs on separate force plates. To increase variability in the data, horses were of different sizes, the recording duration was varied (15-60 s) and data were collected under sighted and blindfolded conditions.
RESULTS: Correlation matrices indicated that total body stabilographic variables were highly significantly correlated with both forelimb and hindlimb data but correlation coefficients were higher for forelimb data. Forward stepwise regression selected forelimb data for inclusion in the model for 15/16 variables, the exception being mean absolute mediolateral velocity.
CONCLUSIONS: Ground reaction force data from a pair of limbs, preferably the forelimbs, can be used to measure variables that represent total body postural balance in sound standing horses.
POTENTIAL RELEVANCE: Stabilographic data from either the forelimbs or hindlimbs may be useful for detecting and quantifying deficiencies in postural balance in ataxic horses."
21880563,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21880563/,"OBJECTIVE: To undertake a systematic review of the literature to determine whether Asian ethnicity is an independent risk factor for severe perineal trauma in childbirth.
METHOD: Ovid Medline, CINAHL, and Cochrane databases published in English were used to identify appropriate research articles from 2000 to 2010, using relevant terms in a variety of combinations. All articles included in this systematic review were assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) 'making sense of evidence' tools.
FINDINGS: Asian ethnicity does not appear to be a risk factor for severe perineal trauma for women living in Asia. In contrast, studies conducted in some Western countries have identified Asian ethnicity as a risk factor for severe perineal trauma. It is unknown why (in some situations) Asian women are more vulnerable to this birth complication. The lack of an international standard definition for the term Asian further undermines clarification of this issue. Nevertheless, there is an urgent need to explore why Asian women are reported to be significantly at risk for severe perineal trauma in some Western countries.
CONCLUSION: Current research on this topic is confusing and conflicting. Further research is urgently required to explore why Asian women are at risk for severe perineal trauma in some birth settings."
21880998,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21880998/,"BACKGROUND: In acute lacunar infarction, MRI may overestimate eventual infarct size and the imaging evolution of acute lesions is not fully understood. Our objective was to examine eventual infarct size, the incidence of cavity formation, and factors associated with cavitation in patients presenting with acute lacunar infarction.
METHODS: Patients with acute diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) infarcts ≤25 mm in diameter, in the distribution of a penetrating artery, who had a follow-up MRI or CT at least 1 month or longer from stroke onset were retrospectively included. We measured baseline lesion size on DWI and T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and follow-up lesion size on T2/FLAIR and CT. Follow-up MRI and CT images were assessed for cavity formation. Predictors for cavitation were assessed in a multivariate model.
RESULTS: We identified 75 patients with lacunar infarction and follow-up CT or MRI, done 20.2 ± 16.6 and 21.2 ± 17.4 months after stroke, respectively. Mean baseline DWI size was 13.5 ± 5.7 and T2/FLAIR size was 13.1 ± 5.3 mm. Follow-up T2/FLAIR lesion size was 8.2 ± 3.4 mm and smaller than baseline DWI and T2/FLAIR (p = <0.001). Follow-up whole lesion size on CT scan was 7.1 ± 4.1 and smaller than baseline DWI and T2/FLAIR (p = 0.001). Cavitation occurred in 23/38 (61%) MRI and 50/70 (70%) CT scans. We identified periventricular white matter lesions as a predictor of cavity formation by MRI and CT.
CONCLUSION: Acute DWI significantly overestimates final infarct size. A third of lacunar infarcts do not develop a cavity."
21881055,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21881055/,"BACKGROUND: Providing effective pain control is a critical part of dental treatment, yet achieving consistently reliable anesthesia in the mandible has proved elusive. The traditional inferior alveolar nerve block (IANB) has a high failure rate; for example, the failure rate in lateral incisors is 81 percent. As a consequence, new approaches and techniques have been developed. The purpose of this supplement to The Journal of the American Dental Association is to determine whether the mandibular nerve block has become passé.
CONCLUSIONS: The high failure rate of the IANB can be frustrating for dentists and lead to discomfort for the patient during treatment. The reasons for this high failure rate include thickness of the cortical plate of bone in adults, thickness of the soft tissue at the injection site leading to increased needle deflection, the difficulty of locating the inferior alveolar nerve and the possibility of accessory innervation. Although the IANB can be unreliable, it is used commonly to provide mandibular anesthesia.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Pain control is an essential part of dental treatment. Alternative injection techniques and devices that can help increase the success rate of mandibular anesthesia are available."
21881374,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21881374/,"PURPOSE: We examined the influence of inflammatory cytokine levels on postoperative early recurrence in patients who underwent curative lung cancer surgery.
METHODS: In 107 patients who underwent curative pulmonary resections for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from November 2007 to June 2008, we measured serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels preoperatively, and on postoperative day (POD) 0, 1, and 2. Between July 2009 and August 2009, 1 year after the date of enrollment of the last patient, we investigated survival status of each patient and identified a group with recurrence.
RESULTS: Among 107 patients, 29 patients developed recurrence with a mean follow-up of 18.1 months (range 14 to 21). P-stage was significantly more advanced in the recurrence group than in the non-recurrence group (p = 0.005). Serum IL-6 levels on POD 1 were significantly higher in the recurrence group than in the non-recurrence group (p = 0.007). In Cox's proportional hazards regression, P-stage and serum IL-6 levels on POD 1 were significant independent predicting factors for postoperative early recurrence (p = 0.006, p = 0.003).
CONCLUSIONS: The higher the serum IL-6 levels on POD 1, the higher the risk of early postoperative recurrence, even when curative pulmonary resection can be accomplished in lung cancer patients."
21881813,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21881813/,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the characteristics of normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism (NPHPT) in patients seen for osteoporosis evaluation.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined the records of 156 women who came to the hospital to be screened for osteoporosis. Measurements of total calcium, PTH, 25-hydroxy vitamin D, and β-C-telopeptide were recorded. Bone mineral density and T-scores were evaluated by densitometry of the lumbar spine, femoral neck and distal one-third of the radius. The latter was only measured in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. Nephrolithiasis and bone fractures were documented by a review of the medical records.
RESULTS: We identified 14 patients with NPHPT, accounting for 8.9% of the population studied. In the medical records, the occurrence of kidney stones was reported in 28.6% of the patients with NPHPT, in contrast with only 0.7% of the noncarriers. Regarding the presence of general fractures, 21.4% of the patients with NPHPT were affected versus 16.2% of noncarriers.
CONCLUSION: Data from our study suggest that NPHPT has a diverse phenotypic presentation, implying that this may not be an ""indolent"" disease."
21881894,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21881894/,"BACKGROUND-AIM: C-reactive protein (CRP) is directly implicated in atherogenesis and associated cardiovascular morbidity in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Effective continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment has been shown to gradually decrease CRP levels and thus consequently improve disease-related cardiovascular morbidity. However, the influence of gender on the CRP evolution pattern has never been assessed before. The aim of our study was to investigate possible gender differences in CRP evolution in OSA patients 3 and 6 months after the start of effective CPAP treatment.
METHODS: The study population consisted of 436 patients (252 males/184 females) with newly diagnosed moderate to severe OSA and good CPAP compliance assessed by a thorough follow up. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) was assessed before CPAP initiation and at the third and sixth month of the follow-up period.
RESULTS: C-reactive protein values showed a statistically significant decrease at the third and sixth month of CPAP therapy [initial values 0.79 ± 0.65 mg/dL versus 0.70 ± 0.52 mg/dL (p < 0.05) after 3 months and 0.30 ± 0.33 mg/dL (p < 0.001) after 6 months of CPAP therapy]. When patients were divided into males and females, the above evolution pattern was changed. At the third month time point, the CRP values showed a statistically significant decrease only in males (from 0.74 ± 0.53 mg/dL to 0.61 ± 0.5 mg/dL, p < 0.01) while females showed only minimal and insignificant changes (from 0.87 ± 0.79 mg/dL to 0.83 ± 0.51 mg/dL, p > 0.05). After 6 months' treatment, CRP decreased significantly in both genders (males from 0.74 ± 0.53 mg/dL to 0.28 ± 0.32 mg/dL, p < 0.001 and females from 0.87 ± 0.79 mg/dL to 0.34 ± 0.36 mg/dL, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest a delay in the normalization of CRP levels in females despite effective CPAP treatment. A time period of at least 6 months appeared to be required in women in order to reduce CRP levels and consequent cardiovascular risk. In contrast, CPAP's protective role in males is achieved at an earlier time point. Gender-related hormonal and genetic factors may influence the above CRP evolution pattern."
21881930,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21881930/,"BACKGROUND: Demographic development and changes in healthcare utilization have led to a rising number of calls for emergency services. In Germany life-threatening situations are responded by physician-staffed ambulances in a 2-tier system whereas paramedic-staffed ambulances are dispatched in non-life-threatening emergencies. A nationwide protocol guides dispatchers in triage decisions. In the years 1999 to 2009 a continuous rise in the number of calls for a physician-staffed ambulance in Münster was recorded. The degree of healthcare utilization according to socioeconomic status and age structure was retrospectively examined.
METHODS: For the year 2006 all emergency calls in the City of Münster responded to by physician-staffed ambulances were analyzed. Each call was assigned to 1 of the 45 urban districts. The local incidence of emergency calls (calls/100 residents/year) was determined and compared to the socioeconomic status which was defined as the percentage of welfare and unemployment benefit recipients per district. Patient condition was assessed by the Munich National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (M-NACA) score. This scoring system allows calls to be allocated to either life-threatening conditions or non-life-threatening conditions by objective vital parameters. The age structure of the emergency callers was also examined.
RESULTS: Urban districts with a low socioeconomic status showed a higher incidence of emergency calls requiring physician-staffed ambulance responses than districts with a high socioeconomic status. Measured by the M-NACA scoring system, the fraction of life-threatening emergencies among all calls proved to be equal to districts with a high socioeconomic status. A correlation between elderly patients and increasing numbers of life-threatening emergencies was found.
CONCLUSIONS: A low socioeconomic status of an urban district will result in more ambulance responses. However, the proportion of life-threatening emergencies is equal to districts with a high socioeconomic status. Thus, the greater need for physician-staffed ambulance responses matches clinical needs and legitimates current resource use in a 2-tier ambulance system. Indications for the abuse of physician-staffed ambulances were not found. Considering an aging population the number of emergency calls will rise in the future."
21882010,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21882010/,"BACKGROUND: In 2007, great concern arose regarding failure of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) leads from several manufacturers.
OBJECTIVE: Of this analysis was to evaluate the incidence and predictors of Sprint Fidelis lead failure in order to find the best clinical strategy to prevent lead-related adverse events.
METHODS: Four hundred fourteen patients (357 male, 67 ± 12 years) with ICD equipped with right ventricular Sprint Fidelis leads were followed up in our institution.
RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 35 months (25th-75th percentile = 27-47 months) and a total follow-up of 1,231 patient-years, lead failures occurred in 40 of 414 (9.7%) patients. The annual rate was 3.2% per patient-year. Thirty-five (87.5%) failures were caused by pacing-sensing connector fracture. The risk of lead fracture was higher in patients younger than 70 years (odds ratio = 2.31; 95% confidence interval = 1.14-4.68, p = 0.02). Among 30 patients with pacing-sensing conductor failure and available device diagnostics for failure alerting, the diagnostic parameter which first responded to lead failure was the sensing integrity counter in 15 of 30 (50%), pacing impedance in 12 of 30 (40%), and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia in 3 of 30 (10%). The median time (25th-75th percentile) between diagnostics alert and lead failure-related adverse events or failure acknowledgment was 2.2 (0.3-13.0) days. Twenty-two patients suffered inappropriate shocks due to lead failure. In 50% of patients, daily monitoring by device diagnostics would have alerted physicians to impending lead failure at least 1 day in advance.
CONCLUSIONS: Automatic algorithms based on device diagnostics may detect impending lead failure in nearly 50% of cases. Remote monitoring may prevent failure-related adverse events."
21882199,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21882199/,"BACKGROUND: For melanoma patients with a positive axillary SLN, the extent of ALND remains controversial, with debate over whether a level III dissection is needed.
METHODS: We queried our IRB approved prospective database for patients with a positive axillary SLN who had a level I/II dissection only, and compared recurrence and complication rates to the existing literature.
RESULTS: Between 1998 and 2008, 270 patients had 285 level I/II ALNDs for a positive SLN. Median number of SLN removed was 2, while the median number of involved SLN was 1 (range 1-4). An average of 18.7 nodes/ALND were removed, with 13% having positive non-SLN. Post-operative complications occurred in 31 patients (11%), primarily cellulitis (8%). After a mean follow-up of 44 months, 14 patients had a regional recurrence in the axillary basin (5%).
CONCLUSIONS: The complication rate and regional recurrence rate for patients undergoing a level I/II ALND for a positive SLN are either lower than or on par with reported series of ALND for level I, II, and III dissections, suggesting that in this setting, the level III dissection may be of minimal benefit."
21882928,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21882928/,"OBJECT: Children with syndromic or complex craniosynostosis are evaluated for increased intracranial pressure (ICP) using funduscopy to detect papilledema. However, papilledema is a late sign of increased ICP. Because papilledema might be preceded by an increase in optic nerve sheath (ONS) diameter, the authors conducted a prospective study to establish the validity and applicability of measuring the ONS using ultrasonography.
METHODS: From January 2007 to December 2009, 175 bilateral ultrasonography ONS measurements were performed in 128 patients with syndromic or complex craniosynostosis during the daytime. The measurements were correlated with ONS diameter assessed on CT and simultaneous funduscopy, when available. Furthermore, results were compared by using thresholds for ONS diameters on ultrasonography that are available in the literature.
RESULTS: The mean ONS diameter on ultrasonography was 3.1 ± 0.5 mm. The CT measurement was significantly correlated with the ultrasonography measurement (r = 0.41, p < 0.001). The mean ONS diameter in 38 eyes with papilledema was 3.3 ± 0.5 mm, compared with 3.1 ± 0.5 mm in the eyes of patients without papilledema (p = 0.039). Relative to the age-related thresholds, the ONS diameter was too large in 11 eyes (3%), particularly in patients with Crouzon syndrome. Compared with funduscopy, ultrasonography sensitivity was 11%, specificity was 97%, and positive and negative predictive values were 40% and 86%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasonography is a valid and easy way of quantifying the ONS. Although the ONS diameter is larger in children with papilledema, it cannot be used as a daytime screening tool instead of funduscopy. The ONS diameter is possibly a more real-time indicator of ICP."
21883684,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21883684/,"BACKGROUND: Undue parental fear of fever in children was termed ""fever phobia"" by Schmitt following a survey in the USA in 1980. In 2000, Crocetti et al. conducted the same survey and concluded that fever phobia existed even 20 years later. In this study, we explore differences in fever phobia between these two US populations and a Japanese sample, and determine whether parents of a single child or those whose child was previously hospitalized or had a febrile seizure report greater anxiety about fever.
METHODS: A questionnaire was distributed to parents of children who visited a pediatric outpatient clinic in Juntendo University Nerima Hospital between 19 and 30 November 2007.
RESULTS: Data was obtained from 211 parents who agreed to participate in the study. Compared with much smaller proportions reported in the two previous studies, 62% of caregivers considered a temperature below 37.8°C to be a fever, although less than half of parents reported that they were ""very worried"" about fever. Over 90% identified doctors and nurses as their primary information source. In contrast to 7% of parents in the US studies, almost no parents reported that temperatures could rise to or above 43.3°C if fever was left untreated; however, 63% of parents stated that they would visit a hospital.
CONCLUSIONS: Fever phobia exists on both sides of the border, and while caregivers in Japan appear to have a more accurate understanding of fever, they are more likely to rely on health-care professionals to manage the condition."
21883690,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21883690/,"BACKGROUND: The American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines recommend that the total bilirubin (TB)/albumin (Alb) ratio (B/A ratio), instead of serum concentration of unbound bilirubin (UB), can be used with TB for determining treatment modality for jaundiced newborns ≥ 35 weeks of gestation. It is unknown, however, whether the B/A ratio is actually correlated with serum UB.
METHODS: Four hundred and ninety-seven serum samples were obtained from 209 newborns ≥ 35 weeks of gestation, who were admitted to Kobe University Hospital. Serum UB concentration was measured using the glucose oxidase-peroxidase method. Serum TB and Alb concentrations were measured on spectrophotometry. B/A ratios were calculated and were linearly compared with serum UB. Furthermore, the accuracy of the B/A ratio was evaluated.
RESULTS: The B/A ratio was significantly correlated with serum UB concentration. A serum UB concentration of 0.6 µg/dL was in agreement with a B/A ratio of 0.5. For comparison of the number of newborns who had serum UB concentrations ≥ or <0.6 µg/dL and B/A ratios ≥ or <0.5, we found the following characteristics: the concordance rate between serum UB concentrations and the B/A ratio was 94%, sensitivity was 51%, and specificity was 99%.
CONCLUSIONS: The B/A ratio is significantly correlated with serum UB concentration in newborns ≥ 35 weeks of gestation. The B/A ratio, however, is underestimated when serum UB concentrations are >0.6 µg/dL."

DESIGN: Retrospective case series in a tertiary care setting.
PARTICIPANTS: Five eyes of five patients presenting to our clinic with macula-off rhegmatogenous retinal detachment.
METHODS: All patients underwent surgical repair of the retinal detachment, with regular postoperative follow-up, including macular optical coherence tomography and fundus autofluorescence.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Visual acuity and subjective visual symptoms in patients with anatomically successful retinal detachment repair, in whom inadvertent macular translocation was noted.
RESULTS: Our series demonstrates the presence of unintentional macular translocation after retinal detachment repair, detected by fundus autofluorescence imaging. In contrast to previous reports, we document inadvertent macular translocation in one patient after scleral buckling surgery. In each case, the retina was fully reattached postoperatively and no other complications were identified. There was variability in the symptoms and objective visual outcomes after surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: Inadvertent macular translocation can occur following repair of macula-off retinal detachment, and may be a significant contributor to poorer visual outcome after retinal detachment, despite objective surgical success."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Records of 2570 patients with bladder cancer treated from 1995 to 2005 were reviewed. Only patients diagnosed with T1HG disease were included in the analysis. Collected variables included various clinicopathological parameters, use of statins, smoking, as well as dates of recurrence, progression, radical cystectomy and death. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) and worsening-free survival (WFS) were analyzed. Multivariate Cox proportional regression analysis was employed to verify the prognostic significance of various variables.
RESULTS: In total, 278 (10.8%) patients were identified as having T1HG disease on transurethral resection. 66% of patients who recurred, and 36.3% developed stage progression after a median (range) follow-up of 3 (0.1-15.4) years. 30% patients who underwent radical cystectomy, and 9% were dead of disease. The 5-year RFS and WFS rates were 26.6% and 49.4%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, only non-trigonal tumour location, restaging transurethral resection, history of previous carcinoma not invading bladder muscle and adjuvant bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) therapy were significantly associated with prolonged RFS, whereas papillary tumour architecture, history of previous carcinoma not invading bladder muscle and adjuvant BCG therapy were significantly associated with prolonged WFS.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with T1HG bladder cancer are at a significant risk of progression and death from disease. Primary tumours, sessile architecture and trigonal location are factors associated with a worse outcome and may be used to counsel patients towards early cystectomy."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 50 patients with primary VUR and matched controls drawn from a reference population. Joint mobility was assessed using the Bulbena hypermobility score.
RESULTS: We identified significantly more patients with VUR with generalized joint hypermobility than controls (24% vs 6.7%, P= 0.007).
CONCLUSION: Our findings confirm our clinical observation of an increased rate of joint hypermobility in patients with VUR. We speculate that an altered composition of the connective tissue may contribute to the severity of the (pre-existing) VUR phenotype."
21884025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21884025/,"AIMS: To describe aspirin use in primary and secondary prevention and to determine the incremental costs-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per life year gain (LYG) of aspirin use among subjects with, or at high risk of atherothrombotic disease.
DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: To project the cost-effectiveness of aspirin over 5 years of follow-up, a Markov state transition model was developed with yearly cycles and the following health states: ""Alive"" (post-CAD) and ""Dead."" The model compared current coverage observed among 2361 subjects using the prospective Australian subset of Reduction of Atherothrombosis for continued Health (REACH) registry, and hypothetical situation whereby all subjects assumed to be treated. Costs were calculated based on the Australian government reimbursed data for 2010.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: ICER per LYG for increased use of aspirin.
RESULTS: The use of aspirin in current group varied from 67% to 70%. The base-case analysis showed that increasing aspirin use among subjects with existing CAD in outpatient settings was cost saving, while increasing use of aspirin in primary prevention equated to an ICER of AUD 7126 per LYG.
CONCLUSION: Among subjects with existing CAD aspirin use was shown to be a dominant choice of treatment. However, among patients without existing cardiovascular disease (primary prevention), increased uptake of aspirin was cost effective but with uncertain benefit, with two hemorrhagic bleeding events occurring for every life saved."
21884861,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21884861/,"BACKGROUND: Indian Asians living in the United Kingdom have a >50% higher risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) death compared with native European whites. The mechanisms underlying their excess mortality are not clear, and there are no validated tools capable of identifying this increased risk. The burden of subclinical atherosclerosis detected in the carotid arteries is an established prognosticator for major CVD events. We hypothesized that the increased prevalence of CVD among Indian Asians would be reflected by their having a greater burden of subclinical carotid artery atherosclerosis compared with European whites.
METHODS: We studied 2,288 healthy subjects and 148 patients with known CVD from the London Life Sciences Prospective Population study who underwent carotid ultrasonography for assessment of intima-media thickness (IMT), plaque prevalence, and plaque echogenicity.
RESULTS: The prevalence of CVD was significantly higher among Indian Asians compared with European whites (odds ratio 1.72, 95% CI 1.2-2.3). Intima-media thickness was slightly higher in European whites compared with that of Indian Asians (0.66 vs 0.65 mm, P = .06), reflecting their higher Framingham Risk Score. After adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors, there were no significant differences in IMT, plaque prevalence, or plaque echogenicity between the 2 ethnic groups regardless of CVD status.
CONCLUSION: The burden of carotid atherosclerosis does not identify the markedly increased risk of CVD among United Kingdom Indian Asians. Other markers and mechanisms of disease require investigation in this high-risk group."
21885185,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21885185/,"BACKGROUND: The new classification for split cord malformation, based on the unified theory of embryogenesis includes two types Type I and II defined on the basis of the nature of the medium septum and the state of the dural tube. According to this, these are the only two essential features needed for typing and there is never an overlap between the two main forms. We have described two cases that defy this theory.
CASE REPORT: We present two patients with split cord malformation who appear to have a combination of features specific to Type I and Type II. Both patients had a partial bony spur within a single dural sac.
CONCLUSION: An overlap between the two forms of split cord malformation does exist. The role of meninx primitiva in the formation of median bony septum is debatable."
21885298,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21885298/,"BACKGROUND: Some studies have shown that rotator cuff tendon (RCT) retears occur early after surgery and ultimate failure strength is reached at between 3 and 6 months. However, few clinical studies have been reported to support their theory. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the RCT integrity after repair showed any difference at 6 months and at 19 months postoperatively.
METHODS: Thirty-one patients who underwent complete repair for full-thickness RCT tears that were medium-sized tears or larger and had 2 postoperative follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were included in this study. Retear, fatty degeneration, and muscle atrophy were evaluated during the first and second MRI sessions. Clinical assessment was performed by use of the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, Constant score, and pain visual analog scale preoperatively and at the time of the first and second MRI scans.
RESULTS: The mean time for the two consecutive MRI scans was 5.9 months (range, 3.1-8.3 months) and 19.7 months (range, 10.1-24.3 months). On the first MRI scans, 24 patients had no retear, 5 had partial retears, and 2 had full-thickness retears. In terms of rotator cuff retears, the 2 sets of MRI scans showed exactly the same statuses. The only statistically significant improvement was a reduction in tendinosis on the second MRI scans. In addition, significant improvements in clinical status were observed between the 2 periods.
CONCLUSION: Our study shows that the structural status of RCTs after arthroscopic repair can be assessed at 6 months after surgery. Furthermore, although functional status improved with time after 6 months, the structural status of repaired cuffs remained unchanged."
21886014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21886014/,"OBJECTIVES: Neoadjuvant therapy for the treatment of oesophageal cancer was introduced in an effort to improve prognosis. Response assessment is crucial for the treatment of patients with oesophageal cancer. Currently, ¹⁸F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (¹⁸F-FDG PET) seems to be the best available tool to assess neoadjuvant therapy response in patients with oesophageal cancer. The purpose of this study was to assess the diagnostic value of ¹⁸F-FDG PET for the evaluation of neoadjuvant therapy responses in patients with oesophageal cancer using a meta-analysis. A unified procedure and evaluation standard for ¹⁸F-FDG PET in the assessment of neoadjuvant therapy response should be established.
METHODS: All published English-language studies pertaining to the assessment of neoadjuvant therapy response in patients with oesophageal cancer using ¹⁸F-FDG PET in the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were collected. The methodological quality of the included studies was evaluated according to the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies quality assessment tool. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratios and summary receiver operating characteristic curves were obtained using statistical software.
RESULTS: Thirteen studies included in the meta-analysis fulfilled the inclusion criteria of the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies quality assessment tool. The pooled sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic odds ratios for F-¹⁸FDG PET in the evaluation of neoadjuvant therapy response in patients with oesophageal cancer were 70.3% [95% confidence interval (CI): 64.4-75.8], 70.1% (95% CI: 65.1-74.8) and 9.389 (95% CI: 3.482-25.319), respectively. The area under the curve and the Q value for the summary receiver operating characteristic curve were 0.8244 and 0.7575, respectively.
CONCLUSION: ¹⁸F-FDG PET has some value in the assessment of neoadjuvant therapy response in patients with oesophageal cancer. A 50% reduction in standardized uptake value between pretherapy and posttherapy positron emission tomography scans performed in the first 2 weeks after the initiation of neoadjuvant therapy is the optimal condition for predicting a response to neoadjuvant therapy in patients with oesophageal cancer."
21886069,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21886069/,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the yield of screening patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of consecutive patients with PH seen at our institution from July 1992 to November 2008. We assessed HIV risk factors and history of HIV. We estimated the proportion of patients who tested positive for HIV.
RESULTS: We identified 445 patients with PH who had serologic testing for HIV antibody. The mean age was 63 years, and 66% were women. Of these patients, 224 (50%) were in World Health Organization diagnostic group I, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Only 1 patient (0.2%; 95% confidence interval, 0.0%-1.2%) was positive for HIV, and this was the only patient who had a known history of HIV infection. Ten other patients (2.2%) had risk factors for HIV infection but had negative serologic results. The patient who tested positive for HIV had PAH, yielding an estimated prevalence of positive HIV testing in that subgroup of 0.4% (95% confidence interval, 0.0%-2.5%); 6 other patients with PAH (2.7%) had risk factors for HIV but negative serology.
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study examining the yield of screening patients with PH for HIV using serologic testing. Of the 445 patients tested, only 1 patient was positive for HIV. This patient was known to have risk factors for and exposure to HIV. Patients with PAH should be assessed for risk factors for HIV before testing for HIV in low-risk populations."
21886082,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21886082/,"OBJECTIVES: Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent and has been linked to increased morbidity and mortality. There has been an increase in testing for vitamin D with a concomitant increase in costs. While individual factors are significantly linked to vitamin D status, prior studies have not yielded a model predictive of vitamin D status or 25(OH)D levels. The purpose of this investigation was to determine if a prediction model of vitamin D could be developed using extensive demographic data and laboratory parameters.
METHODS: Patient data from 6 Veterans Administration Medical Centers were extracted from medical charts.
RESULTS: For the 14,920 available patients, several factors including triglyceride level, race, total cholesterol, body mass index, calcium level, and number of missed appointments were significantly linked to vitamin D status. However, these variables accounted for less than 15% of the variance in vitamin D levels. While the variables correctly classified vitamin D deficiency status for 71% of patients, only 33% of those who were actually deficient were correctly identified as deficient.
CONCLUSION: Given the failure to find a sufficiently predictive model for vitamin D deficiency, we propose that there is no substitute for laboratory testing of 25(OH)D levels. A baseline vitamin D 3 daily replacement of 1000-2000 IU initially with further modification based on biannual testing appears to factor in the wide variation in dose response observed with vitamin D replacement and is especially important in high-risk groups such as ethnic minorities."
21886327,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21886327/,"OBJECTIVE: We assessed changes in levels of support for smoke-free bars and restaurants among teens and young adults before and after implementation of a statewide smoke-free law.
METHODS: We measured support for smoke-free bars and restaurants among teens and young adults aged 16-24 years living in Minnesota (n=2,785) and five comparison states (n=404), up to 12 months before and up to six months after Minnesota's smoke-free law went into effect in October 2007. We compared changes in support among three subgroups-Minnesota participants who lived with a previous local smoke-free law, Minnesota participants who did not live with a previous local smoke-free law, and participants from the comparison states-before and after Minnesota's statewide smoke-free law went into effect.
RESULTS: Support for smoke-free restaurants and bars among participants in Minnesota and comparison states increased after Minnesota's smoke-free law went into effect. Minnesotans, both those living with and without a previous local smoke-free law, showed similar increases in support for smoke-free restaurants as participants in comparison states. However, Minnesotans living without a previous local law showed larger increases in support for smoke-free bars than both those in comparison states and those living in Minnesota with a previous local smoke-free law.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study employed a more robust design than similar studies and focused on the teen and young adult population. Our results will help advocates and policy makers demonstrate how public support for smoke-free laws increases following smoke-free legislation, particularly among those who were not previously living with a local smoke-free law."
21887569,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21887569/,"PURPOSE: Haemorrhoidal disease is a rather common disease of unknown cause. A new technique for treating prolapsing haemorrhoids known as the stapled hemorrhoidopexy (SH) or the ""Longo procedure"" is widely used. Serious adverse events were reported in 2000 and some discussion over the syndrome but nothing since.
METHODS: Two hundred and five patients underwent SH by our surgical team at the Interbalkan European Medical Center. Modified SH was performed.
RESULTS: Despite the low incidence of postoperative complications (11/205), 36.58% of patients developed syndrome comprised of urgency to defecate, sensation of anal foreign body and incomplete defecation and mild cramp like anal discomfort, immediately after surgery or in the following 48 h. There is not statistically significant relationship between the presence of the syndrome and the gender, the presence of muscle fibres in the resected ""ring"" the degree of haemorrhoidal disease, age and ring length.
CONCLUSION: Observations led us to conclude that the stapled hemorrhoidopexy syndrome (SHS) is probably caused by the irritating presence of the titanium staples in the rectal mucosa and by the resection itself."
21887659,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21887659/,"BACKGROUND: Since 01.01.2009 in Germany a newborn hearing screening (UNHS) is obligatory for every child. The UNHS is part of the guidelines for the prevention of diseases for children up to 6 years of age (Kinder-Richtlinien). 2 years after its introduction in Bavaria, we now evaluate whether the UNHS has been implemented successfully,and if the quality criteria of the guidelines have been met.
METHODS: In the guidelines details for the procedure and screening quality are given. The UNHS data from the screening facilities in Bavaria were evaluated for process quality criteria like screening coverage, screening method, REFER rate (rate of failed tests) and child age at diagnosis.
RESULTS: More than 96 % of all newborns were screened. The REFER rate for 2010 was 4.5 %. Only 18 % of the controls were done by a paediatric audiologist.In 38.5 % of the newborns an intervention of the screening centre was necessary to assure controlling of a failed screening test. In 2009 the median age at diagnosis for a bilateral hearing loss was 5.5 months, and the start of therapy was 6.2 months.
CONCLUSION: In Bavaria the UNHS was implemented successfully. A tracking system for all children who failed the hearing screening test is pivotal for the early diagnosis of children with bilateral hearing deficiency."
21888476,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21888476/,"OBJECT: Routine postoperative admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) is often considered a necessity in the treatment of patients following elective craniotomy but may strain already limited resources and is of unproven benefit. In this study the authors investigated whether routine postoperative admission to a regular stepdown ward is a safe alternative.
METHODS: Three hundred ninety-four consecutive patients who had undergone elective craniotomy over 54 months at a single institution were retrospectively analyzed. Indications for craniotomy included tumor (257 patients) and transsphenoidal (63 patients), vascular (31 patients), ventriculostomy (22 patients), developmental (13 patients), and base of skull conditions (8 patients). Recorded data included age, operation, reason for ICU admission, medical emergency team (MET) calls, in-hospital mortality, and postoperative duration of stay.
RESULTS: Three hundred forty-three patients were admitted to the regular ward after elective craniotomy, whereas there were 43 planned and 8 unplanned ICU admissions. The most common reasons for planned ICU admissions were anticipated lengthy operations (42%) and anesthetic risks (40%); causes for unplanned ICU admissions were mainly unexpected slow neurological recovery and extensive intraoperative blood loss. Of the 343 regular ward admissions, 10 (3%) required a MET call; only 3 of these MET calls occurred within the first 48 postoperative hours and did not lead to an ICU admission. The overall mortality rate in the investigated cohort was 1%, with no fatalities in patients admitted to the normal ward postoperatively.
CONCLUSIONS: Routine ward admission for patients undergoing elective craniotomies with selective ICU admission appears safe; however, approximately 2% of patients may require a direct postoperative unplanned ICU admission. Patients with anticipated long operation times, extensive blood loss, and high anesthetic risks should be selected for postoperative ICU admission, but further study is needed to determine the preoperative factors that can aid in identifying and caring for these groups of patients."
21888706,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21888706/,"PURPOSE: SUI (Stress Urinary Incontinence) results from sudden increases in intravesical peak pressures exceeding urethral resistance leading to involuntary urine loss. Obesity and smoking are well established reversible risk factors for SUI and may alter intravesical peak pressures. BMI, smoking status, and other clinical factors were studied to determine their relationship to CIPP (maximal Intravesical Peak Pressures generated by Cough) in SUI complaining women.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three hundred nineteen women complaining of SUI were evaluated with medical history and urodynamics. Age, parity, comorbidities, previous surgery, BMI and history of smoking were obtained. The maximal intravesical peak pressures generated by cough (CIPP) and cough leak point pressure (CLPP) were acquired. Univariate and multivariate analysis were conducted.
RESULTS: Current smokers and former smokers had similar CIPP (170cmH₂O and 170cmH₂O; p = 0.5, respectively); Those individuals who had never smoked had significantly lower CIPP (140cmH₂O; p = 0.000 and p = 0.009 respectively). BMI was directly related to CIPP (r = 0.41; p = 0.000). Vaginal deliveries (r = -0.15, p = 0.08) and diabetes (r = 0.15, p = 0.016) were also directly related to CIPP on univariate analysis. Only smoking status (p = 0.000) and BMI (p = 0.000) were independently significantly related to CIPP on multivariate analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Obesity and smoking showed increased CIPP (maximal Intravesical Peak Pressures generated by Cough). While reduced BMI is related to lower CIPP, smoking cessation does not appear to diminish CIPP. These findings suggest that weight loss may reduce incontinence by CIPP modulation. However, the benefits of smoking cessation without additional lifestyle modification, may have no benefit to improve urinary incontinence."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 14 patients with tympanosclerosis and 26 with other forms of chronic otitis media. All patients underwent surgery for chronic otitis media. Mucosal biopsies were taken, and examined for H pylori using the Campylobacter-Like Organism (CLO) test.
RESULTS: Tympanoplasty was performed in 29 patients (72.5 per cent), radical mastoidectomy in eight (20 per cent) and myringoplasty in three (7.5 per cent). The presence of H pylori was tested in all tympanosclerosis biopsies, but in only 26.9 per cent of biopsies from other forms of chronic otitis media. A statistically significant difference in H pylori presence was found (p ≤ 0.01).
CONCLUSION: This study represents a preliminary investigation of the association between H pylori and tympanosclerosis development."
21889079,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21889079/,"INTRODUCTION: The dilemma of extraction vs nonextraction treatment, along with the uncertain potential of orthodontic treatment to control vertical dimensions, still remains among the most controversial issues in orthodontics. The aim of this study was to evaluate 2 contradictory treatment protocols for hyperdivergent Class II Division 1 malocclusion regarding their effectiveness in controlling vertical dimensions.
METHODS: The subjects were retrospectively selected from 2 orthodontic offices that used contrasting treatment protocols. The patients had similar hyperdivergent skeletal patterns, malocclusion patterns, skeletal ages, and sexes. Group A (29 patients) was treated with 4 first premolar extractions and ""intrusive"" mechanics (eg, high-pull headgear), whereas group B (28 patients) was treated nonextraction with no regard to vertical control (eg, cervical headgear, Class II elastics). Twenty-seven landmarks were digitized on lateral cephalometric radiographs before and after treatment, and 14 measurements were assessed. Geometric morphometric methods were also implemented to evaluate size and shape differences.
RESULTS: As expected, the maxillary and mandibular molars translated mesially and the mandibular incisors uprighted in group A but remained approximately unchanged in group B. The vertical positions of the molars and the incisors were similar between groups before and after treatment, although they were altered by treatment or growth. No significant differences were observed in the posttreatment skeletal measurements between the 2 groups, including vertical variables, which remained unaltered. Permutation tests on Procrustes distances between skeletal shapes confirmed these results.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the limitations of conventional orthodontics to significantly alter skeletal vertical dimensions. More important factors are probably responsible for the development and establishment of the vertical skeletal pattern, such as neuromuscular balance and function."
21889193,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21889193/,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to detect differences in overall survival between the 1988 FIGO staging and current staging of uterine carcinosarcomas to determine if revised 2009 staging accurately predicts actual patient survival.
METHODS: From 1988 until 2010, patients with uterine carcinosarcoma were retrospectively identified from tumor registry records. Patients were grouped in both broad stages (1-4) and all FIGO substages in order to detect differences. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) were generated to predict death before the end of the second year post-diagnosis for both the new and revised system. Kaplan Meier estimated median survival time was utilized to compare actual patient survival.
RESULTS: Of 112 patients with carcinosarcoma, 37 patients (33%) had FIGO Stage I disease, 15 patients (13.4%) had Stage II disease, 36 patients (32%) were diagnosed as Stage III, and 24 patients (21.4%) had Stage IV disease. 106 of 112 (94.6%) patients underwent lymphadenectomy (pelvic +/- para-aortic). Four patients (3.6%) were downstaged when utilizing broad staging criteria: 2 patients were downstaged from Stage II to I, and 2 patients were downstaged from Stage III to Stage I and II respectively. When looking at substage, the area under the ROC was 0.67 for the former staging system, and 0.65 for the revised staging. Kaplan-Meier estimated median survival time post-diagnosis was 610 days (95% CI [478,930]).
CONCLUSION: Based upon our reclassification of 112 patients with uterine carcinosarcoma, the revised FIGO staging system does not predict survival more accurately than former staging. Carcinosarcoma has an overall poor prognosis and better indicators of survival are needed."
21889285,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21889285/,"OBJECTIVE: To gain caregivers' insights into the decision-making process in dementia patients with regard to treatment and care.
METHODS: Four focus group interviews (n=29).
RESULTS: The decision-making process consists of three elementary components: (1) identifying an individual's needs; (2) exploring options; and (3) making a choice. The most important phase is the exploration phase as it is crucial for the acceptance of the disease. Furthermore, the decision is experienced more as an emotional choice than a rational one. It is influenced by personal preferences whereas practical aspects do not seem to play a substantial role.
CONCLUSION: Several aspects make decision-making in dementia different from decision-making in the context of other chronic diseases: (1) the difficulty accepting dementia; (2) the progressive nature of dementia; (3) patient's reliance on surrogate decision-making; and (4) strong emotions. Due to these aspects, the decision-making process is very time-consuming, especially the crucial exploration phase.
PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: A more active role is required of both the caregiver and the health care professional especially in the exploration phase, enabling easier acceptance and adjustment to the disease. Acceptance is an important condition for reducing anxiety and resistance to care that may offer significant benefits in the future."
21889560,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21889560/,"RATIONALE: Treatment guidelines for major depressive disorder (MDD) recommend a continuous use of antidepressants for several weeks, while recent meta-analyses indicate that antidepressant efficacy starts to appear within 2 weeks and early treatment nonresponse is a predictor of subsequent nonresponse.
OBJECTIVES: We prospectively compared 8-week outcomes between switching antidepressants and maintaining the same antidepressant in early nonresponders, to generate a hypothesis on possible benefits of early switching strategy.
METHOD: Patients with MDD without any treatment history for the current episode were included. When subjects failed to show an early response (i.e., ≥20% improvement in the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)) to the initial treatment with sertraline 50mg at week 2, they were randomly divided into two groups; in the Continuing group, sertraline was titrated at 50-100mg, whereas sertraline was switched to paroxetine 20-40 mg in the Switching group. A primary outcome measure was a response rate (i.e., ≥50% improvement in the MADRS) at week 8.
RESULTS: Among 132 subjects, 41 subjects showed early nonresponse. The Switching group (n=20) showed a higher rate of responders than the Continuing group (n=21) (75% vs. 19%: p=0.002). Further, the Switching group was also superior in the rate of remitters (total score of ≤10 in the MADRS) (60% vs. 14%: p=0.004) and continuous changes in the MADRS (19.0 vs. 7.5: p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary findings suggest that patients with MDD who fail to show early response to an initial antidepressant may derive benefits from the early switching antidepressants in the acute-phase treatment of depression."
21889813,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21889813/,"AIMS: To examine the relationship between vascular calcification in the foot (FVC) and bone mineral density (BMD) in the heel of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) subjects.
METHODS: 65 subjects with type 2 DM and serum creatinine<125 μmol/l underwent CT scanning of the foot to assess FVC and dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan to assess heel BMD. Routine biochemistry including osteoprotegerin (OPG) and Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) was also carried out.
RESULTS: The proportion of subjects with FVC was 43%, whilst 40% had low BMD (T score<-1.0). Age, neuropathy and 25 hydroxyvitamin D were independent predictors of FVC. Body-weight, eGFR, 25 hydroxyvitamin D, OPG, and total cholesterol were independent predictors of low heel BMD. There was no correlation between albuminuria and BMD or FVC. There was no difference in heel BMD between those with FVC and those without, but those with frank osteoporosis were significantly more likely to have FVC than those with higher BMD.
CONCLUSIONS: There is no clear-cut association between FVC and low BMD in type 2 DM with relatively well-preserved renal function. Age, neuropathy, eGFR, hyperlipidemia, body-weight, 25 hydroxyvitamin D and OPG play a complex role in their pathogenesis."
21889828,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21889828/,"BACKGROUND: Asthma is a chronic, inflammatory disease of the airway, and adrenomedullin (ADM) may have some effects against bronchoconstriction. However, the role(s) of ADM in asthmatic children have not been evaluated yet. The aims of this study were to determine if there are any changes in plasma ADM levels during acute asthma attack, and to search for any association between allergen sensitivity and ADM level in asthmatic children.
METHODS: Twenty-seven children with acute asthma attack, ranging in age from 5 to 15 years were investigated and compared with 20 controls. Plasma ADM levels (ng/mL) were measured by ELISA method.
RESULTS: No significant difference was found in ADM levels between the controls and patients in either the acute attack or remission period. Plasma ADM levels were significantly higher in the acute attack (p=0.043) compared to the remission period in patients who were considered as having a ""severe attack"" according to GINA (Global Initiative for Asthma) classification. There were statistically significant correlations between the patients' AlaTOP and Food Panel 7 levels and plasma ADM levels in the acute attack period (p=0.010, p=0.001, respectively). The ADM levels in patients with a history of atopic dermatitis were significantly higher in the acute attack period compared to those without a history of atopic dermatitis (p=0.007).
CONCLUSION: We speculate that ADM may have a role in children with atopic dermatitis, and may also have a role in the immuno-inflammatory process of asthma."
21890240,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21890240/,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: In Spain, stroke is the leading cause of death in women as well as the leading cause of disability in adults. This translates into a huge human and economic cost. In recent years there have been significant advances both in the treatment of acute stroke and in the neuro-rehabilitation process; however, it is still unclear when the best time is to initiate neurorehabilitation and what the consequences of delaying treatment are. To test the effect of a single day delay in the onset of neurorehabilitation on functional improvement achieved, and the influence of that delay in the rate of institutionalisation at discharge.
METHODS: A retrospective study of patients admitted to Parkwood Hospital's Stroke Neurorehabilitation Unit (UNRHI) (University of Western Ontario, Canada) between April 2005 and September 2008 was performed. We recorded age, Functional Independence Measurement (FIM) score at admission and discharge, the number of days between the onset of stroke and admission to the Neurorehabilitation Unit and discharge destination.
RESULTS: After adjustment for age and admission FIM, we found a significant association between patient functional improvement (FIM gain) and delay in starting rehabilitation. We also observed a significant correlation between delay in initiating therapy and the level of institutionalisation at discharge.
CONCLUSIONS: A single day delay in starting neurorehabilitation affects the functional prognosis of patients at discharge. This delay is also associated with increased rates of institutionalisation at discharge."

METHODS: In 4 month intervals we followed a cohort of 490 PLWHA for 12 months. We conducted hierarchical linear regression models to examine changes in safer sex self-efficacy when participants received zero, low to moderate (5-131 min) and high (132-320 min) doses of MI time. We conducted a similar analysis using number of counseling sessions as the predictor variable.
RESULTS: Participants with low to moderate doses of MI counseling had 0.26 higher self-efficacy scores than participants with zero MI time (p=0.01). Also, they had 0.26 lower self-efficacy scores than participants with high amounts of MI time (p=0.04). Participants with high doses of MI had a 0.5 higher self-efficacy score than participants with zero amount of MI time (p<0.0001). Participants who received 3-4 counseling sessions had 0.41 greater self-efficacy scores than participants who did not receive any sessions (p<0.0001) but did not differ from participants receiving 1-2 sessions.
CONCLUSION: MI time is a key to enhancing safer sex self-efficacy among PLWHA.
PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Safer sex self-efficacy improves the more MI counseling time and sessions PLWHA receive."
21890488,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21890488/,"AIMS: The current guidelines recommend reperfusion therapy in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with ST-segment elevation or left bundle branch block (LBBB). Surprisingly, the right bundle branch block (RBBB) is not listed as an indication for reperfusion therapy. This study analysed patients with AMI presenting with RBBB [with or without left anterior hemiblock (LAH) or left posterior hemiblock (LPH)] and compared them with those presenting with LBBB or with other electrocardiographic (ECG) patterns. The aim was to describe angiographic patterns and primary angioplasty use in AMI patients with RBBB.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A cohort of 6742 patients with AMI admitted to eight participating hospitals was analysed. Baseline clinical characteristics, ECG patterns, coronary angiographic, and echocardiographic data were correlated with the reperfusion therapies used and with in-hospital outcomes. Right bundle branch block was present in 6.3% of AMI patients: 2.8% had RBBB alone, 3.2% had RBBB + LAH, and 0.3% had RBBB + LPH. TIMI flow 0 in the infarct-related artery was present in 51.7% of RBBB patients vs. 39.4% of LBBB patients (P = 0.023). Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed in 80.1% of RBBB patients vs. 68.3% of LBBB patients (P< 0.001). In-hospital mortality of RBBB patients was similar to LBBB (14.3 vs. 13.1%, P = 0.661). Patients with new or presumably new blocks had the highest (LBBB 15.8% and RBBB 15.4%) incidence of cardiogenic shock from all ECG subgroups. Percutaneous coronary intervention was done more frequently (84.8%) in patients with new or presumably new RBBB when compared with other patients with blocks (old RBBB 66.0%, old LBBB 62.3%, new or presumably new LBBB 73.0%). In-hospital mortality was highest (18.8%) among patients presenting with new or presumably new RBBB, followed by new or presumably new LBBB (13.2%), old LBBB (10.1%), and old RBBB (6.4%). Among 35 patients with acute left main coronary artery occlusion, 26% presented with RBBB (mostly with LAH) on the admission ECG.
CONCLUSION: Acute myocardial infarction with RBBB is frequently caused by the complete occlusion of the infarct-related artery and is more frequently treated with primary PCI when compared with AMI + LBBB. In-hospital mortality of patients with AMI and RBBB is highest from all ECG presentations of AMI. Restoration of coronary flow by primary PCI may lead to resolution of the conduction delay on the discharge ECG. Right bundle branch block should strongly be considered for listing in future guidelines as a standard indication for reperfusion therapy, in the same way as LBBB."

DESIGN: Cross-sectional, regression discontinuity.
SETTING: Canada and the US.
PARTICIPANTS: Canadian and American women of ages 30-60 and men of ages 40-60.
INTERVENTIONS: None. Main Outcomes Measures Mammography, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and colorectal cancer test use within the past 2 years.
METHODS: We identify US and Canadian compliance with age screening information in a novel manner, by comparing test utilization rates of individuals who are immediately on either side of the guideline recommended initiation ages.
RESULTS: US mammography utilization within the last 2 years increased from 33% at age 39 to 48% at age 40 and 60% at age 41. US colorectal cancer test utilization, within the last 2 years, increased from 15% at age 49 to 18% at age 50 and 28% at age 51. US PSA utilization within the last 2 years increased from 37% at age 49 to 44% at age 50 and 54% at age 51. In Canada, mammography utilization within the last 2 years increased from 47% at age 49 to 57% at age 50 and 66% at age 51.
CONCLUSION: American and Canadian cancer screening utilization is generally consistent with each country's guideline recommendations regarding age. US and Canadian differences in screening due to guidelines can potentially explain cross-country differences in breast cancer mortality and affect interpretation of international comparisons of cancer statistics."
21890769,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21890769/,"BACKGROUND: It is well acknowledged that the use of antimicrobial drugs in food animals leads to antimicrobial drug resistance in foodborne bacteria such as Campylobacter; however, the role of human antimicrobial usage is much less investigated. The aim of this study was to quantify the odds of campylobacteriosis conferred by human consumption of fluoroquinolones and macrolides.
METHODS: We conducted a registry-based retrospective case-control study on 31 669 laboratory-confirmed cases of campylobacteriosis between 1999 and 2005 in Denmark. Data were obtained from several Danish databases: the National Registry of Enteric Pathogens, the Danish Civil Registration System, the Danish National Prescription Database, and the Integrated Database on Labor Market Research. Odds ratios (OR) for campylobacteriosis were calculated by conditional logistic regression.
RESULTS: The risk of campylobacteriosis was reduced 1 month after exposure to macrolides (OR, 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56-0.92). Macrolide exposure 1 month to 2 years before infection was associated with an increased risk of a Campylobacter diagnosis (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.4-1.6). A history of fluoroquinolone use was also associated with increased risk (OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.8-3.5). This risk was higher for resistant isolates than for susceptible ones.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with macrolides may protect against Campylobacter infection for a limited period of time, possibly due to the antibacterial effects of the drug or its metabolites. Fluoroquinolone treatment confers increased risk, probably due to a combination of competitive and selective effects, similar to what has been observed for nontyphoid Salmonella infection."
21890788,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21890788/,"BACKGROUND/AIM: This study aimed to provide an objective assessment of the effects on the aqueous outflow rate of various geometries of the scleral flap and sclerostomy created in trabeculectomy.
METHOD: Computer-based models and simulations of this surgical procedure were used to investigate the relative effects of various shapes and dimensions of scleral flap and sclerostomy on the aqueous outflow.
RESULT: In these computer simulations, increasing scleral flap size was found to be associated with an increase of 48.55% in aqueous egress. In addition, a square scleral flap increased the aqueous drainage by 36.26% compared with a triangular flap of equivalent flap area. Surprisingly, our simulation results showed that a smaller semicircular sclerostomy improved aqueous drainage by up to 33.00%, while a semicircular sclerostomy, compared with a circular sclerostomy, led to a further 6.16% increase in aqueous outflow. Decreasing flap thickness beyond half-thickness caused an additional increase in aqueous outflow. However, clinically the flap should not be thinner than half the thickness of the sclera as this may result in hypotony.
CONCLUSION: These simulations indicate that the optimal flow rate through operation site will be achieved in trabeculectomy using a square scleral flap with a large flap-to-sclerostomy ratio."
21890792,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21890792/,"OBJECTIVE: The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 prohibits commercial group health plans from imposing spending and visit limitations for mental health and substance abuse services that are not imposed on medical-surgical services. The act also restricts the use of managed care tools that apply to behavioral health benefits in ways that differ from how they apply to medical-surgical benefits. The only precedent for this approach is Oregon's state parity law, which was implemented in 2007. The goal of this study was to estimate the effect of Oregon's parity law on expenditures for mental health and substance abuse treatment services.
METHOD: The authors compared expenditures for commercially insured individuals in four Oregon health plans from 2005 through 2008 and a matched group of commercially insured individuals in Oregon who were exempt from parity. Using a difference-in-differences analysis, the authors analyzed the effect of comprehensive parity on spending for mental health and substance abuse services.
RESULTS: Increases in spending on mental health and substance abuse services after implementation of Oregon's parity law were almost entirely the result of a general trend observed among individuals with and without parity. Expenditures per enrollee for mental health and substance abuse services attributable to parity were positive, but they did not differ significantly from zero in any of the four plans.
CONCLUSIONS: Behavioral health insurance parity rules that place restrictions on how plans manage mental health and substance abuse services can improve insurance protections without substantial increases in total costs."
21890887,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21890887/,"BACKGROUND: Difficulties in inserting an epidural catheter while performing combined spinal-epidural anesthesia for cesarean delivery may lead to undue delays between the spinal injection of the local anesthetic mixture and the adoption of the supine position with lateral tilt. We hypothesized that this delay may affect the intrathecal distribution of local anesthetic of different baricities such that hypobaric local anesthetic would lead to a higher sensory block level.
METHODS: Healthy parturients with uncomplicated pregnancies undergoing elective cesarean delivery under combined spinal-epidural anesthesia were enrolled in this prospective double-blind randomized controlled trial. The subjects were allocated to receive hyperbaric (hyperbaric group), isobaric (isobaric group), or hypobaric (hypobaric group) spinal bupivacaine 10 mg. After the spinal injection, the subjects remained in the sitting position for 5 minutes (to simulate difficulty in inserting the epidural catheter) before being helped into the supine lateral tilt position. The primary outcome was the sensory block level during the 25 minutes after the spinal injection. Other end points included motor block score, maternal hypotension, and vasopressor requirements.
RESULTS: Data from 89 patients were analyzed. Patient characteristics were similar in all groups. The median [interquartile range] (95% confidence interval) sensory levels after spinal injection were significantly higher with decreasing baricity: hyperbaric T10 [T11-8] (T10-9), isobaric T9 [T10-7] (T9-7), and hypobaric T6 [T8-4] (T8-5) (P < 0.001, Cuzick trend). All patients in the hypobaric group reached a sensory block level of T4 at 25 minutes after spinal injection compared with 80% of the patients in both the isobaric and hyperbaric groups (P = 0.04; difference 20%, 95% confidence interval of difference 4%-33%). Significantly more patients in the hypobaric group had complete lower limb motor block (Bromage score = 4) (hyperbaric 43%, isobaric 63%, and hypobaric 90%; P < 0.001). The incidences of maternal hypotension and nausea and vomiting were similar among groups, although the ephedrine requirements were significantly increased in the isobaric and hypobaric groups by factors of 1.83 and 3.0, respectively, compared with the hyperbaric group (P < 0.001, Cuzick trend).
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that when parturients undergoing cesarean delivery were maintained in the sitting position for 5 minutes after spinal injection of the local anesthetic, hypobaric bupivacaine resulted in sensory block levels that were higher compared with isobaric and hyperbaric bupivacaine, respectively, during the study period."
21892015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21892015/,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of cervical muscle strength on head impact biomechanics.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort.
SETTING: Field setting.
PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-seven volunteer ice hockey players (age = 15.0 ± 1.0 years, height = 173.5 ± 6.2 cm, mass = 66.6 ± 9.0 kg, playing experience = 2.9 ± 3.7 years).
INTERVENTIONS: Participants were equipped with accelerometer-instrumented helmets to collect head impact biomechanics (linear and rotational acceleration) throughout an entire playing season. Before the season, isometric cervical muscle strength was measured for the anterior neck flexors, anterolateral neck flexors, cervical rotators, posterolateral neck extensors, and upper trapezius. Data were analyzed using random intercept general mixed linear models, with each individual player as a repeating factor/cluster.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Dependent variables included linear and rotational head accelerations. Cervical strength data were categorized into tertiles, creating groups with high, moderate, and low strength. Strength measures were averaged and normalized to body mass.
RESULTS: Significant differences in cervical muscle strength existed across our strength groups (P < 0.05). No differences were observed in linear or rotational acceleration across strength groups for the anterior neck flexors (PLin = 0.399; PRot = 0.060), anterolateral neck flexors (PLin = 0.987; PRot = 0.579), cervical rotators (PLin = 0.136; PRot = 0.238), posterolateral neck extensors (PLin = 0.883; PRot = 0.101), or upper trapezius (PLin = 0.892; PRot = 0.689).
CONCLUSIONS: Our hypothesis that players with greater static neck strength would experience lower resultant head accelerations was not supported. This contradicts the notion that cervical muscle strength mitigates head impact acceleration. Because we evaluated cervical strength isometrically, future studies should consider dynamic (ie, isokinetic) methods in the context of head impact biomechanics."
21892097,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21892097/,"INTRODUCTION: Extended-field radiotherapy (EFRT) with the concomitant administration of chemotherapy for patients with advanced cervical cancer has problems regarding its feasibility. The goal of the present study was to assess the tolerability and control rate of low-dose cisplatin with EFRT in patients with imaging-confirmed positive para-aortic lymph nodes (PALs).
METHODS: Sixteen patients with cervical cancer metastatic to the PALs treated with EFRT were evaluated. The patients included those with stages I to III disease according to the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics with positive PALs diagnosed by computed tomographic imaging. The patients were treated with 25 to 30 mg/m weekly of cisplatin concurrently with radiation therapy. Doses of 48.6 to 51.0 Gy were delivered in 1.8-Gy fractions to the pelvis and included the PALs field. In addition, boost doses for the involved nodes of PALs were delivered contiguously for a total dose of 54 to 60 Gy. All patients were treated with a high dose rate of intracavitary brachytherapy combined with external irradiation.
RESULTS: All patients completed the radiation therapy. Grade 3 or 4 acute hematologic toxicity occurred in 7 patients, but there were no cases of grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic acute toxicity. As a late toxicity, 1 patient developed a grade 3 small bowel obstruction. No grade 4 or worse late toxicity occurred. The 4-year overall survival rate was 56.3%. The 4-year distant metastasis-free survival rate was 50%. Seven patients had no recurrence. Eight patients developed distant failures, and another had an isolated local intrapelvic recurrence.
CONCLUSIONS: A dose greater than 54 Gy for positive PALs in EFRT, in combination with intracavitary irradiation and low-dose weekly cisplatin administration, was safely completed by all of our patients. However, half of the patients had distant failure. This study provided relatively favorable local control and survival. Further considering modifications of the treatment should therefore be encouraged."
21892729,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21892729/,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the value of whole-body bone scintigraphy in the initial surgical staging of chondrosarcoma of bone.
METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of the bone scintigraphy reports of a large series of patients with peripheral or central chondrosarcoma of bone treated in a specialist orthopaedic oncology unit over a 13-year period. Abnormal findings were correlated against other imaging, histological grade and the impact on surgical staging.
RESULTS: A total of 195 chondrosarcomas were identified in 188 patients. In 120 (63.8%) patients the reports of bone scintigraphy noted increased activity at the site of one or more chondrosarcomas. In one patient the tumour was outside the field-of-view of the scan, and in the remaining 67 (35.6%) cases, there was increased activity at the site of the chondrosarcoma and further abnormal activity in other areas of the skeleton. Causes of these additional areas of activity included degenerative joint disease, Paget's disease and in one case a previously undiagnosed melanoma metastasis. No cases of skeletal metastases from the chondrosarcoma were found in this series. Multifocal chondrosarcomas were identified in three cases. In two it was considered that all the tumours would have been adequately revealed on the initial MR imaging staging studies. In only the third multifocal case was an unsuspected, further presumed low-grade, central chondrosarcoma identified in the opposite asymptomatic femur. Although this case revealed an unexpected finding the impact on surgical staging was limited as it was decided to employ a watch-and-wait policy for this tumour.
CONCLUSION: There is little role for the routine use of whole-body bone scintigraphy in the initial surgical staging in patients with chondrosarcoma of bone irrespective of the histological grade."
21892946,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21892946/,"BACKGROUND: The estimate of the prevalence of the most common chronic conditions (CCs) is calculated using direct methods such as prevalence surveys but also indirect methods using health administrative databases.The aim of this study is to provide estimates prevalence of CCs in Lazio region of Italy (including Rome), using the drug prescription's database and to compare these estimates with those obtained using other health administrative databases.
METHODS: Prevalence of CCs was estimated using pharmacy data (PD) using the Anathomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System (ATC).Prevalences estimate were compared with those estimated by hospital information system (HIS) using list of ICD9-CM diagnosis coding, registry of exempt patients from health care cost for pathology (REP) and national health survey performed by the Italian bureau of census (ISTAT).
RESULTS: From the PD we identified 20 CCs. About one fourth of the population received a drug for treating a cardiovascular disease, 9% for treating a rheumatologic conditions.The estimated prevalences using the PD were usually higher that those obtained with one of the other sources. Regarding the comparison with the ISTAT survey there was a good agreement for cardiovascular disease, diabetes and thyroid disorder whereas for rheumatologic conditions, chronic respiratory illnesses, migraine and Alzheimer's disease, the prevalence estimates were lower than those estimated by ISTAT survey. Estimates of prevalences derived by the HIS and by the REP were usually lower than those of the PD (but malignancies, chronic renal diseases).
CONCLUSION: Our study showed that PD can be used to provide reliable prevalence estimates of several CCs in the general population."
21892964,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21892964/,"BACKGROUND: We determined whether the market exclusivity incentive of the European Orphan Drug Regulation results in a market monopoly or that absence of another Orphan Medicinal Product (OMP) for the same rare disorder, a so-called follow-on OMP, is a matter of time or market size. In the interest of rare disorder patients better understanding of the effect of the market exclusivity incentive on follow-on OMP development is warranted.
METHODS: First, the impact of various market-, product- and disease-related characteristics on follow-on OMP development in the EU was determined by comparing rare disorders with an approved OMP and at least one follow-on OMP (N = 26), with rare disorders with an approved OMP and no follow-on OMP (N = 18). Next, we determined whether manufacturers continued development of a follow-on OMP upon approval of the first OMP for the intended rare disorder. Since in the EU significant benefit of an OMP has to be established, we determined for each follow-on OMP for which development was continued on what grounds significant benefit was assumed by the sponsor. Data were collected from the public domain only.
RESULTS: The likelihood of a rare disorder with an approved OMP to obtain at least one follow-on OMP development was strongly associated with disease prevalence, turnover of the first OMP, disease class, disease-specific scientific output and age of onset. Out of a total of 120 follow-on OMPs only one follow-on OMP could be identified for which development was discontinued upon approval of the first OMP for the same rare disorder. Only a substantial level of discontinuation of follow-on OMP development would have indicated the existence of a market monopoly. Moreover, sponsors that continued development of a follow-on OMP predominantly assumed that their product had an improved efficacy compared to the first approved OMP.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that absence of follow-on OMP development is a matter of time or market size, rather than that the market exclusivity incentive of the European Orphan Drug Regulation creates a market monopoly."
21893143,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21893143/,"INTRODUCTION: Hepatitis B is a major health problem with serious consequences. In hepatitis B treatment host cellular immune responses have a determinant role and T helper cells are the main active members of immune system against virological infection. The aims of this study are to investigate response rate of patients to INF-α therapy and evaluation of sCD26 and sCD30 roles as presenters of T cells activities in predicting the outcome of therapy in chronic hepatitis B patients.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fifty three chronic hepatitis B patients received IFN-α 9 MU S.C three times weekly for 24 weeks, and were followed up for 24 weeks. Serum levels of sCD26 and sCD30, before, 1 and 3 months after treatment commencement were evaluated in 53 chronic hepatitis B patients and 30 healthy individuals as control group.
RESULTS: Normal level of ALT was seen in 64.1% (34/53) of patients and undetectable DNA was observed in 39.6% (21 out of 53) of them. Finally, 33.9% (18/53) of patients obtained sustain virological response. CD26 levels changes was correlated with response to treatment and significantly (p<0.001) increased during first 3 months of treatment among patients with successful response to therapy.
CONCLUSION: Interferon is an effective and safe treatment for chronic hepatitis B patients and sCD26 serum level changes might be useful in predicting the outcome of therapy in naïve chronic hepatitis B patients undergoing treatment with IFN-α, as it can help clinicians for withdrawing non-responder patients for prevention of adverse events and economical burden."

STUDY DESIGN: A total of 46 ovaries from 30 patients were prospectively enrolled. Preoperatively, all ovaries were assessed by 2D and 3D USG for volume estimation and results were compared with true OV that was calculated with Archimedes' principles following oophorectomy.
RESULTS: The correlation coefficients of 2D and 3D USG with true OV were similar (0.65 vs 0.67, respectively). The mean bias (upper and lower limits of agreement) between 2D and true OV was 1.41 (-3.84 to 6.66) mL. The respective figure for 3D and true OV were 0.33 (-4.71 to 5.37) mL. While estimation by 2D USG brought 18% larger, 3D USG revealed 11% smaller values than the true OV.
CONCLUSION: Three-dimensional OV estimation might present improvement in means of lower mean bias than 2D USG."

A first international proficiency study on WNV indicted that some laboratories were not able to detect WNV lineage 2 virus genome by their PCR diagnostic assays. Therefore an actual External Quality Assessment with both virus lineages was performed to monitor the improvements in molecular diagnostics.
OBJECTIVES: To asses the proficiency of laboratories to detect West Nile virus with molecular diagnostic tests.
STUDY DESIGN: A test panel of different WNV isolates and virus dilutions was given to 26 laboratories to test the samples with their routine diagnostic methods.
RESULTS: Twenty-one participating laboratories provided 28 data set results. WNV lineage 1 was detected with high overall efficiency of 92% (67.9-100%) but two different WNV lineage 2 strains were detected at lower rates (mean = 73%, 67.9-75%) by the different PCR assays. 93% of the laboratories were able to detect a WNV lineage 1 with a concentration of 1.2×10(4)copies/ml but the detection rate was decreased to 68% for 1.2×10(3)copies/ml. One laboratory generated false-positive result from the non-virus control samples and 29% of the datasets showed false-positive results for non-WNV flavivirus samples.
CONCLUSIONS: The WNV EQA showed an improved proficiency of laboratories as compared to the first EQA. However, the data suggest that problems in the detection of both lineages were still present since the first proficiency test was performed in 2006. Further proceedings versus the detection of both lineages are needed particularly for in-house assays."
21893473,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21893473/,"BACKGROUND: Pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) is associated with oxidative stress and low plasma proteins. This study explored the effect of oxidative stress on plasma protein level in PIH.
METHODS: Serum total proteins (TP), albumin, globulin, malondialdehyde, protein carbonyls (PC) and protein bound sialic acid (PBSA) were measured in gestational hypertensive, pre-eclamptic, eclamptic and healthy pregnant women (n=20/group). Serum proteins were separated by electrophoresis for assessing protein damage.
RESULTS: Serum TP and albumin decreased and malondialdehyde, PC & PBSA increased significantly in all PIH subgroups as compared to healthy pregnant subjects. Serum globulin levels decreased only in eclampsia. Malondialdehyde and PC negatively correlated with albumin level. Protein fragmentation and aggregation in eclampsia were evident from electrophoretogram.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that oxidative damages to proteins contribute to decreased serum protein levels in PIH and hypersialylation of plasma proteins is probably body’s protective mechanism to combat oxidative protein damage in PIH."
21893503,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21893503/,"BACKGROUND: This study sought to determine the influence of individual factors on active transportation to school among Danish seventh graders and whether school district factors are associated with such behaviour independently of individual factors.
METHODS: Mixed effects logistic regression models determined the effects of individual (gender, family affluence, enjoyment of school and academic performance) and school district factors (educational level, household savings, land use and size) on active transportation to school (by foot, bicycle or other active means) among 10 380 pupils aged 13-15 years nested in 407 school districts.
RESULTS: Of all students, 64.4% used active transportation to school daily. Boys, those with perceived higher school performance and those with lower family affluence were more likely to use active transportation to school. After adjustment for all individual factors listed above, high household savings at the school district level was associated with higher odds of active transportation to school. As factors of land use, low level of farming land use and high proportion of single houses were associated with active transportation to school.
CONCLUSIONS: Policies aiming at reducing social inequalities at the school district level may enhance active transportation to school. School districts with farming land use face barriers for active transportation to school, requiring special policy attention."
21893568,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21893568/,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of a multifaceted educational intervention concerning treatment of infections in the nursing home setting.
METHODS: We used a cluster randomized controlled trial. Fifty-eight nursing homes in Sweden were randomly assigned either to educational intervention or control. The intervention consisted of small educational group sessions with nurses and physicians, feedback on prescribing, presentation of guidelines and written materials. The primary outcome was the proportion of quinolones prescribed for lower urinary tract infection (UTI) in women. Secondary outcomes were for all infections: number of UTIs per resident, proportion of recorded infections treated with an antibiotic, proportion of infections handled by physicians as 'wait and see', and for lower UTI in women, proportion of nitrofurantoin.
RESULTS: Of the 58 nursing homes, 46 completed the study. A total of 702 and 540 infections were recorded pre- and post-intervention. The proportion of quinolones decreased significantly in the intervention and control groups, by -0.196 (9/93 to 36/123) and -0.224 (4/66 to 31/109), respectively [95% confidence interval (CI) -0.338, -0.054 and -0.394, -0.054], but the difference between intervention and control groups was not significant, with an absolute risk reduction of 0.028 (95% CI -0.193, 0.249). The changes in proportion of infections treated with antibiotics and proportion of infections handled by physicians as 'wait and see' was significant in comparison with controls: -0.124 (95% CI -0.228, -0.019) and 0.143 (95% CI 0.047, 0.240). No intervention effect could be seen for the other outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: The educational intervention had no effect on the primary outcome, but decreased the overall prescribing of antibiotics."
21893606,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21893606/,"AIMS: Poor academic achievement is strongly related to smoking but studies that examine the mechanism between academic achievement and smoking are lacking. The aim of this study, therefore, was to examine the smoking-related cognitions (i.e. attitude, social influence, self-efficacy and intention to smoke) in relation to academic achievement and determine whether these cognitions explain different patterns of smoking.
METHODS: The study uses the data of a longitudinal study that was carried out in Finland, and the sample comprised 1,096 students in grades seven to nine.
RESULTS: During the seventh-grade students with poor academic achievement reported more positive attitudes to smoking and a greater social influence of their peers regarding smoking, weaker self-efficacy to refuse smoking and more intentions to smoke in the future compared to students with high academic achievement. Moreover, the follow-up analyses after a 24-month interval revealed that self-efficacy to refuse smoking of students with poor grades had become weaker compared to students with high grades. Furthermore, the influence of seventh-grade academic achievement predicting ninth-grade weekly smoking was partially mediated through the self-efficacy beliefs and the intention to smoke.
CONCLUSIONS: Differences in academic achievement may have an impact on adolescents' self-efficacy beliefs and the intention to smoke in the future. To reduce health inequalities a strong input on continuing research to improve smoking prevention methods, especially for students with low academic achievement, is needed."
21893953,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21893953/,"OBJECTIVE: Ventriculoperitoneal shunting is the current mainstay of treatment for children with tuberculous meningitis with hydrocephalus. However, ventriculoperitoneal shunting is highly associated with complications, and more importantly, long-term, indwelling shunt devices may adversely affect children's spirits and psychological health. Therefore, there is clearly a need to explore methods of CSF diversion to avoid ventriculoperitoneal shunting.
METHODS: We studied 6 cases of children with tuberculous meningitis with hydrocephalus in whom external drainage from the ventricle to the subcutaneous abdomen was adopted. Outcomes were assessed over a 6- to 9-month follow-up period based on improvements in radiological features, such as ventricular morphology, as well as the need for ventriculoperitoneal shunting and any complications.
RESULTS: The drainage tubes were removed in 4 cases 4-6 months after the modified external ventricular drainage surgery, and 2 patients went on to receive a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. All patients' CSF protein and cell counts returned to normal, and imaging showed improved ventricular morphology and no intracranial secondary infection.
CONCLUSION: In our preliminary study, the modified ventricular drainage device can produce satisfactory outcomes and relatively safe effects and may help some patients to avoid ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement."

METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, urinary/serum concentrations of fetuin-A were investigated in proteinuric children with glomerular diseases and preserved renal function (n = 58) in comparison to healthy controls (n = 246).
RESULTS: Mean fetuin-A serum concentrations were clearly reduced in children with nephrotic syndrome (0.25 ± 0.14 g/l, p < 0.001), slightly reduced in children with large proteinuria (0.39 ± 0.15 g/l, p < 0.05), and comparable to controls in those with mild proteinuria (0.45 ± 0.14 vs. 0.46 ± 0.12 g/l). Fetuin-A was positively correlated with serum protein (r = 0.58), albumin (r = 0.57), and calcium (r = 0.64), but negatively correlated with proteinuria (r = -0.41), albuminuria (r = -0.46), and urinary fetuin-A excretion (r = -0.48; each p < 0.001). The fractional excretion of fetuin-A was significantly associated with the degree of proteinuria and serum fetuin-A levels. However, the urinary loss of fetuin-A and albumin in nephrotic children differed by three orders of magnitude and the mean fractional excretion of fetuin-A was only 1/10 of that of albumin (0.016 ± 0.029 vs. 0.162 ± 0.403%; p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Fetuin-A is clearly reduced in children with nephrotic syndrome and associated with the degree of hypoalbuminemia. This is due to urinary fetuin-A loss and/or reduced hepatic synthesis. Persistent fetuin-A deficiency may have an impact on cardiovascular morbidity in nephrotic children."
21894060,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21894060/,"BACKGROUND: A patient controller (PC) is an optional device for patients with deep brain stimulation (DBS) to have limited control of their stimulator system.
OBJECTIVES: We investigated the impact of a PC on DBS safety, most notably the handling/prevention of unexpected DBS failure in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).
METHODS: PD patients with subthalamic DBS were educated in the use of a PC. After a first impulse generator (IPG) replacement, data on the use of the PC were obtained from the patients' records and by a patient questionnaire.
RESULTS: A total of 27 patients with IPG replacements after 4.4 ± 0.8 years (118.8 patient-years) were included. Thirteen patients transiently used the PC to optimize stimulation amplitudes. Eighteen patients reported events when they used the PC to ensure DBS being on. No accidental switch off by environmental electromagnetism was confirmed. In contrast, 4 patients accidentally turned the IPG off with the PC. Sixteen patients regularly checked the IPG battery but only 1 patient noted a low battery status before quarterly control visits. Of the 27 patients, 26 had anticipated and only 1 an unanticipated IPG replacement.
CONCLUSIONS: A PC is not needed for patient safety. However, in some patients, a PC is helpful to optimize stimulation amplitudes and to increase the patients' own perception of safety."
21894565,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21894565/,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the diagnostic value of dynamic MRI swallowing in patients with symptoms of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD).
METHODS: Thirty-seven patients (17 m/20f) with typical signs of GERD underwent MR swallowing in the supine position at 1.5 T with a phased-array body coil. Using dynamic, gradient echo sequences (B-FFE) in the coronal, sagittal and axial planes, the bolus passages of buttermilk spiked with gadolinium chelate were tracked. MRI, pH-metry and manometry were performed within 31 days and results were compared.
RESULTS: MRI results were concordant with pH-metry in 82% (23/28) of patients diagnosed with abnormal oesophageal acid exposure by pH-metry. Five patients demonstrated typical symptoms of GERD and had positive findings with pH monitoring, but false negative results with MRI. In four of six patients (67%), there was a correct diagnosis of oesophageal motility disorder, according to manometric criteria, on dynamic MRI. The overall accuracy of MRI diagnoses was 79% (27/34). A statistically significant difference was found between the size of hiatal hernia, grade of reflux in MRI, and abnormal acid exposure on pH-monitoring.
CONCLUSIONS: MR fluoroscopy may be a promising radiation-free tool in assessing the functionality and morphology of the GE junction.
KEY POINTS: • Swallowing MRI can assess anatomy and function of the gastroesophageal-junction • Swallowing MRI can help identifying reflux and motility disorders • Definition of the size of hiatal hernias is possible in all three planes in MR. • Short duration of swallowing MRI enables its application in routine clinical practice."
21895610,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21895610/,"OBJECTIVE: We assessed the efficacy of maternal anthropometric measurements and clinical estimates of fetal weight in isolation and in combination as predictors of cephalopelvic disproportion (CPD).
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
SETTING: Tertiary care teaching hospital, two affiliated hospitals with facilities for conducting cesarean delivery and seven affiliated primary care facilities with no operation theaters.
SAMPLE: Primigravidae over 37 weeks' gestation attending these facilities during a 20-month period with a singleton pregnancy in vertex presentation.
METHODS: Several anthropometric measurements were taken in 249 primigravidae. Fetal weight was estimated. Differences in these measurements between the vaginal delivery and CPD groups were analyzed. The validity of these measurements in predicting CPD was analyzed by plotting receiver operating characteristic curves and by logistic regression analysis.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Mode of delivery.
RESULTS: Maternal height, foot size, inter-trochanteric diameter and bis-acromial diameter showed the highest positive predictive values for CPD. Combining some maternal measurements with estimates of fetal weight increased predictive values modestly, which are likely to be greater if the estimates of fetal weight are close to the actual birth weight. Based on multivariate analysis the risk factors for CPD in our population were foot length ≤23cm, inter-trochanteric diameter ≤30cm and estimated fetal weight ≥3 000g.
CONCLUSIONS: Maternal anthropometric measurements can predict CPD to some extent. Combining maternal measurements with clinical estimates of fetal weight only enhances the predictive value to a relatively modest degree (positive predictive value 24%)."

Adverse outcomes after radical prostatectomy are more often recorded in the elderly. In the USA, elderly patients undergoing radical prostatectomy are treated at institutions where suboptimal outcomes are recorded.
OBJECTIVE: • To assess the rate of adverse outcomes after open radical prostatectomy (ORP) in the elderly and to examine the effect of annual hospital caseload (AHC) and academic institutional status on adverse outcomes in these of patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: • Within the Health Care Utilization Project Nationwide Inpatient Sample, we focused on ORPs performed between 1998 and 2007. Subsequently, we restricted to patients aged ≥75 years. • In both datasets, we examined transfusion rates, intra-operative and postoperative complication rates, and in-hospital mortality rates. • Stratification was performed according to AHC tertiles and academic status. • Multivariable logistic regression analyses were fitted.
RESULTS: • Of 115,554 ORP patients, 2109 (1.8%) were aged ≥75 years. • In multivariable analyses performed in the entire cohort, elderly age increased homologous blood transfusion rates (P < 0.001), intra-operative (P= 0.001) and postoperative (P < 0.001) complication rates, and the mortality rate (P= 0.007). • Most elderly were treated at low or intermediate AHC (68.5%) and non-academic centres (56.2%). • Within the elderly cohort, intra-operative (2.9%) and postoperative (22.2%) complications tended to be highest at low AHC institutions compared to institutions of intermediate (2.7% and 17.4%) and high AHC (1.7% and 14.5%). Similarly, intra-operative (2.7% vs 2.1%) and postoperative complications (19.1% vs 13.9%) tended to be higher at non-academic than academic centres. • In multivariable analyses performed in the elderly subgroup, low AHC predicted higher intra-operative complications and higher homologous transfusions, whereas non-academic status predicted higher postoperative complications.
CONCLUSIONS: • Adverse outcomes are more often recorded in the elderly. • Most elderly are treated at institutions where suboptimal outcomes are recorded."

DESIGN: Descriptive study.
SETTING: Bamako area, Mali.
POPULATION: Women aged 30-59 years.
METHODS: Routine visual screening and treatment services were organised through two hospitals and 14 health centres. Patients with positive visual screening tests underwent colposcopy and/or directed biopsies, and ablative or surgical excision treatment was offered to those with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Test positivity, detection and treatment rates for CIN and the sustainability of screening services.
RESULTS: Of the 14,141 women screened, 1682 (11.9%) were positive and were referred for further investigations and treatment. Over 75% of the screen-positive women underwent colposcopy and/or biopsy. CIN 1 was detected in 383 women, CIN 2 in 88, CIN 3 in 37 and invasive cervical cancer in 497. More than 80% of women with CIN and 35% of those with invasive cancer received treatment. The test performance characteristics and treatment coverage of routine screening were similar to those observed in the preceding cross-sectional study.
CONCLUSION: Visual screening and treatment services are sustainable and effective in improving cervical cancer control provision by health services in Bamako, Mali. It is essential to organise and sustain several point-of-care services in order to extend cervical cancer prevention in low-income African countries."

DESIGN: Pilot, cross-sectional, comparison study.
SETTING: North Dakota from January 2005 to September 2008.
PARTICIPANTS: Pharmacy staff at 14 remote telepharmacy sites and 8 comparison community pharmacies.
INTERVENTION: The Pharmacy Quality Commitment (PQC) reporting system was incorporated into the North Dakota Telepharmacy Project. A session was conducted to train pharmacists and technicians on use of the PQC system. A quality-related event (QRE) was defined as either a near miss (i.e., mistake caught before reaching patient; pharmacy discovery), or an error (i.e., mistake discovered after patient received medication; patient discovery).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: QREs for prescriptions.
RESULTS: During a 45-month period, the remote telepharmacy group reported 47,078 prescriptions and 631 QREs compared with 123,346 prescriptions and 1,002 QREs in the standard pharmacy group. Results for near misses (pharmacy discovery) and errors (patient discovery) for the remote and comparison sites were 553 and 887 and 78 and 125, respectively. Percentage of ""where the mistake was caught"" (i.e., pharmacist check) for the remote and comparison sites were 58% and 69%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: This study reported a lower overall rate (1.0%) and a slight difference in medication dispensing error rates between remote telepharmacy sites (1.3%) and comparison sites (0.8%). Both rates are comparable with nationally reported levels (1.7% error rate for 50 pharmacies)."
21896558,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21896558/,"INTRODUCTION: Health services delivered in an older person's home are often implemented at a critical juncture in an individual's functional status. Although homecare has potential to improve this situation, it often focuses on treating disease and 'taking care' of the patient rather than promoting independence. The aim of restorative homecare is to change the philosophy from one where delivery of care may create dependency to provision of care which maximises independence, self-esteem, self-image and quality of life, and reduces the care required.
AIMS: To assess impact of a designated goal facilitation tool on health-related quality of life (HRQoL), social support and physical function among community-dwelling older people referred for homecare.
METHODS: A total of 205 participants [mean age 79.1 years, 71.3% female (intervention group) and 76.9 years with 60.8% female (control group)] were cluster randomised to an intervention or control assessor. The intervention arm involved participants completing a goal facilitation tool with assessors. This established rehabilitation aims. Control participants received a standard needs assessment. Clients from both groups were then referred to a homecare organisation for service delivery.
RESULTS: There was greater change over time in HRQoL [measured by Short Form 36 Survey (SF-36)] in the intervention group (P = 0.0001). There was a marked variation across homecare providers in types of services provided (P < 0.001). Identification of a goal did not predict completion of a formalised review of participants' needs by the homecare organisation.
CONCLUSIONS: Use of a goal facilitation tool in assessment of an older person's needs on referral for homecare leads to significant improvements in HRQoL. This may be through a higher proportion of individualised activities tailored to a successful identification of the person's goals. The findings contribute to greater understanding of factors necessary to implement improvements in homecare services for older people."
21896788,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21896788/,"OBJECTIVE: Induction chemotherapy (ICT) may reduce rates of distant metastases and enhance organ preservation and survival rates in patients with hypopharyngeal cancer. The authors compared survival data in patients who underwent chemoradiotherapy or surgery after ICT and investigated whether response to ICT is a predictive marker for outcome in patients with hypopharyngeal cancer.
STUDY DESIGN: Historical cohort study.
SETTING: Tertiary-care hospital.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The authors enrolled 97 patients (89 men, 8 women; mean age 61.2 years; range, 29-80 years) with previously untreated hypopharyngeal cancer who underwent ICT between January 1997 and December 2006 at Asan Medical Center. Disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), and laryngectomy-free survival (LFS) were analyzed.
RESULTS: At a mean follow-up of 38.0 months, the 3-year DFS and OS for all patients were 48.3% and 49.2%, respectively. The 3-year LFS rate of patients who underwent nonsurgical therapy (n = 85) after ICT was 48.0%. Only response to ICT was associated with DFS (P = .047), OS (P = .003), and LFS (P = .009) in multivariate analysis. When the authors compared survival data in patients who underwent surgical and nonsurgical treatments after ICT, they found that there was no statistical difference in terms of the 3-year DFS in partial response (42.9% vs 50.5%, P = .77) and nonresponse groups (50.0% vs 0%, P = .43) between the 2 treatment types.
CONCLUSION: ICT permits assessment of tumor responsiveness and alters subsequent therapy accordingly. Response to ICT may be useful in the prediction of ultimate outcomes and organ conservation in patients with hypopharyngeal cancer."
21897187,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21897187/,"STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of a multi-institutional, multisurgeon database.
OBJECTIVE: Assess for associations between bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) use and rate of complications in spinal fusion.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: BMP is commonly used in spinal surgery to augment fusion; however, there is limited evidence demonstrating its associated complications.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of all fusion cases submitted by members of the Scoliosis Research Society from 2004 to 2007. We stratified on the basis of the use of BMP and evaluated for complications and associated characteristics.
RESULTS: A total of 55,862 cases of spinal fusion were identified with BMP used in 21% (11,933) of the cases. Excluding anterior cervical fusions, there were no significant differences between fusions with and without BMP with regard to overall complications (8.4% vs. 8.5%; P = 0.5), wound infections (2.4% vs. 2.4%; P = 0.8), or epidural hematomas/seromas (0.2% vs. 0.2%; P = 0.3). Anterior cervical fusions with BMP were associated with more overall complications (5.8% vs. 2.4%; P < 0.001) and more wound infections (2.1% vs. 0.4%; P < 0.001) than fusions without BMP. On multivariate analysis for thoracolumbar and posterior cervical fusions, BMP use was not a significant predictor of complications (P = 0.334; odds ratio = 1.039; 95% confidence interval = 0.961-1.124; covariates were BMP use, patient age, revision vs. primary surgery). Multivariate analysis for anterior cervical spinal fusion demonstrated that BMP use remained a significant predictor of complications (P < 0.001, odds ratio = 1.6; 95% confidence interval = 1.516-1.721), after adjusting for the effects of patient age and whether the surgery was a revision procedure.
CONCLUSION: BMP use with anterior cervical fusion was associated with an increased incidence of complications. Use of BMP was not associated with more complications in thoracolumbar and posterior cervical fusions."
21897208,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21897208/,"OBJECTIVE: Obtaining an accurate blood pressure (BP) reading is vital for diagnosing hypertension. However, BP measures taken in the physician's clinic (CBP) are subject to the 'white coat' bias. Measurements taken outside the office using ambulatory (ABP) and home (HBP) monitoring are superior predictors of cardiovascular diseases compared with CBP, but ABP remains underutilized because of the effort and expense involved. Unfortunately, HBP has limitations, including questionable device validity and patient compliance. Thus, it is important to identify feasible alternative techniques to measure BP in the office that will increase the accuracy of the diagnosis.
METHODS: Auscultatory BP was measured in 249 patients in a nonclinical setting by trained technicians (NCBP); on the following day, patients were taken to their physician (CBP). They were also given an HBP monitor, and a 36 h ABP monitoring. Because ABP is considered the gold standard for prediction of cardiovascular disease, these readings were used as the criterion in a statistical model in which CBP, HBP, and NCBP were entered as predictors. The level of agreement between measurements was estimated.
RESULTS: Multiple regression analysis showed that HBP and NCBP (P < 0.001) explained 94 and 87% of the variance in systolic and diastolic ABP, respectively. The agreement between NCBP and ABP was greater than that between CBP and ABP or between HBP.
CONCLUSION: When ABP monitoring and HBP monitoring are not options, the NCBP at the clinic can avoid the white coat bias and therefore improve diagnosis."
21897762,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21897762/,"BACKGROUND: The number of genetic association studies is increasing exponentially. Nonetheless, genetic association reports are prone to potential biases which may influence the reported outcome.
AIM: We hypothesized that positive outcome for a determined polymorphism might be over-reported across genetic association studies analysing a small number of polymorphisms, when compared to studies analysing the same polymorphism together with a high number of other polymorphisms.
METHODS: We systematically reviewed published reports on the association of glutathione s-transferase (GST) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and cancer outcome.
RESULT: We identified 79 eligible trials. Most of the studies examined the GSTM1, theGSTP1 Ile105Val mutation, and GSTT1polymorphisms (n = 54, 57 and 46, respectively). Studies analysing one to three polymorphisms (n = 39) were significantly more likely to present positive outcomes, compared to studies examining more than 3 polymorphisms (n=40) p = 0.004; this was particularly evident for studies analysing the GSTM1polymorphism (p =0.001). We found no significant associations between journal impact factor, number of citations, and probability of publishing positive studies or studies with 1-3 polymorphisms examined.
CONCLUSIONS: We propose a new subtype of publication bias in genetic association studies. Positive results for genetic association studies analysing a small number of polymorphisms (n = 1-3) should be evaluated extremely cautiously, because a very large number of such studies are inconclusive and statistically under-powered. Indeed, publication of misleading reports may affect harmfully medical decision-making and use of resources, both in clinical and pharmacological development setting."
21898019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21898019/,"BACKGROUND: The main source of postoperative pain after laparoscopic repair of ventral hernia is thought to be fixation of implanted mesh. This study aimed to analyze whether a relation exists between the number of tacks used for fixation and postoperative pain.
METHODS: To reduce the number of prognostic variables, only patients with primary umbilical hernia who underwent laparoscopic repair with double-crown mesh fixation were enrolled in this study. Two groups differing only in the manner of tacking were compared. Group 1 (n = 40), collected from previous studies, showed no specific efforts to minimize the number of tacks. Group 2 was a cohort of 40 new patients who underwent double-crown fixation using the minimal number of tacks considered to provide adequate mesh fixation. To eliminate systematic and random errors, the study analyzed only for postoperative pain. The severity of the patients' pain was assessed preoperatively and then 2, 6, and 12 weeks postoperatively using a visual analog scale (VAS) ranging from 0 to 100.
RESULTS: The mean number of tacks used differed significantly between the two groups: group 1 (45.4 ± 9.6) vs group 2 (20.4 ± 1.4) (p = 0.001). Postoperative pain differed significantly only at the 3-month postoperative assessment: group 1 VAS (5.78) vs group 2 VAS (1.80) (p = 0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: Although postoperative pain differed significantly at the 3-month follow-up assessment, both VAS scores were so low that from a clinical point of view, this difference seems irrelevant. Fewer tacks do not create less pain, nor do more tacks create more pain. This absence of a correlation between the number of tacks used and postoperative pain may indicate that pain after laparoscopic repair of at least small ventral hernias possibly is generated according to some ""threshold"" principle rather than according to a cumulative effect created by more points of fixation."
21898633,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21898633/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of and to quantify the effect of reflex pelvic floor activation on coughing in nulliparous pregnant women, and to assess peripartal changes and any association with stress urinary incontinence.
METHODS: Between April 2008 and March 2010, 131 nulliparous pregnant women were recruited from an antenatal clinic. All participants were interviewed and underwent four-dimensional translabial ultrasound examination at antepartum (35.8 (mean) weeks' gestation) and postpartum (4.6 (mean) months) visits. Four-dimensional ultrasound volume datasets of the pelvic floor during coughs were obtained at a minimum frame rate of 16 Hz, using a 10° volume acquisition angle. To quantify a reflex levator contraction we measured the midsagittal hiatal diameter at multiple time points. Levator integrity was determined using tomographic ultrasound imaging.
RESULTS: From 131 women recruited, 47 datasets were technically suboptimal, leaving 84. There was a visible pelvic floor reflex in 82 (98%) cases. At the postpartum visit this was reduced to 63/84, i.e. 75% (P < 0.001). The magnitude of a reflex contraction was markedly reduced postpartum, from 4.8 mm to 2.0 mm (P < 0.001), and this effect was associated with delivery mode (P = 0.042). There was a trend towards an association between lower reflex contraction magnitude and stress incontinence (0.87 ± 3.18 mm vs. 2.36 ± 3.5 mm; P = 0.08) at the postpartum follow-up visit.
CONCLUSIONS: Pelvic floor reflexes are altered by childbirth. This alteration may be associated with vaginal delivery. Reflex magnitude may be associated with postpartum stress urinary incontinence. The clinical significance of this finding is uncertain."
21898717,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21898717/,"BACKGROUND: We explored whether clinical outcomes differ by treatment strategy following initial antidepressant treatment failure among patients with and without clinically relevant symptom clusters.
METHODS: The Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) trial was used to examine depression remission and response in patients with coexisting anxiety, atypical features, insomnia, and low energy. We applied propensity scoring to control for selection bias that precluded comparisons between augmentation and switch strategies in the original trial. Binomial regressions compared the likelihood of remission or response among patients with and without symptom clusters for switch versus augmentation strategies (n = 269 per arm); augmentation strategy type (n = 565); and switch strategy type (n = 727).
RESULTS: We found no statistically significant difference in remission or response rates between augmentation or switch strategies. However, symptom clusters did distinguish among augmentation and switch strategies, respectively. For patients with low energy, augmentation with buspirone was less likely to produce remission than augmentation with bupropion (remission Risk Ratio (RR): 0.54, 95% CI: 0.35-0.85, response RR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.43, 1.03). Also, for patients with low energy, switching to venlafaxine or bupropion was less likely to produce remission than switching to sertraline (RR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.36-0.97; RR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.38-1.06, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Remission and response rates following initial antidepressant treatment failure did not differ by treatment strategy for patients with coexisting atypical symptoms or insomnia. However, some second-step treatments for depression may be more effective than others in the presence of coexisting low energy. Subsequent prospective testing is necessary to confirm these initial findings."
21899711,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21899711/,"AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate whether patients with diverticulitis can be prioritized with higher urgency for a subsequent full colonic examination based upon the emergency abdominal CT scan performed at the time of presentation.
METHOD: All patients with a diagnosis of diverticulitis, hospitalized during 2006 and having a CT scan on admission and a subsequent 'clean colon' examination, were reviewed. The CT scan was reviewed by two independent and blinded senior radiologists (Radiologist A and Radiologist B) for signs inconsistent with diverticulitis and suggestive of malignancy. The patients were classified on the CT scan results into group 1 (normal findings, nontumour pathology or benign polyps < 1 cm) or group 2 (benign polyps ≥ 1 cm and cancer).
RESULTS: Ninety-three patients (83 in group 1 and 10 in group 2) were reviewed. Radiologist A suggested high-priority colonic examination in 18% and 50% of patients in groups 1 and 2, respectively, and Radiologist B in 63% and 90% of patients, respectively. There was a statistically significant interobserver difference, and also lower accuracy of Radiologist B compared with Radiologist A in predicting a subsequent 'clean colon' examination.
CONCLUSION: Use of an emergency acute CT scan at the time of diagnosis of diverticulitis to predict a clean colon examination for neoplasia is not reliable because there is a considerable degree of interobserver difference between radiologists."
21899999,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21899999/,"BACKGROUND: The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) COPD 2004 guidelines recommend: ∗ COPD patients who smoke should be encouraged to stop at every opportunity; ∗ Inhaled corticosteroid should be used only among patients with moderate to severe COPD; ∗ Pharmacists should identify smokers and provide smoking cessation advice. The community pharmacy contract requires pharmacists to review patients' medications, creating an opportunity for reviewing the prescribing of inhaled corticosteroids in COPD. The survey explored the degree to which community pharmacists in North West England identify and provide advice to smokers and assess prescribed inhaled corticosteroids among COPD patients.
METHODS: A self-completion questionnaire was sent to 2080 community pharmacists from the 2005 pharmacist census database.
RESULTS: Of the 1051 (50.5%) respondants, 37.1% mentioned COPD as a risk from smoking most or every time and 54.5% sometimes or rarely, and 19.6% routinely asked about smoking status when dispensing COPD medication. Pharmacists with more than 20 years experience were more likely to have read the Guideline compared to pharmacists with 10 years or less (OR: 1.54; 95% CI: 1.13 to 2.10). Pharmacists who had read the NICE Guideline (46.8%) were around twice as likely to mention COPD as a risk of smoking, ask about COPD if inhaled corticosteroids were dispensed and ask about smoking routinely if COPD medication was dispensed. (p<0.005).
CONCLUSION: The NICE guidelines on COPD encourage community pharmacists to carry out smoking cessation and educational interventions, but further support is needed."
21900023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21900023/,"OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to investigate the safety of including patients ≥ 80 years of age at the start of a video-assisted thoracic surgery major pulmonary resection (VMPR) programme.
METHODS: Patients were considered for VMPR if the computed tomography/positron emission tomography (CT/PET) was suggestive of T1-3, N0-1 and M0 lesion. Age was not a criterion for exclusion at the very start of the programme. Data were collected prospectively and comparison made between two groups, (A) <80 years of age and (B) ≥ 80 years, in terms of preoperative risk factors, oncological and functional data, operative results, postoperative complications and survival.
RESULTS: Between April 2005 and January 2011, 200 consecutive patients were considered for VMPR. A total of 160 had non-small-cell lung cancer, of whom 136 were in group A, with a median age of 66.5 (range: 42.8-79.4 years) and 24 in group B with a median age of 82 (range: 80-85.5 years). In group B, 13 were men and 11 were women. Rate of conversion to thoracotomy was similar (3 (12.5%) in group B vs 17 (12.5%) in group A, p = 0.65), and so was the mean hospital stay (5.8 ± 3.3 days in group B vs 5.9 ± 4.6 days in group A, p = 0.899). Admission to intensive care unit and atrial fibrillation were significantly higher in octogenarians (six (25%) and six (25%) in group B vs eight (5.9%) and nine (6.6%) in group A, p = 0.008 and p = 0.012, respectively). There was significantly less mean days of air leak in octogenarians (0.06 ± 0.3 days in group B vs 2.8 ± 5.6 days in group A, p = 0.000). Otherwise, there were no age-related differences in relation to morbidity, mortality and the 3-year survival rate.
CONCLUSION: Octogenarians undergoing VMPR have a higher incidence of atrial fibrillation and admission to the intensive care unit for cardiopulmonary support but otherwise are no different from younger age groups when it comes to rate of conversion to thoracotomy, hospital stay, morbidity and mortality. Age should not be an excuse to deny the elderly curative VATS resection. In our experience, accepting octogenarians early in the VMPR programme did not compromise the outcome results."

AIMS: To assess whether faecal-immunochemical test (FIT) may be useful in selecting patients at higher risk of bleeding lesions in iron deficiency anaemia patients.
METHODS: Iron deficiency anaemia patients without overt bleeding were prospectively enrolled. All patients performed FIT, and underwent both upper and lower endoscopy. Predictive factors of potential bleeding lesions were evaluated at multivariate analysis.
RESULTS: FIT was positive in 48 (34.3%) out of 140 enrolled patients, and a potential bleeding lesion was present in 63 (45%) patients. An endoscopic lesion was detected more frequently in FIT-positive than -negative patients (79.2% vs 27.2%; p<0.0001), at both upper endoscopy (52.1% vs 18.5%; p=0.0002) and colonoscopy (33.3% vs 8.7%; p=0.001). At multivariate analysis, FIT was found to be an independent predictor of both bleeding lesions (OR=9.5; 95% CI: 4.1-22; p<0.001) and cancer (OR=4.0, CI: 1.1-15; p=0.029).
CONCLUSIONS: FIT positive-iron deficiency anaemia patients without overt bleeding are at increased risk to present with a bleeding lesion at endoscopy, including cancer. FIT positivity in this setting could be useful to prioritize urgent endoscopy."
21900406,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21900406/,"BACKGROUND: Non-functioning pituitary adenomas (NFAs) are slow-growing tumours with reported re-growth rates following surgical resection alone of up to 50% at 10 years. Currently, the desired length of follow-up surveillance imaging in un-irradiated patients is unclear.
AIM: To clarify the timing of re-growth in patients with NFAs, treated solely by surgery without post-operative pituitary radiotherapy, and also to clarify whether continued imaging is necessary in these patients.
METHODS: A case note analysis of all patients who underwent surgery alone for NFA between January 1984 and December 2007 was undertaken. Patients were followed for a minimum of 1 year. Re-growth was diagnosed on the basis of radiological appearances with or without associated manifestations.
RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-five patients (94 males, mean age at diagnosis 57.9 (range 18.3-88) years) were included. Twenty-nine were followed up for more than 10 years. The mean follow-up following surgery was 6.1 years (median 4.3 (range 1-25.8)). Re-growth was documented in 54 (34.8%) cases and 20.4% of these cases showed relapse/re-growth 10 or more years after the initial surgery. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed relapse rates of 23.1, 46.7 and 67.9% at 5, 10 and 15 years respectively. There was a significant increase in the re-growth rates if there was either pituitary tumour remnant observed on the first post-operative scan (P≤0.001) or a younger age at initial surgery (P=0.034).
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that patients with NFAs need to be closely monitored following surgery, particularly those with post-operative tumour remnants. With 20% of relapse occurring after 10 years, follow-up surveillance needs to be continued beyond this time."
21900434,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21900434/,"INTRODUCTION: We analyzed data from a cohort of 782 older patients assembled in 1999 to 2000 to determine whether baseline patient assessments of the quality of the primary care services they had received, measured using the Components of Primary Care Index (CPCI), were associated with subsequent changes in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and/or survival.
METHODS: Longitudinal growth curve models were used to analyze changes in Quality of Well-Being (QWB-SA) scores over an average (S.D.) of 2.07 (1.07) years. Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify variables associated with mortality over an average of 8.26 years (6460 person-years). To reduce confounding by severity of illness, subjects were stratified into disabled, nondisabled high utilizers of primary care, and nondisabled low utilizers. Within subgroups, we controlled for number of chronic illnesses and scores on the General Health subscale of the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 (SF-36). We also controlled for baseline age, sex, marital status, income, body mass index, educational attainment, duration of the relationship with current primary care physician (PCP), and number of visits to the PCP in the year before enrollment. Analyses took into account clustering of patients within PCP.
RESULTS: Neither total CPCI nor any CPCI subscale score was associated with QWB-SA change over time. Higher ratings of Coordination of Care were associated with reduced survival in the disabled and nondisabled high utilizer subgroups (P = .007).
CONCLUSIONS: Assuming that effective primary care results in better HRQoL and longer survival and that the CPCI captures important primary care attributes, older patients' level of satisfaction with the quality of their primary care may not be a good surrogate measure of effectiveness."
21900536,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21900536/,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to compare the effects of Merocel nasal packs and silicone nasal septal splints with integral airway on the ventilation and pressure of the middle ear when applied intranasally after septoplasty for isolated septal deviation.
STUDY DESIGN: A prospective, randomized trial.
SETTING: A tertiary referral center.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Fifty-one patients who underwent septoplasty for nasal respiratory impairment caused by septal deviation were randomized into 2 groups. After septoplasty, bilateral anterior Merocel nasal packs were applied in one group, while silicone nasal septal splints with integral airway were applied in the other group. Middle ear pressures were compared using preoperative and post-operative tympanometry.
RESULTS: Pathological decrease in the middle ear pressure in at least 1 ear was determined in 17 patients (73.9%) in the Merocel group compared with only 6 patients (21.4%) in the silicone nasal septal splint group at the 48th postoperative hour. In the first 24 hours following surgery, decreases in tympanometric pressures were seen in both groups, but more in the Merocel group. After 24 hours, middle ear pressures continued to decrease in the Merocel group but started to increase in the silicone nasal septal splint group.
CONCLUSION: Because they allow inhalation through the nose and cause less Eustachian tube dysfunction than Merocel, using silicone nasal septal splints with integral airway instead of packing after septoplasty seems a more reasonable option."
21900633,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21900633/,"OBJECTIVE: Current guidelines indicate that certain clinical examination findings at 72 hours after cardiac arrest may be useful in prognosis. Some have suggested that hypothermia may alter the examination. We aimed to examine timing of awakening in cardiac arrest survivors treated with hypothermia.
METHODS: A retrospective review of prospectively identified cardiac arrest survivors from June 2006 to December 2010 at a large academic institution. Data including time to awakening, prognostic variables, systemic complications, cause of mortality, reasons, and timing to withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments were recorded. Outcome measure of in-hospital mortality was assessed.
RESULTS: A total of 227 patients were included. In-hospital mortality was 53%. Of 128 treated with induced hypothermia, 64% survived. Of 99 patients not treated with hypothermia, 24% survived. Median day of awakening was day 2 for both groups and most (91% hypothermic and 79% nonhypothermic) awakened within 3 days. In the hypothermic group, withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments preceded death in 41 patients; the decision was based primarily on poor neurologic prognosis in 29. The average day of death was 5 (range 3-11). In the nonhypothermic group, withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments took place in 69 patients, of which 55 were based on poor neurologic prognosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Awakening after therapeutic hypothermia is usually evident within 3 days of cardiac arrest and not delayed compared with nonhypothermia cases. Mortality in the hypothermia group was not uncommonly preceded by consequences of critical systemic illness."

AIMS: To investigate whether overweight/obesity (BMI≥25 kg/m(2)) affects rabeprazole clinical efficacy versus omeprazole in patients with erosive esophagitis (EE).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Post-hoc analysis of EE healing rate and symptom response stratified by patient BMI was performed on data from a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, 4-to-8-week trial comparing EE healing with rabeprazole (20 mg daily) and omeprazole (20 mg daily). Analysis of variance, two-sample t-test, Blackwelder's test for equivalence, log-rank, and Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests were used to analyze comparisons.
RESULTS: In the two BMI groups (<25 kg/m(2) and ≥25 kg/m(2) respectively), rabeprazole and omeprazole were equally effective for mucosal healing regardless of patient's BMI (N=542, P>0.05). However, in overweight/obese patients, rabeprazole was significantly faster than omeprazole in inducing heartburn relief during the first treatment week (P<0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study show that the clinical efficacy of rabeprazole is maintained in overweight/obese patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease and suggest that this subgroup of patients may derive, from rabeprazole, even greater benefit than lean patients."
21900810,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21900810/,"BACKGROUND: It is a prevalent myth that a postoperative infection may actually confer a survival advantage in patients with malignant glioma. This contention is based largely on anecdotal reports. Recently, a single-center study showed there was no survival advantage in those patients who had glioblastoma with postoperative infection.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of postoperative infections on outcome in patients with glioblastoma treated at our center.
METHODS: This study included 197 patients with newly diagnosed primary glioblastoma treated from January 2001 to January 2008. Of the 197 patients, 10 (5.08%) had postoperative bacterial infection. The Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, and Breslow test were used in the univariate approach; Cox regression was used in the multivariable approach.
RESULTS: The median survival was 16 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 14-18 mo). The infection group had a significant advantage in the median survival: 30 months (95% CI, 21-39) vs 15 months (95% CI, 13-17) for patients without postoperative infection. This advantage was also confirmed by Cox regression; in fact, patients not developing a postoperative infection showed an adjusted hazard ratio for death of 2.3 (95% CI, 1-5.3).
CONCLUSION: The association between infection and prolonged survival is not definitive; we acknowledge the considerable difficulties in undertaking this type of study in a retrospective manner. Our results can instead stimulate further multicentric studies (to increase the number of patients) or experimental studies using genetically modified bacteria for treatment of glioblastoma."
21900825,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21900825/,"BACKGROUND: Many women become pregnant while undergoing antidepressant treatment and are concerned about continuing antidepressant medication. However, antidepressant discontinuation may increase the risk of a new episode of major depressive disorder. We sought to estimate differences in the risk of developing a new major depressive episode among pregnant and postpartum women with recurrent illness who either did or did not use antidepressants.
METHODS: Participants were recruited from obstetrical settings; we analyzed a subgroup of 778 women with a history of a depressive disorder. Diagnoses were determined by the Composite International Diagnostic Interview administered twice in pregnancy and once after delivery. We used Cox Regression to model onset of a major depressive episode with a time-dependent predictor of antidepressant use.
RESULTS: There was no clear difference in risk of a major depressive episode between women who took antidepressants and women who did not (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.88; 95% CI = 0.51-1.50). After accounting for antidepressant use, clearly hazardous factors included 4 or more depressive episodes before pregnancy (HR = 1.97; 95% CI = 1.09-3.57), black race (HR = 3.69; 95% CI = 2.16-6.30), and Hispanic ethnicity (HR = 2.33; 95% CI = 1.47-3.69).
CONCLUSIONS: Failure to use or discontinuation of antidepressants in pregnancy did not have a strong effect on the development of a major depressive episode. Women with 4 or more episodes before pregnancy were at high risk of a major depressive episode, independent of antidepressant use. Black and Hispanic women also were at high risk of a major depressive episode, but it is possible that this effect is attributable to unmeasured factors."
21900857,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21900857/,"OBJECTIVES: To assess whether postconcussive symptoms (PCS) can be used to discriminate injury severity among children with mild traumatic brain injury (TBI).
PARTICIPANTS: One hundred eighty-six children with mild TBI, divided into high and low injury severity depending on whether the injury was associated with a loss of consciousness (LOC), and a comparison group of 99 children with orthopedic injuries (OI), all aged 8 to 15 years at the time of injury.
MAIN MEASURES: Parent-rated frequency and severity of PCS at initial assessment within 2 weeks postinjury and again at 3 and 12 months postinjury.
RESULTS: Ratings of PCS obtained at the initial and 3-month assessments differentiated children with mild TBI from OI, although only ratings at the initial assessment discriminated among all 3 groups. Somatic PCS accounted for most of the discriminatory power.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the accuracy of group classification was relatively modest, with a large proportion of misclassifications of children in the mild-TBI groups. Although children with mild TBI have more PCS than children with OI, PCS do not permit sufficiently accurate discrimination of mild TBI and injury severity to warrant diagnostic decisions at this time."
21901035,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21901035/,"BACKGROUND: Incorrect use of antibiotics is a major public health concern both nationally and globally due to the development of antibiotic resistance. The goal of this study was to see if prescription of antibiotics for urinary tract infections in general practice was in accordance with national guidelines.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We combined two sets of data from February and March 2003: prescriptions of antibiotics redeemed in pharmacies, and electronic billing cards collected from the National Insurance Agency from 145 general practitioners in Vestfold county. We analysed all consultations related to urinary tract problems, and we found which antibiotics had been prescribed and for how long. The treatment was then compared with the national guidelines. A logistic regression analysis identified factors associated with adequate treatment length.
RESULTS: Trimetoprime and mecillinam were most frequently prescribed to both genders. Sixty-nine (6 %) of the total 1,102 prescriptions were quinolones. A total of 271 (32 %) of 847 patients who were prescribed antibiotics for cystitis did not get treatment of sufficient length. Female and young patients were more often given the correct duration of treatment. Doctors with 1,000-1,500 patients more frequently prescribed sufficiently long treatment compared to other physicians. Six patients (0.5 %) were prescribed another antibiotic between two and 14 days after the first prescription.
CONCLUSION: The choice of antibiotics conformed well with national guidelines, but the duration of the treatment was often too short. In spite of this, only 0.5 % showed signs of relapse. A number of factors associated with adequate treatment length were identified. The empirical use of furadantin can be increased."
21901270,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21901270/,"BACKGROUND: Black women experience higher rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) than white women, though evidence for racial differences in subclinical CVD is mixed. Few studies have examined multiple roles (number, perceived stress, and/or reward) in relation to subclinical CVD, or whether those effects differ by race.
PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of multiple roles on 2-year progression of coronary artery calcium.
METHODS: Subjects were 104 black and 232 white women (mean age 50.8 years). Stress and reward from four roles (spouse, parent, employee, caregiver) were assessed on five-point scales. Coronary artery calcium progression was defined as an increase of ≥10 Agatston units.
RESULTS: White women reported higher rewards from their multiple roles than black women, yet black women showed cardiovascular benefits from role rewards. Among black women only, higher role rewards were related significantly to lower progression of coronary artery calcium, adjusting for body mass index, blood pressure, and other known CVD risk factors. Blacks reported fewer roles but similar role stress as whites; role number and stress were unrelated to coronary artery calcium progression.
CONCLUSION: Rewarding roles may be a novel protective psychosocial factor for progression of coronary calcium among black women."
21901478,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21901478/,"UNLABELLED: We analyzed the relationship between aortic calcification and two osteoporotic parameters (bone mineral density (BMD) and incident osteoporotic fractures) in 667 ambulatory, elderly women from the Epidemiology of Osteoporosis (EPIDOS) cohort (mean age, 80 years; range, 72-94 years). We did not find any correlation between the aortic calcification score and BMD or osteoporotic fractures.
INTRODUCTION: The aging process is associated with osteoporosis and aortic calcification; conditions which may have similar disease mechanisms. However, the relationship between these two settings remains to be elucidated. We analyzed the relationship between aortic calcification and osteoporotic parameters (BMD and incident osteoporotic fractures) in a cohort of ambulatory, elderly women.
METHODS: The study included 667 ambulatory women from the EPIDOS cohort (mean age, 80 years; age range, 72-94 years). The baseline examination included bone investigations, a clinical and functional examination, and a comprehensive questionnaire on health status and lifestyle. Semiquantitative methods were used to determine the abdominal aortic calcification score on baseline radiographs. Incident fractures were recorded via postal questionnaires issued every 4 months for about 4 years.
RESULTS: Five hundred three women (75%) had aortic calcification. The mean aortic calcification score was 5.5 (median, 4). During the follow-up period, 186 (28%) women reported one or more incident osteoporotic fractures. We did not find any correlation between the aortic calcification score on one hand and the BMD or the occurrence of incident osteoporotic fractures on the other. Only age and systolic blood pressure were found to be independently associated with the aortic calcification score. Osteoporotic fractures were independently associated with age and BMD.
CONCLUSIONS: Osteoporosis and aortic calcification appear to be independent processes in a cohort of ambulatory, elderly women. However, potential confounding factors may be present and prospective studies are needed to investigate this situation further."
1386135,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1386135/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether improvement in the survival rate of infants with a birthweight of less than 1501 g was accompanied by an increase in the rate of neurological impairment or disability among the survivors.
DESIGN, SETTING AND PATIENTS: Two cohorts of consecutive very low birthweight infants (birthweight less than 1501 g) in one tertiary perinatal centre were followed prospectively to eight years of age; for both cohorts, comparison groups of children of birthweight more than 1501 g were randomly selected from hospital births.
INTERVENTIONS: The first cohort was born before the introduction of assisted ventilation (1966-1970), the second after assisted ventilation was well established (1980-1982).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Comparisons between cohorts, at eight years of age, of the survival rates and the rates of severe sensorineural impairments and disabilities.
RESULTS: The survival rate for very low birthweight infants to eight years of age almost doubled between these cohorts, from 37.1% to 67.8% (odds ratio [OR], 3.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.5-4.7; chi 2 = 57.6; P much less than 0.0001). The biggest gain was the increase in non-disabled survivors at eight years of age, from 52.6% in the first cohort to 80.8% in the second cohort (OR, 3.5; 95% CI, 2.2-5.7; chi 2 = 26.7; P less than 0.0001). Furthermore, the rate of severe disabilities in survivors fell substantially, from 13.6% to 4.1% (OR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.14-0.69; chi 2 = 8.3; P less than 0.01). Of specific impairments, the rate of severe sensorineural deafness fell substantially (3.2% to 0%: OR, 0.14, 95% CI, 0.02-0.81; chi 2 = 4.8; P less than 0.05), as did the rate of severe intellectual impairment (13.0% to 2.7%: OR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.11-0.57; chi 2 = 10.7; P less than 0.002). Only the rate of cerebral palsy increased, but not significantly (2.6% to 6.8%; OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 0.89-7.6; chi 2 = 3.0).
CONCLUSIONS: It has been possible to improve the survival rate of very low birthweight infants over time without increasing the number of severely disabled survivors. Whether the long-term outcome for these infants is continuing to improve with more recent advances in perinatal care remains to be determined."
1386194,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1386194/,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to determine whether there are differences in clinical characteristics in two groups of patients with Alzheimer's disease, those reported to have a family history of dementia and those without a family history of dementia.
METHOD: Using a data set from an Alzheimer's disease patient registry, funded as part of a National Institute on Aging cooperative agreement, the authors made comparisons of sociodemographic and clinical variables in a group of 462 patients with Alzheimer's disease, 172 reported to have at least one first-degree relative with dementia and 290 classified with no family history.
RESULTS: Patients with a presumptive family history differed from those without a family history in two ways: the course of dementia was described as having a fast rather than a slow progression from onset of symptoms to diagnosis, and caregivers reported a higher prevalence of family history of psychiatric disorders. There were no significant differences in age at onset, duration, female gender, aphasia and apraxia, handedness, family history of Down's syndrome, or number of children, brothers, and sisters.
CONCLUSIONS: The association of faster course and family history of psychiatric disorders in the patients with a family history of dementia is consistent with the hypothesis of heterogeneity, but the overall results could also be explained by a genetic-environmental model of Alzheimer's disease."
1386621,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1386621/,"BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic studies link oral contraceptive use with several cardiovascular events, but the literature is difficult to summarize, and potential biases remain poorly addressed. This study uses meta-analysis to summarize study results and to analyze the influence of study characteristics, including susceptibility to bias, on study outcome.
METHODS: Forty-seven case-control and cohort studies of oral contraceptives and four cardiovascular events were coded for relative risk (RR) and study characteristics, including adherence to 14 bias-control standards. Key RRs were pooled to summarize findings for each disease type. Univariate determinants of the magnitude of the relative risks were identified, and partial correlation analysis was performed for each disease type.
RESULTS: Relative risks were significantly greater than 1.0 for venous thromboembolism (RR = 2.8, CI = 2.4 to 3.2), stroke (RR = 1.8, CI = 1.6 to 2.0), and myocardial infarction (RR = 1.6, CI = 1.4 to 1.8), but not for death due to any cardiovascular cause (RR = 1.0, CI = 0.8 to 1.3). Study characteristics were diverse, and potential biases were frequently uncontrolled. For three of ten study characteristics identified as independently influencing relative risk, methodologically stronger studies of venous thromboembolism tended to have higher RRs. The RRs for stroke and myocardial infarction were lower in studies that were methodologically stronger with regard to variables identified as important. In studies of cardiovascular death, bias-control standards identified as important were generally well addressed by the studies.
CONCLUSIONS: Oral contraceptive use does not appear to increase overall cardiovascular mortality. The associations noted with stroke and myocardial infarction may be due to methodologic flaws in the studies, while the association with venous thromboembolism is more likely to be valid."
1387073,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1387073/,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of combination therapy with insulin and sulfonylurea in the treatment of NIDDM.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Studies published between January 1966 and January 1991 were identified through a computerized Medline search and by hand searching the bibliographies of identified articles. We identified 17 eligible randomized, controlled trials of combination therapy in NIDDM. These trials had a minimum duration of 8 wk and at least one of three outcome measures (fasting glucose, HbA1, or C-peptide) with SD or SE of the mean reported to do metaanalysis. With standardized forms, three independent reviews abstracted measures of study quality and specific descriptive information about population, intervention, and outcome measurements.
RESULTS: We calculated effect size and weighted mean changes of the three outcome measures for control and treatment groups. In the treatment group, the fasting plasma glucose decreased from a mean of 11.4 mM (206 mg/dl) at baseline to a mean of 9.16 mM (165 mg/dl) posttreatment, whereas the control group decreased from (11.3 to 10.8 mM) (204 to 194 mg/dl) (effect size 0.39, P less than 0.0001). For HbA1, the treatment group decreased from a baseline of 11.0 to 10.2% compared to 11.0 and 11.2% in the control group (effect size 0.43, P less than 0.0001). For fasting C-peptide, the treatment group increased from 0.49 to 0.58 nM (1.45 to 1.75 ng/ml) compared with 0.47 and 0.43 (1.42 and 1.30) for the control group (effect size 0.26, P less than 0.017).
CONCLUSION: Combined insulin-sulfonylurea therapy leads to modest improvement in glycemic control compared with insulin therapy alone. With combined therapy, lower insulin doses may be used to achieve similar control. Obese patients with higher fasting C-peptides may be more likely to respond than others."
1389193,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1389193/,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine whether data recorded by an information management system is significantly different from that recorded manually.
DESIGN: A comparison was made between 13 handwritten and 13 computer-generated anesthesia records by calculating the frequency with which recorded variables were outside predetermined acceptable ranges. Five physiologic variables [systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate (HR), end-tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PETCO2), and oxygen saturation by pulse oximeter (SpO2)] were compared during the initial 1 1/2 hours of operation.
SETTING: Surgical suite at a university-affiliated hospital.
PATIENTS: Thirteen adult patients scheduled for operations that required general anesthesia for longer than 1 1/2 hours.
INTERVENTION: In addition to the traditional handwritten anesthesia records, an information management system (ARKIVE Patient Management System, DIATEK, San Diego, CA) was used to collect data from each case.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: No significant differences were found between the methods in the frequency of elevated SBP, elevated DBP, and tachycardia. However, the manual records showed low SBP, DBP, and HR with a significantly lower frequency (2%, 11%, 1%, respectively) than the automated records (6%, 26%, 5%, respectively; p < 0.01). The automated PETCO2 readings were higher than the upper limit (40 mmHg) with a higher frequency (18%) than the manual records (3%; p < 0.01). On the automated records, SpO2 was noted to be 90% or less on two occasions, but significant desaturation was noted only once on the manual charts.
CONCLUSIONS: Observer bias, missed readings, and errors of memory, which affect manual anesthetic records, may cause significant inaccuracy and may be avoided by using automated records generated by information management systems."

DESIGN: Doppler derived cardiac output measurements at three pacing rates (90/min, 110/min and 130/min) in five pacing modes: right ventricular pacing, donor atrial pacing, recipient-donor synchronous pacing, donor atrial-ventricular sequential pacing, and synchronous recipient-donor atrial-ventricular sequential pacing.
PATIENTS: 11 healthy cardiac transplant recipients with three pairs of epicardial leads inserted at transplantation.
RESULTS: Donor atrial pacing (+11% overall) and donor atrial-ventricular sequential pacing (+8% overall) were significantly better than right ventricular pacing (p < 0.001) at all pacing rates. Synchronised pacing of recipient and donor atrial segments did not confer additional benefit in either atrial or atrial-ventricular sequential modes of pacing in terms of cardiac output at rest at these fixed rates.
CONCLUSIONS: Atrial pacing or atrial-ventricular sequential pacing appear to be appropriate modes in cardiac transplant recipients. Synchronisation of recipient and donor atrial segments in this study produced no additional benefit. Chronotropic competence in these patients may, however, result in improved exercise capacity and deserves further investigation."

DESIGN: Analysis of restriction fragments of XbaI digests of DNA from clinical and control isolates of B pertussis by pulse field gel electrophoresis.
MATERIALS: 105 isolates of B pertussis: 67 clinical isolates from throughout the United Kingdom and 23 from Germany (collected during the previous 18 months); vaccine strains 2991 and 3700; and 13 control isolates from Manchester University's culture collection.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequency of DNA types according to country of origin and classical serotyping.
RESULTS: 17 DNA types were identified on the basis of the variation in 11 fragments, banding at 200-412 kilobases; 15 types were found in the clinical and control isolates from the United Kingdom and seven in those from Germany. There was no correlation with serotype. DNA type 1 was the commonest overall (22/105 strains, 22%), predominating in serotypes 1,2 and 1,2,3 and including the vaccine strains but not the isolates from Germany.
CONCLUSIONS: Current infections due to B pertussis are not caused by a clonal pathogen as multiple strains are circulating in a given population at one time. There is also considerable epidemiological variation in the pathogen population between countries. These findings may have implications for the design of acellular vaccines."

DESIGN: Randomised, controlled trial; randomisation by household.
SETTING: General practice in a market town.
SUBJECTS: Of 863 patients aged 70 and over on the practice records, 674 were traced and successfully interviewed; 350 were assigned to the intervention group, 324 as controls.
INTERVENTION: The people in the intervention group were allocated to the care of a health visitor. The approach was four pronged: assessment and correction of nutritional deficiencies, including reducing smoking and alcohol intake; assessment and referral of medical conditions such as heart block or inappropriate medication; assessment and correction of environmental hazards in the home such as poor lighting; assessment and improvement of fitness--for example, exercise classes for the moderately fit. The intervention continued for four years.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Fracture rate over four years.
RESULTS: The incidence of fractures was 5% (16/350) in the intervention group and 4% (14/324) in the control group (difference not significant).
CONCLUSIONS: A health visitor visiting a group of people aged 70 and over and using simple preventive measures had no effect on the incidence of fractures."
1392922,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1392922/,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate applications for general practice partnership vacancies by established general practitioner principals, the reasons for changing partnerships, and the disincentives to these moves.
DESIGN: Confidential postal questionnaire.
SUBJECTS: Applicants to 367 general practices in the United Kingdom advertising for a new full time partner.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The proportion of job applications containing at least one application from established principals, proportion of principals appointed as new partners, incentives and disincentives to changing partnership.
RESULTS: Of 325 replies (89% response rate) received, 292 were suitable for further analysis. 210/241 (87%) of all applications contained some applications from at least one established principal. 12% of all applications were made by principals. 41/296 (14%) of the newly appointed partners had previously been an established principal. The main reasons for leaving the previous partnership were a desire to move locality or not getting on with previous partners. The disincentives to changing partnerships were largely financial, including the cost of the move and loss of income.
CONCLUSIONS: It is possible for established principals in general practice to overcome the disincentives and to change partnerships. There did not seem to be any overall prejudice against appointing principals, in contrast to previously published views."
1395767,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1395767/,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine whether the systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressures measured in the radial artery accurately reflect corresponding pressures in the ascending aorta in narcotic-anesthetized patients with known obstructive coronary artery disease, before being subjected to cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).
DESIGN: This was a prospective study.
SETTING: The cardiac operating room of a large, tertiary-care university medical center.
PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-one patients (45 men and six women; age range, 48 to 77 years) with documented atherosclerotic coronary artery disease were studied. All patients underwent elective coronary artery bypass grafting after the study.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients were premedicated with lorazepam and morphine 60 min before administration of Fentanyl-pancuronium anesthesia. The radial artery was cannulated before induction of anesthesia and the aorta approximately 45 min later. Comparisons of radial and aortic pressures were then performed.
MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Radial and aortic pressures were recorded through standard, fluid-filled, high-pressure, 91-cm (36-in) long tubing and disposable transducers, meticulously cleared of air bubbles. Additional measurements included cardiac output, central venous pressure, core temperature, blood gas levels, and hematocrit reading. Radial-aortic pressure differences were as follows: systolic arterial pressure (SAP), 12 +/- 1 mm Hg; mean arterial pressure (MAP), -0.8 +/- 0.3 mm Hg; and diastolic arterial pressure (DAP), -1.0 +/- 0.3 mm Hg. All were significant (p < 0.001), but the SAP difference was more than ten times that of either the MAP or the DAP values. The coefficients of determination (r2) indicated that the radial-aortic dependence was 0.44 for the SAP, 0.90 for the DAP, and 0.98 for the MAP relationship. Plotting the respective differences against the arithmetic mean of simultaneously measured pressures indicated that the radial SAP was 4 to 35 mm Hg higher than the aortic in 42 patients (82 percent) and was 10 to 35 mm Hg higher in 26 patients (51 percent); radial-aortic MAP differences clustered within 3 mm Hg in 47 patients (92 percent); radial DAP was +/- 3 mm Hg different from the aortic in 46 patients (90 percent). The largest MAP difference was -6 mm Hg in one patient. The largest DAP difference was +/- 5 mm Hg in three patients.
CONCLUSIONS: In this group of patients, who were studied before undergoing CPB, the radial SAP gave a poor estimate of that present in the ascending aorta, since in more than 50 percent of the cases, the radial SAP was 10 to 35 mm Hg higher than that in the aorta. The radial MAP and DAP are reliable, since in 90 percent and 92 percent of the patients, respectively, the pressure differences were within +/- 3 mm Hg of those in the aorta."
1397828,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1397828/,"BACKGROUND: Family medicine has responded to the need for training in geriatrics by creating geriatric fellowships and by including geriatric education in residency and medical school curricula. Fellowships, in particular, require extensive time commitment by participating physicians.
METHODS: We developed a 1-month geriatric training experience for academic family physicians. We surveyed previous participants in this short course to determine their subsequent level of activity in geriatrics, whether they had become certified in geriatrics, and other information about their academic experience in geriatrics.
RESULTS: Eighty-one percent of graduates of this 1-month course had passed the geriatrics certification examination, compared to only 56% nationally. Graduates of the program were active as geriatric program directors and teachers of geriatrics, but there was limited activity in research or other scholarly activities related to geriatrics.
CONCLUSION: Intensive short-term training in geriatrics meets some but not all of the needs for academic competency and productivity in geriatrics."
1401272,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1401272/,"BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that oral lesions in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) may be grouped clinically as erythema, discoid lesions, or oral ulcerations. Oral ulcerations have been said to foretell a severe systemic disease flare and the proposal that oral ulcers represent a mucosal vasculitis has been suggested to explain this hypothesis.
OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to test the hypothesis that oral ulcers in patients with SLE result from vasculitis.
METHODS: We studied 10 patients with American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for a diagnosis of SLE who had oral lesions of lupus (six prospectively and four retrospectively) clinically and by routine and immunofluorescence microscopy. Biopsy specimens were reviewed in a single-blinded fashion.
RESULTS: In our patients, no oral lesion, regardless of morphology, demonstrated vasculitis histologically. All lesions demonstrated an interface mucositis.
CONCLUSION: Our data strongly contradict the hypothesis that leukocytoclastic vasculitis explains a possible unproven correlation between oral ulceration and disease flares in patients with SLE."

RESULTS: Second- and third-year residents had a pooled average for correct responses of 91%; dermatologists in practice less than 10 years, 84%; dermatologists in practice more than 10 years, 67%.
CONCLUSION: Dermatologists are able to use the Tzanck preparation effectively for diagnosing herpetic infections. Second- and third-year residents who are most likely to be diagnosing blistering eruptions in immunosuppressed or otherwise critically ill patients are especially accurate interpreters."
1403202,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1403202/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a single Waters view (occipito-mental) radiograph could be substituted for a four-view sinus series to diagnose sinusitis, and to determine the inter- and intraobserver variabilities for sinus radiography.
DESIGN: Radiographs were interpreted by radiologists blinded to the clinical history, and results were recorded on a standardized form.
SETTING: Veterans Affairs Medical Center.
PARTICIPANTS: Staff attending radiologists, an attending radiologist with special training in skull radiology, and a senior radiology resident.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The agreement between the Waters view and the four-view sinus series was moderate to substantial (simple agreement = 75-84%, kappa = 0.5-0.68). However, agreement varied by sinus and, after correction for chance agreement, was substantial only for the maxillary sinuses (kappa = 0.72-0.87). Intraobserver agreement (kappa = 0.72-0.84) was superior to interobserver agreement (kappa = 0.49-0.59) for the four-view sinus series.
CONCLUSIONS: Substituting a single Waters view for a four-view sinus series may be an acceptable strategy for diagnosing maxillary sinusitis."
1403204,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1403204/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of age and work status on whether and where cardiovascular specialists would place hypothetical patients in the queue for coronary surgery.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mailed survey presenting a set of clinical scenarios either to be rated on a scale with 7 time frames for urgency of need or to be designated as questionable/inappropriate for intervention. The basic scenario was a patient with mild-moderate stable angina, good left ventricular function, and limited coronary disease; operative risks and stress test results were varied. Three identifiers were used: ""45-year-old civil servant gainfully employed""; ""45-year-old laborer disabled by angina, faces job loss""; and ""75-year-old retiree, angina limits golf.""
PARTICIPANTS: Cardiologists and cardiac surgeons practicing in five Ontario medical centers (n = 120).
RESULTS: There was a 59% response rate (120 usable responses). Large shifts in willingness to intervene occurred in favor of the disabled laborer (p less than 0.0001) and against the retiree (p-value ranges from 0.04 to less than 0.0001, depending on operative risk and stress test results), but not for the employed civil servant. Striking effects (p less than 0.0001) were also evident in ratings of waiting time, with the order of priority being the disabled laborer first, the civil servant second, and the retiree last. The overall mean shift due to work status or age was equal to, or larger than, the mean shift due to clinical factors, such as stress test results, changes in severity of stable angina, and extent of coronary disease.
CONCLUSION: Cardiovascular specialists may place considerable weight on age and work status in determining urgency and appropriateness of coronary revascularization. Risk-benefit concerns may partly explain shifting thresholds for intervention, but not differential waiting times. The influence of these factors should be sought in utilization audits and addressed from an ethical perspective."
17822482,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17822482/,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to ascertain how frequently toothbrushing and flossing are practiced among schoolchildren in Kuwait and whether life- and school-satisfaction and self-esteem indicators are associated with oral hygiene habits.
METHODS: A sample of 2312 schoolchildren between 11 and 13 years old filled out a structured questionnaire anonymously in school classrooms during 2002 and 2003. For this study, nationally representative samples of children were drawn from all six governorates of Kuwait. Only government schools were included. The questionnaire of the Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children Study was used in this study after it was modified to suit Kuwait. A chi-squared test and logistic regression model were used for analyzing the data.
RESULTS: Over half of the pupils reported brushing their teeth more than once a day; girls reported brushing more frequently than boys did. One-fifth of the pupils did not brush their teeth even on a daily basis. The life- and school-satisfaction and self-esteem indicators were associated with more-than-once-a-day toothbrushing frequency. The strongest predictors for recommended brushing were: feeling very happy (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.38-2.77), feeling that other pupils always accept him/her (1.5; 1.16-2.02), never/sometimes feeling lonely and feeling that it is very easy to make friends (1.4; 1.06-1.94). The summary variables of life-satisfaction, school-satisfaction and self-esteem seemed to be strongly associated with brushing. Dental floss was never used by 45% of the children, weekly by 18% and daily by 17%; 20% did not even know what dental floss was.
CONCLUSIONS: Among intermediate schoolchildren in Kuwait, oral hygiene practices were far behind the international recommendations. Special emphasis should be placed on children who have personal problems with their life, school and self-esteem."
17822485,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17822485/,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the association between two intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) surrogates - IUGR [small for gestational age birth (SGA) and fetal growth restriction (FGR)] and preterm birth with dental caries.
METHODS: Data from the Third National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (1988-1994) were used, including 2- to 5.9-year-old singletons (n = 3189). Dental caries was defined as presence of any teeth with dental caries (treated or untreated) and also as presence of at least two teeth with dental caries. Exposure variables were preterm birth (<37 gestational weeks), FGR, and SGA. Covariates included were poverty, race/ethnicity, age, sex, sucrose intake, environmental tobacco smoking, dental visits, education of head of household, breastfeeding, and use of baby bottle. Separate statistical analyses were conducted for IUGR and for preterm birth through the estimation of prevalence ratio (PR), taking complex sampling design into consideration and adjusting for confounders. Sensitivity analysis was conducted including and excluding 2-year-old children and also with the two definitions of dental caries.
RESULTS: In general, the inclusion of 2-year-old children and the case definition of presence of any teeth with dental caries biased the results toward the null, but with no major changes in the results. In bivariate analysis, SGA and FGR birth were both negatively but not significantly associated with dental caries while a significant positive association was found for preterm birth. Sensitivity analysis showed that the PR for preterm in bivariate analysis varied from 1.65 (95% CI 1.14-2.40) to 1.84 (95% CI 1.19-2.83). After adjusting for confounders, the PR for preterm birth varied from 1.38 (95% CI 1.00-1.89) to 1.64 (95% CI 1.22-2.20). After adjustment, the PR for SGA varied from 0.79 (95% CI 0.56-101) to 0.66 (95% CI 0.33-0.96). For children from 3 to 5.9 years old, the adjusted PR for FGR using the category 'none' as reference were mild (PR 1.10; 95% CI 0.76-1.58), moderate (PR 0.66; 95% CI 0.26-167), and severe (PR 0.59; 95% CI 0.36-0.99). These values for FGR were very similar for the other models using other classifications of case definition or inclusion of 2-year-old children.
CONCLUSIONS: Preterm birth was found to be positively associated with dental caries while there is an indication that SGA and FGR are negatively associated with dental caries. Although the negative association is counterintuitive, it is possible that increased antibiotic use and delayed tooth eruption may explain the negative association between IUGR and dental caries."
17822493,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17822493/,"BACKGROUND: Pemphigus is a rare, life-threatening, acquired autoimmune bullous dermatosis. The prognosis of pemphigus foliaceus (PF) is usually regarded as more favourable than that of pemphigus vulgaris (PV). Our study aims to compare the clinical course of PV and PF in 37 patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study over a period of eight years (1994-2001). The patients were referred during this period and were followed until December 2003. PF and PV were included based on clinical, histological and immunopathological criteria.
RESULTS: In our study there was no significant difference between PF group and PV group concerning; age, sex, duration of the disease, presence of disseminated lesions, treatment, healing time, remission, relapse, complications, death and follows up duration. The survival graph showed no difference between the two groups for the first two relapses. There was a tendency to significance concerning an additional treatment and relapses frequency in the PF group.
CONCLUSIONS: Few studies in the literature were interested in the evolution of the two forms of pemphigus. They showed that the two populations share the same clinical course; nevertheless they revealed the frequency of partial remission, failed treatment, relapses, necessity of high dose of corticosteroids, and difficulties of discontinuing treatment in PF. Our study, suggests that PF and PV may share the same clinical course."
17823462,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17823462/,"BACKGROUND: To compare the postpartum pelvic floor function of women with sutured second-degree perineal lacerations, unsutured second-degree perineal lacerations, and intact perineums.
METHODS: A prospective cohort of nurse-midwifery patients consented to mapping of genital trauma at birth and an assessment of postpartum pelvic floor outcomes. Women completed validated questionnaires for perineal pain and urinary and anal incontinence at 12 weeks postpartum and underwent physical examination to assess pelvic floor strength and anatomy at 6 weeks postpartum.
RESULTS: One hundred seventy-two of 212 (80%) eligible women provided follow-up assessment data at 6 or 12 weeks postpartum. Women with an intact perineum (n=89) used fewer analgesics (P<.002) and had lower pain scores at the time of hospital discharge than women with second-degree lacerations (sutured, n=46; unsutured, n=37; intact, n=89) (P<or=.02). The sutured group was more likely to use analgesics (52%) than the unsutured (35%) or intact (23%) groups at time of hospital discharge (P<.002), although pain scores were not different between sutured and unsutured groups. Postpartum reports of urinary or anal incontinence, sexual inactivity, or sexual function scores did not vary between groups. Weak pelvic floor exercise strength was more common among the women with second-degree lacerations compared with women with an intact perineum (53% vs. 28%; P=.03) but did not differ between sutured (58%) and unsutured (47%) groups (P=not significant). Likewise, perineal body or genital hiatus measurements did not vary between groups (P=not significant).
CONCLUSIONS: Women with sutured lacerations report increased analgesic use at the time of hospital discharge compared with women with intact perineums or unsutured lacerations. At 12 weeks postpartum, no differences were noted between groups regarding complaints of urinary or anal incontinence, sexual inactivity, or sexual function."
17823877,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17823877/,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Genetic studies of complex diseases such as diabetes mellitus (DM) require the recruitment of patients and acquisition of patient data in a time- and cost-effective manner. An effective method to do so may be genetic field work (GFW) that recruits the relatives of index cases, these relatives then replying to appropriate questionnaires. This study investigated the validity of GFW data compared with patient interviews by a physician who had examined those persons.
METHODS: 122 relatives were identified through GFW among a cohort of 35 families with DM. Questionnaires with self-reported information on past medical history, cardiovascular risk factors and life style were obtained. In a second step these famiy members were interviewed and examined by a physician in an outpatient setting.
RESULTS: Comparison of the two data sets of the 122 individuals yielded clear differences which favored interviews by a physician. The number of persons declaring themselves as having DM was significantly lower by GFW than direct examination (18 vs. 27). Diabetic nephropathy was reported by four individuals by GFW, while examination resulted in the identification of 16 cases. Body weight was also clearly too low when self-reported, so that significantly lower values were recorded for BMI in the questionnaire. Hypertension was reported by 25 vs. 54 participants. The amount of cigarettes smoked was significant lower in the GFW than in physicians' examination. But the numbers recorded for myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular disease and stroke were not significantly different.
CONCLUSION: These data show that information obtained by GFW is less accurate than that collected in interview and examination by physicians. The latter are necessary to gain valid data for accurate phenotyping, while GFW is useful in the initial recruitment of relatives."
17824897,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17824897/,"OBJECTIVES: Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is an effective treatment for intractable epilepsy. It is unknown whether acute response is correlated with the amplitude of output current. The purpose of this study was to determine if the output current of VNS is correlated with percent reductions in seizure frequency and response.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of a multicenter randomized trial of three unique paradigms of VNS was carried out in patients with intractable partial onset epilepsy. Output current at 1 and 3 months was correlated with percent reduction in seizure frequency and response rates.
RESULTS: Sixty-one subjects were enrolled and completed the study. Output current, ranging from 0.25 to 1.5 mA, was not correlated with reductions in seizure frequency, or with > or = 50% reduction in seizures. Six of seven initial non-responders did experience > or = 50% reductions in seizures after current was increased.
CONCLUSIONS: The output current is not a major determinant of acute response to VNS for epilepsy. Many patients respond to low current (<1 mA). Some (20%) initial non-responders may respond to an increase in output current."
17824976,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17824976/,"OBJECTIVE: It is not common that, after diversion of the faecal stream by a colostomy, the defunctioned colon develops colitis. The pathogenesis of this colitis is still unclear and it has been proposed that ischaemia may play a major role. Our aim is to look for signs of ischaemia in a group of patients developing colitis after diversion colostomy for various causes.
METHOD: Surgical specimens from 32 patients resected for colitis developed after diverting colostomy were examined with routine (haematoxylin-eosin) and Elastic-Van Gieson and Perls' stains.
RESULTS: The histological features related to mucosal crypt architecture, crypt epithelium and inflammation were mild, non specific or related to the underlying disease. Fibrosis was present in 21 (65.6%) patients, superficial coagulative necrosis was found in 18 (56%) patients, splitting and/or thickening of muscularis mucosae was present in 20 (62%) patients. The vessels were substantially normal or ectasic without thrombi or alterations in the wall. Evident ischaemia with coagulative necrosis, submucosal oedema and focal fibrosis was detected in only two (6%) patients and an intermediate picture between acute and chronic ischaemia was present in 16 (50%) patients.
CONCLUSION: It is possible that ischaemia plays some role in the pathogenesis of diversion colitis; however, further studies are needed to firmly establish its role."
17825421,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17825421/,"OBJECTIVES: Previously published data suggest that a trough serum teicoplanin level of > or = 20 mg/l is predictive of improved outcomes in serious staphylococcal infection. We investigated how dose regimen and patient characteristics impact on trough teicoplanin levels in patients with musculoskeletal infection, in order to help standardise teicoplanin use.
METHODS: We prospectively collected data for 141 clinically stable adults with bone and joint infection treated as outpatients with teicoplanin. Patients with end stage renal failure were excluded.
RESULTS: The most frequently used teicoplanin dose regimens were 400 mg or 600 mg i.v. once daily. Trough levels were available for 78% of episodes, of which 51% were > or = 20 mg/l. Unsurprisingly, a level of > or = 20 mg/l occurred more often with a dose of 600 mg than with lower doses (p=0.005). There was no significant relationship between teicoplanin level and age, body weight or creatinine clearance, but male gender was associated with lower trough levels than female gender (p=0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that teicoplanin levels of > or = 20 mg/l for bone and joint infection in stable adult patients are best achieved with a daily dose of at least 600 mg."
17825609,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17825609/,"OBJECTIVE: To study the feasibility of using acoustic signatures in snore signals for the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).
METHODS: Snoring sounds of 30 apneic snorers (24 males; 6 females; apnea-hypopnea index, AHI=46.9+/-25.7events/h) and 10 benign snorers (6 males; 4 females; AHI=4.6+/-3.4events/h) were captured in a sleep laboratory. The recorded snore signals were preprocessed to remove noise, and subsequently, modeled using a linear predictive coding (LPC) technique. Formant frequencies (F1, F2, and F3) were extracted from the LPC spectrum for analysis. The accuracy of this approach was assessed using receiver operating characteristic curves and notched box plots. The relationship between AHI and F1 was further explored via regression analysis.
RESULTS: Quantitative differences in formant frequencies between apneic and benign snores are found in same- or both-gender snorers. Apneic snores exhibit higher formant frequencies than benign snores, especially F1, which can be related to the pathology of OSA. This study yields a sensitivity of 88%, a specificity of 82%, and a threshold value of F1=470Hz that best differentiate apneic snorers from benign snorers (both gender combined).
CONCLUSION: Acoustic signatures in snore signals carry information for OSA diagnosis, and snore-based analysis might potentially be a non-invasive and inexpensive diagnostic approach for mass screening of OSA."
17825841,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17825841/,"OBJECTIVE: A key assumption underlying the principle that power increases with sample size is that the standardized effect size is fixed over time. In therapeutic areas where it may be difficult to continually recruit from a homogeneous population, this assumption may not be valid; patients randomized toward the end of enrollment may derive from a more heterogeneous population and negatively impact the power of a study. Post hoc analyses were performed on clinical data from four phase III depression trials with paroxetine to evaluate this possibility.
METHODS: Each study used a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design and enrolled approximately 150 patients per treatment arm. Plots of observed p-values for the treatment difference between paroxetine and placebo (on the HAM-D17 change from baseline score at week 8) by cumulative enrollment were made for each study.
RESULTS: As previously reported, three of the four studies showed an overall significant treatment effect and one did not. In each study, a significant treatment effect was observed before approximately 100 patients had been enrolled per treatment arm. Continuing to enroll additional patients did not maintain the achieved level of significance in most instances, and in one case appeared to alter a potentially positive study into a failed study. Plots of p-values versus cumulative enrollment by patient quarters using combined data from all four studies suggested that late-enrolling patients were more likely to be placebo responders than early-enrolling patients. Hypothesized explanations for this finding include a depleted pool of depressed patients and the rush for patient recruitment at the end of a study in order to meet completion timelines. However, no corroborative evidence could be found to support either possibility.
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis demonstrates that bigger is not necessarily better for depression trials."
17825922,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17825922/,"BACKGROUND: Cognitive dysfunctions are being recognized as a major roadblock to functional recovery in patients with bipolar disorders. Little is known about the treatment of these cognitive dysfunctions. Donepezil, approved to treat memory dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease, is evaluated for cognitive dysfunctions common in bipolar disorder. Of concern is some evidence that donepezil may trigger affective instability.
METHODS: All bipolar disordered patients in a private practice setting treated with donepezil for memory problems were analyzed. Patients were assessed for memory improvement and change in psychiatric status with the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement Scale.
RESULTS: Thirty-nine of 58 patients (67%) reported improvement with a mean score of 1.82 (standard deviation+/-0.82). Nine treatments were stopped because of side effects and 4 showed no response. No bipolar I patient received benefits. Thirty-six of 43 (84%) of bipolar II patients showed improvement. Fifty percent of bipolar NOS showed improvement. Four bipolar I patients (57%), 1 bipolar II patient (2%) and 2 bipolar NOS patients (25%) stopped donepezil due to worsening affective symptoms.
LIMITATIONS: This is a naturalistic case series with a single evaluator. Other medications used in treatment were changed as clinically indicated.
CONCLUSIONS: This case series suggests utility for donepezil in the treatment of cognitive problems associated with bipolar II disorder and bipolar disorder NOS. Bipolar I patients showed no improvement and a concerning trend to destabilize with donepezil treatment."

RESULTS: One hundred sixty-seven women delivered twins followed by a singleton pregnancy. Women whose twin delivery was preterm (n = 99) were more likely than those who had delivered a term twin pregnancy (n = 68) to deliver a subsequent preterm singleton pregnancy (13.1% vs 2.9%; odds ratio, 5.0; 95% CI, 1.1, 22.9).

Fetal growth was defined both on a continuum (<1, 1-2, 3-4, 5-9, 10-19, ..., > or = 90) and as birthweight of < 10th percentile for gestational age (FGR) or birthweight of > 90th percentile (large for gestational age [LGA]). All analyses were adjusted for potential confounding factors through multivariable logistic regression.
RESULTS: Rates of abruption among women with and without chronic hypertension were 15.6 and 5.8 per 1000 pregnancies, respectively (relative risk [RR], 2.4; 95% CI, 2.3, 2.5). In comparison with normotensive women with appropriately grown babies (ie, 10th-90th percentile), the association between chronic hypertension and abruption was modified in the presence of FGR (RR, 3.8; 95% CI, 3.6, 4.1) and PIH (RR, 7.7; 95% CI, 6.6, 8.9). However, the highest risk was seen among women with chronic hypertension, PIH, and LGA (RR, 9.0; 95% CI, 7.2, 11.3). A dose-response relationship was observed between the risk of abruption and fetal growth (assessed on a continuum), with the risk being lowest among LGA babies.
CONCLUSION: The association between chronic hypertension and abruption is strong; ischemic placental disease (PIH and FGR) modified this relationship. These findings suggest an etiologic relationship between abruption and chronic placental disease. Chronic hypertension, if associated with LGA, is not associated with abruption; however, chronic hypertension with superimposed PIH accompanied by LGA is associated with significantly increased risk."
17826427,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17826427/,"OBJECTIVE: These studies were performed to elucidate the expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in the uterus, cervix, and placenta in pregnancy and across gestation.
STUDY DESIGN: Message expressions of TLR-2, -3, -4, and -9 were investigated in nonpregnant mice and across gestation in CD-1 mice. Uterine, cervical, and placental tissues were harvested, and RNA was extracted. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed.
RESULTS: Messenger RNA expression of TLRs is significantly upregulated in pregnant uterine and cervical tissues. There is differential TLR messenger RNA expression between the uterus, cervix, and placenta. In the placenta, TLR 4 is significantly downregulated.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the innate immune system is a dynamic system during gestation. The concept of immunosuppression during pregnancy appears to be valid in the placenta only in regard to TLR expression. Research is warranted to determine whether the upregulation in the uterus and cervix during pregnancy is associated with an increased likelihood of responding to a pathogen or serve as a protective mechanism or both."
17826460,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17826460/,"OBJECTIVE: To improve the reproducibility of testing hip abduction and adduction using an isokinetic dynamometer by a novel testing protocol.
DESIGN: Test-retest design.
SETTING: Biodynamics laboratory.
PARTICIPANTS: Fifteen healthy subjects (9 men, 6 women; age, 22.4+/-0.5 y) were recruited.
INTERVENTIONS: Two setups were compared: the first according to manufacturer's guidelines (setup A) and the second a novel setup incorporating pelvic fixation (setup B). Setups A and B were performed in a random order. Both setups included the same battery of isokinetic (30 degrees/s, 60 degrees/s) and isometric tests, and were repeated 1 week later.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The peak torque for each abduction and adduction exercise was noted and pelvic motion during testing was recorded.
RESULTS: Setup B significantly (P<.05) reduced transverse pelvic rotation by between 7.5 degrees and 8.0 degrees dependent on test speed. Mean differences for reproducibility of peak torque, ranged from 0.8 to 11.7 Nm. The coefficients of repeatability of both setups were similar, ranging from 21.4 to 56.3 Nm across isokinetic exercises. A similar observation was noted for isometric exercises, with the differences between the coefficients of repeatability ranging from 18.6 to 40.0 Nm.
CONCLUSIONS: Reducing pelvic rotation does not enhance reproducibility of the system and is not related to torque production. Further research is required to determine the optimal test setup."
17826478,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17826478/,"OBJECTIVES: To demonstrate that urethrocutaneous fistulas can be repaired under local anesthesia in adult patients without catheters.
METHODS: From 1998 to 2006, 96 patients with urethrocutaneous fistulas underwent repair under local anesthesia. The patients were divided into two groups in terms of whether they did or did not have a catheter placed. The catheterized group included 45 patients and the uncatheterized group included 51 patients. The uncatheterized patients were discharged on the operation day, and the catheterized patients were discharged 1 to 4 days postoperatively. Patients were reevaluated on the 7th postoperative day and after 3 months in terms of wound infection, urethral stricture, and fistula recurrence.
RESULTS: All patients tolerated the fistula repair well under local anesthesia. The success rate of fistula repair was 93.3% and 94.1% in the catheterized and uncatheterized groups, respectively. Wound infection was seen in 6 patients in the first group but was not noted in the uncatheterized group. Fistulas recurred in 3 patients in each group (6.6% and 5.8%) after 3 months postoperatively.
CONCLUSIONS: Catheterless fistula repair with local anesthesia in adults is an effective, safe, and inexpensive procedure."

METHODS: A total of 159 women 33 to 77 years old (mean 55.3) was included in this study. UM was quantified using the Q-tip angle. Patients were stratified into the urethral hypermobility (UH) group (Q-tip test angle 30 degrees or greater, n = 96) and the non-UH group (Q-tip test angle less than 30 degrees, n = 63). The mean follow-up time was 6.5 +/- 0.4 months.
RESULTS: In the UH group, the Q-tip test values decreased significantly compared with the baseline data (41.2 degrees +/- 1.1 degrees versus 31.0 degrees +/- 1.4 degrees, P <0.001). No difference was evident in the non-UH group (17.0 degrees +/- 0.9 degrees versus 17.0 degrees +/- 1.1 degrees, P = 965). The overall cure rate was not significantly different in either group (91.7% versus 84.1%, P = 0.142). After the TOT procedure, 66 had a Q-tip test result of 30 degrees or greater. The overall cure rate was not significantly different in the postoperative UH and non-UH groups (92.4% versus 86.0%, P = 0.209).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study have shown that UM decreases after the TOT procedure in the UH group but not in the non-UH group. The cure rate was not lower in the non-UH group compared with that in the UH group. Our findings suggest that the lack of UM should not be considered a factor indicating a high risk of failure after the TOT procedure."
17826487,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17826487/,"OBJECTIVES: The sensitivity of voided urinary cytology has been reported as very low. In this study, we investigated the sensitivity and clinical utility of voided urinary cytology in the detection of various grades and stages of transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder compared with the urinary nuclear matrix protein-22 (NMP-22) qualitative assay.
METHODS: From March 2004 to April 2006, all patients with TCC of the bladder receiving follow-up care and those presenting with gross hematuria were enrolled in this prospective study. These patients underwent urinary cytologic examination and NMP-22 qualitative assay. The diagnosis, determined from the cystoscopy findings and biopsy findings of the suspicious lesion, was accepted as the reference standard.
RESULTS: A total of 196 patients were enrolled in this study, of whom 127 patients had previously been diagnosed with bladder TCC and 69 were presenting for investigation of gross hematuria. A total of 52 cases of bladder TCC were diagnosed. The overall sensitivity of voided urine cytology and NMP-22 assay was 21.1% and 67.3%, respectively (P <0.001). The sensitivity of urinary cytology and urinary NMP-22 for well-differentiated tumors was 9.5% and 52.4%, respectively, and was 18.1% and 77.3%, respectively (P <0.001), in moderately differentiated tumors. The overall specificity of urinary cytology for TCC of the bladder was 98.6% and was greater than the specificity of NMP-22 (80.5%).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study suggest that urinary cytology has a very low sensitivity and can be omitted in favor of NMP-22 in the follow-up of low-grade superficial bladder TCC."
17826654,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17826654/,"PURPOSE: To correlate Gleason grading in prostate biopsies with the final Gleason score in radical prostatectomy specimens, and to investigate predictors for concordance and preoperative undergrading.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The charts of 303 patients who underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy between 1992 and 2002 were retrospectively reviewed. Prostate biopsy and surgical specimen Gleason scores and correlative clinical data were recorded, and a multivariate analysis model was applied.
RESULTS: Data were available in 293 cases (97%). The preoperative biopsy predicted the prostatectomy Gleason score accurately in 51% and undergraded them in 41% of the patients. Accuracy rates were significantly higher for Gleason scores 7-10 compared to low Gleason scores (2-4), concordance 90% and 6%, respectively (P < 0.01). Moreover, accuracy rates were higher in patients with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) higher than 10 ng/ml (85% vs. 40%; P < 0.01) and prostate glands smaller than 55 g (68% vs. 38%; P < 0.01). In 233 patients, the biopsy Gleason score did not include 4 or 5 components. Upgrading to 4 or 5 in 1 of the components was noted in 32 patients (14%). Multivariate analysis revealed that upgrading is associated with preoperative serum PSA (odds ratio 1.05; P < 0.05) and the percentage of positive cores in the biopsy (odds ratio 1.47; P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Biopsy Gleason scores of 2-4, low PSA, and a low percentage of positive cores in the biopsy can predict the biopsy driven biologically significant undergrading of 1 of the components of the Gleason score that may adversely affect therapeutic decisions."
17827951,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17827951/,"BACKGROUND: Quality of life (QoL) is becoming a major issue in the evaluation of any therapeutic intervention.
AIMS: To assess the QoL in patients with uncomplicated symptomatic diverticular disease (DD) and to elucidate the influence of two different treatments either on symptoms or QoL.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 58 outpatients affected by uncomplicated symptomatic DD, admitted in our Gastroenterological Unit from October 2003 to March 2004, were enrolled. Patients were randomly assigned to two different treatments consisting of rifaximin or mesalazine for 10 days every month for a period of 6 months. QoL was evaluated by means of an SF-36 questionnaire and clinical evaluation was registered by means of a global symptomatic score (GSS) at baseline and after 6 months.
RESULTS: At baseline, lower values in all SF-36 domains were confirmed in patients with DD. Both rifaximin and mesalazine groups showed a significant reduction of their mean GSS (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively) and improvement of SF-36 mean scores after therapy, even though treatment with mesalazine showed better results.
CONCLUSIONS: DD has a negative impact on QoL. Cyclic treatment with poorly absorbable antibiotics or anti-inflammatory drugs relieves symptoms and improves QoL."
17828400,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17828400/,"PURPOSE: Prophylactic surgery decisions are difficult. Supplemental information improves patients' knowledge, promoting active participation in decision-making. Our objective was to examine internet information regarding prophylactic surgery for familial adenomatous polyposis to determine its adequacy in facilitating patient participation in surgical decision-making.
METHODS: We searched the internet for information on surgery for familial adenomatous polyposis, using an intentionally simple strategy to represent patients' searches. We examined the first 50 sites from each search, assessing each for content by using predefined criteria. Every site was evaluated by two investigators (kappa 0.71) by using the DISCERN criteria, a tool for evaluating quality of health information. Search-efficiency was calculated.
RESULTS: Searches revealed 307,138 ""hits""; 20 sites met inclusion criteria. GOOGLE demonstrated the highest search-efficiency (28 percent). Sites were maintained by general health pages (35 percent), hospitals (30 percent), professional organizations (15 percent), familial adenomatous polyposis registries (10 percent), and government (10 percent). Only 40 percent had been developed and/or updated within two years. Most included basic information regarding risk, symptoms, diagnosis, as well as discussion of familial adenomatous polyposis-associated diseases and surveillance (80-100 percent). Although 90 percent of sites presented surgical treatment options, only 60 percent provided details. Few provided information regarding postoperative bowel function (40 percent), sexual function (20 percent), or fertility (5 percent). Seven (35 percent) were identified as being of ""good/excellent"" quality. Only four were patient-oriented; variable information was provided.
CONCLUSIONS: Internet information regarding surgical treatment of familial adenomatous polyposis is sparse, and insufficient to support active patient participation in decision-making. Despite the time and financial commitment required, development of high-quality internet resources may be justified given the lack of adequate patient-oriented information currently available."
17828823,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17828823/,"AIM: To study the outcomes of patients with compensated hepatitis C virus-related cirrhosis.
METHODS: Twenty-four grade A5 and 11 grade A6 of Child-Pugh classification cirrhotic patients with active virus replication, treated for a mean period of 31.3 +/- 5.1 mo with moderate doses of interferon-alpha and ribavirin, were compared to a cohort of 36 patients with similar characteristics, without antiviral treatment. Salivary caffeine concentration, a liver test of microsomal function, was determined at the starting and thrice in course of therapy after a mean period of 11 +/- 1.6 mo, meanwhile the resistive index of splenic artery at ultra sound Doppler, an indirect index of portal hypertension, was only measured at the beginning and the end of study.
RESULTS: Eight out of the 24 A5- (33.3%) and 5 out of the 11 A6- (45.45%) treated-cirrhotic patients showed a significant improvement in the total overnight salivary caffeine assessment. A reduction up to 20% of the resistive index of splenic artery was obtained in 3 out of the 8 A5- (37.5%) and in 2 out of the 5 A6- (40%) cirrhotic patients with an improved liver function, which showed a clear tendency to decrease at the end of therapy. The hepatitis C virus clearance was achieved in 3 out of the 24 (12.5%) A5- and 1 out of the 11 (0.091%) A6-patients after a median period of 8.5 mo combined therapy. In the cohort of non-treated cirrhotic patients, not only the considered parameters remained unchanged, but 3 patients (8.3%) had a worsening of the Child-Pugh score (P = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: A prolonged antiviral therapy with moderate dosages of interferon-alpha and ribavirin shows a trend to stable liver function or to ameliorate the residual liver function, the entity of portal hypertension and the compensation status at acceptable costs."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a prospective study 96 non-selected and consecutive AMI survivors underwent cinecoronary arteriography in the 4th week of hospitalization and were followed up for a period of 3 to 39 (21.7 +/- 11.0) months. One-half of the patients were randomly submitted to an attenuated heart rate-limited treadmill stress testing in the 3rd week. Seven patients were lost in the follow-up. Of the remaining 89 patients 5 died of cardiac causes. Cardiac events (death, reinfarction, angina and heart failure) occurred in 26 patients. Multivessel coronary artery disease was found in 67 patients (75%) and mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 49.1 +/- 15.6%. Positive treadmill stress testing for myocardial ischemia occurred in 20 of 43 patients (46%).
RESULTS: All patients who died of cardiac causes or who had a cardiac event had multivessel coronary artery disease, the mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 38.6 +/- 16.6% and 45.2 +/- 16.4%, respectively, and two-thirds of patients had positive stress testing. For cardiac death, multivessel coronary artery disease had better sensitivity than positive stress testing and left ventricular ejection fraction less than 0.3 (100% vs 67% vs 20%, respectively) while ejection fraction had better specificity than stress testing and multivessel coronary artery disease (87% vs 55% vs 21%, respectively). Stress testing had a better positive predictive value than multivessel coronary artery disease and ejection fraction (53% vs 38% vs 36%, respectively while multivessel coronary artery disease had better negative predictive value than stress testing and ejection fraction (100% vs 77% vs and 70%, respectively). The association of data obtained from cinecoronarography study between themselves and with positive treadmill stress testing did not significantly improve the sensitivities, specificities and predictive values in relation to the results obtained by isolated data.
CONCLUSION: In survivors of acute myocardial infarction cinecoronary arteriography is not more accurate than, treadmill stress testing and both have limited value in the identification of patients who are candidates for cardiac death or events in the first few years after AMI. A negative stress testing and coronary arteriography (one-vessel disease) is more informative than a positive one."

METHODS: 53 patients undergoing PBMV were submitted to an echocardiographic analysis of mitral valve in order to note mobility, thickness, calcification of leaflets and subvalvar apparatus (SV). Mitral valve area (VA) before and after PBMV was obtained using continuous wave Doppler. Patients were divided in group 1 (VA enhance inferior to 50%) and 2 (VA enhance equal or superior to 50%) and subgroups A (VA post PBMV inferior to 1.5 sqcm) and B (VA post PBMV equal or superior to 1.5 sqcm). Correlations between the score of each component of mitral valve and the results were established.
RESULTS: Concerning to the total score, there was no significant difference between the groups and subgroups. Differences were significant when SV was analysed separately (p less than or equal to 0.001). VA average in patients with SV compromising grade 3 (1.28 +/- 0.26 sqcm) was inferior to those with grade 1 or 2 (p less than or equal to 0.001).

DESIGN: Randomised double blind crossover study.
SETTING: Two cancer centres in teaching hospitals, one in the United Kingdom and the other in Germany.
SUBJECTS: 100 patients (53 men and 47 women) new to cisplatin chemotherapy, 84 of whom completed two consecutive courses of chemotherapy.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients were given intravenous dexamethasone (20 mg) or physiological saline with intravenous ondansetron 8 mg before cisplatin, then ondansetron 1 mg/h for 24 hours. Oral ondansetron 8 mg was taken three times daily on days 2-6.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of complete or major control of emesis (0-2 episodes in the 24 hours after chemotherapy).
RESULTS: Complete or major control was obtained in 49 out of 71 (69%) of patients after receiving ondansetron plus dexamethasone compared with 40 out of 71 (56%) when they were given ondansetron alone (p = 0.012). This effect was most pronounced in the first 12 hours after chemotherapy. Patients receiving the combination also had significantly less nausea. Of the 53 patients who expressed a preference, 38 (72%) preferred the combination treatment (p = 0.002) to ondansetron alone. The effect of ondansetron on delayed emesis was less pronounced.

DESIGN: Two year randomised controlled prospective 'crossover' study in which patients were assigned to one of two parallel treatment groups receiving continuous treatment or treatment on demand.
SETTING: 29 general practices in the catchment area of the University of Nijmegen.
PATIENTS: 223 patients aged greater than or equal to 30 with moderate airway obstruction due to asthma or chronic bronchitis, selected by their general practitioners.
INTERVENTIONS: 1600 micrograms salbutamol or 160 micrograms ipratropium bromide daily (113 patients) or salbutamol or ipratropium bromide only during exacerbations or periods of dyspnoea (110). No other pulmonary treatment was permitted.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Decline in ventilatory function and change in bronchial responsiveness, respiratory symptoms, number of exacerbations, and quality of life.
RESULTS: Among 144 patients completing the study, after correction for possible confounding factors the decline in forced expiratory volume in one second was -0.072 l/year in continuously treated patients and -0.020 l/year in those treated on demand (p less than 0.05), irrespective of the drug. The difference in the decline in patients with asthma was comparable with that in patients with chronic bronchitis (asthma: 0.092 v -0.025 l/year; chronic bronchitis: -0.082 v -0.031 l/year). Bronchial responsiveness increased slightly (0.4 doubling dose) with continuous treatment in chronic bronchitis, but exacerbations, symptoms, and quality of life were unchanged. Salbutamol and ipratropium bromide had comparable effects on all variables investigated.
CONCLUSIONS: Continuous bronchodilator treatment without anti-inflammatory treatment accelerates decline in ventilatory function. Bronchodilators should be used only on demand, with additional corticosteroid treatment, if necessary."
1840462,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1840462/,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTCA), as a revascularization procedure in patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease in the 8th and 9th decades of life.
METHODS: Four hundred and fifty-two elderly patients (mean age 74.7 years) underwent balloon dilation, between April 1982 and June 1990, at the Institute ""Dante Pazzanese"" of Cardiology. There were 70.4% male, 34.9% with high blood pressure, 18.8% smoked and 10.8% with diabetes. Ninety-four patients (20.7%) had previous myocardial infarction and systemic disorders were diagnosed in 14% (renal failure 5.1%, respiratory insufficiency 3.1%, rheumatic and bone disorders 1.1%, malignancy 4.2%, haematologic disorders 0.4%). One hundred and seventy-three (38.3%) had multivessel coronary artery disease whereas 84 (18.5%) had moderate to severe dysfunction of the left ventricle. PTCA was done according to the method described by Grüntzig, with the use of a ""over the wire"" (LPS, USCI, Mini Profile USCI, ACX ACS) balloon or a ""on the wire"" (Probe USCI, Axcel ACS) System.
RESULTS: Primary success was achieved in 406 (89.5%) patients where PTCA was done to dilate one vessel in 412, two vessels in 38 and three vessels in 2, accomplishing 494 dilated vessels. Major complications occurred in 14 (3.1%) patients, due to occlusion of the treated coronary artery. Emergency by-pass surgery was necessary in 5 (1.1%) patients, while 8 patients involved to acute myocardial infarction (1.8%), and 5 (1.1%) died. At the end of the late follow-up (mean 24.5 months) of 349 elderly patients (86% of the 406 successful dilated) 246 (70.5%) were asymptomatic, chest pain had recurred in 101 (28.9%) and 2 (0.6%) had myocardial infarction. Twenty-eight patients died during the follow-up, 14 of them (4.0%) due to cardiac causes. Late restenosis developed in 66 patients and 22 had progression of coronary atherosclerosis. Forty patients underwent a late PTCA, and 33 others underwent a late bypass surgery.
CONCLUSION: PTCA in patients in the 8th and 9th decade of life was a safe and efficient procedure (primary success rate about 90% and major complications of 3.1%). The late evolution showed satisfactory clinical results (70.5% of asymptomatic) low myocardial infarction rate (0.3% per year) and low incidence of cardiac death (2% per year). About 2/3 of the patients were free of any cardiac event (angina, myocardial infarction, by-pass surgery or death) at the end of the follow-up."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: this study comprised an analysis of the follow-up of men with a PCA3 score of ≥ 20 and a repeat Bx-, after which a follow-up Bx was taken. The initial study data in 463 men were also analysed to compare characteristics of: (i) men with a PCA3 score of ≥ 20 and ≥ 35 and a repeat Bx+, vs those with a Bx-; and (ii) men with a repeat Bx- and a PCA3 score of ≥ 20 vs <20 and a PCA3 score of ≥ 35 vs <35.
RESULTS: a follow-up Bx was taken in 51 selected men; the Bx+ rate was 55%. Men with a follow-up Bx+ had a higher PCA3 score (mean 69.5, median 50.4) than those with a Bx- (mean 37.7, median 28.2; P < 0.001). They also more often had high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) at the previous Bx (46% vs 17%; P= 0.029). Men with a PCA3 score of ≥ 35 and a repeat Bx+ had a higher PCA3 score (mean 113.9, median 75.7) than those with a Bx- (mean 87.3, median 56.9; P= 0.047). Men with a repeat Bx- and an elevated/high PCA3 score more often had HGPIN than men with a low PCA3 score.
CONCLUSIONS: an elevated/high PCA3 score can predict prostate cancer in men with one or two previous Bx-. If the repeat Bx is negative, an elevated/high PCA3 score combined with HGPIN might predict prostate cancer at the follow-up Bx."
20346109,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20346109/,"BACKGROUND: Past studies have linked certain values (traditional vs. individualistic) with adolescent substance-use. The aims of this study are to replicate cross-sectional research linking values and adolescent substance-use and to determine if such values predict future substance-use.
METHODS: A longitudinal school-based survey of 2196 young people (age 15) followed up in early adulthood (age 18/19). Participants provided data about their beliefs and values at age 15, and their substance-use (smoking, alcohol and drug-use) at ages 15 and 18/19. In addition data were collected about their social background (gender, risk-taking, deprivation, religion, etc).
RESULTS: Cross-sectionally, young people with anti-authority values were more likely to use various substances, e.g. 17-67% more likely to regularly smoke (daily), drink (most days), or use drugs (weekly) for each SD above typical levels. Adjusting for social background, associations were not substantially attenuated. However in the prospective analysis, adjusting for both background and substance-use at age 15, only two (anti-authoritarian and work ethic) values were (marginally) associated with substance-use at age 18/19.
CONCLUSIONS: While we replicated results found in prior cross-sectional studies, evidence from this study does not support the argument that holding certain 'pro-social' or 'good' values substantively protects against later substance-use and challenges the likely effectiveness of values-based interventions in relation to later substance-use."

METHODS: Two RA patients were selected by a rheumatologist who performed independently a grey-scale and power Doppler (PD) volumetric acquisition at three anatomic sites in their more symptomatic wrist/hand using two identical scanners equipped with 3D volumetric probe. Twelve rheumatologists expert in MSUS were randomly assigned to a US scanner and a patient. In the first part of the study, each group of experts blindly, independently, and consecutively performed a 2D real-time grey-scale and PD US investigation of inflammatory changes and/or bone erosions at the three anatomic sites. In the second part of the study, each group of investigators blindly evaluated the same pathologic changes in the 6 volumes from the patient not scanned by them.
RESULTS: The kappa values were higher for 3D volumetric US than for 2D US in the detection of synovitis/tenosyno-vitis (0.41 vs. 0.37) and PD signal (0.82 vs 0.45) and in the PD signal grading (0.81 vs. 0.55).
CONCLUSION: 3D volumetric US may improve the interobserver reliability in RA multicentre studies."
20347201,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20347201/,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this retrospective study was to review the outcomes and recurrence rates of subjects with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma treated at a single institution by primary surgical resection, with or without adjuvant radiation or chemotherapy, to identify factors that affect locoregional control and determine whether surgical salvage affects survival.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The records of 157 subjects diagnosed with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma treated at a single institution from 1997 to 2007 were identified. Data on demographics, site, clinical stage, pathologic stage, treatment, recurrence, and survival were collected. Defined outcome measures were overall survival, disease-free survival, and length of survival after recurrence. Analysis of the data was performed by use of the Cox proportional hazards model. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were created for disease-free survival, as well as survival by histologic grade, nodal status, recurrence, and tumor stage.
RESULTS: We identified 157 subjects, with 155 meeting the inclusion criteria. The overall 5-year survival rate was 48%, with a disease-free survival rate of 42% (95% confidence interval, 36%-53%). Survival was found to be influenced by stage (P = .0001), nodal status (P = .0025), and histologic grade (P = .04). There were 24 subjects with recurrence (15%). Of these, 11 had local recurrence (46%), 9 had regional recurrence (37%), 2 had distant recurrence (8%), 1 had both local and regional recurrence (4%), and 1 had both local and distant metastasis (4%). Recurrence was not found to be significantly affected by pathologic stage (P = .71), clinical stage (P = .6), histologic grade (P = .178), postoperative radiation therapy (P = .54), postoperative chemotherapy (P = .66), N-positive status (P = .71), or whether the subject underwent a neck dissection (P = .984). Surgery significantly increased both overall survival time (P = .009) and survival time after recurrence (P = .006). Radiation therapy (P = .4) and chemotherapy (P = .82) did not have a survival benefit as therapy for recurrence.
CONCLUSIONS: Survival is influenced by stage at presentation, nodal status, and histologic grade. No variables were found to influence recurrence rates. Surgery significantly increased overall survival time, and salvage surgery increased survival after recurrence."
20347262,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20347262/,"OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: To determine whether knowledge of medical diagnosis biases listeners with varied experience levels in their judgments of dysphonia.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, mixed experimental and comparative design.
METHODS: Twenty-six speakers with dysphonia and four normal controls provided speech recordings. Twenty novice and eight experienced clinicians evaluated speech samples for roughness and breathiness using 100-mm visual analog scales. In one condition, the speech samples were presented without diagnostic information; in the second condition, samples were presented in conjunction with the medical diagnosis.
RESULTS: Regardless of experience level, listeners judged the samples as significantly more severe when the speakers' diagnoses were known. Specifically, novice listeners (NLs) significantly increased the severity of judgments for speakers who were mildly breathy or mildly or moderately rough when diagnostic information was known. In addition, listeners in both groups judged speakers with mass lesions to be significantly rougher when diagnosis was known; this bias was not observed for speakers with other diagnoses. NLs also trended toward increasing the severity of breathiness judgments for individuals with known vocal fold paralysis but not other diagnoses.
CONCLUSIONS: Sources of bias such as knowledge of medical diagnoses should be considered when listeners with varied experience levels use auditory-perceptual measures to evaluate dysphonia."
20347288,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20347288/,"BACKGROUND: All public services in the UK are expected to produce evidence-based policies. This principle was argued particularly strongly in relation to policies for tackling drug misuse. However, concerns have been expressed that commitment to this principle is not matched by the reality of policy making. In this paper, we examine the extent to which the UK drug strategy can be regarded as evidence-based.
METHODS: Focusing on case studies of policies implemented as part of the four main strands of the strategy, evidence reported by the government as forming the basis of the policy is examined as are findings of the published sources of evidence cited.
RESULTS: In most cases, the evidence was of a good quality in that it reflected the general standard of research in the area. The main problem lies in the interpretation and reporting of research results. Two of four case studies were reported as biased in terms of research study selection and in two there was some evidence that the reporting was not wholly representative of the conclusions drawn.
CONCLUSION: There are many factors that influence the generation of policy and it is unrealistic, and perhaps disingenuous, to suggest in relation to drugs policy, that evidence is its primary focus."
20347311,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20347311/,"OBJECTIVE: The study aim was to evaluate the psychological impact on parents of the provision of a paediatric intensive care follow-up clinic.
DESIGN: Exploratory randomised controlled trial. Families were allocated to intervention (follow-up clinic appointment two months after discharge) or control (no appointment) condition.
SETTING: An eight-bed Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) in an inner city teaching hospital.
MEASUREMENTS: Parents' baseline stress was assessed using the Parental Stressor Scale: PICU. Post-traumatic stress, anxiety and depression were assessed at five months using the Impact of Event Scale and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.
RESULTS: Only 18/72 families (25%) in the intervention group chose to attend the clinic. Outcome data were provided by 55/82 parents in the intervention group and 50/72 in the control group. Although no significant differences were found between the groups as a whole, parents with higher baseline stress reported lower rates of post-traumatic stress (n=8/32(25%) vs. n=13/23(57%), p=0.018) and depression (n=6/32(19%) vs. n=12/23(52%), p=0.009) at five months if they had been offered an appointment than if they had not.
CONCLUSIONS: Whilst these results do not justify routine follow-up for all, they suggest that, for the most traumatised parents, rates of long-term distress could be reduced by this intervention."
20347619,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20347619/,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Partially covered metal stents have been extensively used for palliation of obstructive jaundice in malignant distal biliary strictures and can be removed in cases of malfunction or need for tissue diagnosis. We investigated independent predictors of mortality in patients undergoing partially covered metal stents revision (i.e., removal and replacement).
METHODS: Patients with a distal malignant biliary obstruction palliated with a partially covered metal stent were followed-up prospectively over 5 years until malfunction or death. All patients who required removal of their partially covered metal stents were captured in a specific database. Multivariate analysis was performed on non-surgical patients to assess for independent predictors of death using known risk factors including type of malignancy (adenocarcinoma versus all others), age greater than 55, gender, and exposure to adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.
RESULTS: Forty-two patients (28 men, mean age of 62±12 years) underwent partially covered metal stents removal. Of these, biliary drainage was achieved in 38 patients by placement of a new partially covered metal stent (n=32) or plastic stent (n=6). The remaining 4 patients did not undergo stent replacement because of refusal (2), resolution of obstruction (1) and unrelated death (1). Long-term follow-up post removal in patients who were not surgical candidates (n=31) was 35 weeks (95% CI 28-40), with a survival rate of 29% at 10 months. Logistic regression analysis in the 31 patients with unresectable disease showed that a histologic diagnosis of adenocarcinoma was associated with increased mortality post partially covered metal stents revision.
CONCLUSIONS: Partially covered metal stents revision should be undertaken especially when dealing with a non-adenocarcinoma type cancer."
20347733,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20347733/,"BACKGROUND: Endoscopic resection and ablation have advanced the treatment of intramucosal esophageal adenocarcinoma and have been promoted as definitive therapy for selected superficial submucosal tumors. Controversy exists regarding the prevalence of nodal metastases at various depths of mucosal and submucosal invasion. Our aim was to clarify this prevalence and identify predictors of nodal spread.
STUDY DESIGN: An expert gastrointestinal pathologist retrospectively reviewed 54 T1 adenocarcinomas from 258 esophagectomy specimens (2000 to 2008). Tumors were classified as intramucosal or submucosal, the latter being subclassified as SM1 (upper third), SM2 (middle third), or SM3 (lower third) based on the depth of tumor invasion. The depth of invasion was correlated with the prevalence of positive nodes. Fisher's exact test and univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to identify variables predicting nodal disease.
RESULTS: Nodal metastases were present in 0% (0 of 25) of intramucosal, 21% (3 of 14) of SM1, 36% (4 of 11) of SM2, and 50% (2 of 4) of SM3 tumors. The differences were significant between intramucosal and submucosal tumors (p < 0.0001), although not between the various subclassifications of submucosal tumors (p = 0.503). Univariate logistic regression identified poor differentiation (p = 0.024), lymphovascular invasion (p = 0.049), and number of harvested lymph nodes (p = 0.037) as significantly correlated with nodal disease. Multivariate logistic regression did not identify any of the tested variables as independent predictors of the prevalence of positive lymph nodes.
CONCLUSIONS: All depths of submucosal invasion of esophageal adenocarcinoma were associated with an unacceptably high prevalence of nodal metastases and a marked increase relative to intramucosal cancer. Accurate predictors of nodal spread, independent of tumor depth, are currently lacking and will be necessary before recommending endoscopic resection with or without concomitant ablation as curative treatment for even superficial submucosal neoplasia."
20347747,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20347747/,"BACKGROUND: Student recruiting is a top priority for surgical educators. Efforts have focused on improving the junior clerkship, but earlier interventions might prove to be more effective. This study was performed to determine students' perceptions of surgeons across all 4 years, with special emphasis on the effect of the 3(rd)-year clerkship.
STUDY DESIGN: During 2004 to 2007, medical students at all levels were surveyed with 21 statements about surgeons' behavior, lifestyle issues, and potential as role models. Subjects responded anonymously using a 5-point Likert scale (1 = strongly agree). Surveys were administered annually to medical student year 1 (MS1), MS2, and MS4, and before and after the clerkship to MS3. Data were analyzed using chi-square contingency table analyses.
RESULTS: Three-thousand and sixty surveys were analyzed (MS1, n = 833; MS2, n = 670; MS3, n = 1,193; and MS4, n = 364). Responses among MS1 and MS2 confirm that students enter medical school with negative impressions of surgeons. The surgical clerkship had a positive impact, but this effect was lost by senior year. Changes in perceptions were statistically significant for 20 of 21 statements. This is underscored by the fact that the proportion of students applying to general surgery from our medical school remains essentially unchanged (2004, 5.3%; 2005, 7.4%; 2006, 10%; 2007, 7.4%; and 2008, 6%).
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the junior surgery clerkship has a favorable but transient impact on the negative perceptions that medical students have about surgeons. Perceptions return to negative values within 1 year of the clerkship. Recruiting efforts should be focused on earlier interaction with students rather than concentrating on a 2- to 3-month rotation in the junior year."

20348144,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20348144/,"AIMS: The evoked QT interval can be detected beat by beat through an implanted pacing system. The correlation between the right ventricular paced QT interval and the left ventricular systolic interval is not known. The aim of our study was to collect data on the correlation between QT and systolic and diastolic indexes at different heart rates in patients with dual-chamber rate-responsive pacemakers.
METHOD AND RESULTS: The study involved 13 patients [67 +/- 9 years; ejection fraction (EF) 52 +/- 10%] with standard indication for dual-chamber pacing. Patients were evaluated at rest in the supine position. The AV delay was set at 130 ms, and the pacing rate was increased from 90 to 130 bpm (10 bpm steps for 3 min). At the end of each 3 min step, QT intervals were automatically evaluated in real time by means of pacemaker telemetry. We also evaluated heart performance by means of echo-2D (end-diastolic/end-systolic volumes, EF) and echo-Doppler measurements [left ventricular ejection time (LVET) and diastolic filling time (LVDFT), aortic velocity time integral, and systolic volume] and systemic arterial pressure. The QT interval progressively decreased from 330 +/- 20 to 280 +/- 10 ms as the pacing rate was increased from 90 to 130 bpm. The correlation between the QT interval and LVET as a function of the pacing rate was R(2) = 0.966, indicating a good and relatively parallel trend in these two parameters. The correlation between RR-QT (reflecting electrical diastole) and LVDFT (reflecting mechanical diastole) was R(2) = 0.975. The index LVET/QT (ratio between mechanical and electrical systole) was constant in the range 90-120 bpm, but significantly decreased at 130 bpm: the mechanical LVET shortens more than the electrical QT does at the highest heart rates.
CONCLUSION: In paced patients at rest and during artificially increased heart rates, QT interval dynamics is closely correlated with changes in ejection time, thus constituting an electrical parameter of systolic time. A similar correlation exists between RR-QT, as a diastolic electrical interval, and the DFT."
20348193,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20348193/,"OBJECTIVES: Several studies have identified airflow obstruction as a risk factor for lung cancer independent of smoking history, but the risk associated with the presence of radiographic evidence of emphysema has not been extensively studied. We proposed to assess this risk using a quantitative volumetric CT scan analysis.
METHODS: Sixty-four cases of lung cancer were identified from a prospective cohort of 1,520 participants enrolled in a spiral CT scan lung cancer screening trial. Each case was matched to six control subjects for age, sex, and smoking history. Quantitative CT scan analysis of emphysema was performed. Spirometric measures were also conducted. Data were analyzed using conditional logistic regression making use of the 1:6 set groups of 64 cases and 377 matched control subjects.
RESULTS: Decreased FEV(1) and FEV(1)/FVC were significantly associated with a diagnosis of lung cancer with ORs of 1.15 (95% CI, 1.00-1.32; P = .046) and 1.29 (95% CI, 1.02-1.62; P = .031), respectively. The quantity of radiographic evidence of emphysema was not found to be a significant risk for lung cancer with OR of 1.042 (95% CI, 0.816-1.329; P = .743). Additionally, there was no significant association between severe emphysema and lung cancer with OR of 1.57 (95% CI, 0.73-3.37).
CONCLUSIONS: We confirm previous observations that airflow obstruction is an independent risk factor for lung cancer. The absence of a clear relationship between radiographic evidence of emphysema and lung cancer using an automated quantitative volumetric analysis may result from different population characteristics than those of prior studies, radiographic evidence of emphysema quantitation methodology, or absence of any relationship between emphysema and lung cancer risk."
20348198,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20348198/,"BACKGROUND: To our knowledge, the new local coverage determination (LCD) adherence criteria for continued reimbursement of continuous positive airway pressure after 90 days has heretofore not been validated, including the effects of the policy on care for patients with obstructive sleep apnea.
METHODS: We examined a retrospective database of 150 patients who received neuropsychologic testing prior to treatment and 3 and 6 months post treatment. We categorized participants using the new LCD criteria. Comparisons of neuropsychologic variables were made between adherent and nonadherent groups.
RESULTS: Fifty-five participants (37%) failed to meet the new criteria, although this number may not reflect the actual rates of adherence in clinical settings because some efforts beyond standard care were made to ensure adherence to treatment among many of the participants. Of the 50 patients who did not receive any special adherence intervention, only 28 (56%) met the criteria. On most measures, patients with poor adherence demonstrated neuropsychologic improvements similar to their adherent counterparts. Nonadherent patients realized additional improvements in working memory between 3 and 6 months post treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the potential effects of the new criteria for adherence on patients with obstructive sleep apnea and their clinical care. These data were taken from a study that was not designed to examine these criteria, so controlled trials are needed to better understand the effect of the guidelines on adherence and treatment outcomes.

20348273,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20348273/,"CONTEXT: Peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) is a rare site of distant metastases in patients with adrenocortical cancer (ACC). One preliminary study suggests an increased risk of PC after laparoscopic adrenalectomy (LA) for ACC.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to search for risk factors of PC including surgical approach.
DESIGN: This was a retrospective cohort study conducted in an institutional practice.
PATIENTS: Sixty-four consecutive patients with ACC seen at our institution between 2003 and 2009 were included. Mean tumor size was 132 mm. Patients had stage I disease in 2 cases, stage II disease in 32 cases, stage III disease in 7 cases, stage IV disease in 21 cases, and unknown stage disease in 2 cases. Surgery was open in 58 cases and laparoscopic in 6 cases.
MAIN OUTCOME: The main outcome was the risk factors of PC.
RESULTS: PC occurred in 18 (28%) patients. It was present at initial diagnosis in three cases and occurred during follow-up in 15 cases. The only risk factor of PC occurring during follow-up was the surgical approach with a 4-year rate of PC of 67% (95% confidence interval (CI), 30-90%) for LA and 27% (95% CI, 15-44%) for open adrenalectomy (P=0.016). Neither tumor size, stage, functional status, completeness of surgery, nor plasma level of op'DDD was associated with the occurrence of PC.
CONCLUSION: We found an increased risk of PC after LA for ACC. Whether this is related to an inappropriate surgical approach or to insufficient experience in ACC surgery should be clarified by a prospective program."
20349092,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20349092/,"PURPOSE: It was examined whether nurses and physicians are able to identify whether adolescents with cancer have used certain strategies to cope with disease- and treatment-related distress.
METHOD: Adolescents (N = 48) were asked whether they had used a number of strategies to cope with disease- and treatment-related distress and, if so, the extent to which they had used these. Nurses and physicians were asked to answer the same questions on behalf of a certain adolescent.
RESULTS: Nurses overestimate the extent to which adolescents use strategies to cope with distress, and neither nurses nor physicians, physicians somewhat more, are successful in identifying the extent to which certain adolescents use strategies.
CONCLUSION: Health-care staff's possibilities to assess how patients cope with disease- and treatment-related distress should be increased. A number of changes in education and the organization of clinical care, especially with regard to assessing patients' needs, are suggested."

METHODS: Fifty-eight women underwent treatment with antimuscarinics in 12 weeks. Before treatment and at 1, 2, 6 and 12 weeks of treatment, women completed the patient perception of bladder condition (PPBC) single-item global questionnaire, indicated the severity of their urgency on a visual analogue scale (VAS) and underwent transvaginal ultrasound to determine mean bladder wall thickness (BWT).
RESULTS: PPBC and VAS scores for urgency declined throughout the treatment course whereas mean BWT declined during the first 6 weeks of treatment and then reached a plateau after falling to below 5 mm.
CONCLUSION: The mechanism of action of antimuscarinics appears to be a complex interaction of sensory and motor components."

We chose to investigate whether the use of omeprazole could reduce the incidence of hypercalcemia in dialysis patients who could not afford expensive non-calciumbased phosphate binders.
METHODS: 26 hemodialysis patients at the Hypertension, Nephrology, Dialysis, and Transplantation Clinic in Opelika, Alabama (USA) with refractory hypercalcemia for at least 3 months prior to the study who were unable to afford non-calcium-based binders were treated with 20 mg of omeprazole a day for three months and then compared to 27 similar patients who were taking non-calcium-based binders.
RESULTS: While there was a trend towards lower serum calcium levels and phosphate binder dosages in the omeprazole group (particularly with the calcium carbonate binders as opposed to the calcium acetate binders), there was no statistical difference in any variable in either controls or the omeprazole group from pre-study period.
CONCLUSIONS: While theoretically advantageous, we found that omeprazole had little clinical benefit in reducing hypercalcemia in a population who are unable to afford non-calcium-based binders; however, further studies may be warranted."
20349619,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20349619/,"INTRODUCTION: Medical professionals are particularly exposed to stress. It is therefore important for them to learn how to cope with work stress and prevent burnout. This study was undertaken in a group of nurses from the province of Kuyavia and Pomerania to determine the extent to which strategies and attitudes required for work effectiveness change with length of service.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Four groups were formed according to seniority: up to 15 years, 16-20 years, 21-25 years, and more than 25 years at work. The survey instrument was the AVEM questionnaire consisting of scales which cover the following personality domains: commitment to service, resistance to stress, problem-solving strategies, emotional well-being at work. The results were analyzed basing on percentile norms for hospital staff.
RESULTS: It was found that career ambitions and offensive problem-solving strategies correlate with length of service. Nurses with the shortest length of service were least active in coping with problems. Competence increased with seniority. The distribution of results regarding career ambitions was greatest in group 3 (15-25 years at work). It seems plausible that on the one hand this finding can be attributed to seniority, on the other to different social roles undertaken concurrently.
CONCLUSIONS: Qualitative assessment of the present results demonstrated that commitment to service is important for nurses regardless of work experience. This study did not take into account the total personality structure as a modifying variable which determines the direction of personal development, including professional development, and integrates human activities."
20350151,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20350151/,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the surgical site infection (SSI) rate after primary total hip arthroplasty with the SSI rate after revision total hip arthroplasty.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, a referral orthopedic center.
PATIENTS: All patients undergoing primary total hip arthroplasty or revision total hip arthroplasty during the period from January 1, 2002, through December 31, 2006.
METHODS: We obtained data on total hip arthroplasties from a prospectively maintained institutional surgical database. We reviewed data on SSIs collected prospectively as part of routine infection control surveillance, using the criteria of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the definition of an SSI. We used logistic regression analyses to evaluate differences between the SSI rate after primary total hip arthroplasty and the SSI rate after revision total hip arthroplasty.
RESULTS: A total of 5,696 total hip arthroplasties (with type 1 wound classification) were analyzed, of which 1,381 (24%) were revisions. A total of 61 SSIs occurred, resulting in an overall SSI rate of 1.1% for all total hip arthroplasties. When stratified by the National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance (NNIS) risk index, SSI rates were 0.5%, 1.2%, and 1.6% in risk categories 0, 1, and 2, respectively. After controlling for the NNIS risk index, the risk of SSI after revision total hip arthroplasty was twice as high as that after primary total hip arthroplasty (odds ratio, 2.2 [95% confidence interval, 1.3-3.7]). In the analysis restricted to the development of deep incisional or organ space infections, the risk of SSI after revision total hip arthroplasty was nearly 4 times that after primary total hip arthroplasty (odds ratio, 3.9 [95% confidence interval, 2.0-7.6]).
CONCLUSION: Including revision surgeries in the calculation of SSI rates can result in higher infection rates for institutions that perform a larger number of revisions. Taking NNIS risk indices into account does not eliminate this effect. Differences between primary and revision surgeries should be considered in national standards for the reporting of SSIs."

METHODS: A total of 165 consecutive subjects with ACS and 159 medically healthy, matched control subjects were examined and followed for 3 years. Periodontitis was defined by alveolar bone loss. Subgingival microbial samples were studied by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method.
RESULTS: The recurrence of ACS was found in 66 of 165 (40.0%) subjects, and a first ACS event was found in seven of 159 (4.4%) subjects among baseline control subjects. Subjects who later had a second ACS event were older (P <0.001). Significantly higher serum levels of high-density lipoprotein (P <0.05), creatinine (P <0.01), and white blood cell (WBC) counts (P <0.001) were found in subjects with future ACS. Periodontitis was associated with a first event of ACS (crude odds ratio [OR]: 10.3:1; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.1 to 17.4; P <0.001) and the recurrence of ACS (crude OR: 3.6:1; 95% CI: 2.0 to 6.6; P <0.001). General linear modeling multivariate analysis, controlling for age and the prediction of a future ACS event, identified that WBC counts (F = 20.6; P <0.001), periodontitis (F = 17.6; P <0.001), and serum creatinine counts (F = 4.5; P <0.05) were explanatory of a future ACS event.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that recurrent ACS events are predicted by serum WBC counts, serum creatinine levels, and a diagnosis of periodontitis. Significantly higher counts of putative pathogens are found in subjects with ACS, but these counts do not predict future ACS events."
20350326,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20350326/,"BACKGROUND: It is important that healthcare provided in crisis settings is based on the best available research evidence. We reviewed guidelines for child and perinatal health care in crisis situations to determine whether they were based on research evidence, whether Cochrane systematic reviews were available in the clinical areas addressed by these guidelines and whether summaries of these reviews were provided in Evidence Aid.
METHODS: Broad internet searches were undertaken to identify relevant guidelines. Guidelines were appraised using AGREE and the clinical areas that were relevant to perinatal or child health were extracted. We searched The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews to identify potentially relevant reviews. For each review we determined how many trials were included, and how many were conducted in resource-limited settings.
RESULTS: Six guidelines met selection criteria. None of the included guidelines were clearly based on research evidence. 198 Cochrane reviews were potentially relevant to the guidelines. These reviews predominantly addressed nutrient supplementation, breastfeeding, malaria, maternal hypertension, premature labour and prevention of HIV transmission. Most reviews included studies from developing settings. However for large portions of the guidelines, particularly health services delivery, there were no relevant reviews. Only 18 (9.1%) reviews have summaries in Evidence Aid.
CONCLUSIONS: We did not identify any evidence-based guidelines for perinatal and child health care in disaster settings. We found many Cochrane reviews that could contribute to the evidence-base supporting future guidelines. However there are important issues to be addressed in terms of the relevance of the available reviews and increasing the number of reviews addressing health care delivery."
20350798,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20350798/,"PURPOSE: (18)F-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) has benefits in target volume (TV) definition in radiotherapy treatment planning (RTP) for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, an optimal protocol for TV delineation has not been determined. We investigate volumetric and positional variation in gross tumor volume (GTV) delineation using a planning PET/CT among three radiation oncologists and a PET radiologist.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: RTP PET/CT scans were performed on 28 NSCLC patients (Stage IA-IIIB) of which 14 patients received prior induction chemotherapy. Three radiation oncologists and one PET radiologist working with a fourth radiation oncologist independently delineated the GTV on CT alone (GTV(CT)) and on fused PET/CT images (GTV(PETCT)). The mean percentage volume change (PVC) between GTV(CT) and GTV(PETCT) for the radiation oncologists and the PVC between GTV(CT) and GTV(PETCT) for the PET radiologist were compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Concordance index (CI) was used to assess both positional and volume change between GTV(CT) and GTV(PETCT) in a single measurement.
RESULTS: For all patients, a significant difference in PVC from GTV(CT) to GTV(PETCT) exists between the radiation oncologist (median, 5.9%), and the PET radiologist (median, -0.4%, p = 0.001). However, no significant difference in median concordance index (comparing GTV(CT) and GTV(FUSED) for individual cases) was observed (PET radiologist = 0.73; radiation oncologists = 0.66; p = 0.088).
CONCLUSIONS: Percentage volume changes from GTV(CT) to GTV(PETCT) were lower for the PET radiologist than for the radiation oncologists, suggesting a lower impact of PET/CT in TV delineation for the PET radiologist than for the oncologists.

METHODS: The subjects were 14 healthy males who had no known eye diseases or abnormality in their pupils. They received five different interventions: no acupuncture stimulation (hereinafter 'no-stimulation') and acupuncture stimulation at four sites (TE5, ST7, CV12 and ST36). The Latin square design was used to allocate stimulation order. For all acupuncture stimulation interventions, a disposable acupuncture needle was inserted superficially at the acupuncture point. Gentle repetitive tapping stimulation was applied manually during the subject's exhalation phase of respiration, for 90 s. The pupil diameter was continuously measured for 2 min before stimulation, during stimulation and for 2 min after stimulation. Statistical analysis was conducted on serial changes in pupil diameter during acupuncture stimulation on each respective site and during non-stimulation session by analysis of variance and Fisher (least significant difference) multiple comparison, with linear analysis using a mixed model.
RESULTS: Pupil diameter reduction occurred at 30 s after stimulation on ST7 (p=0.008) and 60 s after stimulation (p=0.014) compared with pre-stimulation. The decrease of pupillary diameter occurred 60 s after stimulation on TE5 (p=0.028) compared with pre-stimulation. On ST36, CV12 and during the non-stimulation intervention, no significant change in the pupil diameter was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Pupillary reaction varies depending on the different stimulation sites."
20351526,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20351526/,"OBJECTIVE: To assess dose and image quality of dual-energy (DE) mixed images in comparison to single-energy (SE) images.
METHODS: A phantom containing iodine contrast inserts was scanned using SE and DE protocols. Dual-energy mixed images were reconstructed with varying composition ratios (ratio describing the contribution of 80 and 140 data in the mixed images). Image noise, iodine contrast, and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) were assessed inside and outside the central field of view (FoV).
RESULTS: With the default composition ratio (0.3), noise and contrast were comparable between both protocols in the central FoV. Peripherally, DE image noise exceeded noise in SE images; CNR in the periphery was lower in the DE images. The highest CNR was found for a composition ratio of 0.5 to 0.9, exceeding the CNR of SE images.
CONCLUSIONS: Dual-energy mixed images offer an image quality comparable to SE images within the central FoV at comparable dose levels. In the peripheral FoV, image quality is decreased. By optimizing the composition ratio in the DE mixed images, higher CNRs than in the SE images can be achieved, leading to a dose reduction potential."
20351552,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20351552/,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to build risk charts for the assessment of cardiovascular mortality of the CUORE project, an Italian longitudinal study, and to compare them with the systematic coronary risk evaluation (SCORE) project charts for low risk European countries.
DESIGN: Random population samples enrolled in the 1980s and 1990s in Italy were included in the analysis: 7,520 men and 13,127 women aged 35-69 years without previous cardiovascular events and with a mean follow-up period of 10 years for cardiovascular disease. ICD-9 codes of death certificates similar to those of the SCORE project were considered when they appear as first cause of death.
METHODS: Sex-stratified Cox proportional hazard model including age, systolic blood pressure, ratio between total and HDL cholesterol, and smoking habit as risk factors was used to assess cardiovascular mortality.
RESULTS: Analysis showed that all risk factors included in the model were statistically significant. The corresponding area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.825 (95% confidence interval: 0.803-0.846) for men and 0.850 (0.823-0.877) for women. The CUORE project charts yielded similar results to the corresponding charts of the SCORE project: Lin's coefficient was 0.929 for men and 0.935 for women.
CONCLUSION: The comparison between CUORE and SCORE mortality risk charts shows that SCORE charts reflect quite well the Italian cardiovascular mortality and, correspondingly, Italian cohorts of the CUORE project are quite representative of European countries at low risk for cardiovascular mortality."
20351599,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20351599/,"OBJECTIVES: We investigated if (18F) fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (F-FDG-PET) during radiotherapy or concurrent chemoradiotherapy adds information about the treatment outcome compared with an FDG-PET study before treatment.
METHODS: Forty-three patients with head and neck cancer were treated with helical tomotherapy. F-FDG-PET was performed at baseline and during the treatment after 47 Gy. Tracer accumulation at the tumor site was assessed visually and semiquantitatively using the maximal standardized uptake values (SUV(max)). With median SUV(max) of both the studies as cutoff, patients were categorized into low and high SUV(max) groups. For visual analysis, two independent observers classified patients as complete metabolic responders (CMR) or noncomplete metabolic responders (NCMR).
RESULTS: At baseline the median SUV(max) was 8.11 (2.41-15.13). The overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were 81 and 67% versus 50 and 40% for the low and high SUV(max), respectively. OS was significantly different (P=0.027). During therapy, median SUV(max) was 4.03 (1.94-7.58). OS and DFS were 82 and 63%, versus 47 and 42% for the low and high SUV(max) group, respectively. OS was significantly different (P=0.026). No significant differences between CMR versus NCMR in OS (72 vs. 60%), and DFS (56 vs. 49%) were found.
CONCLUSION: Categorizing patients on the basis of a semiquantitative approach resulted in significant differences in OS for both the scans before and during therapy. Future work on a larger number of patients is warranted to determine SUV(max) cutoff values which could be used for the early identification of patients with poor treatment outcome or perhaps other therapeutic approaches."
20351607,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20351607/,"OBJECTIVE: To assess whether combined electric acoustic stimulation (EAS) provides a significant hearing-in-quiet advantage over ipsilateral electrical stimulation alone, ipsilateral acoustic stimulation alone, or full-length cochlear implantation without preserved hearing.
SETTING: Tertiary care academic referral center.
PATIENTS: Two matched groups of cochlear implant (CI) patients that were implanted with either an EAS or full-length device and use similar speech processing strategies.
INTERVENTION: EAS cochlear implantation and hearing preservation (n = 10, EAS group) or conventional CI (n = 10, conventional CI group) without hearing preservation.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Status of residual hearing and speech perception data in quiet at 3 and 6 months after fitting.
RESULTS: Preoperatively, the mean aided Consonant Nucleus Consonant Word Test word score was 24.2 +/- 8.3% for the EAS group and 20.7 +/- 11.36% for the conventional CI group (p = 0.14). In the conventional CI group, hearing was not preserved after surgery in any subject, whereas 9 of the 10 subjects in the EAS group had hearing preservation. Mean CNC word scores at 6 months after activation using electrical stimulation alone were 50.3 +/- 11.53% in the EAS group and 53.8 +/- 17.32% in the conventional CI group (p = 0.81). Between-condition comparisons among the EAS subjects revealed that combined stimulation was significantly better than either the electrical or acoustic stimulation condition alone (p < 0.05). When compared with the conventional CI group, combined stimulation in EAS subjects was again superior (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Limited length CI with ipsilateral hearing preservation provides comparable speech perception performance results to conventional CI when electric stimulation alone is used. The addition of ipsilateral acoustic stimulation in ears with preserved residual hearing provides an additional benefit over electrical stimulation alone."
20351673,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20351673/,"AIM: Chronic fatigue (CF) severely affects patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), but its pathogenesis remains elusive and the effectiveness of available treatments is modest. We aimed to evaluate the effect on CF of the balloon dilatation of stenosing lesions affecting the main extracranial veins configuring the chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI), a condition strongly associated with MS.
METHODS: Thirty-one MS consecutive patients (16 males, age 46.2+/-9.4 years) with associated CCSVI and CF underwent the endovascular procedure. Fatigue was assessed using the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) at baseline (T0) and one (T1), six (T6) and twelve (T12) months after the procedure. In ambulatory patients (N.=28), mobility was evaluated using the 6-min walking test at T0 and T1.
RESULTS: and MFIS scores significantly improved from preoperative values, and the positive trend was maintained at one year (FSS: T0=5.1+/-1.0 to T12=3.5+/-1.8, P<0.001; MFIS-total score: T0=34.9+/-14.8 to T12=22.5+/-13.7, P<0.001; MFIS-Physical subscale: T0=21.2+/-8.0 to T12=13.5+/-9.7 P<0.001; MFIS-Cognitive subscale: T0=9.2+/-9.5 to T12=6.0+/-6.3, P=0.03; MFIS-Psychosocial subscale: T0=4.5+/-2.1 to T12=2.5+/-2.1, P<0.001). Six-min walking distance (6MWD) at T1 improved significantly (332+/-190m to 378+/-200m, P=0.0002). In addition, an inverted correlation between 6MWD and MFIS-physical subscale variations was found in the subgroup of patients (N.=8) with no lower limb motor impairment (r=-0.74, P=0.035).
CONCLUSION: The reestablishment of cerebral venous return dramatically reduced CF perception in a group of MS patients with associated CCSVI, suggesting that CF is likely the symptom of CCSVI."
20351739,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20351739/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of an educational intervention, created with a human-centered design approach, on children's knowledge and beliefs related to obesity and nutrition.
DESIGN: Pre-post intervention: we evaluated fifth graders (aged 9-12) from five urban schools using a survey instrument at 1 week before intervention, immediately after intervention, and 1 week later after intervention.
SUBJECTS: Of 189 fifth graders enrolled in the schools, 165 consented students (87.3%) completed baseline data. We obtained immediate post-intervention data from 94% of them and 1-week post-intervention data from 88%.
RESULTS: Of the 14 instrument questions that covered items under obesity, disease, nutrition, portion sizes, and exercise, 11 showed significant improvements in the percentage of correct answers. The children's knowledge in specific areas, including the meaning of the term 'obesity' and portion sizes, increased dramatically. Participatory design, child-inspired characters, hand-based portions, traditional games, and attention to reception by the students resulted in an engaging presentation.
CONCLUSION: Simplified health vocabulary and multiple modes of presentation resulted in accessible and understandable health education regarding obesity, nutrition, exercise, and portion size. This study yields compelling evidence that the Fitwits tools are an effective method to promote knowledge about obesity. Future studies are needed to determine whether this knowledge can affect health outcomes."
20352386,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20352386/,"BACKGROUND: The US Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) and Orthopaedic In-Training Examination (OITE) are commonly used to select medical students or residents, respectively. Knowing how well these examinations predict performance on the American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery (ABOS) Part I certifying examination is important to provide evaluations for medical students and residents. Previous studies comparing the OITE scores with the ABOS Part 1 scores have been limited to one program.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: Therefore, we compared the scores on the USMLE Step 1 and OITE examinations with those on the ABOS Part I certifying examination using data from four ACGME approved residency programs.
METHODS: We reviewed 202 resident files from 1996 to 2008 from four programs in the same geographic region. Of those, 181 (90%) had complete records. De-identified data were used to compare USMLE Step 1 scores, OITE percentile rank scores, and ABOS Part I percentile rank scores. Pearson coefficients and receiver operator curves were calculated to assess the relationships between tests.
RESULTS: We found a correlation of 0.53 between the USMLE Step 1 and ABOS Part I, and an average correlation of 0.50 for postgraduate years (PGY) 2 through 5 OITE scores and ABOS Part I. There was a stepwise increase in correlation from PGY 2 through PGY 5 between the OITE scores and ABOS scores. Those who averaged in the 27th percentile or lower on the OITE had a 57% chance of failing the ABOS Part I examination.
CONCLUSION: USMLE Step 1 scores correlated with ABOS Part I certifying examination scores, and we therefore believe it may be used as one factor in resident selection. Use of the OITE scores in guiding education and feedback appears to be justified."
20352647,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20352647/,"BACKGROUND: Examination of the extent of offenders' engagement in change, and in rehabilitation programmes, is important to understanding success or failure following rehabilitation. In treatment programmes, the alliance between therapist and offender, and the therapy process itself appear central to progress offenders make that may reduce their criminal risk. But research with offenders seldom has measured therapeutic alliance and clinical writing suggests that it is difficult to form an alliance with those not ready to change their behaviour; especially with higher risk and psychopathic offenders.
AIMS AND METHODS: This study outlines the course of the therapeutic alliance in an 8-month treatment programme for high-risk, PCL-psychopathic violent prisoners. It examines relationships between early-treatment therapeutic alliance, therapists' global ratings of motivation to change, and initial stage of change on dynamic risk factors. In addition, it investigates which factors best predict who will complete treatment and change behaviourally during treatment.
CONCLUSION: In this challenging, high-needs client group, early-programme stage of change, therapists' perceptions of motivation, therapeutic alliance and psychopathy did not predict how much change prisoners made. Regardless of initial levels, prisoners whose alliance increased the most over the course of treatment made the most change."
20353433,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20353433/,"BACKGROUND: A high prevalence of nocturnal sleep-related attacks is reported in patients with cluster headache (CH). Episodic CH is considered closely related to rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze the relationships between episodic CH attacks and sleep macrostructure.
METHODS: Data were obtained by means of 24-hour continuous ambulatory polysomnography (PSG) capturing CH attacks in 4 out of 7 episodic CH patients (all males; mean age 38.4 +/- 9.2 years) studied.
RESULTS: Eight CH attacks were captured during the PSG monitoring; 5 arose from sleep: 4 from non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep (stage 2 NREM), and 1 from REM sleep. One patient experienced CH attacks during both NREM and REM sleep in the same night.
CONCLUSIONS: In the light of previous literature findings, the prevalence of NREM-related episodic CH attacks observed, and the finding of attacks arising during both REM and NREM sleep in the same subject, suggest that the relationship between CH and sleep stages is heterogeneous, and the existence of a specific macrostructural pattern associated with episodic CH attacks appears to be uncertain. A more comprehensive approach taking into account the microstructure of NREM and REM sleep is expected to provide more in depth information about the pathophysiology of CH, whose complexity might overcome the simplistic dichotomy of REM/NREM staging."
20353497,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20353497/,"BACKGROUND: Medically confirmed hypersensitivity reactions to food are usually IgE-mediated. Non-IgE-mediated reactions are not only seldom recognized but also more difficult to diagnose.
AIM: To examine B cell-activating factor (BAFF) in serum and gut lavage fluid of patients with self-reported food hypersensitivity, and to study its relationship to atopic disease.
METHODS: Gut lavage fluid was obtained from 60 and serum from another 17 patients with self-reported food hypersensitivity. Twenty healthy volunteers served as controls, gut lavage fluid was obtained in all, serum from 11 of 20. The patients were divided into atopic and non-atopic subgroups. BAFF was measured by ELISA in both serum and gut lavage fluid.
RESULTS: B cell-activating factor levels in serum and gut lavage fluid were significantly higher in patients than in controls (P < 0.03 and P < 0.002 respectively). Non-atopic patients had significantly higher levels of BAFF in serum than both atopic patients (P < 0.05) and controls (P < 0.05). There was no significant correlation between serum levels of BAFF and IgE.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that BAFF might be a new mediating mechanism in food hypersensitivity reactions. Significantly higher levels in non-atopic compared with atopic patients, and no correlation between BAFF and IgE, suggest that BAFF might be involved particularly in non-IgE-mediated reactions."
20353554,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20353554/,"BACKGROUND: The association between ages and psychological impact of natural disasters has not been well characterized. A population-based study was conducted 15 months after the 2008 Sichuan earthquake to assess whether elderly survivors were more likely to develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and general psychiatric morbidity.
METHODS: A population-based survey of 327 survivors (152 elders, 175 younger adults) was conducted in severely affected areas by the earthquake, using a multi-stage systematic sampling design.
RESULTS: Compared with the younger adult survivors, the elderly were more likely to have symptoms of PTSD (22.5% vs. 8.0%, p = 0.001) and general psychiatric morbidity (42.0% vs. 25.4%, p = 0.003). Risk factors, such as being elderly, having been in serious danger, having lost family members, and having felt guilt concerning one's death or injury were significantly associated with developing PTSD; being elderly, having family members or friends seriously injured, and having felt guilt concerning one's death or injury were significantly associated with developing general psychiatric morbidity. Utilization of mental health services is strongly associated with the decreased risk for developing both of the symptoms.
CONCLUSION: Compared with the younger adults, the elderly survivors were more likely to develop PTSD and general psychiatric morbidity. More mental health services should be distributed to the elderly and groups at particular risk, to ensure their smooth mental health reconstruction after the earthquake."
20353641,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20353641/,"INTRODUCTION: The National Health Service (NHS) Cancer Plan guidelines recommend a maximum 2-week wait from referral to first appointment, and 2 months from referral to treatment for primary cancers. However, there are currently no guidelines available for metastatic disease. In the UK, nearly half of all colorectal cancer patients develop hepatic metastases. Timely, surgical resection offers the potential for cure. The aim of this study was to audit current practice for colorectal liver metastases in a regional hepatobiliary unit, and compare this to the NHS Cancer Plan standards for primary disease.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of the unit's database was performed for all hepatic metastases referrals from January 2006 to December 2008. The dates of referral, first appointment, investigations and initiation of treatment, along with patient's age and sex, were recorded on Microsoft Excel and analysed. Time was expressed as mean +/- SD in days.
RESULTS: A total of 102 patients with hepatic metastases were identified. Five were excluded due to incomplete data. The average time from referral to first appointment was 10.6 +/- 9.4 days and the average time from referral to treatment was 38.5 +/- 28.6 days. Seventy-five (72.7%) had surgical intervention, of whom 37 also had chemotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS: The data compare favourably to the NHS Cancer Plan guidelines for primary malignancy, demonstrating that a regional hepatobiliary unit is capable of delivering a service for colorectal liver metastases that adheres to the NHS Cancer Plan. Therefore, the NHS Cancer Plan can be applied to this cohort."
20353739,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20353739/,"BACKGROUND: Brucellosis is a zoonotic disease transmittable to humans. It is diagnosed either by isolation of Brucella organism in culture of blood or other sample types (e.g., bone marrow or liver biopsy specimens), or by a combination of serological tests and clinical findings. Dialysis patients constitute a special population group with an impaired autoimmune system and a propensity to develop infections, such as brucellosis. This paper presents the high incidence of brucellosis in our dialysis patients during last year, while there was not any zoonotic infection recorded in the previous at least 5 year period.
METHODS-RESULTS: This is a retrospective study including 8 dialysis patients, undergoing renal replacement therapies (5 patients were on hemodialysis (HD) and 3 on peritoneal dialysis (PD)), who out of a total of 124 patients developed brucellosis, during the last year. Four patients were male and four female and their mean age was 67 +/- 9 years. Clinical presentation of Brucellosis infection was mild with low-grade fever and symptoms of influenza. All patients were living in places where animal brucellosis was prevalent. Infection was diagnosed on the basis of clinical symptoms and signs and with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of peripheral blood. The affected patients had consumed fresh unpasteurized milk and cheese and were treated with oral doxycycline and oral rifampicin for 6 weeks. All patients are in follow up for at least 1 year, during which there were no relapses.
CONCLUSIONS: Brucellosis is a zoonotic disease that can occur in dialysis patients who are susceptible to infection under certain conditions. Our brucellosis patients lived in agricultural and veterinary areas and had consumed unpasteurized milk and cheese and insufficiently cooked meat derived from infected animals."
20354031,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20354031/,"AIMS: Cognitive impairment occurs often in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) and may contribute to sub-optimal self-care. This study aimed to test the impact of cognitive impairment on self-care.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In 93 consecutive patients hospitalized with CHF, self-care (Self-Care of Heart Failure Index) was assessed. Multiple regression analysis was used to test a model of variables hypothesized to predict self-care maintenance, management, and confidence. Variables in the model were mild cognitive impairment (MCI; Mini-Mental State Exam and Montreal Cognitive Assessment), depressive symptoms (Cardiac Depression Scale), age, gender, social isolation, education level, new diagnosis, and co-morbid illnesses. Sixty-eight patients (75%) were coded as having MCI and had significantly lower self-care management (eta(2)= 0.07, P < 0.01) and self-confidence scores (eta(2)= 0.05, P < 0.05). In multivariate analysis, MCI, co-morbidity index, and NYHA class III or IV explained 20% of the variance in self-care management (P < 0.01); MCI made the largest contribution explaining 9% of the variance. Increasing age and symptoms of depression explained 13% of the variance in self-care confidence scores (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Cognitive impairment, a hidden co-morbidity, may impede patients' ability to make appropriate self-care decisions. Screening for MCI may alert health professionals to those at greater risk of failed self-care."
20354056,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20354056/,"OBJECTIVE: The evaluation of rehabilitation success as measured by different tools is becoming increasingly important in terms of time and money allocation. We wanted to know whether functional change in the first week predicts subsequent improvement in a geriatric inpatient rehabilitation clinic.
DESIGN: Observational longitudinal study.
SETTING: Geriatric inpatient rehabilitation clinic in Germany.
SUBJECTS: One hundred and sixty-one inpatients (117 women) with a median age of 82 years, capable of walking at baseline.
MAIN MEASURES: Weekly assessments of physical function were performed from admission until three weeks later. We used a self-rated tool (the function component of the Short Form - Late Life Function and Disability Index), a proxy-rated tool (the Barthel Index) and a performance-based tool (gait speed). We set up linear regression models to estimate the predictive capacity of change in physical function within the first week on change in physical function within the following two weeks.
RESULTS: Positive correlations were found between functional change within the first week and total change within three weeks. However, correlations of the same periods of change with subsequent change were negative. Correlations were highly significant for both analysis with P-values <0.0001 when the same measures for prediction and outcome were used. Correlations were inconsistent when prediction and outcome were different.
CONCLUSIONS: Improvement within the first week of inpatient rehabilitation is negatively correlated with subsequent functional change."

DESIGN: Cross-sectional postal questionnaire survey.
SETTING: Hong Kong.
PARTICIPANTS: Practising doctors registered with the Medical Council of Hong Kong were sent a questionnaire between August and December 2007.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Respondents' responses to questions on demographic data, parameters routinely used to assess asthma control, the pattern of asthma medication prescribing, and seven different case scenarios assessing their ability to classify asthma control and management. RESULTS. We received 410 completed questionnaires from general practitioners (55%), internists (22%), paediatricians (11%), and other specialists (12%). The majority (82%) explained the pathology of asthma to at least some of their patients and tried to identify aggravating factors of the asthma (91%). Fewer observed the inhalation technique of their patients (68%) and prescribed a written asthma management plan (33%). The main medications prescribed to adults and children with asthma were inhaled corticosteroids, inhaled short-acting beta-2 agonists, and combinations of an inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting beta-2 agonist. In adults and children, long-acting beta-2 agonist alone (without inhaled corticosteroid) was being used to treat asthma by 45% and 36% of the doctors, respectively. Also, 94% of the respondents correctly classified the control status in four out of the seven case scenarios and 31% chose the correct medications when responding to seven of the 14 questions asked.
CONCLUSIONS: Asthma management practice of Hong Kong doctors falls short of the standards recommended by international guidelines. More effort in improving their knowledge is urgently warranted."

20355039,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20355039/,"BACKGROUND: A number of retail shops in Copenhagen sell fresh cassava roots. Cassava roots contain the toxic cyanogenic glucoside linamarin. A survey was made of the shop characteristics, origin of the roots, buyers, shop owner's knowledge of toxicity levels, and actual toxicity levels.
RESULTS: Shops selling fresh cassava were shown mostly to be owned by persons originating in the Middle East or Afghanistan, buyers were found to predominantly be of African origin, and sellers' knowledge concerning the potential toxicity was found to be very restricted. Seventy-six per cent of the roots purchased had a total cyanogenic potentials (CNp) above the 50 mg HCN equivalents kg(-1) dry weight (d.w.) proposed as acceptable by an EU working group. Two of 25 roots purchased had CNp higher than 340 mg HCN eq. kg(-1) d.w.
CONCLUSION: The EU has previously made risk assessments concerning cassava and cyanogenic compounds. In the light of the conclusions drawn, the EU needs to make decisions about how to deal with the regulation and control of fresh cassava roots imported to the European food market. Also cassava root products and cassava leaves should be considered."
20355128,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20355128/,"BACKGROUND: The effects of pelleting on the extent of the Maillard reaction (MR) and on calcium, magnesium and zinc solubility and absorption were analysed in a conventional pre-starter diet for suckling piglets. Development was tested measuring colour, absorbance (280/420 nm), fluorescence, residual free lysine, furosine, hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and furfural contents before and after pelleting. Fluorescence, absorbance and mineral solubility were also measured after in vitro digestion of diets. The effects on mineral absorption were tested using Caco-2 cells.
RESULTS: MR indexes confirmed the development of the reaction during the pelleting of this particular diet compared with the meal diet. The CIE-Lab colour parameters showed a decrease in luminosity (L*) and progress of the colour to the red zone (a*) in the pelleted diet. A 36% decrease in free lysine content was observed. Significant correlations were observed between fluorescence intensity and furosine levels, HMF and furfural. The pelleting process did not modify calcium and magnesium solubility after in vitro digestion, but soluble zinc increased. The efficiency of calcium and zinc transport across Caco-2 cell monolayers was greater in the pelleted diet.
CONCLUSIONS: Evidence of MR development is shown, resulting in various nutritional consequences. Optimisation of pelleting could result in a better formulation of diets for feedstuffs."
20356665,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20356665/,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the association between computed tomographic (CT) assessment of inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) canal cortical integrity and intraoperative IAN exposure.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study. The study sample included patients considered at high risk for IAN injury based on panoramic findings. The primary predictor variable was IAN canal integrity (intact or interrupted) assessed on coronal CT images. The secondary predictor variable was length of the cortical defect, in millimeters. The primary outcome variable was intraoperative visualization of the IAN. Other variables were demographic and operative parameters. Bivariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the unadjusted and adjusted associations between the cortical integrity and IAN exposure. Diagnostic test characteristics were computed for cortical integrity and threshold cortical defect size. A P value < or = 0.05 was statistically significant.
RESULTS: The sample consisted of 51 subjects (57% female) with a mean age of 35.2 +/- 12.8 years. Of the 80 third molars available for evaluation, 52 third molars (64.1%) had evidence of loss of cortical integrity. The mean cortical defect length was 2.9 +/- 2.6 mm. Loss of cortical integrity had a high sensitivity (> or = 0.88) but low specificity (< or = 0.49) as a diagnostic test for IAN visualization. A cortical defect size > or = 3 mm was associated with an increased risk for intraoperative IAN visualization with a high sensitivity and specificity (> or = 0.82).
CONCLUSION: Cortical defect size on a maxillofacial CT has a high sensitivity and specificity for predicting intraoperative IAN exposure during third molar removal."
20356915,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20356915/,"AIMS: The number of low-field (<0.5 T) magnetic resonance (MR) scanners installed worldwide is increasing due to a favourable cost and safety profile and improved patient comfort using an open-scanner design. Therefore, the aim of our study was to evaluate a strategy for the safe performance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at a field strength of 0.2 T, in pacemaker (PM) patients without limitations on scan region, PM dependency, or the presence of abandoned leads.
METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred and fourteen PM patients, including PM-dependent patients and patients with abandoned leads, examined at a 0.2 T MR scanner due to an urgent clinical need for an MRI examination, were evaluated. All PMs were reprogrammed before MRI: if heart rate was <60 bpm, the asynchronous mode (with a rate of 80 bpm) was programmed to avoid MR-induced inhibition; if heart rate was >60 bpm, sense-only mode (ODO/OVO/OAO) was used to avoid MR-induced competitive pacing and potential proarrhythmia. Patients were monitored with electrocardiogram (ECG) and pulse oximetry. All PMs were interrogated before and after MRI, including measurement of lead impedance, pacing capture threshold (PCT), and battery voltage. All MRI scans were completed safely. No induction of arrhythmias or inhibition of PM output occurred. There were no statistically significant changes in lead impedance, PCT, or battery voltage (P>0.05).
CONCLUSION: Low-field MRI of PM patients, including high-risk PM patients and MRI scan regions, can be performed with an acceptable risk-benefit ratio under controlled conditions."
20356938,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20356938/,"OBJECTIVE: To document patient decisions after being informed of a first trimester sequential screen Down's syndrome risk between 1/51 and 1/270.
SETTING: A database analysis of sequential screen results for patients seen in the Philadelphia, PA (USA) area between January 2006 and March 2008 was examined.
METHODS: All patients with first trimester sequential screen Down's syndrome risks in the 1/51-1/270 range were identified. Patient decisions regarding invasive testing (prior to completing the second trimester stage of the sequential screen), completion of the second trimester blood draw or no additional testing were tabulated.
RESULTS: A total of 10,850 patients underwent first trimester sequential screening during this interval. Five hundred and fifty-seven patients (5.1%) met the study inclusion criteria and had risks between 1/51 and 1/270. Ninety-three percent of these patients completed the sequential screening process before making any decisions regarding invasive testing. Four percent did not elect an invasive prenatal diagnosis procedure, but also did not complete the second trimester sequential screening blood draw and only 3.2% elected an invasive procedure based on their first trimester risk without completing the second trimester blood draw. Five women (0.9%) with low risks after the second stage screen chose to have an amniocentesis.
CONCLUSION: The vast majority (97%) of patients in the moderately increased Down's syndrome risk range (1/51-1/270) following first trimester sequential screening did not pursue an invasive procedure based on their first trimester sequential screen risk. Using a > or = 1/50 risk cut-off in the first trimester is an effective screening policy for sequential screening."
20357134,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20357134/,"BACKGROUND: Prior studies of common disorders in community-dwelling adults identified internalizing and externalizing spectra of mental illness. We investigated the placement of schizophrenia and schizotypal personality disorder in this framework and tested the validity of the resulting organization in a clinical population.
METHODS: The data came from the Suffolk County Mental Health Project cohort (N = 628), which consists of first-admission patients with psychosis recruited from inpatient units throughout Suffolk County, NY (72% response rate). The sample was reassessed multiple times over the following 10 years. Complete diagnostic data were available for 469 participants. Mental health professionals diagnosed 11 target conditions based on semistructured clinical interviews, review of medical records, and reports of significant others. Two validators were included: family history of schizophrenia and 10-year illness course.
RESULTS: Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV grouping of conditions fit the data poorly. The best alternative classification consisted of three clusters: internalizing, externalizing, and schizophrenic. Both validators supported the coherence and distinctiveness of the schizophrenic cluster.
CONCLUSIONS: We replicated internalizing and externalizing spectra in a clinical population, identified a schizophrenic spectrum, and provided initial evidence of its validity. These findings suggest that schizotypal personality disorder may be better placed with schizophrenia, antisocial conditions with substance use disorders, and major depression with anxiety disorders."
20357586,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20357586/,"BACKGROUND: The medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL), a chief medial restraint preventing lateral patellar dislocation, often is reconstructed in children with recurrent dislocation. The femoral MPFL attachment can be difficult to delineate at surgery. Therefore, the origin of the medial collateral ligament (MCL) frequently is used to approximate the reattachment site. The purpose of our study was to compile normative data from MR imaging examinations over different patient ages, to determine the effect of growth on the relationship of the MCL origin site to the distal femoral physis and medial femoral condyle (MFC).
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This HIPAA-compliant study was IRB approved. Informed consent requirement was waived. Three hundred knee MR imaging examinations (143 boys, 157 girls, 0-20 y) were evaluated. MCL origin to femoral physis distance, MFC height, and MCL origin-physis distance: MFC height ratio (MCL:MFC ratio) were calculated. Relationships between these values and age, gender, and physeal patency were assessed using linear regression models.
RESULTS: With physeal patency, MCL origin-physis distance was significantly associated with increasing age in boys (P=0.0394), and trended toward significance in girls (P=0.0557). Distance increased 0.01 cm/y in both genders. MFC height increased 0.15 cm/y in boys and 0.13 cm/y in girls (P<0.0001). MCL:MFC ratio decreased 0.01/y (P<0.0001). With physeal closure, no significant change was measured for any variable.
CONCLUSIONS: During growth, there are statistically significant, albeit minimal, changes of the MCL origin-physis distance and MFC height. As these changes are essentially negligible, no adjustment for age is needed during restorative MPFL surgery in growing children.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: As there is neglible change in location of the origin of the MCL relative to the distal femoral physis during skeletal growth in both boys and girls, no adjustment for patient age is necessary when using the origin of the MCL as a landmark to locate the site of femoral reattachment of a disrupted MPFL."
20357611,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20357611/,"INTRODUCTION: Because of the relatively high expense of collecting primary data and limited resources, electronically available, population-based hospital discharge data have been increasingly used for disease surveillance by public health researchers. The objective of this study was to compare the New York State Congenital Malformations Registry (CMR) data, which relies on hospital reports, with the hospital discharge files to identify cases in the CMR that were missed in the hospital discharge data files. The ultimate goal was to evaluate whether hospital discharge data can serve as the sole source of case ascertainment for a population-based birth defects surveillance program.
METHODS: CMR cases that were born to the New York State residents for the years 2000 to 2005 were selected and matched to the hospital discharge files from the New York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) for the same birth year period. Since the SPARCS database does not contain patient's name, extensive database matching and manual review by staff members were performed using identifying variables such as the hospital's permanent facility identifier, child's date of birth and medical record number, and mother's medical record number and residential address.
RESULTS: Out of 66 757 CMR cases selected for the study period, 62 118 cases (93.1%) were matched to SPARCS hospital discharge records with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes that were reportable to the CMR, 3 444 cases (5.2%) were matched to SPARCS records with ICD-9 codes that were not reportable to the CMR, and 1 195 cases (1.8%) were not matched. The percentage of cases with multiple congenital malformations was significantly higher (21.3%) for the matched cases that had reportable ICD-9 codes in SPARCS, compared with that for matched CMR cases that had no reportable ICD-9 codes in SPARCS (10.2%).
CONCLUSION: The study found that 93% of CMR infants selected for the study were matched to hospital discharge records with at least one ICD-9 code that was reportable to the CMR; 87 percent had reportable ICD codes in SPARCS that were exactly matched to those in the CMR, that is, all the birth defect codes in SPARCS were matched to those in the CMR. Thus, about 7 percent of CMR children with birth defects would have been missed if only hospital discharge files were used to ascertain the birth defect cases, indicating that there are limitations to using hospital discharge files as the sole source of case ascertainment for population-based birth defects surveillance programs."
20357620,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20357620/,"BACKGROUND: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene copy number has been proposed as predictor of response to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
METHODS: Cytologic and matched histologic samples from 33 primary non-small cell lung cancers were analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for epidermal growth factor receptor gene.
RESULTS: FISH was positive in 52% and negative in 35% of the 31 matched evaluable samples. Four of 31 (13%) cases were discordant (K = 0.736; p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Our data support the feasibility and reliability of epidermal growth factor receptor gene assessment by FISH on cytology."
20357646,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20357646/,"OBJECTIVE: This study had its genesis in a personally observed collision between a motor vehicle and a motorized wheelchair (electric mobility device) on a busy street in the middle of the block at an unmarked crossing. To the observer, at the time, this appeared to be a suicidal act. This investigation was initiated to both delineate the number of these crashes nationally and understand this phenomena as a potentially planned act of self-destruction.
DESIGN: An initial survey of police reports was immediately frustrated by an inability to separate motor vehicle and electric mobility device collisions from the much larger group that involved ambulatory citizens because both types were classified together as ""pedestrian"" accidents. Instead, the search engine NexisLexis was used to identify 107 newspaper articles each of which described a motor vehicle and electric mobility device accident.
RESULTS: In the motor vehicle and electric mobility device collisions, men predominated women (3:1 ratio) with an average age of 56 yrs. Sixty of these accidents were fatal. Ninety-four percent involved an electric mobility device and 6% a manual wheelchair. In 50% of the cases, the motor vehicle was a truck, van, or sport utility vehicle. Fifty percent occurred at dusk or dawn or at night. The electric mobility device occupant was cited as the guilty party in 39% of the cases and the driver of the motor vehicle in 27%. Twenty percent were unwitnessed hit-and-run accidents, whereas ""no fault"" was found in 8% of the cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Although many accidents do happen by chance, when an electric mobility device operator openly challenges busy traffic by attempting to traverse it in the middle of the block at an unmarked crossing, predisposing psychosocial factors must also be considered. Hubris or premeditated self-destructive behavior or both need to be explored as preeminent issues with reference to the prodromal of the ""accident process."""
20358335,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20358335/,"BACKGROUND: The ulnar styloid is a supportive structure for the capsular ligament complex of the distal radioulnar joint. The relation between fractures of the ulna and distal radius is not clear, especially in regard to whether ulnar fractures predict worse outcomes for distal radius fractures. The objective of this study was to analyze the influence of ulnar styloid fractures in patients with reducible and unstable distal radius fractures.
METHODS: A total of 100 patients with unstable and reducible distal radius fractures, with or without an ulnar styloid fracture, were randomly assigned to treatment with transarticular bridging external fixation or transulnar percutaneous pinning. Follow-up was obtained for 91 patients. For the secondary data analysis, three patient cohorts were created: a no ulnar styloid fracture group with the radius fracture treated by pinning or external fixation (n = 30); an ulnar styloid fracture with radius fracture group treated by external fixation (n = 31); and an ulnar styloid fracture with radius fracture treated by pinning (n = 30). Functional and radiological outcomes were measured at 6 and 24 months. Functional outcome measures included wrist pain (visual analogue scale) and the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) questionnaire.
RESULTS: At 24 months, patients with both fractures had worse wrist pain and worse scores on the DASH questionnaire than the patients with an isolated distal radius fracture; and those treated by pinning had less wrist pain and showed better scores on the DASH questionnaire than the patients treated by fixation.
CONCLUSIONS: Ulnar styloid fracture may be a predictive factor of worse functional outcome for distal radius fracture. Pinning and above-the-elbow casting, used to treat ulnar styloid fractures, led to better function than fixation."
20359411,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20359411/,"BACKGROUND: There is an assumption expressed in literature that computer use for clinical activity will improve the quality of general practice care, but there is little evidence to support or refute this assumption.
AIM: This study compares general practitioners (GPs) who use a computer to prescribe, order tests or keep patient records, with GPs who do not, using a set of validated quality indicators.
METHODS: BEACH (Bettering the Evaluation and Care of Health) is a continuous national crosssectional survey of general practice activity in Australia. A sub-sample of 1257 BEACH participants between November 2003 and March 2005 were grouped according to their computer use for test ordering, prescribing and/or medical records. Linear and logistic regression analysis was used to compare the two groups on a set of 34 quality indicators.
RESULTS: Univariate analyses showed that computerised GPs managed more problems; provided fewer medications; ordered more pathology; performed more Pap smear tests; provided more immunisations; ordered more HbA1c tests and provided more referrals to ophthalmologists and allied health workers for diabetes patients; provided less lifestyle counselling, and had fewer consultations with Health Care Card (HCC) holders. After adjustment, differences attributable solely to computer use were prescribed medication rates, lifestyle counselling, HCC holders and referrals to ophthalmologists. Three other differences emerged - computerised GPs provided fewer referrals to allied health workers and detected fewer new cases of depression, and fewer of them prescribed anti-depressants. Twenty-three measures failed to discriminate before or after adjustment.
CONCLUSION: Deciding on 'best quality' is subjective. While literature and guidelines provide clear parameters for many measures, others are difficult to judge. Overall, there was little difference between these two groups. This study has found little evidence to support the claim that computerisation of general practice in Australia has improved the quality of care provided to patients."
20359575,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20359575/,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to compare the intraoperative learning needs and educational resource use of junior and senior residents. Our goal was to gain a better understanding of the progression of learning needs in surgical training.
METHODS: Residents (n = 125) completed a previously validated, 27-item survey indicating the following: (1) the extent to which traditional learning resources are used when preparing for cases in the operating room, and (2) which intraoperative management topics in which they believed they were deficient despite preoperative preparation.
RESULTS: On a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 indicating frequent use, postgraduate year (PGY)-5 residents (n = 39) indicated surgical atlases (4.15; SD, .90) and surgical texts (4.15; SD, .90) were their most frequently used resources when preparing for a case in the operating room. In contrast, PGY-1 residents (n = 32) indicated anatomy atlases (3.97; SD, .93) and advice from colleagues (3.64; SD, .90) were their most frequently used resources when preparing for a case in the operating room. Despite the differences in how the PGY-5 group and the PGY-1 group prepared for a case, of 12 intraoperative management topics both groups believed they were the least prepared for instrument use/selection and suture selection.
CONCLUSIONS: Today's residents represent a heterogeneous group of individuals with different learning needs based on level of experience, knowledge, and learning style. Our study highlights unexpected but critical learning needs for senior-level residents that can and should be readily addressed."
20359748,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20359748/,"OBJECTIVE: Although the intergenerational transmission of family violence has been well documented, the mechanisms responsible for this effect have not been fully determined. The present study examined whether trauma symptoms mediate the relationship between a childhood history of child physical abuse (CPA) and adult CPA risk, and whether any such mediation was similar for women and men.
METHOD: Female and male US Navy (USN) recruits (N=5,394) and college students (N=716) completed self-report measures of their history of child abuse (i.e., CPA and child sexual abuse [CSA]), exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV), current trauma symptoms, and adult CPA risk.
RESULTS: As expected, there was a strong association between a childhood history of CPA and adult CPA risk. This association was significant even after controlling for demographic variables and childhood exposure to other forms of violence (CSA and IPV), and the strength of the relationship did not vary depending on demographics or exposure to other forms of violence. However, the association between a history of CPA and adult risk of CPA was stronger for individuals high in defensive avoidance compared to those low in defensive avoidance. The association between a history of CPA and adult CPA risk was largely, although not entirely, mediated by psychological trauma symptoms. Mediation was observed for both women and men in both the USN and college samples.
CONCLUSIONS: Trauma symptoms associated with a history of CPA accounted for a substantial part of the relationship between a history of CPA and adult CPA risk in both women and men.
PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: To the extent that trauma symptoms are a mechanism by which the intergenerational transmission of child abuse occurs, intervening to reduce trauma symptoms in CPA victims has the potential of reducing their risk of continuing the cycle of violence."
20359810,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20359810/,"OBJECTIVE: To analyse the significance of risk factors and the role of episiotomy in preventing obstetric anal sphincter injury at vaginal delivery.
STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective cross-sectional study in the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital in the UK. All caesarean sections and non-vertex presentations were excluded, which resulted in a study population of 10,314 deliveries. Obstetric anal sphincter injury (OASI) was defined as third or fourth degree tears to the anal sphincter muscles, with or without a tear involving the anal mucosa. First a univariate analysis was done to identify factors that had a significant association with OASI. Factors included parity, age, gestation, labour induction method, duration of second stage, use of epidural analgesia, episiotomy, method of delivery, time and month of delivery, and birth weight. All factors were then combined in a multivariate logistic regression analysis. The multivariate analysis was then repeated including only factors that had a significant association with OASI in the univariate analysis. Adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.
RESULTS: The frequency of anal sphincter lacerations was 3.2%. There were statistically significant associations between an increased incidence of OASI and parity, birth weight, method of delivery and shoulder dystocia. Women giving birth without a mediolateral episiotomy were 1.4 times more likely to experience OASI (95% CI 1.021-1.983). Interestingly, the incidence of OASI has risen between 2005 and 2007.
CONCLUSION: Parity, age, birth weight, method of delivery and shoulder dystocia are strongly associated with obstetric anal sphincter injury. Mediolateral episiotomy appears to be protective against OASI but a randomised controlled trial would be needed to confirm this. The rising incidence of OASI after normal vaginal deliveries may be related to adoption of the hands off technique or increased identification of tears."
20359851,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20359851/,"OBJECTIVE: Longitudinal studies have shown that alexithymic features can interfere with treatment response in eating disorders. However, an alternative hypothesis could be that clinicians faced with alexithymic patients chose different treatment options according to their perceptions of these patients. The aim of this investigation was to explore the relationships between alexithymic features and treatment options provided by professionals in a naturalistic prospective study of eating disorders.
METHODS: We conducted a 3-year longitudinal study exploring a sample of 102 DSM-IV Eating Disorder patients with the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20). All treatments received during follow-up were recorded and recoded dichotomously, and crossed with the variation of alexithymic categories (cut-off≥56) between inclusion and follow-up.
RESULTS: Patients received different treatments according to their alexithymic profile, in terms both of number and type of treatment received. Patients with high, stable levels of alexithymia received overall more treatments, and significantly more antidepressants, than non-alexithymic patients. Patients who became alexithymics during follow-up were more often rehospitalized and received fewer regular psychotherapies than the non-alexithymic patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Professionals should carefully monitor these personality features and be aware of the potential impact of alexithymic features on treatment compliance and on treatment choice for eating disordered patients."
20360153,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20360153/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the use of short-term goal setting is effective in monitoring patient progress, with regard to achievement of rehabilitation goals for discharge and predicted length of hospital stay.
DESIGN: A prospective observational cohort study.
SETTING: An inpatient rehabilitation unit co-located with a large tertiary teaching hospital.
SUBJECTS: Consecutive cases admitted to rehabilitation with a neurological condition and a planned length of stay of three weeks or longer.
PROCEDURE: Discharge and short-term goals and predicted length were set in the initial team meeting. Goals were set, and achievement scored, in the domains of health, social functioning, communication and cognition, mobility and activities of daily living (ADLs) and a composite goal of global function. Actual length of stay and discharge destination were recorded.
RESULTS: Data from 53 consecutive cases were examined, with 45 cases returning home. The median length of stay was 49 days (interquartile (IQ) 30-74). Significant correlations (P<0.05) were demonstrated between short-term goal achievement and discharge goals for continence (rho = 0.62), transfers (rho = 0.53), personal activities of daily living (rho = 0.47) and global function (rho = 0.62). For those that returned home, there were significant correlations (P<0.05) between adherence to predicted length of stay and achieving their initial goals in transfers (rho = 0.44), walking (rho = 0.51) and global function (rho = 0.55).
CONCLUSION: Short-term goal setting is a valid measure of patient progress in inpatient neurological rehabilitation and can be used to identify patients who are not progressing as anticipated, facilitating review of the rehabilitation plan."
20360190,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20360190/,"OBJECTIVE: To ascertain whether magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) can reliably detect synovial neovascularization in subjects with early inflammatory arthritis.
METHODS: Subjects with 6 weeks to 6 months of clinical evidence of inflammatory hand arthritis had a radiograph, power Doppler ultrasound (PDU) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and contrast enhanced MRA performed on the more symptomatic hand. Ultrasound examination of the wrist and 2nd-5th metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints was scored for erosions, synovial thickening, and synovial blood flow. MRI were assessed using the OMERACT Rheumatoid Arthritis MRI Score (RAMRIS). MRA was used to assess the number of abnormal vessels in the 2nd-5th MCP and in the wrist.
RESULTS: Of 30 subjects, 66.7% showed abnormal vasculature on MRA in the MCP and/or wrist; mean number of abnormal vessels was 5.24 (range 0-22). Number of abnormal vessels on MRA was strongly correlated with degree of blood flow seen in the corresponding area on PDU (r = 0.79, p <or= 0.0001). The number of abnormal vessels was highly correlated with MRI MCP synovitis scores (r = 0.69, p <or= 0.0001), MRI wrist synovitis scores (r = 0.73, p <or= 0.0001), and ultrasound synovitis scores (r = 0.68, p <or= 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: In this cross-sectional pilot study, MRA identified abnormal vessels in patients with early inflammatory arthritis. This is the first report of MRA visualizing abnormal vessels in this patient population. If the degree of neovascularization in early inflammatory arthritis predicts disease course, MRA evidence of abnormal vessels could be a new imaging biomarker."
20360321,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20360321/,"BACKGROUND: The relationship between depression and cerebrovascular disease (CBVD) continues to be debated although little research has compared the predictive power of depression for coronary heart disease (CHD) with that for CBVD within the same population. This study aimed to compare the importance of depression for CHD and CBVD within the same population of adults free of apparent cardiovascular disease.
METHODS: A random sample of 23,282 adults (9507 men, 13,775 women) aged 20-54 years were followed up for 7 years. Fatal and first non-fatal CHD and CBVD events were documented by linkage to the National-hospital-discharge and mortality registers.
RESULTS: Sex-age-education-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for CHD was 1.66 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.24-2.24] for participants with mild to severe depressive symptoms, i.e. those scoring > or =10 on the 21-item Beck Depression Inventory, and 2.04 (1.27-3.27) for those who filled antidepressant prescriptions compared with those without depression markers in 1998, i.e. at study baseline. For CBVD, the corresponding HRs were 1.01 (0.67-1.53) and 1.77 (0.95-3.29). After adjustment for behavioural and biological risk factors these associations were reduced but remained evident for CHD, the adjusted HRs being 1.47 (1.08-1.99) and 1.72 (1.06-2.77). For CBVD, the corresponding multivariable adjusted HRs were 0.87 (0.57-1.32) and 1.52 (0.81-2.84).
CONCLUSIONS: Self-reported depression using a standardized questionnaire and clinical markers of mild to severe depression were associated with an increased risk for CHD. There was no clear evidence that depression is a risk factor for CBVD, but this needs further confirmation."
20360488,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20360488/,"BACKGROUND: Several guidelines advocate multiple chest x-rays during primary resuscitation of trauma patients. Some local hospital protocols include a repeat x-ray before leaving the trauma resuscitation room (TR). The purpose of this study was to determine the value of routine repeat x-rays.
METHODS: One-year data of all radiological imaging in the TR were prospectively collected for all patients presenting to the TR of the hospital. The x-rays were counted and assessed and the findings were classified as either 'new injury detected', 'presence of intervention devices' or 'deterioration of previously detected injury'.
RESULTS: A total of 674 patients were included. More than 75% had two x-rays. Eight (2.1%) new injuries without clinical relevance were found on the repeat x-ray after an initial normal x-ray. 61 patients (9%) had a repeat x-ray to verify the effect of an intervention or position of devices. In 28 patients (22%) with two abnormal x-rays, newly diagnosed injuries (n=9) or deterioration of known injuries (n=19) were found. In 411 patients (81%) the results of the repeat x-ray had no clinical consequences.
CONCLUSION: This study indicates that routine repeat chest x-rays can be omitted in trauma patients whose initial chest x-ray is normal."
20360489,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20360489/,"BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury is one of the most common reasons for admission to hospital emergency departments. However, optimal diagnosis and treatment protocols remain controversial. The aim of this study is to assess whether a specific group of patients can be discharged from the hospital without 24-h neurological observation.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis was performed for 1078 patients with a minor isolated head injury admitted to the authors' Emergency Department for 24-h observation. Exclusion criteria included intracranial bleeds with maximum diameter above 5 mm or multiple (>1) bleeds, a history of inherited coagulopathy or anticoagulant therapy, platelet aggregation inhibitor therapy, intoxication or multiple associated injuries. Furthermore, patients who had no-one to observe them at home or who lived more than 1 h away were excluded from the study.
RESULTS: 110 patients presented with an isolated small intracranial bleed (<5 mm) with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 13-15. Of these patients, 46% exhibited small intracerebral haematomas, 23% traumatic subarachnoid haematomas, 9% epidural haematomas and 7% subdural haematomas. Nine patients presented with a GCS of 13/15, 30 patients with a GCS 14/15 and 71 patients with a GCS 15/15. 85% of all patients regained GCS 15/15 within 1 h after admission and 15% within 2 h after admission. All patients maintained their GCS 15/15 over the 24-h period.
CONCLUSIONS: Standard 24-h observation may not be required for adult patients with single intracranial bleeds with maximum diameter less than 5 mm, without a history of inherited coagulopathy or anticoagulant therapy, platelet aggregation inhibitor therapy, intoxication or multiple associated injuries. The decision for discharging patients may be made from the clinical picture. This might help to spare hospital resources and reduce unnecessary hospitalisations."
20360501,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20360501/,"BACKGROUND: Research on the relationship between orthopaedic volume and outcomes has focused almost exclusively on elective arthroplasty procedures. Geriatric patients who have sustained an intertrochanteric hip fracture are older and have a heavier comorbidity burden in comparison with patients undergoing elective arthroplasty; therefore, any advantage of provider volume in terms of mortality could be overwhelmed by the severity of the hip fracture condition itself. This study examined the association between surgeon and hospital volumes of procedures performed for the treatment of intertrochanteric hip fractures in Medicare beneficiaries and inpatient through ninety-day postoperative mortality.
METHODS: The Medicare 100% files of hospital and physician claims plus the beneficiary enrollment files for 2000 through 2002 identified beneficiaries who were sixty-five years of age or older and who underwent inpatient surgery for the treatment of an intertrochanteric hip fracture with internal fixation. Provider volumes of intertrochanteric hip fracture cases were calculated with use of unique surgeon and hospital provider numbers in the claims. Fixed effects regression analysis using generalized estimating equations was used to model the association between hospital and surgeon intertrochanteric hip fracture volume and inpatient through ninety-day mortality, controlling for age, sex, race, Charlson comorbidity score, subtrochanteric fracture, prefracture nursing home residence, Medicaid-administered assistance, surgical device, and year. The unadjusted inpatient, thirty, sixty, and ninety-day mortality rates and adjusted relative risks are reported.
RESULTS: Between March 1, 2000, and December 31, 2002, 192,365 claims met inclusion criteria and matched with provider information. The unadjusted inpatient, thirty-day, sixty-day, and ninety-day mortality rates were 2.91%, 7.92%, 12.34%, and 15.19%, respectively. Patients managed at lower-volume hospitals had significantly higher (10% to 20%) adjusted risks of inpatient mortality than those managed at the highest-volume hospitals. By sixty days postoperatively, the increased mortality risk persisted only among patients managed at the lowest-volume hospitals (six cases per year or fewer). Patients who were managed by surgeons who treated an average of two or three cases per year had the highest mortality risks when compared with patients managed by the highest-volume surgeons.
CONCLUSIONS: Only the highest-volume hospitals showed an inpatient mortality benefit for Medicare patients with intertrochanteric hip fractures. Unlike the situation with elective arthroplasty procedures, our findings do not indicate a need to direct patients with routine hip fractures exclusively to high-volume centers, although the higher mortality rates found in the lowest-volume hospitals warrant further investigation."

METHODS: Data from the public use files of the National Population Health Survey, Cycle 2 (1996), and the Canadian Community Health Survey, Cycle 3.1. (2005), were used. A total of 847 individuals with stroke were included. Self-reported information on health status based on the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 was used to generate single-attribute and overall health-related quality of life scores. Analysis of covariance and multiple logistic regression were used to determine the relationship between survey year and poststroke impairment adjusting for demographic variables and clinical comorbidities.
RESULTS: A statistically significant and clinically important reduction in mean overall Health Utilities Index Mark 3 scores was observed for respondents with stroke from 1996 to 2005. In addition, 2 of the 8 single-attribute Health Utilities Index Mark 3 domains showed a significant change between survey years. Significantly more individuals with stroke reported dexterity and cognitive impairment in 2005 compared with respondents in 1996, indicating reduced health-related quality of life for these domains.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite improvements in medical management, quality of life is not improving after stroke in the Canadian population. These findings are useful to generate hypotheses about the impact of advances in management on quality of life after stroke and identify specific domains that may benefit from future study in stroke populations."
20361902,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20361902/,"OBJECTIVE: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a safe treatment method with few side effects. However, efficacy for various psychiatric disorders is currently not clear.
DATA SOURCES: A literature search was performed from 1966 through October 2008 using PubMed, Ovid Medline, Embase Psychiatry, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, and PsycINFO. The following search terms were used: transcranial magnetic stimulation, TMS, repetitive TMS, psychiatry, mental disorder, psychiatric disorder, anxiety disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, catatonia, mania, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, psychosis, posttraumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, Tourette's syndrome, bulimia nervosa, and addiction.
STUDY SELECTION: Data were obtained from randomized, sham-controlled studies of rTMS treatment for depression (34 studies), auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH, 7 studies), negative symptoms in schizophrenia (7 studies), and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD, 3 studies). Studies of rTMS versus electroconvulsive treatment (ECT, 6 studies) for depression were meta-analyzed.
DATA EXTRACTION: Standardized mean effect sizes of rTMS versus sham were computed based on pretreatment-posttreatment comparisons.
DATA SYNTHESIS: The mean weighted effect size of rTMS versus sham for depression was 0.55 (P < .001). Monotherapy with rTMS was more effective than rTMS as adjunctive to antidepressant medication. ECT was superior to rTMS in the treatment of depression (mean weighted effect size -0.47, P = .004). In the treatment of AVH, rTMS was superior to sham treatment, with a mean weighted effect size of 0.54 (P < .001). The mean weighted effect size for rTMS versus sham in the treatment of negative symptoms in schizophrenia was 0.39 (P = .11) and for OCD, 0.15 (P = .52). Side effects were mild, yet more prevalent with high-frequency rTMS at frontal locations.
CONCLUSIONS: It is time to provide rTMS as a clinical treatment method for depression, for auditory verbal hallucinations, and possibly for negative symptoms. We do not recommend rTMS for the treatment of OCD."
20361906,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20361906/,"BACKGROUND: The importance of the therapist's education and experience for the successful behavior treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has not been investigated. Data on the relative effectiveness of self-controlled versus therapist-controlled in vivo exposure with response or ritual prevention (ERP) have yielded conflicting results. The present study compared the effectiveness of 4 different modes of delivery of ERP in a referred sample of OCD patients.
METHOD: Of the 146 eligible OCD outpatients, 118 patients enrolled in this randomized controlled trial and were randomly assigned to (1) therapist-controlled ERP performed by experienced behavior therapists; (2) therapist-controlled ERP performed by master's students of clinical psychology; (3) self-controlled ERP performed by experienced behavior therapists; and (4) self-controlled ERP performed by master's students of clinical psychology. This trial was performed from January 1999 to January 2005.
RESULTS: Our analyses revealed no significant differences in clinical outcome between any of the different modes of delivery of ERP at posttreatment. The different ERP modes of delivery were associated with significant pretreatment to posttreatment improvement on all measurements, with large effect sizes on the primary outcome measure, the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that clinically inexperienced master's students with no postgraduate training can be as capable as experienced and certified behavior therapists in treating OCD patients, as long as therapists adhere to a standardized treatment manual and adequate training and supervision is provided. In contrast to other studies, we did not find a supposed benefit of therapist-controlled ERP versus self-controlled ERP in patients with OCD.

20362287,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20362287/,"INTRODUCTION: Exsanguination from penetrating torso injury is a major source of mortality on the battlefield. Advanced Life Support guidelines suggest 'on-scene' thoracotomy for patients in cardiac arrest following penetrating chest trauma. This requires significant resourcing and training. Experience from published series (31 pre-hospital thoracotomies with 3 survivors) suggests that when this manoeuvre is applied to a well selected group it is a significant and life-saving procedure. Can this be applied to military injuries?
METHODS: Over a 12 month period on Operation Herrick all patients who sustained significant thoracic trauma were retrospectively reviewed. Parameters were recorded to allow detailed analysis of injury pattern and operative management. Our main objective was to determine if an early (pre-hospital) thoracotomy would have influenced the outcome.
RESULTS: Over the period, 81 patients required operative intervention following thoracic trauma: 8 patients underwent emergency thoracotomy (performed as part of the resuscitation) and 14 underwent urgent thoracotomy (performed after physiology partly restored). There were 9 fatalities--7 undergoing emergency thoracotomy and 2 post-operatively from multi-organ failure. Of the 7 intra-operative deaths 4/7 patients had thoracic injury and 6/7 had additional abdominal injuries. The median predicted survival of fatalities was 2.0% using Trauma Injury Severity Scoring.
DISCUSSION: Emergency thoracotomy should be performed in cardiac arrest following penetrating trauma as soon as possible. Highest survival rates in both in-hospital and pre-hospital thoracotomy are found in isolated cardiac stab wounds (19.4%). Poorest survival is found in multiply, ballistic injured patients (0.7%). The latter best reflects the injury pattern of military patients who have cardiac arrest following penetrating torso injury.
CONCLUSION: As our injury pattern suggests, any pre-hospital thoracotomy on military patients is likely to require complex intervention in very challenging environments. Our evidence does not support the notion that earlier thoracotomy could improve survival."
20362753,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20362753/,"BACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency is associated with significant increases in the incidence of cardiovascular risk factors and mortality. However, the mechanisms underlying this association remain unclear. The current study evaluated the possible relationships among vitamin D status, endothelial dysfunction, and inflammation.
METHODS: Plasma concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) were determined by radioimmunoassay in a normal population cohort (n=253) aged 51 to 77 years (mean 63.4+/-6 years). Asymmetric dimethylarginine, a marker/mediator of endothelial dysfunction, was assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels were used as a marker of inflammatory activation.
RESULTS: On univariate analyses, low 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) levels were inversely correlated with asymmetric dimethylarginine concentrations, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels, and body mass index. Seasonal fluctuations in 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) levels were associated with reciprocal asymmetric dimethylarginine concentration fluctuations. Hypertension and treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker also were associated with low 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) levels. On multiple linear analysis, both asymmetric dimethylarginine (beta=-0.19, P=.003) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (beta=-0.14, P=.03) concentrations were inversely correlated with plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) concentrations; other significant correlates were male gender (beta=0.19, P=.003), calcium levels (beta=0.14, P=.03), and use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (beta=-0.17, P=.007).
CONCLUSION: Low 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) levels are associated with markers of endothelial dysfunction and inflammatory activation, representing potential mechanisms for incremental coronary risk."
20362834,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20362834/,"PURPOSE: The aims of our study were to assess effects of the extent of capsular release and to define the benefit of additional release of the inferior glenohumeral ligament (IGHL) from inferior to posterior in frozen shoulder.
METHODS: Seventy-four consecutive patients with refractory frozen shoulder underwent arthroscopic capsular release and were divided into 2 groups randomly. The release of anterior capsular structures, including the anterior band of the IGHL, was performed in group 1. In group 2 the release extended inferiorly and posteriorly. Constant functional scores were used to assess the outcome. The range of motion (ROM) in various directions was also recorded preoperatively and postoperatively.
RESULTS: Follow-up was obtained in 41 patients in group 1 and 29 patients in group 2, and it averaged 28 months. At the last follow-up, there was a significant improvement in Constant score (P < .01) postoperatively in all patients. There was a significant and rapid reduction in the visual analog scale score in both groups postoperatively. No statistical difference in the visual analog scale score was found between the 2 groups at the corresponding time points. Overall, patients had restored shoulder ROM at the last follow-up without difference between group 1 and group 2. Abduction, flexion, external rotation at 90 degrees of abduction, internal rotation at 0 degrees of abduction, and internal rotation at 90 degrees of abduction recovered more rapidly in group 2 within 3 months after surgery; however, there was no significant difference in ROM after 6 months.
CONCLUSIONS: In this broad group of patients with recalcitrant adhesive capsulitis, the addition of the posterior capsular release did not improve patient function or ROM over anterior capsular release alone at 6 months. The extended release of the inferior and posterior IGHL would improve ROM more rapidly within the first 3 months postoperatively.

20362912,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20362912/,"INTRODUCTION: The aim of this pilot study was to analyze the morphology of the cervical vertebrae of subjects with transverse maxillary constriction.
METHODS: The study population included 40 subjects (7-11 years of age) undergoing palatal expansion to correct transverse maxillary constriction, and a control group of 40 subjects (7-11 years of age) without transverse maxillary constriction. Two observers assessed cervical morphology on lateral cephalograms by means of templates showing cervical maturation sequences. Round angles and concave vertebral body edges were classified as vertebral anomalies that could not be associated with physiologic vertebral growth. Agreement between the data collected by the observers was assessed with the Cohen kappa test, and the data of the 2 groups were compared with the Fisher exact test (P <0.05).
RESULTS: The 2 observers agreed in their assessments (k >0.5). The greater percentage of vertebral defects in the study group was significant (P <0.05) according to both observers. Rounding of the anterosuperior angle of the vertebral body was the most common defect in the study group. Vertebral defects of the study group were mainly at vertebrae C4 and C5.
CONCLUSIONS: A statistically significant correlation, worthy of further study, was found between transverse maxillary constriction and cervical vertebral defects."
20363001,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20363001/,"OBJECTIVE: We have analyzed short- and long-term variations of pulmonary function in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer after induction chemoradiotherapy.
METHODS: Twenty-seven patients with stage IIIA (N2) non-small cell lung cancer underwent resection with radical intent after induction chemoradiotherapy in the period 2003 to 2006. Pulmonary function has been evaluated by spirometry, diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide, and blood gas analysis before induction chemoradiotherapy (T0), 4 weeks after induction chemoradiotherapy and before surgery (T1), and 1 (T2), 3 (T3), 6 (T4), and 12 months (T5) after surgery.
RESULTS: A 22.80% decrease of diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (P < .001) was observed at T1. At T2 significant decreases in the following were present: vital capacity, -20.50% (P < .001); forced vital capacity, -22.50% (P < .001); forced expiratory volume in 1 second, -23.00% (P < .001); peak expiratory flow, -29.0 (P < .001); forced expiratory flow 25% to 75%, -13.7% (P = .005); and diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide, 43.6% (P < .001). However, in the interval between T2 and T5, a progressive improvement of lung function in most parameters was observed, but only diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide presented a significant increase (P < .001). Within the same time gap (T2 to T5), subjects 65 years of age or younger showed an increasing trend for vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, total lung capacity, and residual volume significantly different from that of elderly patients, in whom a decrease in these parameters is reported.
CONCLUSIONS: An impairment of respiratory function is evident in the immediate postoperative setting in patients with non-small cell lung cancer receiving induction chemoradiotherapy. In the long-term period, a general recovery in diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide was found, whereas an improvement of forced expiratory volume in 1 second, vital capacity, total lung capacity, and residual volume was detected in the younger population only."
20363117,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20363117/,"BACKGROUND: Epidemics of asthma and overweight have been linked recently. They might be associated with systemic inflammation. In asthma hyperresponsiveness to adenosine (AMP) is more closely related to inflammation than to methacholine (MCh). The aim of the study was to determine responsiveness to AMP and MCh in overweight compared with normal weight asthmatics.
METHODS: Thirty women were enrolled (19 overweight) with mild controlled asthma according to GINA. A Body Mass Index (BMI) less than 25kg/m(2) was considered as normal and a BMI above 25kg/m(2) as overweight. We assessed the recent control of asthma (ACQ), pulmonary function tests, bronchial responsiveness to MCh and AMP (PC(20) and O'Connor two-point dose-response slope), perception of symptoms (Borg scale), and blood inflammatory markers (leptin and hs-CRP by ELISA).
RESULTS: Overweight had a significant lower dose-response slope of the MCh challenge (p=0.009) as compared to normal weight patients, whereas no significant difference was observed for AMP challenge (p=0.27). Overweight patients had higher intercepts of the Borg scale measured before the MCh and AMP challenge tests (p=0.01 and p=0.03). Plasma leptin (p=0.001) and hs-CRP (p=0.05) concentrations were higher in overweight than normal weight patients. There was no correlation between challenges and inflammatory markers.
CONCLUSIONS: Overweight asthmatic women have more pronounced systemic inflammation, but are less responsive to MCh. AMP responsiveness appeared to be comparable between both groups. Our findings suggest that overweight asthmatic women do not feature increased airway inflammation, but do represent a distinct phenotype as compared to normal weight patients."
20363171,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20363171/,"AIM: In France, diabetes prevalence and ageing of the population are both on the increase, yet little information on diabetes in elderly patients living in geriatric institutions is available. Moreover, institutionalized diabetic patients are not included in the French recommendations for the management of diabetes in the elderly. For this reason, the aim of the present study was to evaluate diabetes management in older, institutionalized patients.
METHODS: The medical records of 100 diabetic patients, aged 65 years and over, and living in seven geriatric institutions in the Côte d'Or region of France, were studied from May 2008 to January 2009.
RESULTS: Prevalence of diabetes in these seven geriatric institutions was 15.46±4.9%, higher than in the general population. The diabetic patients had a mean age of 81.85±11.93 years, and 32% had glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) less or equal to 6.5%, indicating a high risk of severe hypoglycaemia. A diet for diabetes was prescribed in 54% of the patients, but HbA(1c) levels did not differ between patients following and not following the diet (7.26±1.36% vs 7.11±1.10%, respectively; P=0.27). Creatinine was assessed in 87% of the patients, and 16% were ophthalmologically followed-up. Daily capillary blood glucose monitoring was performed in 100% of the patients taking insulin and in 17% of those taking oral antidiabetic treatment (P<0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Our data show that, among older institutionalized patients, the prevalence of diabetes is high and the control of diabetes too tight, with a potential risk of hypoglycaemia. Antidiabetic treatment should be reduced when the HbA(1c) value is less than 7.5% in this frail and functionally dependent population. Furthermore, a diabetic diet, prescribed for more than half this population, is useless for glycaemic control and may even impinge on quality of life."
20363417,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20363417/,"BACKGROUND: Gastric polyps are found frequently in various colonic polyposis syndromes. Genetic alterations of several genes occur in gastric adenomas and colorectal adenomas. However, it is unknown whether patients with gastric adenomas are at higher risk for colorectal adenomas.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence rate of colorectal adenoma in patients with gastric adenomas and to determine the association between the presence of gastric adenomas and synchronous colorectal adenomas.
DESIGN: A retrospective, cross-sectional, case-control study.
SETTING: Single center: Center for Health Promotion of Samsung Medical Center.
PATIENTS: This study involved 87 patients with gastric adenomas and 174 sex-matched and age-matched controls among 19,019 participants who underwent EGD and colonoscopy simultaneously or within 6 months of each other from January 2001 to December 2008 at the Center for Health Promotion of Samsung Medical Center.
INTERVENTION: EGD and colonoscopy.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: The prevalence rate of colorectal adenoma in patients with gastric adenomas.
RESULTS: The 87 gastric adenoma patients included 72 men and 15 women. Colorectal adenomas were identified in 42 (48.3%) of 87 cases and in 58 (33.3%) of 174 controls (P = .022). The prevalence of colorectal adenoma was significantly higher in the gastric adenoma group than in the control group. The mean size and number of colorectal adenomas were not significantly different between the two groups. The majority of colorectal adenomas were located in distal colonic segments in the gastric adenoma group in contrast with proximal colonic segments in the control group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that independent risk factors for colorectal adenoma were the presence of gastric adenomas (odds ratio [OR], .915; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.044-3.513) and increasing age over 55 years (OR, 2.943; 95% CI, 1.558-5.560).
LIMITATIONS: Lack of data on previous colorectal adenomas and possible confounding factors such as hyperlipidemia or diabetes mellitus.
CONCLUSION: The risk of colorectal adenoma increases significantly in patients with gastric adenomas and in patients over age 55. A screening colonoscopy may be necessary for patients with gastric adenomas to detect colorectal adenomas."
20363547,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20363547/,"PURPOSE: Perineural invasion (PNI) in oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is recognized as a significant predictor of outcome. PNI is associated with locoregional recurrence and decreased survival of patients with head and neck SCC. Nerve growth factor (NGF) has been shown to be involved in PNI in several malignancies, including breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancers. We investigated the hypothesis that NGF and its high-affinity receptor tyrosine kinase A (TrkA) are highly expressed in cases of oral SCC that have histologic evidence of PNI.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed immunohistochemistry on archived oral tongue SCC specimens from the established oral and general pathology databases at the University of California, San Francisco. The following groups were evaluated: 1) 21 T1/T2 oral tongue SCC cases with PNI and 2) 21 T1/T2 oral tongue SCC cases without histologic evidence of PNI.
RESULTS: Strong homogeneous cytoplasmic staining for NGF and TrkA was detected in the malignant cells in the PNI-positive group of tumors. In group II (PNI negative) NGF and TrkA were detected in the stroma cells or were very weakly expressed by the malignant cells. We were able to show the presence of NGF and TrkA in the cytoplasm of malignant squamous cells in tumors with histologic evidence of PNI. Immunostaining for NGF (P = .0001) and TrkA (P = .039) was significantly higher in the PNI-positive oral SCC group than in the PNI-negative oral SCC group.
CONCLUSION: This study shows that oral SCC with evidence of PNI shows increased expression of NGF and TrkA and suggests that NGF and TrkA are involved with the mechanism leading to PNI. Further investigations are warranted to determine the potential for use of NGF and TrkA as candidate biomarkers to predict progression and outcome."
20363583,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20363583/,"BACKGROUND: Current clinical practice in many emergency departments (EDs) includes checking a type and screen blood test (T&S) for Rhesus (Rh) status on all pregnant patients presenting with vaginal bleeding or abdominal pain. The test is expensive, and awaiting results may delay disposition.
OBJECTIVE: To determine if there is a subset of pregnant women who reliably know their blood type and for whom a T&S blood test to determine Rh status can be safely omitted or deferred.
METHODS: A prospective study at two associated urban academic centers with an annual ED census of 150,000 patients was performed between January 2007 and June 2008. Pregnant patients who had a T&S obtained as part of their ED evaluation were enrolled. Subjects completed a standardized data form that requested demographic information and were asked to select ""no,"" ""maybe,"" or ""yes, definitely"" if they knew their blood type. Standard descriptive statistics with 95% confidence intervals were performed.
RESULTS: There were 319 pregnant women enrolled in the study. Among the 106 subjects that reported ""yes, definitely"" they knew their blood type, 103 (97.2%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 94.0-100%]) identified their correct blood type and 105 (99.1%; 95% CI 97.2-100%) identified their correct Rh status. None of these subjects selected a positive Rh when they were in fact a negative Rh. All 14 (13.2%) subjects with a negative Rh status identified themselves as having a negative Rh.
CONCLUSION: Pregnant women reporting that ""yes, definitely"" they know their blood type, are reliable. Deferring T&S testing test may be reasonable."
20364430,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20364430/,"INTRODUCTION: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is an important problem in orthopedic trauma patients. An association between VTE and upper extremity injury has not been reported. The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether upper extremity trauma is an independent risk factor for lower extremity VTE. This study also attempted to identify associations between VTEs and demographic and injury variables in patients that sustained upper extremity trauma.
METHODS: Eleven years of data from the trauma registry at our Level I trauma center was retrospectively reviewed in an injury-matched cohort study. From an initial pool of 646 patients who sustained upper extremity trauma, 32 subjects (4.95%) were identified as having major upper extremity injuries as well as thromboembolic complications. Thirty-two injury-matched controls were randomly selected from the 646 patients with major upper extremity injuries. Regression analysis was performed to determine variables that were significantly associated with lower extremity thromboembolic complications.
RESULTS: Overall incidence of VTE in patients sustaining upper extremity injury was 4.95% (deep vein thrombus 4.64%, pulmonary embolism 0.31%) and was similar to the 4.95% VTE rate in patients without upper extremity injury. Major head injury (p = 0.022) occurred at increased frequency in the VTE group. Patients with increased length of hospital stay (p < 0.001) and length of time on a ventilator (p = 0.002) were at significantly higher risk for thromboembolic complications. No patient with isolated upper extremity trauma had complications from VTE.
CONCLUSION: Lower extremity VTE occurs at similar rates in patients sustaining upper extremity injury compared to those patients that do not. Major upper extremity orthopedic trauma is not an independent risk factor for lower extremity VTE, and current clinical management guidelines for VTE prophylaxis are adequate for patients sustaining major upper extremity trauma."
20364536,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20364536/,"OBJECTIVES: The prevalence of childhood obesity in Canada is a major concern. Studies report a small but significant inverse relationship between exclusive breastfeeding and childhood obesity. The study objectives were to determine the prevalence of overweight and obesity in a preschool population living in Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) and to examine the relationship between exclusive breastfeeding and preschool obesity.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional analysis of 1,026 children born in 2001 who participated in the Pre Kindergarten Health Fairs in 2005. Heights and weights were collected and body mass index (BMI) calculated. The BMI-for-age references used by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in the United States were used to classify the weight status of children. Infant feeding information was collected through a survey. The relationship between breastfeeding and childhood obesity was examined using logistic regression models controlling for child's age and gender, mother's education and smoking status, and whether the baby was preterm or full-term.
RESULTS: In 2005, 65%, 19% and 16% of preschool children were normal, overweight and obese, respectively. 74% of women initiated breastfeeding and 43% exclusively breastfed to 3 months. Exclusive breastfeeding to 3 months was protective of preschool obesity (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.65, 95% CI 0.45-0.96).
CONCLUSION: Obesity is prevalent in preschool children in NL. Exclusive breastfeeding appeared to be a protective factor for obesity in preschoolers. Given the known benefits of breastfeeding and the adverse health consequences of obesity, efforts should be made to increase exclusive breastfeeding which may help to prevent the development of obesity in young children."
20364543,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20364543/,"OBJECTIVES: Comprehensive tobacco control policies implemented in Canada have succeeded in lowering overall smoking prevalence; however, the extent to which they have impacted socio-economic disparities in tobacco use is not known. This study examined smoking rates and related measures across socio-economic groups over a 7-year period in Canada.
METHODS: Regression analyses tested associations between smoking-related outcomes (prevalence, frequency, consumption, quit intentions and attempts, quit ratios), education level and time, using data from adults 25 years and older who completed the 1999 to 2006 waves of the Canadian Tobacco Use Monitoring Survey (CTUMS), a repeated cross-sectional survey with nationally representative samples (n = 86,971).
RESULTS: Between 1999 and 2006, smoking prevalence, daily smoking, and cigarette consumption decreased, while the proportion of smokers who planned to quit increased, as did the proportion of ever-smokers who had quit. However, significant educational differences were observed: Canadians with less education had greater odds of current smoking (prevalence approximately doubled between the most and least educated groups) and daily smoking, and consumed more cigarettes, compared to university graduates. Highly-educated ever-smokers were also more likely to have quit smoking. These disparities remained stable over the time period studied. Intentions and attempts to quit were not consistently associated with education.
CONCLUSIONS: The decline in smoking among Canadians between 1999 and 2006 represents a major public health achievement. However, considerable smoking-related disparities exist between socio-economic groups, and have changed very little. Therefore, while recent programs and policies have succeeded in reducing overall tobacco use, they have not addressed socio-economic disparities."
20364546,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20364546/,"OBJECTIVES: Canadian recommendations exist for energy intake (EI), physical activity (PA) and gestational weight gain (GWG) to help pregnant women avoid excessive GWG and attain ""fit pregnancies"". Our objectives were: 1) to measure daily EI, PA and GWG to observe whether pregnant women were meeting recommendations, 2) to explore the impact of health care provider advice on PA and GWG, and 3) to determine behaviours associated with recommended weekly GWG.
METHODS: Women (n = 81) were recruited from prenatal classes. Current weight and self-reported pre-pregnancy weight were documented. Current PA levels and provider advice for PA and GWG were surveyed using questionnaires. Dietary recalls and pedometer steps were recorded for three and seven days respectively.
RESULTS: The majority of our women were classified as having average pre-pregnancy body mass indices (BMI) of 23.3 +/- 4 kg/m2, average EI of 2237 kcal/d and energy expenditure (EE) of 2328 kcal/d, but with weekly rates of GWG in excess of current recommendations despite having received advice about GWG (74%) and PA (73%). Most were classified as sedentary (< 5000 steps/day (d)) and 36% as low active (< 7500 steps/d). Women were most likely to achieve appropriate GWG if their total PA was > 8.5 MET-hr/wk.
CONCLUSION: Health care providers need to provide appropriate PA and GWG guidelines to pregnant women. Development of pregnancy step and MET-hr/wk recommendations are warranted in order to promote greater PA during pregnancy."
20364743,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20364743/,"BACKGROUND: Glycaemic control is critical for managing diabetes and related complications. Considering high prevalence of Diabetes in Pakistan, our study aimed to assess the status of glycaemic control in Type-II Diabetics by measurement of HbA1c from 2005-2007 at Rawalpindi. We also evaluated changes in its trends in relation with sex and age.
METHODS: It was a retrospective analysis of data from Clinical Pathology Laboratory, Army Medical College, Rawalpindi during 2005-2007. A total of 2875 patients, aged 24-70 years, taking oral hypoglycaemic agents, were included. HbA1c was measured by using Human kit. International Diabetes Federation guidelines, < or = 6.5%, 6.6%-8.4% and > or = 8.5% were used to classify patients into good, fair and poor control categories.
RESULTS: The number of patients (n = 2875) tested for HbA1c increased from 904,974 to 997 during 2005-2007. The patients had an age of 48 +/- 13 years and comprised of 54% males and 46% females. Improvement in patient's glycaemic control among the three categories during 2005 to 2007 was as follows: good (41% vs 47%), fair (38% vs 40%) and poor (21% vs 13%) respectively. The average HbA1c values improved from 7.25 % in 2005 to 6.69% in 2007 (p < 0.05). Overall, males (45%) and youngest age group (53%) patients had good diabetic control.
CONCLUSION: Glycaemic control improved in diabetic patients from 41% to 47% during 2005-2007 at Rawalpindi. Males, especially the youngest patients comprised majority of good control population. For effective disease management and optimal HbA1c values, a combined effort by the patient and physician is required."
20367312,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20367312/,"CONTEXT: Tissue microarrays (TMAs) have emerged as a high-throughput technology for protein evaluation in large cohorts. This technique allows maximization of tissue resources by analysis of sections from 0.6-mm to 1.5-mm core ""biopsies"" of standard formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks and by the processing of hundreds of cases arrayed on a single recipient block in an identical manner.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the expression of a series of biomarkers as a function of core size. Although pathologists frequently feel better if larger core sizes are used, there is no evidence in the literature showing that large cores are better (or worse) than small cores for assessment of TMAs.
DESIGN: Estrogen receptor, HER2/neu, epidermal growth factor receptor, STAT3, mTOR, and phospho-p70 S6 kinase were measured by immunofluorescence with automated quantitative analysis. One random 0.6-mm field (one 0.6-mm spot) was compared to 6 to 12 fields per spot, representing 1-mm and 1.5-mm cores, for 3 different tumor types.
RESULTS: We show that measurement of a single random 0.6-mm spot was comparable to analysis of the whole 1-mm or 1.5-mm spot (Pearson R coefficient varying from 0.87-0.98) for all markers tested.
CONCLUSIONS: Since TMA technology is now being used in all phases of biomarker development, this work shows that TMAs with 0.6-mm cores are as representative as those with any common larger core size for optimization of standardized experimental conditions. Given that a greater number of 0.6-cores can be arrayed in a single master block, use of this core size allows increased throughput and decreased cost."
20367328,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20367328/,"PURPOSE: The Facebook web site is an exceptionally fast-growing social networking site (SNS) containing membership groups with discussion boards on a wide variety of issues. This study uses content analysis to scrutinise postings on Facebook groups related to concussion and examine the purpose of these postings.
METHOD: 472 Facebook groups related to concussion were screened by three researchers using a specifically developed coding scheme to examine demographic information and the purpose of the posting. In those cases where agreement was not obtained, post-analysis discussion allowed consensus to be reached.
RESULTS: From the 17 Facebook groups which met the inclusion criteria, 145 postings were included for analysis. The predominant demographic group which posted on the Facebook discussion boards were North American males. In the main part, individuals utilised the Facebook group to relate personal experiences of concussion (65%), although it was also used to seek (8%) or offer advice (2%). Supporting quotes were extracted.
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the evolving nature of healthcare support in the twenty-first century and the rich information present relating to concussion on SNSs such as Facebook. Although the information being shared on these sites is important, the peer-to-peer interaction may be the key aspect of this health education medium."
20367371,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20367371/,"OBJECT: Modic changes (MCs) and high-intensity zones (HIZs) potentially serve as variably sensitive markers for discogenic chronic low-back pain (CLBP). No study has hitherto assessed the phenomenon of MC-HIZ coexistence at a single level, and the goal in this study was to assess the nature and frequency of this phenomenon.
METHODS: One hundred twenty consecutive patients with discogenic CLBP in whom lumbar MR imaging studies had demonstrated an HIZ, an MC, or both were included.
RESULTS: This cohort (120 consecutive patients with 193 degenerative discs) had discogenic CLBP in at least 1 lumbar level associated with either an HIZ (77 discs), an MC (67 discs), or both (16 patients); there were 55 coexistent non-HIZ/non-MC degenerative discs. Painful MC-HIZ coexistence at 1 level occurred in 6 patients (5 of whom were female). If HIZs and MCs were random, independent entities, then MC-HIZ coexistence at 1 level would have been expected in 67 x 77/193 (that is, 27) discs. The observed frequency was therefore significantly lower (chi(2) = 41, p < 0.001). There were no significant demographic differences between groups. The HIZ disc height (8 +/- 0.2 mm) was significantly greater than the MC (6.6 +/- 0.2 mm) or MC-HIZ (6.7 +/- 0.2 mm) disc heights (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with discogenic CLBP associated with HIZ or MC lesions, MC-HIZ coexistence at 1 level was significantly rarer than expected even by chance; thus, despite both being manifestations of a seemingly common degenerative process, HIZ and MC more closely represent ""either/or"" phenomena. Because HIZ disc height was significantly greater, HIZs may develop earlier in the disc degenerative ontogeny. If any degenerative disc may only display an HIZ first, yet may ultimately display an MC instead, then HIZs must invariably regress as MCs supervene (or even vice versa). The MC-HIZ coexistence would therefore represent either a rare stable state (possibly more common in females) or a transitory state, as one lesion gradually replaces the other. Longitudinal studies would confirm or refute these hypotheses, although significantly larger sample sizes would be required."
20367396,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20367396/,"OBJECTIVE: The presence of a tertiary Gleason grade (TGG) pattern 4 or 5 in radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens has been reported with adverse pathology and a higher biochemical relapse rate after RP. This study investigated the impact of a TGG pattern 4 or 5 on biochemical and pathological outcome in men operated with RP.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study reviewed 151 consecutive cases treated at the hospital between 1985 and 2006; 148 were included in the study. All prostatectomy specimens were re-examined by a genitourinary pathologist and among others parameters the presence of TGG pattern 4 or 5 was recorded. The hospital files were examined retrospectively for clinical follow-up data. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) relapse was defined as two subsequent rising measurements above 0.20 ng/ml. The influence of a TGG pattern 4 or 5 on prognosis was assessed in a Cox proportional hazards regression model controlling for pathological stage, surgical margin (SM) status, seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) and extraprostatic extension (EPE).
RESULTS: Fifty-six patients (38%) experienced PSA relapse during follow-up. Twenty-one patients (58%) with a TGG pattern 4 or 5 had a biochemical relapse compared with 35 patients (31%) without TGG pattern 4 or 5. In the Cox regression model, TGG pattern 4 or 5 was an independent predictor of biochemical failure (p = 0.020).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing RP the presence of a TGG pattern 4 or 5 is an independent predictor for biochemical relapse. Consequently, the RP specimens should routinely be investigated for TGG pattern 4 or 5."
20367618,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20367618/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the utility and importance of total white blood cell count (WBC) and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) as markers of serious bacterial infection (SBI) in hospitalized febrile infants aged ≤2 months.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data on WBC and ANC were collected prospectively for all infants aged ≤2 months who were hospitalized for fever at our centre. The patients were divided into two groups by the presence or absence of SBI.
RESULTS: A total of 1257 infants met the inclusion criteria, of whom 134 (10.7%) had a SBI. The area under the ROC curve was 0.73 (95% CI: 0.67-0.78) for ANC, 0.70 (95% CI: 0.65-0.76) for %ANC and 0.69 (95% CI: 0.61-0.73) for WBC. The independent contribution of these three tests in reducing the number of missed cases of SBI was significant.
CONCLUSION: Complete blood cell count should remain as part of the routine laboratory assessment in this age group as it is reducing the number of missing infants with SBI. Of the three parameters, ANC and %ANC serve as better diagnostic markers of SBI than total WBC. However, more accurate tests such as C-reactive protein and procalcitonin should also be part of the evaluation of febrile infants in these age group as they perform better than WBC or ANC for predicting SBI."
20367722,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20367722/,"RATIONALE, AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The use of general clinical guidelines versus customization of patient care presents a dilemma for clinicians managing chronic illness. The objective of this project is to investigate the claim that the performance of customized strategies for the management of chronic illness depends on accurate patient categorization, and inaccurate categorization can lead to worse performance than that achievable using a general clinical guideline.
METHODS: This paper is based on an analysis of a basic utility model that differentiates between the use of general management strategies and customized strategies.
RESULTS: The analysis identifies necessary conditions for preferring general strategies to customized strategies as a trade-off between strategy performance and the probability of correct patient categorization. The analysis shows that customized treatment strategies developed under optimal conditions are not necessarily preferred.
CONCLUSIONS: Results of the analysis have four implications regarding the design and use of clinical guidelines and customization of care: (i) the balance between the applications of more general strategies versus customization depends on the specificity and accuracy of the strategies; (ii) adoption of clinical guidelines may be stifled as the complexity of guidelines increases to account for growing evidence; (iii) clinical inertia (i.e. the failure to intensify an indicated treatment) can be a rational response to strategy specificity and the probability of misapplication; and, (iv) current clinical guidelines and other decision-support tools may be improved if they accommodate the need for customization of strategies for some patients while providing support for proper categorization of patients."

METHODS: The diagnoses of and therapies received by inpatients at the George Eliot Hospital National Health Service Trust in Nuneaton were recorded. A clinical librarian searched the literature (Clinical Knowledge Summaries, Cochrane Library, Medline and Embase) for the best evidence for each diagnosis-therapy pair. Evidence was graded on the following scale: systematic review, randomized controlled trial, non-experimental evidence and no or contrary evidence.
RESULTS: One hundred and two patients generated 150 diagnosis-therapy pairs. Of these 61 (41%) had systematic review level evidence supporting them, 17 (11%) randomized controlled trial evidence, 48 (32%) non-experimental evidence and 24 (16%) no evidence.
CONCLUSIONS: Results were comparable with previous studies. Care in a medical admissions unit in 2008 is still evidence-based, but, despite the vast growth in medical literature, no more than it was. The process was a useful collaboration between medical and library staff to audit the quality of patient care."
20367824,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20367824/,"BACKGROUND: Surgeons realize that safe and efficient care processes for total joint replacement requires more than just well-performed operations. Orthopaedic teams are reorganizing care process to improve efficacy and shorten length of stay. Little is known on the impact of organizational changes on patient outcome. This paper studies the relation between the organization of care processes and patient outcomes in hip and knee. Clinical pathways are used as one of the methods to structure the care process. Although evidence is available on the effect of pathways in total joint replacement, their impact with the organization of the care process has not been studied previously.
METHODS: A cross-sectional multicentre study was performed on 39 care processes and 737 consecutive patients. Regression models were used to analyse the relation between the organization of the care process and risk-adjusted patient outcomes. The use of pathways and the organization of the care process, measured by the Care Process Self Evaluation Tool (CPSET), were measured at organizational level. Length of stay, pain, mobility and elapsed time to discharge were measured at patient level.
RESULTS: The use of pathways had a positive effect on four out of five subscales and the overall CPSET score. Using pathways decreased length of stay (P = 0.014), pain (P = 0.052) and elapsed time to discharge (P = 0.003). The CPSET subscale communication was related with three risk adjusted outcomes. Multivariate analysis demonstrated a significant effect by three different variables on the length of stay; (1) use of pathways; (2) coordination of care processes; and (3) communication with patients and family. Both the use of pathways and coordination of the care process were determinants for the elapsed time to discharge. A significant interaction effect was found between use of pathways and coordination of the care process.
CONCLUSION: This large multicentre study revealed the relation between the use of pathways, organization of the care process and patient outcomes. This information is important for both clinicians and managers to understand and further improve the organization of orthopaedic care.

20367982,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20367982/,"BACKGROUND: Nosocomial infection in early post-transplantation period is a tough problem for kidney transplantation. Few reports have explored the relations between biochemical parameters and nosocomial infection in kidney transplantation. This retrospective study was carried out to describe the characteristics of nosocomial infection in the very early period of kidney transplantation and to determine the risk factors in biochemical parameters and their alterations.
METHODS: Patients who underwent their first kidney transplantation from January 2001 to March 2009 in Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital were recruited and the nosocomial infectious episodes were collected for this study. Gender, age, donor type, delayed graft function (DGF) and biochemical parameters such as serum uric acid, lipids files and albumin on day 0 (before transplantation) and day 1 (24 hours after transplantation) and their changes were analyzed with Logistic regression models for nosocomial infection.
RESULTS: A total of 405 patients (315 men and 90 women) were involved in this study. There were 80 patients experiencing 113 infection episodes and 105 strains of microorganism were identified. In univariate analysis, there were significant differences in DGF, albumin on day 0, lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)) on day 1, change in low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C, day 1-day 0) and change in uric acid (day 1-day 0) between nosocomial infection patients and noninfectious patients (P < 0.05). In multivariate analysis, change in uric acid (day 1-day 0) (OR 5.139, 95%CI 1.176-22.465, P < 0.05), change in LDL-C (day 1-day 0) (OR 4.179, 95%CI 1.375-12.703, P < 0.05) and DGF (OR 14.409, 95%CI 1.603-129.522, P < 0.05) were identified as independent risk factors for nosocomial infection in kidney transplantation.
CONCLUSIONS: Most nosocomial infections in early postoperative period of kidney transplantation are bacterial, especially with Gram-negative bacteria. The most common infection sites are respiratory tract, urinary tract and surgical site. DGF, decrease of LDL-C and increase of uric acid could increase the risk for nosocomial infections."
20368304,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20368304/,"BACKGROUND: Circulating fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23) promotes renal phosphate excretion and is markedly increased in patients with chronic kidney disease. High serum FGF23 is associated with cardiovascular risk factors and was recently identified as a predictor of total mortality in haemodialysis patients. Herein, our aim was to evaluate the relation between FGF23 and mortality, including the impact of gender and cardiovascular disease (CVD), in a Swedish cohort of 'incident' dialysis patients.
METHODS: Two hundred and twenty-nine incident dialysis patients (149 males; mean age 55 years) were included. Serum intact FGF23, calcium, phosphate, S-albumin, parathyroid hormone, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 were measured at baseline. Cardiovascular disease was defined as clinical symptoms and/or a history of CVD.
RESULTS: During a median follow-up time of 23 months, 66 patients (29%) died. FGF23 levels positively correlated to calcium (r = 0.27, P < 0.0001), phosphate (r = 0.40, P < 0.0001), calcium x phosphate product (r = 0.52, P < 0.0001) and creatinine (r = 0.18, P = 0.007). In Cox proportional hazard models, FGF23 was not associated with increased mortality risk, neither in crude nor in multivariate adjusted models. However, in a subgroup analysis of men with prevalent CVD, FGF23 level above median was associated with higher mortality risk in crude models [hazard ratio 2.19, 95% confidence interval 1.04-4.60, P = 0.04].
CONCLUSIONS: In primary analysis, serum FGF23 was not associated with increased mortality risk in this cohort of 'incident' dialysis patients. Our data support that the impact of FGF23 on mortality may be modified by gender and CVD and, as previously shown, is blunted in the setting of pronounced hyperphosphatemia."
20368474,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20368474/,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate psychological characteristics that could be used for the classification of somatic syndromes requesting medical care. Positive psychological classification criteria are needed to justify the classification of somatic syndromes as Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders- or International Classification of Diseases-10 section F/mental disorders diagnosis.
METHODS: From a population-based sample of 2510 people, subsamples reporting high scores for somatic symptoms (SOM+; n = 154) versus average scores for somatic symptoms (SOM-; n = 167) were defined. Telephone interviews (e.g., structured interviews for diagnoses, healthcare use, symptom history, possible psychological characteristics), self-rating scales (e.g., Pain Disability Index, depression scale Patient Health Questionnaire-9), and general practitioners reports were collected for these subsamples. In addition to somatic symptoms, we used healthcare use and disability as major external validation criteria.
RESULTS: There was strong evidence for ten of the 28 binary coded psychological variables to identify those people with somatic symptoms who needed medical help and/or were seriously disabled. These variables included ""avoidance of physical activities,"" ""bias for somatic illness attributions,"" ""self-concept of being physically weak,"" and ""desperation because of somatic symptoms."" The relevance of these psychological characteristics was partially further confirmed by stepwise regression analyses, which showed incremental validity compared with variables like somatic symptoms and depression.
CONCLUSIONS: This study identified several psychological characteristics of people with somatic complaints who need medical care. These features can be assessed, using binary variables that are more feasible for classification processes. These psychological criteria should be included in classification rules for people with somatic syndromes (e.g., somatoform disorders)."

METHODS: A qualitative study using semistructured interviews from a purposive sample of chief executive officers from urban and rural Victorian GPN included those either participating or not participating in the Australian Primary Care Collaboratives Program.
RESULTS: Australian Primary Care Collaborative experienced DGP have developed the range of skills and knowledge to undertake clinical data management for quality improvement and NQPS reporting. Trust by local general practices for the provision of clinical data has been developed through the demonstration of benefits to practices and improved patient health. General practice networks without Australian Primary Care Collaborative experience have a range of concerns about clinical data management for NQPS reporting, such as gaining cooperation from their practices, handling privacy issues and finding appropriately skilled staff.

This study was designed to comparatively evaluate electron microscopic features of non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).
METHODS: Quantitative and semi-quantitative ultrastructural evaluations were performed on liver biopsies from 23 patients, 10 with NAFL and 13 with NASH.
RESULTS: No statistically significant difference was noted between NAFL and NASH patients in ultrastructural features of hepatocytes including megamitochondria, intramitochondrial crystalline inclusions, mitochondrial matrix granules, foamy cytoplasmic appearance, electron-lucent and glycogen-containing nuclear regions, lipofuscin granules, or an increased frequency of vesicles containing electron-dense material in peribiliary Golgi zone; however, the mitochondrial diameter was significantly higher in the NASH patients. Intercellular distance and microvilli between hepatocytes, collagen and electron-dense material accumulation in the space of Disse, electron-dense material accumulation and microvillus density in bile canaliculi did not differ significantly between the groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that, although NAFL and NASH can be distinguished by their distinct light microscopic features, ultrastructural characteristics are similar, which suggests that NAFL may also have the potential to progress to fibrosis and cirrhosis like NASH."
20370977,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20370977/,"OBJECTIVE: To assess features of sleep among pregnant women.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of low-risk pregnant women in a tertiary perinatal centre (CHUS) in Eastern Townships, Quebec. Sleep was assessed during the second trimester (mean gestational age 16.1 +/- 3.0 weeks) (T2) and third trimester (mean gestational age 27.5 +/- 1.8 weeks) (T3) using a validated self-administered questionnaire, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Scores in this index range from 0 to 21, representing the cumulative scoring of seven sleep components. Subjects with a score > 5 were identified as ""poor sleepers."" Descriptive, bivariate, and regression analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Among 260 consenting women, 192 (73.6%) had a term delivery without any adverse outcome. There were no differences in sleep parameters between pregnancies with adverse outcome and without adverse outcome. Mean overall PSQI scores showed evidence of deterioration in sleep quality from T2 (5.26 +/- 3.16) to T3 (6.73 +/- 4.02; P < 0.01). This deterioration was displayed in five of seven sleep components (P < 0.01). Scores in the ""poor sleeper"" range were recorded by 36% of women in T2 and 56%, of women in T3 (P < 0.01). ""Poor sleep"" in T2 and T3 was associated with low or high weight gain (P < 0.01), annual family income < $40,000 (P = 0.03), and single motherhood (P < 0.01). There was a trend for a seasonal influence on sleep scores (P = 0.08). The only predictor of poor sleep using multivariate analysis was single motherhood (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Sleep is disturbed in early pregnancy and is worse in the third trimester. Interventions to improve sleep should be sought to optimize quality of life for pregnant women."
20371751,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20371751/,"BACKGROUND: Pharmacists in Australia are routinely asked to advise people with lower bowel symptoms. Clinical, demographic, and working environment parameters may affect whether appropriate referral for advanced care is advised by pharmacists.
OBJECTIVE: To characterize how selected clinical, demographic, and working environment variables affect the likelihood of a pharmacist providing a referral for patients with lower bowel symptoms to consult a general practitioner, and to investigate factors associated with agreement with an expert panel and colorectal cancer guidelines.
METHODS: Self-administered questionnaires were distributed to a random sample of 300 pharmacists in Western Australia. Vignettes were constructed around 6 clinical variables and pharmacists were asked to describe a referral pathway. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with odds of referral and agreement with an expert panel.
RESULTS: One hundred sixty-seven completed surveys were returned, giving a response rate of 56%. The odds of referral to a general practitioner were mostly associated with presenting symptoms, although lower odds of referral were observed with increasing volumes of weekly prescriptions. The odds of pharmacists agreeing with the expert panel for an urgent referral were 70% (95% CI 50 to 80) lower for weight loss as the presenting symptom compared to rectal bleeding. The expert panel considered weight loss or rectal bleeding of 4 weeks' duration as meriting an urgent referral, but 63% and 30% of pharmacists, respectively, disagreed. In contrast to cancer guidelines, over 60% of respondents did not consider persistent diarrhea in a 65-year-old patient as a likely symptom of significant bowel pathology.
CONCLUSIONS: In general, pharmacists' patterns of referral were influenced by clinical symptoms and not by demographic or working environment variables. They over-referred patients with diarrhea but under-referred those with weight loss and rectal bleeding, according to the expert panel. This is a cause for concern because any unexplained rectal bleeding should be referred for further investigation."
20372954,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20372954/,"PURPOSE: To elucidate the differences in the pathology of incisional and primary ventral hernias and the outcomes of their laparoscopic repair.
METHODS: An operating room database of all laparoscopic ventral hernias performed between 2001 and 2009 was analyzed retrospectively. Patients were divided into two main groups: Group 1 (incisional hernias) and Group 2 (primary hernias). All P-values < 0.05 were considered to be significant.
RESULTS: There were 121 patients in Group 1 (mean age: 60.35 years) and 100 patients in Group 2 (mean age: 51.94 years). There was a significantly higher percentage of females in Group 1 (70 vs. 28%, P < 0.0001). There were significantly more complex hernias (defined as multiple points of weakness on the anterior abdominal wall) in Group 1 (37 vs. 10%, P < 0.0001). A total of 89% of patients required lysis of adhesions in Group 1 as compared with 73% in Group 2 (P = 0.007). There was a significantly higher percentage of conversions in Group 1 (9%) compared with Group 2 (2%, P = 0.02). The mean mesh size was significantly larger in Group 1 (243.22 vs. 131.46 cm(2)). The mean length of procedure (LOP) was significantly longer in Group 1 (113.94 min) as compared with Group 2 (70.96 min). The overall morbidity rate was not significantly different between the two groups (23 vs. 16%). The mean length of stay (LOS) was significantly longer for Group 1 (2.2 vs. 0.75 days, P < 0.0001). Finally, 22.3% of the patients in Group 1 were discharged on the same day as compared with 59% of the patients in Group 2 (P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: The LOP and LOS are longer after the laparoscopic repair of incisional than for primary ventral hernias. This disparity should be kept in mind when counseling patients and while designing trials investigating laparoscopic ventral hernia repairs (LVHRs)."
20372972,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20372972/,"GOAL OF WORK: The aim of the study was to investigate if the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) model with clinical data from patients with breast-cancer-related lymphedema can predict their health-related quality of life (HRQL).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-one patients with breast-cancer-related lymphedema were recruited. Data were collected from records, including age, type(s) of surgery, number of dissected lymph nodes and history of radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy, duration of lymphedema, and duration between surgery and enrollment. Excessive arm volume, average arm symptom, function of upper extremity (U/E), and HRQL were assessed four times during and after patients' treatment of lymphedema.
RESULTS: The ICF model accounted for 20.5% to 55.6% variance in each domain of HRQL. Activity and participation reflected by U/E function were the most important factor, significantly predicting every domain of HRQL. Among measured impairments, average arm symptom was found to be most correlated with U/E function (r = 0.590, P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The ICF model consisting of clinical measures for patients with breast-cancer-related lymphedema can predict their HRQL. Activity and participation were the most important component. Arm symptoms rather than arm volume significantly correlated with U/E function. This might suggest that reducing arm symptoms is relatively more important while treating patients with breast-cancer-related lymphedema."

20373046,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20373046/,"BACKGROUND: The ultimate fate of the leaking intestinal anastomosis is unknown. We sought to analyze long-term outcomes of anastomotic leak with an emphasis on identifying the likelihood of re-establishing intestinal continuity and the potential for releak with corrective surgery.
METHODS: All consecutive subjects treated for clinical anastomotic leak from January 2001 through December 2007 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were stratified by management of leak: (1) drainage alone, (2) proximal loop diversion, (3) repair/revision without diversion, (4) end stoma, or (5) tube enterostomy. We then determined management of anastomotic leak, mortality, corrective procedures, releak, and re-establishment of intestinal continuity.
RESULTS: In a database of 2,627 intestinal procedures, 79 patients had 88 anastomotic leaks with a final overall mortality of 10.1%. The aggregate rate of re-establishment of intestinal continuity was lowest for the patients treated by end stoma (44.4%) as compared to other initial management options (p < 0.01). Of the patients who survived their initial anastomotic leak, 20.5% had another leak (releak).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients who underwent resection of the leaking anastomosis and end stoma or proximal loop diversion have a high rate of long-term fecal diversion. The proportion of patients who experience an anastomotic releak is substantial following further corrective surgery to re-establish intestinal continuity."
20374201,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20374201/,"BACKGROUND: While the validity of self-reported consumption based on blood alcohol concentration (BAC) has been found to be high in emergency room (ER) samples, little research exists on the estimated number of drinks consumed given a BAC level. Such data would be useful in establishing a dose-response relationship between drinking and risk (e.g., of injury) in those studies for which the number of drinks consumed is not available but BAC is.
METHODS: Several methods were used to estimate the number of drinks consumed in the 6 hours prior to injury based on BAC obtained at the time of ER admission of n = 1,953 patients who self-reported any drinking 6 hours prior to their injury and who arrived to the ER within 6 hours of the event, from the merged Emergency Room Collaborative Alcohol Analysis Project (ERCAAP) and the World Health Organization Collaborative Study on Alcohol and Injury across 16 countries.
RESULTS: The relationship between self-reported consumption and averaged BAC within each consumption level appeared to be fairly linear up to about 7 drinks and a BAC of approximately 100 mg/dl. Above about 7 reported drinks, BAC appeared to have no relationship with drinking, possibly representing longer consumption periods than only the 6 hours before injury for those reporting higher quantities consumed. Both the volume estimate from the bivariate BAC to self-report relationship as well as from a Widmark calculation using BAC and time from last drink to arrival to the ER indicated a somewhat weak relationship to actual number of self-reported drinks.
CONCLUSIONS: Future studies may benefit from investigating the factors suspected to be driving the weak relationships between these measures, including the actual time over which the reported alcohol was consumed and pattern of drinking over the consumption period."
20374211,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20374211/,"BACKGROUND: Recent animal and human studies indicate that the exposure to alcohol during early adolescence increases the risk for heavy alcohol use in response to stress. The purpose of this study was to examine whether this effect may be the consequence of a higher susceptibility to develop ""drinking to cope"" motives among early initiators.
METHODS: Data from 320 participants were collected as part of the Mannheim Study of Children at Risk, an ongoing epidemiological cohort study. Structured interviews at age 15 and 19 were used to assess age at first alcohol experience and drunkenness. The young adults completed questionnaires to obtain information about the occurrence of stressful life events during the past 4 years and current drinking habits. In addition, alcohol use under conditions of negative states was assessed with the Inventory of Drinking Situations.
RESULTS: The probability of young adults' alcohol use in situations characterized by unpleasant emotions was significantly increased the earlier they had initiated the use of alcohol, even when controlling for current drinking habits and stressful life events. Similar results were obtained for the age at first drunkenness.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings strengthen the hypothesis that alcohol experiences during early adolescence facilitate drinking to regulate negative affect as an adverse coping strategy which may represent the starting point of a vicious circle comprising drinking to relieve stress and increased stress as a consequence of drinking."

According to available guidelines, patients on long-term glucocorticoid therapy should receive adequate prophylaxis to prevent osteoporosis.
OBJECTIVES: To compare prescription patterns in relation to Royal College of Physicians (RCP) Guidelines 2002. To identify prescribing trends for prophylaxis and management of steroid-induced osteoporosis.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective audit for patients in a tertiary care center to determine whether clinicians are evaluating and appropriately following prophylactic guidelines for corticoid-induced osteoporosis. Information regarding risk assessment for osteoporosis, instructions regarding its prevention, bone mineral density measurements, and prophylactic therapy were recorded.
RESULTS: One hundred and five patients (38 men and 67 women), more then 18 years of age were included in this study. Of the 105 patients, 56% had at least one documented intervention for osteoporosis prevention (calcium, vitamin D, bisphosphonates or a bone mineral density study). Only three patients received bisphosphonates for osteoporosis prophylaxis.
CONCLUSION: The study shows poor pre-therapeutic risk assessment, absence of instructions regarding preventive measures, inappropriate investigation for presence of osteoporosis, and unacceptable absence of bone protective agents."
20374354,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20374354/,"AIM: To determine the relationship of steroid use with tophus formation and other comorbid conditions among male gout patients.
METHODS: Review of medical records of Filipino gout patients under the care of rheumatologists was conducted. Univariate analysis (chi-square, Student's t-test) and multiple logistic regression analysis were performed to establish the risk for tophus formation among glucocorticoid users. Bivariate analysis was separately done to determine the confounding effect of steroid use in the association of comorbidities and tophi formation.
RESULTS: There were 295 Filipino men with a mean age of 56 years and a mean duration of 12 years of gouty arthritis who were included in the study. Multivariate analysis showed a five times higher likelihood (OR 4.81 95% CI 1.92-12.04, P < 0.001) for tophus formation among prolonged steroid users. Confounders identified were disease duration of gout (> or = 10 years), presence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and elevated serum creatinine level (SCr). Bivariate analysis of comorbidities showed that steroid use introduced a considerable bias in the relationship of hypertension, elevated SCr, CKD and dyslipidemia.
CONCLUSION: Patients with equivalent prednisone intake of at least 15 mg/week for > or = 3 months is associated with tophi formation. In the presence of hypertension, renal impairment, and elevated serum creatinine level, use of steroids confounds the individual risk that each factor carries."
20374667,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20374667/,"BACKGROUND: Integration of medical care across clinicians and settings could enhance the quality of care for patients. To date, there is limited data on the levels of integration in practice. Our objective was to compare primary care clinicians' perceptions of clinical integration and three sub-aspects in two healthcare systems: Kaiser Permanente, Northern California (KPNC) and the Danish healthcare system (DHS). Further, we examined the associations between specific organizational factors and clinical integration within each system.
METHODS: Comparable questionnaires were sent to a random sample of primary care clinicians in KPNC (n = 1103) and general practitioners in DHS (n = 700). Data were analysed using multiple logistic regression models.
RESULTS: More clinicians in KPNC perceived to be part of a clinical integrated environment than did general practitioners in the DHS (OR = 3.06, 95% CI: 2.28, 4.12). Further, more KPNC clinicians reported timeliness of information transfer (OR = 2.25, 95% CI: 1.62, 3.13), agreement on roles and responsibilities (OR = 1.79, 95% CI: 1.30, 2.47) and established coordination mechanisms in place to ensure effective handoffs (OR = 6.80, 95% CI: 4.60, 10.06). None of the considered organizational factors in the sub-country analysis explained a substantial proportion of the variation in clinical integration.
CONCLUSIONS: More primary care clinicians in KPNC reported clinical integration than did general practitioners in the DHS. Focused measures of clinical integration are needed to develop the field of clinical integration and to create the scientific foundation to guide managers searching for evidence based approaches."
20374971,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20374971/,"OBJECTIVE: To study the possibility of shift toward more proximal sites in colorectal cancer (CRC) after resection of tumors and synchronous lesions.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We reviewed 382 resected CRC diagnosed and followed-up with complete colonoscopies. The localization of metachronous adenomas was compared with that of synchronous lesions overall and by sex, tumoral size and the number of synchronous lesions. The frequency of exclusively proximal localization in first-, second- and third-generation metachronous adenomas was compared with that of synchronous adenomas.
RESULTS: A total of 54.5% of patients with CRC had synchronous adenomas. After a median follow-up of 48 months, with 2.74+/-1.47 colonoscopies/case, 42.4% developed metachronous adenomas, 16.8% second-generation adenomas and 7.3% third-generation lesions. Proximal shift was found in metachronous adenomas in both sexes, independently of tumoral size and the number of initial lesions. The frequency of exclusively proximal localization in adenomas was 21.2% in synchronous lesions, 39.5% in first-generation metachronous adenomas (p=0.0001; OR=2.46 [1.50-3.95]), 42.6% in second-generation metachronous adenomas (p=0.0008; OR=2.77 [1.44-5.31]) and 39.3% in third-generation metachronous lesions (p=0.0003; OR=2.41 [0.97-5.93]).
CONCLUSIONS: We found a high incidence of synchronous and metachronous adenomas. Metachronous adenomas showed a proximal shift, independently of sex, tumoral size and the number of synchronous lesions. This tendency was maintained in successive generations of metachronous adenomas, thus demonstrating the need to perform complete colonoscopies throughout the postoperative follow-up period."
20375204,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20375204/,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Genome size is a function, and the product, of cell volume. As such it is contingent on ecological circumstance. The nature of 'this ecological circumstance' is, however, hotly debated. Here, we investigate for angiosperms whether stomatal size may be this 'missing link': the primary determinant of genome size. Stomata are crucial for photosynthesis and their size affects functional efficiency.
METHODS: Stomatal and leaf characteristics were measured for 1442 species from Argentina, Iran, Spain and the UK and, using PCA, some emergent ecological and taxonomic patterns identified. Subsequently, an assessment of the relationship between genome-size values obtained from the Plant DNA C-values database and measurements of stomatal size was carried out.
KEY RESULTS: Stomatal size is an ecologically important attribute. It varies with life-history (woody species < herbaceous species < vernal geophytes) and contributes to ecologically and physiologically important axes of leaf specialization. Moreover, it is positively correlated with genome size across a wide range of major taxa.
CONCLUSIONS: Stomatal size predicts genome size within angiosperms. Correlation is not, however, proof of causality and here our interpretation is hampered by unexpected deficiencies in the scientific literature. Firstly, there are discrepancies between our own observations and established ideas about the ecological significance of stomatal size; very large stomata, theoretically facilitating photosynthesis in deep shade, were, in this study (and in other studies), primarily associated with vernal geophytes of unshaded habitats. Secondly, the lower size limit at which stomata can function efficiently, and the ecological circumstances under which these minute stomata might occur, have not been satisfactorally resolved. Thus, our hypothesis, that the optimization of stomatal size for functional efficiency is a major ecological determinant of genome size, remains unproven."
20375815,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20375815/,"INTRODUCTION: Patients with cervical carcinoma that invade the bladder or rectum (International Federation of Obstetrics and Gynecology stage IVA) have a high risk to develop vesicovaginal and/or rectovaginal fistulae. If we could identify pretreatment factors that predict fistula formation, these patients could be offered less debilitating treatment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were retrieved from the database of consecutive patients diagnosed with stage IVA cervical cancer from 1992 to 2008. Overall survival and fistula-free survival were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to study the association between pretreatment prognostic variables and fistula formation.
RESULTS: Thirty patients with stage IVA cervical cancer were diagnosed. Extension to the bladder was present in 27 patients; three patients had only rectal involvement. Twenty-three patients (77%) had curative radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy and/or hyperthermia. Seven patients (23%) received only palliative therapy or no treatment at all. The 5-year overall survival in the curatively treated group was 42%. Five (22%) of these 23 patients developed one or more fistulae: 3 vesicovaginal, 1 rectovaginal, and 1 vesicovaginal and rectovaginal fistulae. The 5-year fistula-free survival of this group was 64%. No significant association was found between the prognostic variables and fistula formation.
CONCLUSIONS: The risk to develop vesicovaginal and/or rectovaginal fistulae is high after curative radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy and/or hyperthermia in patients with stage IVA cervical cancer. We could not identify further pretreatment factors that might have predicted fistula formation."
20375919,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20375919/,"BACKGROUND: Closed suction drainage is a routine part of wound management for patients undergoing surgical treatment of acetabulum fractures. This pilot study seeks to determine if there is a difference in wound healing for a Kocher-Langenbeck approach with and without the use of drains.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective, randomized study including 39 patients with acetabulum fractures treated through a Kocher-Langenbeck approach. During wound closure, patients were randomized into two groups: 20 patients (group I) received drains and 19 (group II) were closed without drains. All were followed up for drain output, quality and quantity of drainage, signs of infection, and duration of drainage. Patients were then evaluated at 2 weeks and 8 weeks for wound healing and any signs of infection.
RESULTS: By the 8-week follow-up, all wounds healed without any signs of infection. There was no difference in the average number of days of drainage between groups: 7.45 days and 7.95 days for group I and group II, respectively (p = 0.37). There were two wound complications (5.13%), with one in each group. Both complications consisted of cellulitis without signs of deep infection and had complete resolution with intravenous antibiotics. A post hoc power analysis determined that a test population of 1,264 patients would be needed to show a reduction in wound drainage time by 1 day.
CONCLUSION: With the numbers available in this pilot study, we showed no benefit to the use of drains for acetabular surgery performed through a Kocher-Langenbeck approach."
20376499,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20376499/,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate whether the learning curve during laparoscopic colectomy is associated with increased costs compared with the procedure after the learning curve has been achieved.
METHODS: The direct costs for patients undergoing laparoscopic colectomy during the learning curve (group A) and after the attainment of proficiency by two colorectal surgeons performing the procedure (group B) between 2001 and 2007 were compared. The learning curve was defined as the first 40 laparoscopic colectomy cases for each surgeon. The distribution of cases for the surgeons ensured that cost-related differences were not influenced by lead time bias of cases performed during the learning curve.
RESULTS: The study involved 80 group A and 74 group B patients. Groups A and B were similar in terms of age (P = 0.7), gender (P = 0.5), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score (P = 0.5), body mass index (P = 0.3), diagnosis (P = 0.8), previous abdominal surgery (P = 0.07), and comorbidity (P = 0.4). The two groups also were similar with regard to performance of anastomosis (P = 0.2) or resection (P = 0.6), conversion to open surgery (P = 0.7), postoperative morbidity (P = 0.6), readmission (P = 0.1), reoperation rate (P = 0.6), and hospital length of stay (P = 0.6). The operation time was significantly longer for group A (P = 0.01). The total direct costs (P = 0.7) and the operating room (P = 0.6), nursing (P = 0.7), pharmacy (P = 0.9), radiology (P = 1), and professional (P = 0.051) costs were however similar between the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: As expected, laparoscopic colectomy during the learning curve period is associated with prolonged operating time. Concerns pertaining to increased conversions, complications, and direct costs during this period were not substantiated in this study."
20376592,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20376592/,"BACKGROUND: Physical activity can provide psychological benefits, but there is little research on psychologists' promoting activity as part of psychological treatment.
PURPOSE: This study assessed psychologists' attitudes to and frequency of providing activity advice and counseling.
METHOD: A mail questionnaire sent to 620 psychologists provided 236 responses (38%). Items assessed frequency of providing activity advice and counseling, confidence to provide activity advice and counseling, perceived efficacy of activity for managing physical and psychological conditions, acceptability of activity advice and counseling, knowledge of national activity guidelines, exposure to training in activity promotion, and practice and sociodemographic characteristics. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and multiple linear regression analyses.
RESULTS: Among respondents, 83% reported often recommending activity, 67% often provided activity advice, and 28% often did activity counseling. There was a high level of acceptability for physical activity promotion as part of psychological treatment. Over 80% of respondents were confident to provide general activity advice, discuss activity options, and problem solve barriers to activity, but less than half were confident to monitor activity levels or to tailor advice. Factors significantly associated with providing activity advice and counseling were: if the psychologist reported doing regular exercise, confidence to provide general activity advice, high acceptability, working in private practice, and clients presenting with general health and well-being issues (p < 0.05). Seventy-two percent of respondents were interested in attending a workshop on providing activity advice and counseling.
CONCLUSION: Many psychologists are willing and potentially able to promote physical activity as part of psychological treatment and would be likely to participate in relevant professional development."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey was used for the analysis. The study population included 5,938 subjects aged 20 year old drawn from non-diabetic participants in a health examination survey. The subjects were classified according to the presence of abdominal obesity based on waist circumference, IFG based on their fasting blood glucose level, and hypertriglyceridemia on their fasting triglyceride.
RESULTS: The multivariate-adjusted odds ratios for the occurrence of hypertriglyceridemia were 2.91 in the abdominal obesity group as compared with the nonobesity group and 1.31 in subjects with IFG compared with the normoglycemia controls. Abdominal obesity was found to be positively moderated in the interaction between waist circumference and fasting blood sugar.
CONCLUSION: The moderate effect between abdominal obesity and IFG contributes to the development of hypertriglyceridemia in Korea."
20377110,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20377110/,"BACKGROUND: Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by a deficiency of C1 esterase inhibitor (C1 INH) protein or function. Guidelines do not exist regarding diagnostic criteria or routine testing of family members of patients with HAE. Laboratory data for diagnosis include complement factor 4 level; C1 INH antigenic protein level, which is reduced in approximately 85% of patients with HAE; and C1 INH functional assay, which is considered an unreliable test in the United States secondary to inconsistent standardization of assays.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the shortcomings of diagnosing HAE and to determine whether family members of patients with HAE are being adequately screened.
METHODS: The top physician prescribers of danazol in the United States were screened via an Internet questionnaire focusing on the diagnosis and current management of HAE. To assess the patient perspective on HAE, affected individuals in the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and The Netherlands participated in the Web-based International Survey of Patient Experience of Hereditary Angioedema.
RESULTS: All 80 physicians who completed the survey were allergist or immunologists with a mean of 7 patients with C1 INH deficiency in their practices. Almost 84% of physician respondents used C1 INH level and function for diagnosis, and 63.8% used complement factor 4 levels. A total of 313 patients with HAE completed the survey. Respondents noted that only 48% of immediate family members and 26% of extended family members had been tested.
CONCLUSION: Guidelines could potentially alleviate delays in diagnosis and incorrect diagnoses and could lead to adequate screening of family members."
20377364,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20377364/,"PURPOSE: To investigate the potential of multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) as a tool for non-invasive temperature measurement.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Samples of water, 0.9% saline, sunflower oil and dilutions of (1:32, 1:64, 1:128) contrast agent (Iopromid 370, BayerSchering Pharma, Berlin) were heated in a plexiglass phantom. In a first set-up, samples of 0.9% saline solution were scanned at defined temperatures (25 degrees -75 degrees C; 5 degrees C intervals) using a clinical CT scanner. Scan parameters (tube current-time product, tube voltage, collimation, slice thickness) were systematically varied. In a second set-up samples of the different fluids (water, sunflower oil, contrast agent dilutions) were scanned using the following scan protocol: 250 mAs, 140 kV, 1.2 mm collimation, 9.6 mm slice thickness. CT numbers were measured in reconstructed axial images at the different temperatures. A regression analysis was performed to investigate the relationship between temperature and CT number.
RESULTS: Standard deviation of measured CT numbers decreased with increasing tube current-time product, increasing tube voltage, thicker collimation and higher slice thickness. Regression analysis showed an inverse relationship between temperature and CT number for all fluids with regression coefficients of -0.471 (0.9% saline), 0.447 (water), -0.679 (sunflower oil), -0.420 (contrast agent 1:32), -0.414 (contrast agent 1:64) and -0.441 (contrast agent 1:128), respectively.
CONCLUSION: Multi-slice computed tomography can depict thermal density expansion of different fluids. Based on these results the implementation of a temperature discrimination of several degrees C at a high spatial resolution is achievable."
20377431,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20377431/,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The injection of dextranomer/hyaluronic acid (DHA) has become an accepted treatment for children with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Complete ureteral duplication has been considered by some practitioners as counterindication for its use. We reviewed the Texas Children's Hospital (TCH) records for children with complete ureteral duplication who were treated with DHA for VUR.
METHODS: We searched medical records at TCH for patients with a preoperative diagnosis of complete ureteral duplication who had undergone DHA injection between January 1, 2001, and October 15, 2008. Operative notes, imaging studies, and clinic notes were reviewed.
RESULTS: In this period, 28 kidneys in 24 children were treated. The average grade of reflux before injection was 3.44 (range 1-5). First injection resolution of reflux was 57% with an increase to 73% after a second injection with an average volume of DHA of 1.05 mL. New contralateral VUR developed postinjection in three (15%) children with unilateral VUR. There were no perioperative complications. The average age of the children who were treated was 41.4 months. Mean follow-up was 45.94 months. Success of DHA injection tended to be higher in girls (65%) and older children.
CONCLUSIONS: High levels of success can be achieved with DHA injection in children with complete ureteral duplication. DHA injection is more likely to be successful for older girls with VUR and complete ureteral duplication. If initial injection does not result in VUR resolution, a second injection offers an opportunity for improved success. For physicians and families who are seeking an alternative to open surgical management, DHA represents an attractive option for selected children with complete ureteral duplication."
11191194,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11191194/,"OBJECTIVE: To introduce and encourage the use of generalised linear models (GLMs) in analysing caries data that do not require the response to be treated necessarily as a sample from a normal distribution.
BASIC RESEARCH DESIGN: At the present time, it is most likely that the sampling distribution of dmf/DMF in industrialised countries will not approximate normality. Generalised linear modelling can be conducted assuming many underlying distributions which, in fact, includes the normal distribution. In this paper three GLMs are employed (normal, Poisson, negative binomial) for modelling an example caries data set. In addition, a binomial model is used to model the dichotomous outcome of caries-free/caries-present.
CLINICAL SETTING: The data comprised 871 Old Trafford, Manchester primary school children aged between 4 years 0 months and 5 years 11 months.
RESULTS: The effect of one study covariate was prominent in a normal model applied to all available dmf data but not in two non-normal models which used dmf > 0 data only. Furthermore, the same covariate was significant at the 5% level in a binomial model indicating that it influenced whether or not caries was present and not the level of dmf.
CONCLUSION: A suitable modelling approach for caries data is to employ a Poisson or a negative binomial model for the dmf/DMF response and a binomial model for the caries-free/caries-present outcome. This allows separate estimation of those factors which influence the magnitude of caries and those factors which influence whether caries is actually present or not."
11191244,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11191244/,"OBJECTIVE: to determine whether the use of strategic and tactical compensation can successfully improve safety in older drivers.
METHODS: 84 healthy subjects aged between 65 and 96 were referred for a fitness-to-drive evaluation. Using ANOVA and contrast analysis, we tested the hypothesis that bad drivers who have had no car accidents use more active compensation strategies than bad drivers who have caused accidents in the previous 12 months. We classified drivers as bad, average or good, based on a structured road test.
RESULTS: drivers who select driving tasks below their capacities and compensate by adapting their driving style cause fewer accidents than those who do not apply these strategies.
CONCLUSIONS: fitness-to-drive screening procedures need a broader perspective to prevent an over-emphasis on procedures which focus more on deficit than on capacities."
11191936,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11191936/,"OBJECTIVES: A marked, sequential decline in coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality is established, but not its causes. Does it reflect modern treatment effects or a spinoff of primary prevention? The aim of this study was to explore this issue using a prospective cohort follow-up design.
DESIGN: In 1972-1975 and 1980-1982 Cohorts 1 (n = 613) and 2 (n = 667) of identical age (males, mean 56 years) were examined, and thereafter followed closely for 14 years. CHD risk- and treatment patterns, incidence of non-fatal myocardial infarctions (MIs) and total-, cardiovascular and CHD mortality rates were studied.
RESULTS: CHD risk factors were more favourable, medical treatment more aggressive and 14-years CHD mortality, as expected, lower in Cohort 2 (7.7%/4.8%, p = 0.032). However, hospital- and prospective ECG data revealed opposite trends in non-fatal cohort CHD incidence, and aggregated numbers of CHD deaths and non-fatal MI cases were 16.7%/16.0% in Cohort 1/2 (p = 0.90).
CONCLUSIONS: A marked, sequential reduction in CHD mortality was followed by a reciprocal increase in non-fatal MIs. This phenomenon may prevail in low CHD-endemic areas, and may call for altered primary preventive measures for reduction in total CHD incidence."
11192103,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11192103/,"OBJECTIVE: To establish cut off levels for oral glucose tolerance test in pregnancy using fetal hyperinsulinism as a clinical endpoint.
DESIGN: Capillary blood glucose levels at 0, 1, and 2 hours after the ingestion of either 1 g/kg or 75 g glucose, at 28 (SD 5) weeks of gestation were analysed in 220 women with elevated amniotic fluid insulin levels [> or =42 pmol/L (> or =7 microU/mL)] after a mean (SD) of 31 weeks (3) and in 220 nondiabetic controls.
RESULTS: In women with elevated amniotic fluid insulin levels the mean (SD) capillary blood glucose values at 0, 1, and 2 hours were 5.2 mmol/L (1.0) [94 mg/dL (18)], 10.5 mmol/L (1.4) [189 mg/dL (25)] and 8.2 mmol/L (2.0) [147 mg/dL (36)], respectively. The one-hour value had the highest sensitivity to predict elevated amniotic fluid insulin levels. The 5th centile of the one-hour blood glucose levels representing a detection rate of 95% was 8.9 mmol/L (160 mg/dL).
CONCLUSION: Glucose cut off levels in most established oral glucose tolerance test criteria are too high, to accurately predict amniotic fluid hyperinsulinism. A one-hour test may be sufficient for detecting amniotic fluid hyperinsulinism. Since different loads (1 g/kg, 75 g or 100 g) and blood fractions (venous plasma or capillary blood) have minimal impact on oral glucose tolerance test results, a single one-hour cut off of 8.9 mmol/L (160 mg/dL), independent of the sampling method, may be appropriate for the diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus severe enough to cause amniotic fluid hyperinsulinism."
11192277,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11192277/,"BACKGROUND: A survey of students in three UK higher education establishments was undertaken to obtain information about students' physical and emotional well-being, their attitudes to, and beliefs about health, and the prevalence of risk factors for future ill health.
METHODS: Health was measured by the prevalence of longstanding illness and by the SF-36 health status measurement tool. Survey results were compared with equivalent data for 18- to 34-year-olds in the local population. The prevalence of long-standing illness was also compared with two national surveys.
RESULTS: The survey achieved a 49 per cent response rate. More than one-third of respondents reported a long-standing illness, a higher prevalence than in all comparison surveys. Students scored significantly worse than their peers in the local population on all eight SF-36 dimensions. The greatest difference was for role limitations as a result of emotional problems. The main sources of emotional distress were study or work problems and money.
CONCLUSION: The poor response rate in this survey dictates the need for caution in interpretation of the results. However, they suggest that the health of students is poor relative to that of their peers, and that their emotional health is more of a problem than their physical health. Public health practitioners might want to pay more attention to the health of this important and relatively neglected group. Worries about studies and money appear to be affecting students' academic work, and this should be of concern to higher education establishments."

Therefore, it is important to develop screening tests for detecting patients that need an intestinal biopsy. The aim of the present study was to investigate the value of plasma zinc levels for the diagnosis of monosymptomatic CD in short-statured children.
METHODS: Fourty-nine children with a short stature and 34 healthy controls were investigated. Plasma zinc levels were assayed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry in short-statured children and controls. All patients with short stature underwent endoscopic small intestinal biopsy.
RESULTS: Duodenal mucosal histopathology was normal in 25 children. Low plasma zinc values were observed in 54.2% of patients with CD, 32.0% of patients with idiopathic short stature and 14.8% of controls. The mean values of plasma zinc levels were not significantly different among the three groups. Sensitivity, specificity and the positive and negative predictive values for plasma zinc were 45.8, 76.0, 64.7 and 59.4%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that zinc deficiency is an important problem in CD children with short stature; however, plasma zinc levels are not useful as a screening test for selecting patients for jejunal biopsy."

STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in patients who underwent curative D1 or D2 resection for operable gastric carcinoma. Survival and multivariate prognostic factor analyses were carried out to determine whether dissection type was significant for outcomes, and which subgroup of patients would benefit from D2 dissection.
RESULTS: Three hundred one patients who had potentially curative treatment were eligible to enter the trial. Although mortality rates were 3.1% in the D1 group and 4.3% in the D2 group (p = NS), morbidity rates in the D1 and D2 groups were 6.2% and 27.9%, respectively (p<0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that lymph node dissection type, Borrmann type of tumor, number of metastatic lymph nodes, and depth of wall invasion were the most important independent prognosticators. Five-year disease-free and overall survival rates were 19% and 36% in D1, and 49% and 54% in D2, respectively (p<0.05). After stratifying for pT and pN, the significant survival advantage with D2 was observed in subgroups of pT2, pT3 and pN1, pN2. The subset analysis showed a significant prognostic benefit with D2 dissection in patients in stages II and III-A.
CONCLUSIONS: D2 dissections can be carried out with low mortality rates, but they have high morbidity rates and a survival advantage over D1 dissection of only 18%. In principle, a survival benefit with D2 is obtained especially when the tumor invades muscularis propria, penetrates serosa without invasion of adjacent structures, or metastasizes to fewer than fifteen regional lymph nodes. Data in this homogeneous population support the use of extended lymphadenectomy for selected group of patients with gastric carcinoma."
11194762,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11194762/,"AIM: To analyse the relationship between residential segregation and smoking and quit rates in Christchurch.
METHOD: The study used a nested research design, which examines the extent to which variations in adult smoking rates at the meshblock level are, when holding socio-economic status constant, also influenced by the socio-economic profile of the census area units or wider communities within which they are located.
RESULTS: Smoking and quit rates are not only related to levels of local neighbourhood (meshblock) deprivation, but also depend to a large extent on whether such neighbourhoods are located in socially segregated or more socially mixed parts of the city. The findings provide added support for the independent influence of contextual effects on smoking behaviour.
CONCLUSION: The results suggest that attempts to further reduce smoking should target places as well as people."
11194814,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11194814/,"PURPOSE: To determine whether embolization of endoleaks after endovascular repair of aortic aneurysms is associated with a decrease in the diameter of the aneurysm.
METHODS: Fifteen patients (13 men; median age 76 years) demonstrated primary endoleaks persisting > or =3 months after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair with a variety of commercial endografts. In 8 patients, coil embolization failed to completely obliterate the leak, whereas embolotherapy proved successful in the remaining 7 patients. Surveillance of endoleaks and the effect of their embolization on aneurysm size were followed with serial computed tomographic (CT) scans. Follow-up after embolization extended for at least 12 months.
RESULTS: Patients with persistent leak exhibited a slight increase in mean aneurysm area from 21.41+/-4.25 to 22.47+/-6.70 cm2. Medians differed from 20.03 (range 16.59-28.73) to 23.03 (range 14.14-33.69) cm2 (p = 0.0078, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.0075 to 0.0081). Successfully treated patients, however, showed a mean decrease from 20.58+/-3.63 (median 19.87) to 16.36+/-6.46 cm2 (median 18.10) at 1 year (p = 0.0156, 95% CI = 0.0151 to 0.0160). The medians differed significantly between groups (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Persistent endoleaks after endovascular aortic aneurysm treatment led to an increase in the diameter of the aneurysm, whereas complete occlusion was associated with a significant decrease in aneurysm diameter."
11194818,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11194818/,"PURPOSE: To evaluate placement of polyester (Dacron) coverings on nitinol stents implanted in the canine aorta to determine the effect on cross-sectional lumen area, development of intimal hyperplasia, device endothelialization, and flow hemodynamics.
METHODS: Ten polyester-covered and 10 uncovered nitinol stents (60-mm length, 10- or 12-mm diameter) were deployed percutaneously in the normal infrarenal aorta of 20 adult mongrel dogs using random assignment. Angiography, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), and duplex ultrasound performed at device deployment and before explantation at 6 weeks were used to measure aorta/device diameter and cross-sectional area. Pressure-perfusion-fixed aortic segments were compared for surface endothelialization (CD31 staining) and for thickness of neointimal formation.
RESULTS: All 20 endoluminal devices were accurately positioned in the infrarenal aorta without early or delayed evidence of device thrombosis, significant lumen narrowing, or device deformity. IVUS and duplex scanning identified no anatomical stenosis in either the covered or the bare devices by duplex ultrasound; peak systolic velocity measurements were similar (106+/-25 cm/s in the covered stent versus 96+/-25 cm/s for bare stents, p > 0.05). Mean neointimal thickness was significantly greater (p < 0.005) in the covered (326+/-145 microm) compared with the bare (219+/-62 microm) stents. Intima-to-media height ratios were greater in the covered stents (3.0+/-1.1 compared with 1.1+/-0.2, p < 0.003). Mean surface area endothelialization in the proximal, middle, and distal sections of each device was similar (p > 0.05) in covered (59%, 56%, and 69%) and bare (59%, 65%, and 53%) stents.
CONCLUSIONS: Deployment and balloon dilation of a covered nitinol stent in a nondiseased canine aorta increased neointimal development compared with an uncovered stent, but overall lumen cross-sectional area was preserved. No differences in device patency, intradevice thrombus formation, flow hemodynamics, or luminal endothelialization were demonstrated, despite a thicker intradevice neointima induced by the polyester covering."
11194821,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11194821/,"PURPOSE: To examine whether complete aneurysm exclusion is a reliable marker for successful long-term endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair.
METHODS: The medical records, computed tomographic (CT) scans, and duplex examinations of all the patients who underwent endovascular AAA repair at a single institution and had at least 12 months of follow-up were reviewed. Sixty-seven patients (58 men; mean age 74 years, range 57-87) were identified. Complete aneurysm exclusion was defined by the absence of an endoleak at any time before an adverse event. The primary endpoint included all major adverse events that occurred during the postoperative period, including aneurysm expansion, acute symptoms referable to the AAA, late secondary procedures, ruptures, and deaths from ruptures and all other causes.
RESULTS: There were 44 adverse events (8 expanding aneurysms, 4 acute symptoms, 17 secondary procedures, and 15 deaths from other causes) in 28 (42%) patients. Among 36 (54%) patients who had initial complete aneurysm exclusion (no endoleak), 12 (33%) experienced adverse events, compared with 16 (52%) events in 31 patients who had endoleak (chi2 = 1.59, p = 0.21).
CONCLUSIONS: There was no statistically significant difference in adverse events based on the presence or absence of endoleak. Complete aneurysm exclusion as defined by absence of an endoleak does not indicate an event-free postoperative course. A better marker of clinical success of endovascular AAA repair is needed."
11195314,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11195314/,"OBJECTIVES: When evaluating patients for spondyloarthropathy, clinicians use the 'possible spondyloarthropathy' category to indicate that they are unsure about the diagnosis. We sought to determine whether Amor's criteria or the European Spondyloarthropathy Study Group (ESSG) criteria could lift thi uncertainty.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: During a Spanish study designed to validate criteria for spondyloar thropathies, 102 patients were classified in the 'possible spondyloarthropathy' category. We divided these patients into subgroups based on whether or not they met criteria for spondyloarthropathy. We compare baseline characteristics (N = 102) and five-year outcomes (N = 52) in these subgroups.
RESULTS: The following features were significantly more common in the subgroups of patients who met Amor's criteria for spondyloarthropathy: oligoarthritis, heel pain, uveitis, balanitis, family history of spondyloarthropathy, an presence of the HLA B27 antigen. No differences were found for age at symptom onset, disease duration, buttock pain, gender, dactylitis, diarrhea, or psoriasis. Of the 52 patients followed up for five years, 17 me Amor's criteria at baseline and 13 were subsequently found to have definite spondyloarthropathy, whic was undifferentiated in six cases. There were only three cases of spondyloarthropathy among the 2 patients who did not meet Amor's criteria at baseline. Of the 28 patients who met ESSG criteria at baseline, 13 had spondyloarthropathy versus three of the 17 patients who did not meet ESSG criteria at baseline
CONCLUSION: Amor's criteria or the ESSG criteria allow early classification of most patients with 'possible spondyloarthropathy' and early identification of undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy corresponding to minimal-symptom or incipient disease. In this study, Amor's criteria performed better than the ESSG criteria."
11195476,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11195476/,"BACKGROUND: The Family APGAR has been widely used to study the relationship of family function and health problems in family practice offices.
METHODS: Data were collected from 401 pediatricians and family physicians from the Pediatric Research in Office Settings network and the Ambulatory Sentinel Practice Network. The physicians enrolled 22,059 consecutive office visits by children aged 4 to 15 years. Parents completed a survey that included the Family APGAR and the Pediatric Symptom Checklist. Clinicians completed a survey that described child psychosocial problems, treatments initiated or continued, and specialty care referrals.
RESULTS: Family dysfunction on the index visit often differed from dysfunction at follow-up (kappa=0.24). Only 31% of the families with positive Family APGAR scores at baseline were positive at follow-up, and only 43% of those with positive scores at follow-up had a positive score at the initial visit. There were many disagreements between the Family APGAR and the clinician. The Family APGAR was negative for 73% of clinician-identified dysfunctional families, and clinicians did not identify dysfunction for 83% of Family APGAR-identified dysfunctions (kappa=0.06).
CONCLUSIONS: Our data do not support the use of the Family APGAR as a measure of family dysfunction in the primary care setting. Future research should clarify what it does measure."
11195602,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11195602/,"BACKGROUND: Most studies concerning exercise electrocardiography (ECG) testing after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) were carried out in the prethrombolytic era. ST-segment elevation in the infarction area during exercise has usually been interpreted as indicating the presence of dyskinesia as a result of extensive left ventricle damage.
HYPOTHESIS: This study was undertaken to evaluate the contributions of exercise-induced ST-segment elevation and T-wave pseudonormalization to the assessment of myocardial viability in patients with thrombolyzed myocardial infarction (MI), compared with low-dose dobutamine echocardiography.
METHODS: The study comprised 52 consecutive patients with AMI treated with thrombolysis. All patients underwent low-dose dobutamine echocardiography and symptom-limited exercise testing before discharge.
RESULTS: Nineteen patients showed ST-segment elevation (Group 1), 9 showed isolated T-wave pseudonormalization (Group 2), and 24 patients did not exhibit either of these ST-T segment changes (Group 3). Low-dose dobutamine echocardiography revealed evidence of viability in 16 patients (84%) in Group I (p = 0.01), 5 (56%) in Group 2 (p = NS), and 11 patients (46%) in Group 3 (p = NS).
CONCLUSION: Exercise-induced ST-segment elevation may contribute to the evaluation of myocardial viability in patients with AMI treated with thrombolysis. However, in the absence of exercise-induced ST-segment elevation, further noninvasive studies might be indicated to assess myocardial viability."
11195603,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11195603/,"BACKGROUND: There is no clear consensus as to the correct screening procedure to identify patients undergoing cardiac surgery and who are at greatest risk of stroke because of the presence of significant carotid artery stenosis. Such screening is important because some patients benefit from combined carotid and cardiac surgery and, regardless of this, the information gained puts the cardiac surgeon in a position to provide an accurate assessment of surgical risk. Our objective was to examine current clinical practice of carotid artery investigation prior to urgent cardiac surgery and to review this illustrative practice in the context of the world literature.
HYPOTHESIS: The study aimed to establish that current typical practice for screening cardiac surgical patients for carotid artery disease is illogical according to the evidence in the world literature.
METHODS: The study consisted of a retrospective assessment of all patients undergoing urgent cardiac surgery and a Medline-derived literature review, and included all patients undergoing urgent cardiac surgery at a tertiary cardiothoracic center between January 1 and December 31, 1997.
RESULTS: Of 529 patients undergoing urgent cardiac surgery, 44 (8%) were screened preoperatively by duplex Doppler ultrasonography for carotid disease. The indications for screening were asymptomatic carotid bruit in 24 patients, history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) in 12 patients, and neither stroke, TIA, or bruit in 7 patients. The tests were requested either by the attending cardiologists or by the cardiac surgeon to whom they were referred. One patient had already been diagnosed as having carotid artery disease in the past. Thirteen patients underwent additional carotid investigations. Eleven patients were demonstrated to have internal carotid artery stenosis > or = 60% and 3 patients underwent combined cardiac and carotid surgery. Review of the literature revealed the following groups to be at increased risk of future stroke unrelated to surgery, and of postoperative stroke: those with a history of stroke or TIA, those with carotid bruits, and, of importance, all patients with significant carotid stenosis. Recent data suggest that symptomatic patients and the elderly are at greatest risk.
CONCLUSIONS: Only 8% of patients undergoing urgent cardiac surgery in a 1-year period were screened for carotid artery disease. We suggest that screening should definitely be performed in all patients with a history of stroke or TIA, all patients with a bruit, and all patients aged > 65 years. The literature suggests, however, that significant reductions in stroke rate could be achieved by screening the whole cardiac surgical population, although there is a paucity of data that are specifically pertinent to this patient subgroup. Further data are therefore required for the construction of a scientifically valid and medicolegally sound policy."
11195607,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11195607/,"BACKGROUND: Calcific aortic stenosis may have common etiological factors with atherosclerosis.
HYPOTHESIS: In this retrospective, case-control study, we aimed to determine whether there is an association between hypercholesterolemia and calcific aortic valve stenosis.
METHODS: Consecutive patients undergoing single aortic or mitral valve replacement in a regional cardiothoracic surgical center were reviewed and preoperative patient characteristics were recorded: demographics, comorbidity (including coronary artery disease and associated risk factors), serum total cholesterol, lipid-lowering therapy, and serum creatinine.
RESULTS: Serum total cholesterol concentrations were significantly higher in patients with calcific aortic stenosis than in controls (6.2+/-1.1 vs. 5.3+/-1.1 mmol/l; p < 0.001). The significant difference in serum cholesterol concentrations remained following correction for gender and body mass index (p = 0.02) and when patients with coronary artery disease were excluded (6.3+/-1.1 vs. 5.3+/-1.4 mmol/l; p<0.001). Subgroup analysis demonstrated that the association between elevated serum cholesterol concentrations and calcific aortic stenosis was particularly strong in patients with tricuspid aortic valves (6.4+/-1.2 vs. 5.3+/-1.1 mmol/l; p < 0.001) compared with those with bicuspid valves (5.9+/-1.1 vs. 5.3+/-1.1 mmol/l; p = 0.06).
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that hypercholesterolemia is associated with calcific aortic stenosis and may be implicated in its pathogenesis and progression. We believe that there is now a need for a randomized, controlled trial of cholesterol-lowering therapy in patients with calcific aortic stenosis."
11196559,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11196559/,"INTRODUCTION: Little information is available on the relationship between the mode of induction of ventricular fibrillation (VF) to VF characteristics.
METHODS AND RESULTS: VF was induced from the anterior left ventricle by programmed electrical stimulation, burst pacing, alternating current (AC), high current S2 at a site remote from S1, T wave shock, and intersecting wavefronts in seven normal dogs and seven dogs with chronic myocardial infarction. Using two electrode arrays, 112 electrograms were recorded from the anterior and lateral wall. Cycle lengths were analyzed and activation vectors were created by summing orthogonally recorded bipolar electrograms. The magnitude of the vector loops was integrated over time to produce an ""ensemble vector"" index (EVI) whose magnitude is high when beat-to-beat activation direction is consistent and low when activation direction is variable. T wave shock-induced VF had a significantly longer cycle length 1 to 5 seconds after VF onset than other modes of induction (P < 0.05). The frequency-corrected EVI was significantly larger for AC current and T wave shock-induced VF as opposed to all other modes of VF induction in early VF (P < 0.0001). After 10 seconds of VF, these differences persisted only on the anterior wall.
CONCLUSION: VF induced in animals by T wave shock and AC current had different characteristics than VF induced by other methods. These findings may have implications for our understanding of VF pathophysiology."
11198340,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11198340/,"OBJECTIVE: Epidemiological studies and interventions to reduce inequalities in community health require the assignation of exhaustive and easy-to-obtain social indicators. Occupation and education are two of the most often used. In this study we attempt to evaluate the association between education and occupation among adult working population because if, in the absence of one of these two variables, it will be feasible to use the remaining with the lesser lost of socio-economic information.
DESIGN: From a representative sample (n = 3091) of general population (18-65 years old) drawn out from a prevalence survey on chronic disease risk factors performed in the Region of Murcia, a log-lineal analysis has been made between education and occupation among working people (65.8% of males and 34.2% of females from the original sample).
RESULTS: Men present significant association between managerial positions and university education. The association drops between clerks and high school graduates to increase among all manual workers with or without primary schooling education. Among women--with a lesser number of participants--the education/occupation association describes the same pattern but with higher magnitudes in the positive associations between managerial positions and university education. For both genders, the greatest associations are found in both diagonals of the education by occupation tables indicating: better occupation, more education, and the opposite.
CONCLUSIONS: The classification of working people according to education and occupation presents association, internal consistency and gradient. In absence of comprehensive information regarding occupation, education could be an alternative as socio-economic indicator."
11198784,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11198784/,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the benefit of a dietary fiber preparation (Fibernat) in patients with chronic ischemic heart disease (IHD).
METHODS: From January 1997 to March 1998, 114 consecutive patients with chronic IHD were enrolled in this prospective double blind randomized placebo controlled trial. The fiber (F) and placebo (P) groups were comparable at baseline. All patients were given advice regarding dietary and lifestyle modifications. Concomitant drug therapy was not altered. The drug (consisting of soluble and insoluble fibers obtained from fenugreek, guar gum and wheat bran) and placebo were administered for six months (10 grams twice daily).
RESULTS: The following parameters improved in both groups: HDL cholesterol (32 to 39 mg/dl, p < 0.0009 in F and 33 to 38, p < 0.007 in P), total: HDL cholesterol ratio (6.7 to 5.6, p < 0.0007 in F and from 7.0 to 6.0, p < 0.01 in P) and weight (64.0 to 63.0 kg, p < 0.002 in F and 60.3 to 59.5, p < 0.002 in P). The Apolipoprotein B increased (101 to 129 mg/dl, p < 0.00001 in F and 98 to 127, p < 0.0008 in P). The following parameters improved only in group F: LDL cholesterol (146 to 134, p < 0.027), Apolipoprotein A-1 (105 to 139, p < 0.001), body mass index (24.9 to 24.5, p < 0.03) and waist circumference (37.2 to 36.7, p < 0.03). Total cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, triglycerides, hip circumference, W:H ratio, exercise time and blood sugar were unchanged in both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Fibernat is well tolerated, safe and had favorable effects on LDL cholesterol, Apolipoprotein A-1, body mass index and waist circumference."
11199203,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11199203/,"PURPOSE: The introduction of public access to defibrillation via automated external defibrillators makes it possible to reduce the incidence of sudden cardiac arrest cases. Since they may expect civil and criminal liability after negligence causing damage, many German potential First Responders might hesitate to use an AED.
METHODS: After we demonstrate the medical reasons and compare the legal situation of Public Access Defibrillation between the USA and Germany we analyse a possible hesitation of German First Responders.
RESULTS: More than 30 states of the USA provide immunity from civil liability after a public access defibrillation followed by damage due to negligence. However, only an AED-trained US-First Responder is granted immunity from civil liability. In Germany there is no immunity from civil and criminal liability in case of public access defibrillation with damage caused by negligence.
CONCLUSION: German law will not decrease any possible hesitation by First Responders. For a successful system of public access defibrillation, revision of the legal situation is mandatory."

METHODS: Four hundred ninety six home, hospital, and hospice nurses participated in a one-day workshop or two half-day workshops on cancer pain assessment and management. Of these, 116 were randomized to participate in a bedside-precepted visit with an oncology nurse specialist with pain specialization and a focus group to discuss attitudinal issues. Eighty-six nurses served as controls. Pre-, post- and one-year follow-up tests were administered.
RESULTS: Attitudes, knowledge, and application skills significantly improved for workshop-only and enriched-model nurses relative to controls.
CONCLUSION: For postgraduate nurses, daylong cancer pain education workshops were, in the group studied, as effective as hands-on experience in improving cancer pain knowledge and changing attitudes. Both the workshop-only and the enriched-model nurses relative to controls had significantly improved knowledge and changed attitudes towards optimal pain management."
11199413,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11199413/,"UNLABELLED: PURPOSE/METHODS/PATIENTS: This work retrospectively analysed 252 synovectomies performed on 153 patients from 1958 to 1995 at the Balgrist University Orthopaedics Clinic, and evaluated the short-term and long-term benefits of open synovectomy of the metacarpo-phalangeal joint in rheumatoid arthritis.
RESULTS: Rheumatoid arthritis (n = 182) was by far the most common of the 21 different diagnoses involved, and the metacarpo-phalangeal joint (n = 101) was by far the most frequently operated of the 7 different joint types in question. In the short tenn (n = 97), after a mean of 5.5 months, open synovectomy of a metacarpo-phalangeal joint in rheumatoid arthritis patients provided a benefit in terms of mobility in 85% of cases and in terms of joint swelling and pain in 93% of cases. Among one-third of the originally operated cases (n = 38), long-term benefit, i.e. after a mean of 6.9 years, was obtained in 89% of cases with regard to joint mobility, 87% with regard to swelling and 97% with regard to pain relief. Two-thirds of the joints presented normal mobility and swelling, and three-quarters were pain-free.
CONCLUSIONS: The metacarpo-phalangeal joint is very important for maintaining the independence of a patient (gripping). Open synovectomy of the metacarpo-phalangeal joint in rheumatoid arthritis patients is an effective therapeutic procedure with little morbidity and very good long-term benefit in the management of metacarpo-phalangeal pain, swelling and stiffness refractory to conservative therapy."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: In 25 patients 398 ultrasound images of the abdomen were evaluated in a prospective, double blind study. 49% of the images were obtained with THI sonography, 51% with conventional sonography, respectively. Image parameter, anatomical region and image plane were kept constant by using a switchable ultrasound probe. Image contrast, delineation of organs, detection of vessels and artifacts in cystic structures were evaluated by four radiologists using a 3-grade scale. The interobserver variability was determined.
RESULTS: The results of all groups showed statistically significant improvement compared to conventional sonography. High agreement of the evaluaters was achieved for image contrast and delineation of organs, less agreement in detection of vessels and artifacts in cystic structures, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Image contrast and delineation of organs to neighboring structures as well as reduction of artifacts in cystic structures and vessels are statistically significantly improved with THI sonography using pulse-inversion technology in comparison to conventional sonography."
11200949,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11200949/,"BACKGROUND: Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) patients often complain that physical exertion produces an increase of complaints, leading to a greater need for rest and more time spent in bed. It has been suggested that this is due to a bad physical fitness and that physical deconditioning is a perpetuating factor in CFS. Until now, studies on physical deconditioning in CFS have shown inconsistent results.
METHODS: Twenty CFS patients and 20 matched neighbourhood controls performed a maximal exercise test with incremental load. Heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory tidal volume, O2 saturation, O2 consumption, CO2 production, and blood-gas values of arterialized capillary blood were measured. Physical fitness was quantified as the difference between the actual and predicted ratios of maximal workload versus increase of heart rate. Fatigue, impairment and physical activity were assessed to study its relationship with physical fitness.
RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in physical fitness between CFS patients and their controls. Nine CFS patients had a better fitness than their control. A negative relationship between physical fitness and fatigue was found in both groups. For CFS patients a negative correlation between fitness and impairment and a positive correlation between fitness and physical activity was found as well. Finally, it was found that more CFS patients than controls did not achieve a physiological limitation at maximal exercise.
CONCLUSIONS: Physical deconditioning does not seem a perpetuating factor in CFS."
11201596,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11201596/,"BACKGROUND: Venous prostheses have poor long-term patency; to improve this situation, experimental studies have been carried out.
METHODS: Methods of endothelial cell harvesting, prosthetic seeding and implantation mainly in the inferior vena cava were studied in 127 dogs. Evaluations were conducted by angiography, gross appearance, light, scanning and transmission electron microscopic observations, histo-fluorescent staining, as well as radioimmunoassay.
RESULTS: It was found that at five to ten days following implantation, the prosthetic endothelialisation could be reliably achieved in the seeded group and a 100% patency of the seeded inferior vena caval prostheses was attained at 100 days. The thickness of the neointima in the seeded group at 10 and 100 days was 299 microm and 302 microm, respectively. The metabolite of PGI2 from extrinsic arachidonic acid, 6-keto PGF1a, produced by cells from seeded graft was significantly higher than that from spontaneously formed cells and the reverse found with thromboxane B2. A temporary (one week) distal (femoral) arteriovenous fistula enhanced graft patency. These results indicated that the early endothelialisation of grafts by seeding enhanced the patency and inhibited intimal hyperplasia of venous prostheses. The clinical outcome was impressively improved from our previous experience with ten of eleven venous grafts patent over a follow-up period of six to nine years. These might result from the realization of early endothelialisation and its cells derived from seeding being able to produce significantly more PGI2 and less thromboxane B2.
CONCLUSIONS: The endothelial cell seeding technique may bring us much closer to an ideal venous prosthesis."
11202582,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11202582/,"OBJECTIVE: To study opportunistic screening in primary care, in such a way that would include teenage women. Setting-Screening for chlamydia infection was offered opportunistically in eight general practices in Edinburgh to women aged < or = 35 years attending for cervical smear, and women aged < or = 20 years attending for contraception. The numbers of women eligible to be offered screening were 901 in the cervical smear group, and 595 in the contraception group.
RESULTS: Effective screening rate (offered test, consented, and urine sample returned) was 30% for the cervical smear group compared with 23% for the contraception group. Among those tested, chlamydia prevalence was strongly associated with young age, ranging from 11.8% in those <18 years, to 0% in those >25 years. Number of sexual partners in past year did not improve prediction of infection.
CONCLUSION: These findings raise concerns regarding the feasibility of opportunistic screening in general practice, particularly for those with highest prevalence of chlamydia--teenage women."

DESIGN: A population based cross sectional survey.
SETTING: A general practice with a broad mix of socioeconomic groups in one district health authority.
SUBJECTS: A total of 1600 subjects aged 25-69 years stratified using the social deprivation score of wards were randomly selected from a population of 8000; 77% (1227) returned the questionnaire and 56% (896) attended for screening.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Questionnaire measures of confidence in own ability to self assess risk factors for melanoma, attitudes to seeking medical help for skin abnormalities, and self assessment of relative risk of developing melanoma.
RESULTS: Clinic attenders were less confident in their ability to self assess risk factors (p<0.005), more favourable towards seeking help (p<0.001), and more pessimistic about developing melanoma (p<0.001) than non-attenders. Those from more affluent wards were more willing to seek help (p<0.001). Those clinically assessed as at higher risk were more pessimistic about developing melanoma (p<0.001) but clinical assessments were inconsistently related to help seeking attitudes and self assessment confidence.
CONCLUSIONS: Barriers to the uptake of screening included greater optimism about not developing melanoma, confidence in self assessment, and reluctance to seek professional help. Such reluctance was greater in more deprived social groups. Targeting screening at high risk groups cannot depend on self identification and self referral."
11203744,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11203744/,"AIMS: To test the hypothesis that the ovarian cycle influences the pressure-pain threshold of the masticatory muscles.
METHODS: Eighteen healthy women with a regular menstrual cycle (28 +/- 2 days), ranging in age from 18 to 35 years, participated in the study. For each subject, pressure-pain thresholds (PPTs) of the masseter and temporalis muscles were assessed at 4 muscular sites by means of an electronic algometer. Measurements were taken at 4 separate sessions across the menstrual cycle corresponding to the following phases: menstrual, follicular, periovulatory, and luteal. Menstrual cycle phases were determined by a pelvic ultrasonographic screening. The study was carried out in a single-blind design, and the initial session was randomly determined for each individual. Data collected were analyzed by repeated-measures analysis of variance.
RESULTS: The findings suggest that the PPTs of several masticatory muscles (2 of 4) are influenced by the ovarian cycle, but to a minor extent (P < 0.05), and the influence is of limited clinical relevance.
CONCLUSION: In healthy subjects, there is a link between mechanical sensitivity of the masticatory muscles and fluctuation of the ovarian hormones. The relationship between PPTs of the masticatory muscles and the ovarian cycle should be also investigated in patients with temporomandibular disorders and/or orofacial pain conditions."
11204804,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11204804/,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Helicobacter pylori colonizes the gastric mucous gel layer, the surface epithelium and glands. It has been shown that H. pylori infection causes aberrant expression of gastric mucins MUC 5 and MUC 6. This study aimed to determine the distribution of MUC 5 and MUC 6 in the gastric antrum of dyspeptic patients, and to investigate changes in this pattern in the presence of H. pylori and after successful eradication.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Gastric antrum biopsy specimens were examined by immunohistochemistry for mucin gene (MUC 5 and MUC 6) expression. Polyclonal antibodies were used to detect amino acid tandem repeats of each protein. A scoring system (0-3) was used to assess staining intensity at three sites: foveola, mucous neck cells and glands. H. pylori status was determined by histology and rapid urease test, and considered positive or negative when both tests were positive or negative, respectively. The study included 49 patients positive for H. pylori, in 36 of whom successful eradication was performed, and 11 H. pylori-negative patients.
RESULTS: There was a gradient of MUC 5 expression, higher to lower, from the surface to the glands, which was more pronounced before eradication. Increased MUC 5 synthesis in the mucous neck cells and in the glands was found after H. pylori eradication (P = 0.016). MUC 6 was synthesized in the glands more than in the mucous neck cells or foveola. MUC 6 was also secreted into the lumen and probably comprised the superficial part of the unstirred mucous layer.
CONCLUSION: The change in MUC 5 synthesis may reflect H. pylori colonization."
11205736,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11205736/,"PURPOSE: After its removal from the skin surface, chemical remaining within the skin can become systemically available. The fraction of chemical in the skin that eventually enters the body depends on the relative rates of percutaneous transport and epidermal turnover (i.e., stratum corneum desquamation). Indeed, some investigators have claimed that desquamation is an efficient mechanism for eliminating dermally absorbed chemical from the skin.
METHODS: The fate of chemical within the skin following chemical contact was examined using a mathematical model representing turnover of and absorption into the stratum corneum and viable epidermis. The effects of turnover rate, exposure duration, penetrant lipophilicity, and lag time for chemical diffusion were explored.
RESULTS: These calculations show that significant amounts of chemical can be removed from skin by desquamation if epidermal turnover is fast relative to chemical diffusion through the stratum corneum. However, except for highly lipophilic and/or high molecular weight (>350 Da) chemicals, the normal epidermal turnover rate is not fast enough and most of the chemical in the skin at the end of an exposure will enter the body.
CONCLUSIONS: Epidermal turnover can significantly reduce subsequent chemical absorption into the systemic circulation only for highly lipophilic or high molecular weight chemicals."
11205860,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11205860/,"BACKGROUND: Orthopaedic surgery is a male-dominated field. As of 1998, women accounted for 42% of medical school graduates, yet only 6.9% of the total number of orthopaedic residents were female. The purpose of our study was to determine whether the Electronic Residency Application Service charts of female candidates for orthopaedic residencies are ranked lower by faculty reviewers than are those of male candidates with similar qualifications.
METHODS: After we obtained permission from the applicants, the Electronic Residency Application Service applications submitted by ninety male and ten female candidates for admission to a university orthopaedic residency program for the 1998 National Residency Matching Program were randomly divided into ten groups, consisting of the charts of nine male candidates and one female candidate. Each chart from a female candidate was altered into a ""male"" version, in which all names and personal pronouns were changed but which was otherwise identical to the original female version. Therefore, each group of ten charts existed as a paired set: one containing the true female chart and one, the altered ""male"" chart. The paired sets acted as their own control. One hundred and twenty-one faculty reviewers from fourteen orthopaedic residency programs around the United States each reviewed either the ""male"" or the female version of one set, without knowledge of the goals of the study, and ranked the ten charts in the order in which they would like to have the candidates as residents in their own programs. Each version of the sets was reviewed by at least five separate reviewers. Reviewers at a given institution were randomized to review different sets, so that there was no overlap among them. The rankings of the female-""male"" pairs were compared with use of a standard paired t test.
RESULTS: No significant difference was detected in the rankings of the female and ""male"" charts (p = 0.5). The mean difference in rankings was -0.33, with a 95% confidence interval ranging from -1.41 (favoring females) to 0.74 (favoring ""males"").
CONCLUSIONS: The low percentage of female residents is not due to bias against female applicants in the initial chart-review phase of the orthopaedic residency selection process. It is possible that bias is introduced in other stages of the selection process, such as the interview."
11207224,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11207224/,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the number and volume of red blood cell transfusions (RBCTs) in very and extremely low birthweight infants under restrictive red blood cell transfusion guidelines without erythropoietin administration, and to compare the results with those reported in similar infants receiving erythropoietin.
METHODS: From April 1996 to June 1999, all RBCTs given to infants with a birth weight of less than 1500 g were prospectively recorded. Data on RBCT combined with erythropoietin treatment and RBCT guidelines were extracted from four prospective randomised trials of erythropoietin for anaemia of prematurity.
RESULTS: When the restrictive RBCT guidelines were followed, the number of RBCTs and volume transfused were similar to those reported during erythropoietin administration.
CONCLUSIONS: RBCT guidelines may have a similar impact on RBCT in very low birthweight infants to the administration of erythropoietin. The effect of RBCT guidelines on RBCT frequency should be considered when evaluating the efficacy of erythropoietin administration to preterm infants."
11207463,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11207463/,"BACKGROUND: The aetiology of transient lumbar pain (TLP) after spinal anaesthesia has generated much interest. Many theories have been discussed. Early ambulation has been suggested as one plausible theory for developing TLP.
METHODS: A total of 107 patients scheduled for inguinal hernial repair under spinal anaesthesia (20 mg/ml hyperbaric lidocaine) were randomised to either early or late ambulation: the early ambulation (group A), as early as possible after total regression of spinal block or the late mobilisation (group B) bedridden for more than 12 h. The clinical course and duration of operation were monitored. Assessments 4, 8 and 12 h after spinal anaesthesia were performed with respect to wound pain, nausea, tiredness and eventual symptoms of TLP were recorded. The patients also kept a diary about any symptoms once daily day 1-3 at home. A telephone follow-up was performed at day 5-7.
RESULTS: Our results showed an incidence of TLP of 23% in all patients. No difference was recorded between early and late mobilisation patients, 12 and 13 patients, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Early ambulation does not seem to increase the risk of developing TLP."
11207696,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11207696/,"BACKGROUND: Although hyaluronan has been acknowledged as being free of species and organ specificity, for 4 years I have encountered a variety of adverse reactions to injectable hyaluronic acid as used in aesthetic medicine.
OBJECTIVE: I have tried to prove that some of those side effects may be allergic reactions to the commercial preparations of injectable hyaluronic acid.
METHODS: I began with intradermal tests to the reactive patients and to 2 witnesses; then lymphocyte transforming tests were performed at the University of Geneva (Switzerland). Histology was performed on the skin tests and on reactive treated areas of the face of different patients. A serum analysis was then done by Pr. Sainte Laudy of Laboratoire Pasteur--Cerba (France).
RESULTS: The skin tests were positive for one or the other or both of the injectable hyaluronic acid preparations used in aesthetic medicine. The different biopsies have shown for some a chronic inflammatory reaction, even 11 months after the treatment or a severe granulamatous reaction to foreign bodies. Serum analysis revealed positive antibodies against Restylane and/or Hylaform and even IgG and E anti-hyaluronic acid.
CONCLUSION: Since 1995, I have 8 patients with adverse reactions to injectable hyaluronic acid, which after several tests, may be allergic to those products. Isn't it time to introduce intradermal tests before any injection of this type, as done with injectable bovine collagen?"
11208510,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11208510/,"BACKGROUND: There are conflicting reports concerning the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases: some studies connected Sulphasalazine therapy and lower incidence of Helicobacter pylori infection, but others showed lower prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection in inflammatory bowel diseases despite the choice of therapy.
CASE REPORT: A 28-year-old male patient presented in January 1996 with the symptoms of ulcer like dyspepsia. There was no significant abnormality on physical examination, laboratory testing and abdominal ultrasound. Histology examination of the biopsy specimen taken during the upper endoscopy revealed Helicobacter pylori associated active gastritis only in the corporal part of the stomach. After two weeks eradication therapy (Omeprazole, Amoxicillin) he was well. Three months later, at the control endoscopy, granulomatous gastritis of the corporal localization was detected, without Helicobacter pylori present. Antral mucosa appeared normal, both, on endoscopy and histology examination. In July 1996 he started with cramping abdominal pain, mild periodical fever and episodes of watery diarrhea. In laboratory results we found nonspecific signs of inflammation. We repeated upper endoscopy, colonoscopy and enteroclysis--with evidence of segmental stenotic lesions of the upper part of ileum and jejunum. Again, we confirmed granulomatous gastritis and small granuloma in the proximal jejunum. After starting the 5-ASA therapy in combination with Metronidazol, patient was better clinical condition, and laboratory results were normal. We suggested mesalamine maintenance therapy 1 gr. every day, and three years later he is well, in clinical remission of Crohn's disease.
CONCLUSION: The clinical course of the Crohn's disease maybe ""sui generis"" connected with Helicobacter pylori infection- but the exact mechanisms remain to be discovered."
11208849,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11208849/,"PURPOSE: To determine whether changes in whole-lung pulmonary function test (PFT) values are related to the sum of predicted radiation therapy (RT)-induced changes in regional lung perfusion.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1991 and 1998, 96 patients (61% with lung cancer) who were receiving incidental partial lung irradiation were studied prospectively. The patients were assessed with pre- and post-RT PFTs (forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV1] and diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide [DLCO]) for at least a 6-month follow-up period, and patients were excluded if it was determined that intrathoracic recurrence had an impact on lung function. The maximal declines in PFT values were noted. A dose-response model based on RT-induced reduction in regional perfusion (function) was used to predict regional dysfunction. The predicted decline in pulmonary function was calculated as the weighted sum of the predicted regional injuries: equation [see text] where Vd is the volume of lung irradiated to dose d, and Rd is the reduction in regional perfusion anticipated at dose d.
RESULTS: The relationship between the predicted and measured reduction in PFT values was significant for uncorrected DLCO (P = .005) and borderline significant for DLCO (P = .06) and FEV1 (P = .08). However, the correlation coefficients were small (range,.18 to.30). In patients with lung cancer, the correlation coefficients improved as the number of follow-up evaluations increased (range,.43 to.60), especially when patients with hypoperfusion in the lung adjacent to a central mediastinal/hilar thoracic mass were excluded (range,.59 to.91).
CONCLUSION: The sum of predicted RT-induced changes in regional perfusion is related to RT-induced changes in pulmonary function. In many patients, however, the percentage of variation explained is small, which renders accurate predictions difficult."

METHODS: This retrospective study on 398 couples analyzed epidemiological features, characteristics of ovarian stimulation, number and quality of retrieved oocytes, as well as pregnancy outcome according to three groups of BMI values: BMI < 20, 20 < or = BMI < 25 and BMI > or = 25 kg/m2.
RESULTS: The prevalence of underweight and overweight women was 21.8% and 22.3%, respectively. The mean ratio follicle-stimulating hormone-luteinizing hormone increased significantly according to BMI. An increase in the mean number of consummated gonadotropin ampoules together with a decrease in the number of collected oocytes was observed in long stimulating protocol cycles when BMI > or = 25 kg/m2. The same observations were made in short stimulation protocol cycles of BMI < 20 and > or = 25 kg/m2. No significant difference could be found in clinical pregnancy and miscarriage rates between underweight, normal weight, and overweight patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Both underweight and overweight have negative effects on IVF parameters and outcome leading to decreased chances of pregnancy."
11209582,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11209582/,"OBJECTIVE: Anecdotal evidence exists that the public is becoming skeptical about nutrition messages. This article examines whether there is a backlash against dietary recommendations and whether it is associated with less healthful diets.
DESIGN/PARTICIPANTS: Data are from a 1997-1998 Washington State random-digit-dial survey of 1,751 adults designed to monitor attitudes and behavior related to cancer risk and prevention.
STATISTICAL ANALYSES: Responses to the nutrition backlash survey were weighted to reflect the Washington State population. Linear regression was used to examine associations of nutrition backlash with fat and fruit and vegetable intake.
RESULTS: This survey did not find strong evidence that nutrition backlash was widespread. However, 70% of respondents thought that Americans are obsessed with the fat in their diet and that the government should not tell people what to eat. More than a quarter agreed with the statement that eating low-fat foods takes the pleasure out of eating. Nutrition backlash was associated with less healthful diets: individuals showing high backlash had a fat-related diet habits score of 2.11 compared with a score of 1.73 among those showing low backlash (P for trend = .001), which corresponds to a difference of roughly 4 percentage points in percentage energy from fat. Individuals showing high backlash reported eating only 2.72 servings of fruits and vegetables per day, compared with 3.35 servings among those showing low backlash (P for trend = .001).
APPLICATIONS/CONCLUSIONS: Nutrition professionals need to ensure that dietary recommendations are clear and positive to avoid the possibility that consumers may disregard nutrition messages entirely."
11209628,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11209628/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine if tubal rupture rates are decreased when a strict diagnostic algorithm is employed in the evaluation of women with suspected ectopic pregnancy as compared to individualized diagnostic methods.
STUDY DESIGN: Between 1994 and 1996, a group of investigators at Charleston Area Medical Center employed a strict diagnostic algorithm consisting of serum quantitative human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels, progesterone levels, ultrasound and endometrial curettage in order to expedite diagnosis when ectopic pregnancy was suspected (group A patients). Other practitioners employed traditional criteria in similar clinical situations (group B patients). Medical records of patients diagnosed with ectopic pregnancy in this period were retrospectively reviewed. Demographic data, clinical and laboratory characteristics, and rate of tubal rupture were compared.
RESULTS: Sixty-one of 122 patients were diagnosed with ectopic pregnancy by strict criteria. These patients did not differ significantly from those evaluated by an individualized approach in regard to age, gravidity, parity or risk factors for ectopic pregnancy. Menstrual age, hCG levels and progesterone levels were similar as well. Group A patients had a median diagnostic interval of 2 days, with a range of 0-16. Group B patients had a median diagnostic interval of 8 days, with a range of 0-44 (P < .001). Of patients evaluated by this strict algorithm, 3.3% experienced rupture as compared to 23% of patients in group B (P < .001).
CONCLUSION: Use of a strict diagnostic algorithm in the evaluation of patients with suspected ectopic pregnancy resulted in decreased tubal rupture rates. Such an algorithm could be disseminated to all locations for triage of patients and use in a standardized manner. This practice could result in a reduction in loss of reproductive function and mortality secondary to ectopic pregnancy."

METHOD: Under sonographic guidance five biceps muscles of three cadavers were marked with a needle in the region of the elbow joint. Thereafter an anatomical preparation of the distal biceps brachii muscle followed to verify the correct positioning of the needle. Real time ultrasound was performed with a 7.5 MHz linear array transducer. The standard section of the elbow and the images on the screen correspond to the guidelines provided by the German Society of Ultrasonography in the Locomotor Apparatus (DEGUM).
RESULTS: In all five cases the needle tip could be found in the middle of the distal biceps muscle. It was possible to perform a sonographically guided puncture of the muscle and to differentiate between distal biceps brachii and surrounding soft tissues using a high resolution transducer of the newest generation in ultrasound technology.
CONCLUSION: Our investigation confirmed our clinical ultrasound findings in distal biceps tendon ruptures. The echo-intense signal is replaced by a hypoechogenic signal representing the haematoma in the area of the distal biceps brachii muscle. In addition to the clinical examination in case of a ruptured distal biceps muscle ultrasound of the elbow is a valuable and reliable imaging method to support the diagnosis. MRI of the elbow is not always necessary to confirm the diagnosis."
11210168,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11210168/,"BACKGROUND: [corrected] We investigated whether alcohol drinking contributes to suicides in cancer sufferers when compared with non-cancer suicides. We also explored the suicide method used in cancer suicides.
METHODS: The population-based, prospectively collected data sample consisted of 1515 completed suicides committed in the province of Oulu, Finland, during the period 1988-99. Victims who suffered from cancer were compared with other suicides.
RESULTS: Cancer patients who committed suicide were significantly less commonly under the influence of alcohol than non-cancer suicide victims (84.8% vs 54.7%). Mental disorders were less prevalent among cancer patients than non-cancer patients. The cancer patients were significantly older and more often retired and a trend that a greater proportion of cancer suicide victims were male was noted. Shooting and poisoning were the most common suicide methods among cancer patients.
CONCLUSION: An early recognition and evaluation of the extent of the suicidal tendencies among cancer patients is of great importance in clinical oncology, since preventive interventions would be effective especially for those without comorbid alcoholism at the time of the suicide."

METHODS: Analysis was made of the 1995 National Health Survey, in which personal interviews were conducted on a multistage area sample of private dwellings and a list sample of non-private dwellings in all States and Territories of Australia. Mothers between the ages of 17 and 50 years (n = 1991) with children under the age of four years in 1995 participated in the study.
RESULTS: Of the group of mothers with a body mass index (BMI) of 20-25, 89.2% (95% confidence interval (CI) 87.4-91.0) initiated breastfeeding, compared with 82.3% (95% CI 77.6-87.0) of mothers with a BMI of 30 or more. There was also a significant difference between the mean and median duration of breastfeeding of obese and non-obese mothers (BMI 30 and over, < 25, respectively). These differences remained significant when maternal smoking, age and other sociodemographic factors were taken into consideration.
CONCLUSIONS: Health professionals should be aware that obese women may be at increased risk of not breastfeeding or stopping breastfeeding prematurely."

METHODS: Data were derived from the CARDIA study, a cohort of 5115 healthy adults aged 18 to 30 years at baseline (1985-1986) and recruited from the populations of 4 US cities. Respondents were followed over 10 years.
RESULTS: Among 3950 respondents reexamined in 1995-1996, 20% of Whites and 33% of African Americans were smokers, as compared with 25% and 32%, respectively, in 1985-1986. On average, African Americans were of lower socioeconomic status. Ten-year regular smoking initiation rates for African American women, White women, African American men, and White men were 7.1%, 3.5%, 13.2%, and 5.1%, respectively, and the corresponding cessation rates were 25%, 35.1%, 19.2%, and 31.3%. After adjustment for socioeconomic factors, most 95% confidence intervals of the odds ratios for regular smoking initiation and cessation in African Americans vs Whites included 1.
CONCLUSIONS: Less beneficial 10-year changes in smoking were observed in African Americans, but socioeconomic factors explained most of the racial disparity."
11211638,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11211638/,"OBJECTIVES: This study examined (1) the relation of employment grade in middle age to self-reported poor health and functional limitations in old age and (2) whether socioeconomic status at approximately the time of retirement modifies health differentials in old age.
METHODS: Survivors of the Whitehall Study cohort of men were resurveyed. Respondents were aged 40 to 69 years when they were originally screened in 1967 to 1970.
RESULTS: Compared with senior administrators, men in clerical or manual (low-grade) jobs in middle age had quadruple the odds of poor physical performance in old age, triple the odds of poor general health, and double the odds of poor mental health and disability. At most, 20% of these differences were explained by baseline health or risk factors. Men who moved from low to middle grades before retirement were less likely than those who remained in low grades to have poor mental health.
CONCLUSIONS: Socioeconomic status in middle age and at approximately retirement age is associated with morbidity in old age."

Many patients, who also displayed symptoms of psychological distress, were referred to an electrodiagnostic clinic with a diagnosis of possible CTS; they subsequently had normal nerve conduction studies.
DESIGN: Sixty patients with hand pain were referred to either of two university clinics for electrophysiologic testing, were assigned to either the CTS or nonneurologic group, and were compared on a series of psychometric tests.
RESULTS: The Beck Depression Inventory and McGill Pain Questionnaire showed that the physician-assigned nonneurologic patients have a greater degree of depression, use more affective adjectives, and choose more words on the McGill Pain Questionnaire than the physician-assigned CTS group. The nonneurologic group also scored higher on indices of self-reported disability on the Pain Disability Inventory in five of seven categories. Although the CTS group perceived more control over their pain, no differences were observed in the types of coping strategies used on the Coping Strategy Questionnaire. Finally, the nonneurologic group had more Workers' Compensation Board claims.
CONCLUSION: Evidence of important psychological issues in some patients with hand pain suggests a need for greater awareness among treating physicians."

PARTICIPANTS: A total of 15,731 non-institutionalized adults.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Reported visits to general practitioners and specialists in the previous year and reports of having had blood pressure measurements, mammography, and Pap smears.
RESULTS: A graded relationship was observed between level of regular care by a family physician in the previous year (none, some, regular) and receiving preventive services. Those without regular doctors and those reporting only some care by a family physician were less likely to have ever had their blood pressure checked than adults receiving ongoing care from a regular family physician. Women reporting some or no care were less likely to have had mammography within 2 years or to have ever had Pap smears.
CONCLUSION: Adults who receive regular care from a family physician are more likely to receive recommended preventive services."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The records of all patients over 80 years old undergoing TURP at one institution over a 3.5-year period were studied retrospectively.
RESULTS: 31% of patients underwent TURP for symptoms and 68% for urinary retention. The early complication rate was 41%. The late complication rate was 22%. There were no deaths within 30 days of surgery. Of all patients, 80% were satisfied with the outcome of their operation. Of all patients with retention, 80% were able to void with small residual volumes by 6 weeks after operation.
CONCLUSIONS: Although TURP in the over 80-year-old male is associated with significant morbidity, it is an effective treatment for urinary symptoms or retention. The majority of patients are able to void afterwards and are satisfied with the outcome of their surgery."
11212594,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11212594/,"OBJECTIVE: A secondary analysis of our data to investigate if sex influences the specificity of the relationship between each of the 3 clinical syndromes (i.e., reality distortion, disorganization and psychomotor poverty) in schizophrenia and the neurocognitive functions that are thought to represent regional brain functions.
PATIENTS AND DESIGN: Fifty-seven male and 30 female patients with a DSM-III-R diagnosis of schizophrenia were rated on the Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms and the Scale for Assessment of Positive Symptoms to derive scores for psychomotor poverty, disorganization, and reality distortion syndromes. All subjects completed a battery of neuropsychological tests purported to assess functioning of left temporal, right temporal, left basal frontal, right basal frontal, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.
RESULTS: Correlation coefficients between syndrome scores and neuropsychological measures showed only word fluency (left frontal functioning) to have a statistically significant association with psychomotor poverty in women (p < 0.01). This relation was specific to psychomotor poverty syndrome. No relations between neurocognitive measures and symptoms were seen in men.
CONCLUSIONS: The lack of specific relations between symptom dimensions in schizophrenia may be influenced by the fact that the neuronal circuitry associated with particular symptom dimensions may differ in men and women."
11213006,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11213006/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the maternal and fetal risk of adverse outcome during pregnancy in relation to low maternal body mass index in an unselected population.
DESIGN: Retrospective analysis.
METHODS: Information for the years between 1988 and 1997 was extracted from a validated maternity database, including all but one of the maternity units in the North West Thames Region; 215,105 completed singleton pregnancies were studied. Comparison of pregnancy outcome was made on the basis of maternal body mass index at booking. There were 176,923 with a normal weight body mass index ( = 20 < 25). There were 38,182 with an underweight body mass index (< 20). Comparisons included antenatal complications (e.g. gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia); intervention in labour, maternal morbidities (e.g. infection, postpartum haemorrhage, pulmonary thromboembolism); and neonatal outcome (admitted to special care baby unit at 24 hour of age, gestation at delivery, birthweight, stillbirth). Data are presented as percentages of outcomes in the normal and underweight groups with adjusted odds ratios and confidence intervals according to body mass index group.
RESULTS: In the underweight group only antenatal anaemia, preterm delivery and birthweight below the 5th centile were more frequent than in women of normal body mass index. The prevalence of certain complications, including development of gestational diabetes mellitus, pre-eclampsia, obstetric intervention and postpartum haemorrhage, were significantly lower in those with low body mass index.
CONCLUSION: Low maternal body mass index is associated with increased prevalence of some pregnancy complications, notably preterm delivery and low birthweight, but overall the outcome is favourable and several adverse outcomes are less common in this group of women."
11216557,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11216557/,"OBJECTIVE: Iron supplementation plays a major role in erythropoietin-treated end-stage renal disease patients. For peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients, oral iron substitution is more convenient than intravenous therapy. However, disturbed iron absorption and adverse effects may be limiting factors for oral treatment. Nevertheless, we compared the response to a high-dose and low-dose oral iron absorption test between PD patients and healthy control subjects.
PATIENTS AND INTERVENTIONS: In 34 PD patients and 15 healthy control subjects, blood samples were taken at baseline as well as 2, 4, and 8 hours after oral intake of 4 tablets iron sulfate (105 mg elemental iron per tablet). In a subgroup of 6 PD patients and 6 control subjects, the oral iron absorption test was repeated using 1 tablet iron sulfate.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the increase in serum iron during the test between the two groups. As known for healthy subjects, iron absorption was significantly better in PD patients with absolute iron deficiency compared to those with functional iron deficiency. Iron-repleted PD patients showed the lowest iron absorption, indicating that a high dose of oral iron did not overwhelm the ability of the bowel tract to reject unneeded iron. Increasing the oral iron dose from 1 to 4 tablets was followed by a better response in a small subgroup of PD patients compared to control subjects. Side effects such as nausea and vomiting occurred more frequently during high-dose oral iron in control subjects than in PD patients (20% vs 8.8%).
CONCLUSION: High-dose oral iron is well absorbed in iron-depleted PD patients. This kind of oral iron therapy should be considered in some subgroups of PD patients with iron deficiency, particularly in those patients with poor vascularization of arm veins or intolerance to intravenous iron preparations."

Patients were classified as overweight [BMI > 27.5; mean +/- standard error of mean (SEM): 32.1 +/- 1.1; n = 14] or normal weight (BMI 20-27.5; mean +/- SEM: 23.8 +/- 0.4; n = 29).
OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient survival and adverse cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, congestive cardiac failure, cerebrovascular accident, and symptomatic peripheral vascular disease) were recorded over a 3-year period.
RESULTS: At baseline, no significant differences were seen between the groups in clinical, biochemical, nutritional, or echocardiographic parameters, except for a lower dietary protein intake (0.97 +/- 0.10 g/kg/day vs 1.44 +/- 0.10 g/kg/day, p = 0.004) and a higher proportion of well-nourished patients by subjective global assessment (100% vs 72%, p < 0.05) in the overweight group. After 3 years of follow-up, 29% of overweight patients and 69% of normal-weight patients had died (p < 0.05). Using a Cox proportional hazards model, a BMI greater than 27.5 was shown to be an independent positive predictor of patient survival, with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 0.09 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.01-0.85; p < 0.05]. However, being overweight did not significantly influence myocardial infarction-free survival (adjusted HR: 0.33; 95% CI: 0.07-1.48; p = 0.15) or combined adverse cardiovascular event-free survival (adjusted HR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.23-1.93; p = 0.46).
CONCLUSIONS: Obesity conferred a significant survival advantage in our PD population. Obese patients should therefore not be discouraged from receiving PD purely on the basis of BMI. Moreover, maintaining a higher-than-average BMI to preserve ""nutritional reserve"" may help to reduce the mortality and morbidity rates associated with PD."
11216740,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11216740/,"BACKGROUND: Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) may contribute to the complications and cost of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Off-pump CABG (OPCAB) allows coronary revascularization without CPB. We hypothesized that OPCAB provides satisfactory graft patency while reducing complications and cost compared with CABG with CPB.
METHODS: We prospectively followed 80 patients undergoing CABG: 40 patients undergoing OPCAB and 40 patients undergoing CABG with CPB. OPCAB patients underwent angiography within 48 hours of surgery to determine early graft patency. Incidence of complications, length of stay, and costs were recorded for each patient. The influence of the number of vessels bypassed was analyzed.
RESULTS: OPCAB patients (n = 40) underwent grafting of 2.7 +/- 0.7 vessels per patient compared with 3.6 +/- 0.8 vessels per patient in the CABG with CPB group (n = 40) (p < 0.0001). Angiography demonstrated 105 of 108 (97%) of grafts were patent in the OPCAB group. Incidence of complications, length of stay, and costs did not differ between the OPCAB and CABG with CPB groups. Number of vessels grafted showed a positive correlation to total costs in both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: While OPCAB provided satisfactory early graft patency, there was no significant difference between OPCAB and CABG with CPB with regard to cost, length of stay, or incidence of complications. In this study, eliminating CPB did not reduce morbidity or cost after CABG."
11216766,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11216766/,"BACKGROUND: Isoperistaltic colon is preferred to antiperistaltic colon for esophageal replacement, but experimental data do not exist to support this practice.
METHODS: In 7 dogs a 20 cm long colon loop was interposed between the skin and the small bowel, isoperistaltically in 3 dogs and antiperistaltically in 4 dogs. Three months later five strain-gauges were implanted and evacuation was investigated by motility testing, barium studies, and scintigraphy.
RESULTS: Motility recording showed normal colon motility in the excluded loops. Quiescent states (duration 40.2 +/- 13.6 minutes) were followed by contractile states (duration 7.5 +/- 2.4 minutes, frequency 3.3 +/- 0.6 per minute). The main peristaltic direction of isoperistaltic loops was isoperistaltic, and the main peristaltic direction of antiperistaltic loops was antiperistaltic. Evacuation took place exclusively during the contractile status. Half time emptying was more rapid in isoperistaltic loops (35 +/- 11 vs 69 +/- 16 minutes). The content of antiperistaltic loops was held back by antiperistaltic activity. Application of oatmeal porridge into the loops shortened the quiescent status from 40.2 to 13.2 +/- 4.8 minutes.
CONCLUSIONS: The colon graft for esophageal replacement is an active system. Food is stored during the quiescent states and evacuated during the contractile states. The original peristaltic direction is preserved so that retroperistalsis in antiperistaltic loops may lead to patient discomfort and pulmonary complications."
11217003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11217003/,"BACKGROUND: The manifestation of bilateral disk swelling raises the suspicion of papilledema and mandates that an etiology for increased intracranial pressure be discovered. This case report will present the manifestations and treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and review the differential diagnoses of bilateral disk edema.
CASE REPORT: A 51-year-old black man manifested symptoms of dizziness and intermittent loss of vision in the left eye for one week. Dilated funduscopy revealed early left optic disk edema; edema of the right optic nerve head was questionable. The patient had pulmonary nodules noted on a recent chest x-ray that were thought to be cancerous; this raised the suspicion of a metastasis to the brain or orbit. The patient did not return until about 10 weeks later, at which time he presented with a history significant for newly-diagnosed intermediate-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. He had begun chemotherapy one month before the second examination at our clinic; methotrexate therapy for CNS metastasis had been provided at the time of the spinal taps. At the second visit, there was marked progression of the swelling of the left optic disk and mild swelling of the right disk. At the third visit, six weeks later, the disk edema had improved remarkably. The patient's disk swelling resolved completely by the end of his six months of chemotherapy.
CONCLUSION: This is a unique presentation of a patient at high risk for brain metastasis, in which laboratory and radiologic studies failed to provide adequate supportive evidence for the conclusions drawn from clinic observations. Bilateral disk edema in a patient with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is strongly suggestive of a metastatic tumor to the brain causing increased intracranial pressure."
11217253,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11217253/,"PURPOSE: To determine whether pseudophakic astigmatism is a desirable goal, and if so, which one is better: against-the-rule (ATR) or with-the-rule (WTR).
METHOD: Eyes were included only if they had an uncorrected vision > or = 6/18 and N/18. Three groups, of 40 patients each were evaluated: group 1, pseudophakes with neutral astigmatism; group 2, with ATR and group 3, with WTR astigmatism Unaided distance and near visual acuity was recorded. Statistical analysis was performed using the chi-square test for independence.
RESULTS: Unaided distance vision of > or = 6/7.5 was achieved in 19 eyes (47.5%) of group 1 (neutral), 12 eyes (30%) in group 2 (ATR), and 5 eyes (12.5%) in group 3 (WTR) (p = 0.0133, significant). Unaided near vision of > or = N/9 was achieved in 17 eyes (42.5%) in group 1 (neutral), 34 eyes (85%) in group 2 (ATR), and 10 eyes (25%) in group 3 (WTR) (P < 0.001, significant). Group 1 (neutral) fared the best for unaided distance visual acuity. Group 2 (ATR) was better than in group 3 (WTR) for distant vision. Group 2 (ATR) fared the best for unaided near vision.
CONCLUSION: ATR astigmatism could be a desirable goal after cataract extraction in selected populations because the largest proportion of these cases achieved good unaided near vision with acceptable distant vision."
11217589,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11217589/,"BACKGROUND: The American Heart Association recommends that patients with certain abnormal and prosthetic heart valves receive antibiotic prophylaxis before undergoing invasive dental treatment, owing to the risk of bacterial endocarditis, or BE. However, it is not known how many patients are aware that they have such conditions and understand such recommendations.
METHODS: The authors conducted a study to determine how many male users of three U.S. Department of Veterans' Affairs ambulatory medical care centers denied having a heart murmur, even though a murmur was noted in their medical record. The authors asked 637 potential subjects a series of questions to identify those who had a heart murmur that might place them at risk of developing BE. The authors then reviewed each subject's medical records for documentation of a heart murmur.
RESULTS: Four hundred ninety-seven dentate men (mean age: 61.0 years) denied having a heart murmur. Seventy (14.1 percent) of these men had documentation of a heart murmur in their medical records, and 13 (2.6 percent) had murmurs that were likely to be pathological. The failure to accurately report having a heart murmur and having a potentially pathological heart murmur were positively related to age (P = .001). Failure to accurately report having a heart murmur also was related to lower educational levels.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that a substantially larger number of older men than younger men were unaware that they had a heart murmur. Since some of these murmurs necessitate administration of antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures, this failure to communicate their correct medical status may put them at risk of developing BE.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Dental health care providers should be aware that patient self-report may not be a reliable indicator of cardiac status, particularly in older patients."
11217622,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11217622/,"BACKGROUND: Childhood asthma remains underdiagnosed in general practice. Computers with a patient interface have the potential to screen children for asthma in a time-efficient manner.
AIM: To develop a concise, validated self-report measure that calculates an 'asthma score' that predicts likelihood of asthma and its severity in childhood.
DESIGN OF STUDY: Computerised questionnaire survey in general practitioners' (GPs') waiting rooms, followed by a written questionnaire and either bronchial challenge or skin allergy testing at the regional teaching hospital.
SETTING: Children between 18 months and 18 years old accompanied by a parent or guardian in five group practices in Newcastle in New South Wales, Australia.
METHOD: The responses from both the computerised questionnaire and the written questionnaire were compared with physician assessment of asthma, based on an existing validated questionnaire and clinical tests.
RESULTS: Six items were identified to be independently and significantly associated (at P < 0.05) with the presence of asthma and its severity: parent or self-reported asthma, previous diagnosis, wheeze in the past year, physical activity affected by symptoms, night cough in the past year, and visits to a GP in the past year. From the regression model a linear score was derived that indicates whether a child is likely to have asthma and its likely severity.
CONCLUSIONS: The asthma score is a valid indicator of asthma and its severity in children in general practice."
11219358,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11219358/,"OBJECTIVES: To construct a simulation model of the hospital drug distribution system, to evaluate the effects of different changes to the system on unavailability-related medication administration errors (U-MAEs), to test the most promising system in a controlled trial and to explore the model's validity.
METHODS: A discrete-event simulation model of the drug distribution system was constructed, using data collected on a vascular surgery ward and a renal medicine ward as model inputs. The model's output was the U-MAE rate. The model was used to explore the effects on U-MAEs of different changes to the system. One of the changes predicted to reduce U-MAEs, a patients' own drugs scheme, was introduced on each study ward; U-MAE rates were measured using observations before and after its introduction and compared with those predicted by the model.
RESULTS: The model predicted that the introduction of a patients' own drugs system would reduce unavailability-related errors on each ward; in practice, there was a slight decrease on the medical ward but an increase on the surgical ward. Reasons for these findings were explored and four contributing factors identified. Three of these related to failure to follow hospital procedures, the fourth to an issue for which no policy existed. If these factors had been taken into account, the error rates predicted by the model would have been similar to those observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Simulation modelling is a potentially useful approach to the study of U-MAEs, although care must be taken to ensure that such models reflect actual practice rather than stated policy."
11220370,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11220370/,"OBJECTIVE: We report the long-term follow-up of 31 patients with cavernous sinus meningiomas who were treated either with surgery and radiotherapy (RT) or with RT alone. This retrospective review was undertaken to compare long-term efficacy and morbidity of RT with or without previous surgery versus complete, aggressive surgical removal.
METHODS: Between 1980 and 1997, we performed a retrospective study of 31 patients harboring cavernous sinus meningiomas. The patient group comprised 25 women and 6 men. Patients were divided into two therapeutic categories: patients treated with surgery and RT (Group I, 17 patients) and patients treated with RT alone (Group II, 14 patients). Twenty-five patients (14 in Group I and 11 in Group II) were treated for primary tumors, and 6 patients (3 in Group I and 3 in Group II) were treated for recurrent disease. All three patients who were treated by RT alone at the time of recurrent disease had had previous surgery as initial treatment. Tumor control, treatment morbidity, and functional outcomes were evaluated for all patients. Twenty-eight patients were alive at the time of analysis, with a median follow-up period of 6.1 years.
RESULTS: The progression-free survival rate was 92.8% at 10-year follow-up. Only two patients exhibited tumor progression after initial treatment. One of the patients who experienced tumor regrowth 4 years after surgery and RT benefited from additional conventional external beam radiation, and this patient exhibited no evidence of tumor progression at the last follow-up examination 6 years later. Two patients experienced cranial nerve impairment after surgery, and no patients developed late radiation toxicity. Follow-up status as measured by the Karnofsky Performance Scale deteriorated in 7% of patients and was the same or improved in 93% of patients.
CONCLUSION: The results of combined surgery and RT or RT alone indicated a high rate of tumor control and a low risk of complications. Complete aggressive surgical removal of cavernous sinus meningiomas is associated with an increased incidence of morbidity and mortality and does not demonstrate a better rate of tumor control. Conventional external beam radiation seems to be an efficient and safe initial or adjuvant treatment of these lesions, and these findings should serve as a basis for evaluating new alternatives such as radiosurgery or stereotactic RT."
11220481,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11220481/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether microorganisms associated with intrauterine infection and preterm labor play a contributing role in midgestation abortion.
METHODS: A 4 year retrospective review of spontaneous midgestation abortions for which autopsy and microbiological cultures of placental and fetal tissue were performed was conducted for a tertiary obstetrics hospital, which included a regional referral service for perinatal and fetal pathology. One hundred twenty-nine spontaneously delivered, nonmacerated, midgestation fetuses or stillbirths (of between 16 and 26 weeks' gestation) and placentas were examined and cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, yeasts, and genital mycoplasmas.
RESULTS: Microorganisms were recovered in 85 (66%) cases (57% placentas, 49% fetuses). Among the culture positive cases, 81% had histological chorioamnionitis, 28% fetal pneumonitis, 38% clinical signs of infection, and 62% ruptured membranes at the time of miscarriage. These differed significantly from culture-negative cases (44%, 5%, 13%, and 34%, respectively). Group B streptococcus (GBS) was the most significant pathogen, recovered in 21 cases, 13 as the sole isolate, 94% with chorioamnionitis, and 47% in women with intact membranes. Escherichia coli and Ureaplasma urealyticum (22 and 24 cases, respectively) occurred mostly as mixed infections, with ruptured membranes. GBS, MU urealyticum, and Streptococcus anginosus group were individually associated with chorioamnionitis, Bacteroides/Prevotella and S. anginosus with fetal pneumonitis. The spectrum of microorganisms was similar to that in preterm labor at later gestations; however, GBS appeared to be the most significant pathogen in midgestation miscarriage, especially with intact membranes.
CONCLUSIONS: Unsuspected intrauterine infection underlies many spontaneous midgestation abortions. GBS is a key pathogen in this setting."
11220690,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11220690/,"BACKGROUND: Human spongiform transmissible encephalopathies (TSE) are a group of neurodegenerative diseases caused by a transmissible not yet recognized agent; their distinctive neuropathological features are astrocytosis, spongiform lesions of the neuropil, neuronal loss and occasionally amyloid plaques in the cortical and subcortical gray matter. TSE are biochemically characterized by the deposition in the nervous system of an amyloid-type protein, PrPres derived from the post-translational modification of a normal protein, PrPsen. The expression of this protein is controlled by the PRNP gene mapped on chromosome 20 in man. A number of point mutations of the PRNP gene have been described in the familial forms of these TSE. Some of these mutations have been associated with differences in the phenotypic expression of the disease.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study was designed to verify whether it was possible to identify a selective phenotype depending upon a given PRNP modified genotye; for this purpose, a group of familial TSE cases (CJD 210ILE, CJD 201LYS, FFI 178ASN) were selected and their neuropathological profiles have been compared with those of a large series of sporadic CJD cases.
RESULTS: No significant differences were found between the topography and severity of lesions in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, basal ganglia and thalamus between the two groups. Two differences were found: the clinical duration of the disease which appeared significantly (p = 0.02) shorter in the 210ILE-mutated cases compared to that of non-mutated sporadic cases. The highly selective vulnerability of thalamus in FFI showing a severe pathology especially in its dorso-medial part in comparison with that of the sporadic CJD cases.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study confirm that the different polymorphism at codon 129 of the PRNP gene, which could be involved in the structural ""domains"" of human PrP, might modulate the pathological phenotype of TSE."
9973581,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9973581/,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between adolescents' favorite movie stars and their smoking status, controlling for variables associated with smoking initiation.
METHODS: The 1996 California Tobacco Survey questioned 6,252 adolescents about their favorite stars, smoking history, exposure to smokers, rebelliousness, knowledge and attitudes regarding smoking, and cigarette advertising and promotion. The top 10 favorite stars were tested for differential preference between ever and never smokers, defined as those who had never puffed on a cigarette. Never smokers were categorized as susceptible or nonsusceptible to smoking.
RESULTS: Favorite stars differed significantly among adolescent ever and never smokers. A majority of favorite stars of ever smokers smoked on and off screen compared to favorite stars of never smokers. In multivariate analyses, adolescent never smokers who preferred favorite stars of adolescent ever smokers were significantly more likely to be susceptible to smoking (OR = 1.35; 95% CI 1.12, 1.62), even after adjustment for known predictors of adolescent smoking and demographic variables. This effect was only slightly weaker than that of exposure to friends and family who smoke (OR = 1.45; 95% CI 1.13, 1.85).
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary evidence that stars who smoke on and off screen may encourage youth to smoke."
9973779,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9973779/,"BACKGROUND: The study examined the role of relaxation and aggressive types of imagery and the effect of goal orientations, self efficacy, self control, and determination on exertion tolerance.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: the participants underwent an exertive task in which they were required to squeeze a dynamometer, at 50% of their maximal hand-grip capacity, for as long as they could. Perceived exertion was measured every 15 sec during the task. The time that elapsed between rating exertion as ""strong"", and dropping the handbar under 10% of the designated 50% criterion, was considered as the ""zone of exertion tolerance"".
PARTICIPANTS: forty-eight female university students were randomly assigned into 3 groups.
INTERVENTIONS: two imagery techniques, one under relaxing and one under aggressive conditions were taught and then applied. In the control condition, discussions were conducted.
MEASURES: traits such as goal orientation (task and ego), physical self-efficacy and self-control were measured prior to performing the task, while rate of perceived exertion task-specific determination (i.e., task-related confidence, commitment, exertion tolerance, and effort investment) were measured before, during and after the task.
RESULTS: The results showed an average of 31% and 28% increase in exertion tolerance in participants who used aggressive and relaxation imagery techniques respectively, compared to 4% reduction in the controls. RM ANOVA indicated equality between the two imagery groups but both were significantly different from the control group. Physical self-efficacy, self-control, and task-specific determination were found nonsignificant, but their important roles in coping with aversive stimuli are highlighted. It was evident that the ""coping"" mechanism rather than the ""distraction"" mechanism accounted for the larger sustain in the ""zone of exertion tolerance"".
CONCLUSIONS: Imagery can be used efficiently in exertion tolerance but more studies are needed on athletes."
9973863,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9973863/,"UNLABELLED: In patients (pts) with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD), antitachycardia pacing (ATP) schemes may be used followed by a limited number of endocavitary shocks in the same episode of ventricular tachycardia (VT) with the potential risk of therapeutic exhaustion.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the incidence of episodes of therapeutic exhaustion in a population of ICD carriers with ATP programmes and to attempt to determine their correlation with clinical variables.
METHODS: Study of the episodes of VT treated by ICD in 8 patients (6 male; 2 female) with an average age of 56 +/- 17 years with a follow-up > 6 months. The underlying pathology was: ischemic heart disease-5 patients; arrhythmogenic dysplasia of the right ventricle-1 patient; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy-1 patient; and operated pulmonary valve stenosis-1 patient. The authors considered therapeutic exhaustion to be the occurrence of episodes in which VT persisted after the application of ATP and the maximum number of shocks. The patients with episodes of therapeutic exhaustion (group A-3 patients) were compared with the remaining patients (group B-5 patients) with regard to the following parameters: age; ejection fraction; previous myocardial infarction (pMI; cardiac frequency during VT (cfVT); number of episodes of non-maintained VT (NMVT) without therapeutic intervention; > 20% reduction of the VT cycle after ATP (VTATP); intensity of programmable shocks (Icho); and medication with anti-arrhythmia drugs (AA).
RESULTS: In a total of 262 VT records (duration > 2.5 sec. after detection) with treatment by ICD during an average follow-up of 11 months, 6 episodes (2.3%) of therapeutic exhaustion were detected in 3 patients. Four of the episodes occurred in the same patient in a period of 4 hours, hospitalisation being necessary following syncope. In the other two cases, there were complaints of dizziness which subsided spontaneously a short time after the application of the last shock by the ICD. [table: see text]
CONCLUSION: Therapeutic exhaustion occurred in about 2% of the VT treated with this population. The possibility of a high number of non maintained VT episodes being associated to a greater possibility of therapeutic exhaustion may have implications on ICD programming."
9974067,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9974067/,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Discrete focal lesions in the splenium of the corpus callosum on MR images in epileptic patients have received little attention in the literature. Our purpose was to describe these lesions, which may be related to the toxicity of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), and to discuss the possible mechanisms of their development.
METHODS: We examined six patients with epilepsy whose brain MR imaging findings showed a discrete focal nonhemorrhagic lesion in the splenium of the corpus callosum. The medical records and MR images were reviewed retrospectively with respect to the patients' clinical history, medication, and laboratory findings to determine the etiology of the lesion.
RESULTS: In all six patients MR imaging showed a focal lesion in the splenium of the corpus callosum, which was ovoid in shape and 15 to 19 mm in size. In the three patients who received contrast material, there was no enhancement of the lesion. Four of six patients had a history of medication with dilantin, in two of whom the level of serum dilantin was found to be elevated (22.3 micrograms/mL and 70.4 micrograms/mL, respectively). Vigabatrin was administered in three patients, one of whom took dilantin together with vigabatrin. In two patients, the focal lesion in the corpus callosum disappeared on follow-up MR images after withdrawal of dilantin and/or vigabatrin.
CONCLUSION: A discrete, focal, ovoid, nonhemorrhagic lesion in the splenium of the corpus callosum may be seen on brain MR images of patients with epilepsy. The lesion is considered to be reversible demyelination related to AEDs toxicity."
9974090,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9974090/,"PATIENTS AND METHODS: The role of cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis of growth hormone (GH) deficiency in children has been studied in 100 children. The diagnosis of GH deficiency was assessed at a mean age of 6.7 +/- 4.1 years: morphological abnormalities of the hypothalamic-pituitary (HP) region have been studied in three different groups: in the first group (70 cases), the neurohypophysis was present and normally located; in the second group (ten cases) it was missing; in the third group (20 cases) the neurohypophysis was ectopic (truncated stalk syndrome with ectopic neurohypophysis, small antehypophysis, thin or non-visualized stalk).
RESULTS: In the majority of cases, children presenting with only one morphological abnormality of the HP region (ectopic neurohypophysis or small antehypophysis or non-visualized or thin stalk) had an isolated GH deficiency. When multiple morphological abnormalities were present, anterior pituitary deficiency was multiple in more than half the cases. Cerebral midline anomalies (above all Chiari I malformation and basipharyngeal canal) had been observed in 20% of the children presenting with GH deficiency. In the majority of cases (95%), these anomalies were associated with one or more abnormalities of the HP region. A familial case is reported: morphological anomalies of the HP region were different for both siblings. Genetic factors are evoked.
CONCLUSION: The severity of the hormone deficiency is correlated to the ectopic location of the neurohypophysis, the thin appearance or non visibility of the pituitary stalk and the associated midline anomalies."
9987445,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9987445/,"OBJECTIVE: To correlate the ranked review slides by the AutoPap Assisted Primary Screener with the final cytologic diagnosis and to assess whether the ranking of slides improves diagnostic accuracy.
STUDY DESIGN: A total of 5,865 consecutive conventional and suitable cervical/vaginal smears, including high-risk (HR) cases, were processed by the AutoPap System. All slides designated Review were manually screened by two cytotechnologists using the Ranked Review Report. All abnormal findings and reactive/reparative changes were referred to two attending cytopathologists for a final diagnosis. After screening, the Review slides called Within Normal Limits (WNL) were selected according to rank for a further Quality Control (QC) review by the supervisor. All HR cases not selected by AutoPap for QC review were also rescreened. The final diagnoses of the possibly abnormal/reactive/reparative referred slides were recorded and distributed in five ranks according to the Ranked Review Report assignment.
RESULTS: Of 5,865 slides, 5,120 (87%) qualified for scanning. The AutoPap System designated 3,840 (75%) slides for manual review. One thousand three hundred forty-five slides were assigned for QC review. After elimination of nonqualified slides, 763 remained. Rescreening detected 1 high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), 2 low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL), 5 atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) and 5 Benign Reactive Changes (BRC). QC of 364 HR cases revealed 1 LSIL, 2 ASCUS and 3 BRC. Ultimately, 313 (8.1%) smears were diagnosed as ASCUS or a more severe abnormality, 262 (6.8%) as reactive/reparative changes, 3,259 (84.8%) as WNL and 6 (0.1%) as unsatisfactory. Of 313 abnormal slides, 181 were ranked by the system in the 1st rank, 61 in the 2nd, 38 in the 3rd, 19 in the 4th and 14 in the 5th. No HSIL or more severe lesions occurred in the fourth and fifth ranks.
CONCLUSION: Our study validated the claim by the manufacturer that a significant epithelial abnormality is more likely to be present if a high score is assigned to a slide. The preliminary results support use of the AutoPap Assisted Primary Screener to improve cytologic diagnosis."
9987460,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9987460/,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine whether breast-feeding has a dose-related protective effect against illness and whether it confers special health benefits to poor infants.
METHODS: The association between breast-feeding dose and illnesses in the first 6 months of life was analyzed with generalized estimating equations regression for 7092 infants from the National Maternal and Infant Health Survey. Breast-feeding dose (ratio of breast-feedings to other feedings) was categorized as full, most, equal, less, or no breast-feeding.
RESULTS: Compared with no breast-feeding, full breast-feeding infants had lower odds ratios of diarrhea, cough or wheeze, and vomiting and lower mean ratios of illness months and sick baby medical visits. Most breast-feeding infants had lower odds ratios of diarrhea and cough or wheeze, and equal breast-feeding infants had lower odds ratios of cough or wheeze. Full, most, and equal breast-feeding infants without siblings had lower odds ratios of ear infections and certain other illnesses, but those with siblings did not. Less breast-feeding infants had no reduced odds ratios of illness. Findings did not vary by income.
CONCLUSIONS: Full breast-feeding was associated with the lowest illness rates. Minimal (less) breast-feeding was not protective. Breast-feeding conferred similar health benefits in all economic groups."
9987466,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9987466/,"OBJECTIVES: Expert panels determined the public health goals of Healthy People 2000 subjectively. The present study examined whether data-driven benchmarks provide a better alternative.
METHODS: We developed the ""pared-mean"" method to define from data the best achievable health care practices. We calculated the pared-mean benchmark for screening mammography from the 1994 National Health Interview Survey, using the metropolitan statistical area as the ""provider"" unit. Beginning with the best-performing provider and adding providers in descending sequence, we established the minimum provider subset that included at least 10% of all women surveyed on this question. The pared-mean benchmark is then the proportion of women in this subset who received mammography.
RESULTS: The pared-mean benchmark for screening mammography was 71%, compared with the Healthy People 2000 goal of 60%.
CONCLUSIONS: For Healthy People 2010, benchmarks derived from data reflecting the best available care provide viable alternatives to consensus-derived targets. We are currently pursuing additional refinements to the data-driven pared-mean benchmark approach."

METHODS: Four strategies using decision analysis were compared for a potential cohort of 100000 asymptomatic sexually active young women: (1) pelvic examination screening in 100%; (2) urine screening in 100%; (3) actual predicted pelvic examination screening in 70%; and (4) actual predicted urine screening in 90%. Assumptions and costs were generated from published sources.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cases of PID prevented per year and cost to prevent a case of PID.
RESULTS: A total of 1750 cases of PID would be predicted to occur per year with no screening. Strategy 1 would prevent the most cases of PID (1283) at a mean cost of $10230. Strategy 2 would prevent 1215 cases of PID at a mean cost of $5093. The marginal cost to prevent an additional case of PID by strategy 1 is $101454. Strategy 3 would prevent 898 cases of PID and 1093 cases of PID would be prevented with urine screening in strategy 4.
CONCLUSION: Urine-based ligase chain reaction screening is the most cost-effective strategy to detect chlamydial and gonococcal genital infection in asymptomatic sexually active adolescent females and, owing to ease of implementation, the most likely to prevent the greatest number of cases of PID."
9989575,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9989575/,"OBJECTIVE: Managed care organizations prefer putatively less expensive split treatment, i.e., a psychopharmacologist plus a non-M.D. psychotherapist. In this study the cost of integrated care by a psychiatrist was compared with split care.
METHOD: Using 1998 fee schedules of seven large managed care organizations (with 54.3% market share and 67.8 million lives) plus Medicare (37 million people), the author modeled clinical scenarios of psychotherapy alone, medication alone, and combined treatment provided by a psychiatrist or split with a psychologist or social worker.
RESULTS: Brief psychotherapy by a social worker was the least expensive treatment. When treatment required both psychotherapy and medication, combined treatment by a psychiatrist cost about the same or less than split treatment with a social worker psychotherapist; it was usually less expensive than split treatment with a psychologist psychotherapist.
CONCLUSIONS: The integrated biopsychosocial model practiced by psychiatry is both theoretically and economically the preferred model when combined treatment is needed."
21198266,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21198266/,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: A changing paradigm shift with multiparity (MP) and breast feeding (BF) has been reported in recent years in breast cancer (BC). Our aim was to observe associations of parity, BF and other risk factors with BC among a local population attending a breast care clinic.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 1,039 women (mean age 39 ± 15 years) attended for screening or presented with palpable breast lumps at KIRAN, Pakistan. The majority were in middle and low socioeconomic strata. As per American Cancer Society (ACS) guidelines 2003, mammography and ultrasound were performed, along with fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) in 195 women with Breast Imaging Reporting and Data Set (BIRADS) IV/V, high risk patients with BIRADS III on mammography and with suspicious ultrasound findings.
RESULTS: The study population was stratified into two groups; one with BC on FNAC in 181 women (17%) and other including 858 healthy women after screening for cancer. The BC group had relative predominance of MP (86% p<0.001), BF (85% p<0.001), family history FH (8% p=0.106) and post-menopause PM (49% p<0.001) as compared to the healthy population. Estimated relative risk (RR) of BC in women with MP, BF, F/H and PM was 3.12 (95% CI=2.05-4.73; p<0.001), 2.47 (95%CI=1.69-3.61; p<0.001), 1.45 (95%CI=0.93-2.41; p=1.06) and 2.33 (95%CI=1.70-3.02; p<0.001) respectively. Higher incidence of BC was observed between 30-40 years 23% (p<0.001) and between 40-50 years 38% (p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: MP, BF and PM have significant associations with BC in the studied Pakistani women and this possible paradigm shift now needs to be evaluated for confounding factors."

METHODS: A pelvic examination and Pap smear were performed for all women who came for cervical screening. Specimens were also collected by self vaginal douching before cervical screening and sent to the cell and molecular biology laboratory for analysis of human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16, 18, 31 and 33 using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
RESULTS: HPV prevalence was 3.6% overall from 250 women in this study. Twenty-four (9.6%) women had an abnormal cytology screening result. No cancer was found. Four women had a high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) and 14 had a low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) from colposcopic biopsy. Self vaginal douching for HPV 16, 18, 31 and 33 was used to predict abnormal Pap smear. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were 12.5%, 97.5%, 33.3% and 91.3%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: From our analysis of self-vaginal douching for HPV detection using cases from Thammasat university hospital, it cannot replace the Pap smear."
21198745,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21198745/,"INTRODUCTION: Chronic low-dose cabergoline treatment for microprolactinoma may cause cardiac valve pathology, but the evidence is contradictory. We investigated whether the expectation of the echocardiographer could influence the report.
METHODS: Transthoracic echocardiograms from 40 patients aged 49·3 ± 9·6 (mean ± SD) years (Men:Women 7:33) on long-term cabergoline and bromocriptine therapy (duration 9·94 ± 4·5 years) were randomly assigned to two groups of echocardiographers so that each echocardiogram was reported twice. One group was told that 'the patients were control subjects' (Group A) and the other that 'the patients were on dopamine agonist therapy which is known to cause valve disease' (Group B). An observer who was blind to the group scored the reports for regurgitation at each valve (scores 0-4; max 16 per case).
RESULTS: Mean total regurgitation score was significantly higher in Group B (1·43 ± 1·28; P = 0·014) than in Group A (0·73 ± 1·30). The difference was mainly from reporting trivial regurgitation: (mitral 16 vs 5, P = 0·005; tricuspid 17 vs 6, P = 0·007 and pulmonary 8 vs 1, P = 0·013). Mild regurgitation was uncommon (mitral 1 vs 1 and tricuspid 3 vs 6). Moderate regurgitation occurred in only one case and was associated with restriction of the leaflets consistent with the effects of cabergoline. Valve thickening was not reported in Group A, but in 9 (23%) mitral and 4 (10%) aortic valves in Group B.
CONCLUSION: Long-term, low-dose dopamine agonist therapy rarely causes cardiac valve disease, but operator bias can lead to over-reporting of both valve thickening and trivial regurgitation."
21198899,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21198899/,"AIM: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the dentists' decision making in the maxillary molar region to find out how it is influenced by general practitioners' and specialists' characteristics as well as by the external evidence.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A questionnaire was developed containing clinical cases and statements to assess practitioners' opinions on the treatment of periodontally involved maxillary molars and implant therapy with sinus grafting. Data were analysed with respect to the dentists' age and specialty.
RESULTS: Three hundred and forty questionnaires were evaluated (24% from universities, 76% from educational courses, overall response rate 35.1%). Forty six per cent of all participants indicated they had specialised, 52% placed dental implants, while 33% performed sinus grafting and 64% periodontal surgeries. Forty six per cent were against or were indecisive about having sinus grafting performed on themselves. The treatment proposals given for the clinical cases revealed a preference among older dentists and general practitioners for regenerative treatments even when these were not evidence based in through-and-through furcation involvements. Resective therapies were most often selected by periodontists. Prosthodontists tended to prefer more invasive treatment options with extractions and augmentations. More experienced general practitioners favoured conventional fixed dental prostheses in free-end situations or no treatment rather than the complicated augmentation procedures, which were preferred by younger dentists.
CONCLUSIONS: Implant placement seems to be widely accepted by almost all subjects, who may either place implants themselves or refer patients. More information seems to be needed on the indications for regenerative therapies for furcation involved maxillary molars, and guidelines required for decision making in complex clinical situations."
21199043,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21199043/,"BACKGROUND: There are few well validated brief measures that can be used to assess the general progress of young children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) over time. In the present study, the Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC) was used as part of a comprehensive assessment battery to monitor the progress of 22 school-aged children with ASD who had previously taken part in intensive home- or school-based intervention programmes in their pre-school years.
METHODS: Parents completed the ATEC when the children were on average 5.5 years and then again 5-6 years later (mean age 10.4 years). Standardised measures were also used to assess cognitive, language and adaptive behaviour skills and severity of autism symptoms over the same period.
RESULTS: The ATEC had high internal consistency at both time points. ATEC total and sub-scale scores remained relatively stable over time and were highly and significantly correlated with cognitive, language and adaptive behaviour skills and severity of autism symptoms at both assessment points. Initial ATEC total scores predicted 64% of the variance in scores at the subsequent follow-up. However, there was also considerable variation in the patterns of scores shown by individual children over time.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides some preliminary evidence of the ATEC's potential value for monitoring progress of children with ASD over time. Its advantages and limitations are discussed in the context of the need systematically to monitor the progress of children with ASD over time or in response to intervention."
21199273,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21199273/,"AIM: Acceptance of a short distal bowel margin results in a higher rate of anterior resection but may compromise oncological safety. This study aimed to evaluate the safety of a 5-mm distal margin.
METHOD: A retrospective analysis was carried out of 412 consecutive patients with rectal cancer treated with anterior resection with a negative circumferential resection margin. Radiotherapy was given to 63% of patients with an advanced tumour. The median follow up was 75 months.
RESULTS: Fewer patients in the group with a distal margin of ≤ 5 mm had a tumour with an advanced pT stage compared to patients in the group with a distal margin of > 5 mm (P = 0.033). Two patients were converted to abdominoperineal resection because of a positive 'doughnut', leaving 410 patients, in whom 5.4% (95% CI, 0-11.3%) of the group with a distal margin of ≤ 5 mm had local recurrence at 5 years compared with 4.2% (95% CI, 2.1-6.3%) of the group with a distal margin of > 5 mm (P = 0.726). The corresponding figures for the 5-year overall survival were 82.4% (95% CI, 72.6-92.2%) vs 76.3% (95% CI, 71.8-80.8%) (P = 0.581). All four anastomotic recurrences occurred in the group with a distal margin of > 5 mm.
CONCLUSION: A distal margin of ≤ 5 mm did not compromise oncological safety in patients undergoing preoperative radiation for an advanced rectal cancer."
21199285,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21199285/,"OBJECTIVE: • To investigate among general practitioners (GPs) their level of awareness and indications for urological consultations in patients treated with 5α-reductase inhibitors (5ARIs).
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: • We conducted a survey of GPs in Quebec. • Questions covered GPs' preferred benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) management, knowledge of 5ARIs, their role in prostate cancer prevention, and triggers for urology consultation.
RESULTS: • Of the surveys mailed, 599 were returned (15.7% response rate). • Therapy with 5ARIs was initiated by GPs in 34.3%, with 20% and 12% preferring 5ARIs alone and combined with an α-blocker as first-line therapy for BPH, respectively. • Once on therapy, 74% did not refer to a urologist if the PSA level did not decline after 6-12 months. • Finally, 40.7% would not advocate 5ARI chemoprevention for prostate cancer, regardless of risk reduction. • Findings were not associated with GP gender, experience or geographic location of practice (urban versus rural).
CONCLUSIONS: • There was a preference amongst GP to use α-blockers over 5ARIs for BPH and hesitancy to use them in prostate cancer chemoprevention. • There is a lack of awareness of 5ARI effects on PSA kinetics and a reluctance to refer to a urologist. • Further education in Quebec is needed about 5ARIs to optimize their usage and avoid delaying cancer detection."
21199316,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21199316/,"OBJECTIVES: One indirect line of evidence for opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH) in humans is decreased pain thresholds (PTREs) and tolerances (PTOLs) in opioid addicts on opioids. There are a number of such studies in opioid maintained addicts, but no such studies in chronic pain patients (CPPs) with current opioid addiction. The objective of this study was to determine if this group demonstrates hyperalgesia.
METHODS: CPPs were subdivided into those with psychoactive substance (opioid dependence) (PSOD) (n=38) (addicted) and those taking opioids but without PSOD (n=198) (not addicted). A group of opioid-free non-CPPs served as a control group (n=36). PTREs/PTOLs were determined in each group by pressure pain stimulation in both the right and left index fingers. PTREs/PTOLs were compared by analysis of variance among the three groups controlling for sex/age and by analysis of covariance between the PSOD CPPs and non-PSOD CPPs controlling for duration of pain and visual analog scale pain level over the last 24 hours.
RESULTS: The PSOD and non-PSOD CPPs had significantly lower PTREs and PTOLs vs. the control group, ie, were hyperalgesic. However, they were not significantly different from each other.
CONCLUSIONS: This study contributes to the human OIH literature. However, because of the potential confounders in this study, the issue of OIH in humans remains unresolved."

AIMS: The current study addressed the predictive value of non-symbolic and symbolic (number word (NW) and Arabic number (AN)) comparison for arithmetics by means of a longitudinal design.
SAMPLE: Sixteen children with mathematical disabilities (MD), 64 low achievers (LA), and 315 typical achieving (TA) children were followed from kindergarten till grade 2.
METHOD: The association of comparison skills with arithmetical skills in grades l and 2 was studied. The performances of MD, LA and TA children were compared.
RESULTS: Regression analyses showed that non-symbolic skills in kindergarten were predictively related to arithmetical achievement 1 year later and fact retrieval 2 years later. AN comparison was predictively related to procedural calculation 2 years later. In grade 2, there was an association between both symbolic tasks and arithmetical achievement. Children with MD already had deficits in non-symbolic and symbolic AN comparison in kindergarten, whereas in grade 2 the deficits in processing symbolic information remained.
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of non-symbolic and symbolic deficits represents a risk of developing MD."
21199540,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21199540/,"OBJECTIVES: The relations of caregiver attributions about care-recipient's problem behaviour to caregiving relationship satisfaction and caregiver distress were examined.
DESIGN: This is a cross sectional study. Seventy-five family caregivers of individuals diagnosed with various disabling health conditions were recruited and interviewed. Caregiver attributions (internality, intentionality, responsibility, and controllability), caregiving relationship satisfaction, and caregiver distress variables were measured.
RESULTS: Structural equation techniques tested an a priori model of the latent constructs of caregiver attributions and caregiver relationship satisfaction to caregiver distress. Maladaptive caregiver attributions (i.e., more trait, higher intentionality, higher responsibility, and higher controllability) about care-recipients' problem behaviours predicted lower caregiving relationship satisfaction, which in turn was predictive of higher caregiver distress. Unexpectedly, caregiver attributions were not directly related to caregiver distress. However, attributions had an indirect effect on distress through relationship satisfaction. Younger caregivers experienced higher caregiver distress.
CONCLUSIONS: Caregivers' explanations about care-recipient's problem behaviour are indicative of their satisfaction in the relationship with the care recipient, and poor caregiving relationship satisfaction is predictive of caregiver distress. Caregiver attributions and relationship quality may be considered in interventions with family caregivers."
21199576,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21199576/,"BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis is associated with changes in balance and physical performance and has psychosocial consequences which increase the risk of falling. Most falls occur during walking; therefore an efficient obstacle avoidance performance might contribute to a reduction in fall risk. Since it was shown that persons with osteoporosis are unstable during obstacle crossing it was hypothesized that they more frequently hit obstacles, specifically under challenging conditions.
METHODS: Obstacle avoidance performance was measured on a treadmill and compared between persons with osteoporosis (n = 85) and the comparison group (n = 99). The obstacle was released at different available response times (ART) to create different levels of difficulty by increasing time pressure. Furthermore, balance confidence, measured with the short ABC-questionnaire, was compared between the groups.
RESULTS: No differences were found between the groups in success rates on the obstacle avoidance task (p = 0.173). Furthermore, the persons with osteoporosis had similar levels of balance confidence as the comparison group (p = 0.091). The level of balance confidence was not associated with the performance on the obstacle avoidance task (p = 0.145).
CONCLUSION: Obstacle avoidance abilities were not impaired in persons with osteoporosis and they did not experience less balance confidence than the comparison group. These findings imply that persons with osteoporosis do not have an additional risk of falling because of poorer obstacle avoidance abilities."
21200057,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21200057/,"PURPOSE: The appropriateness of combination therapy for infections caused by gram-negative organisms is examined.
SUMMARY: Mortality from Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection is particularly high; therefore, empirical regimens are often selected to ensure coverage for this organism. The initial use of combination antimicrobial therapy for gram-negative infections is usually justified by one of three reasons: the potential for synergistic activity between two classes of antimicrobial agents, the broad empirical coverage provided by two antimicrobial agents with differing spectra of activity and resistance patterns, or the prevention of resistance development during antimicrobial therapy. Disadvantages of using combination therapy are increased drug toxicity, increased costs, and increased risk of superinfection with more-resistant bacteria or fungi. There are no clinical data that suggest that the combination of a β-lactam plus a fluoroquinolone results in improved patient outcomes compared with a β-lactam alone or a β-lactam plus an aminoglycoside. Results from studies that evaluate combination therapy versus monotherapy for gram-negative bacilli conflict with the common practice of use of double coverage. Strong evidence to support the administration of antimicrobials for double coverage of gram-negative organisms is lacking. Antimicrobial overuse may lead to antibiotic resistance, unnecessary adverse effects, and increased costs.
CONCLUSION: The available clinical evidence does not support the routine use of combination antimicrobial therapy for treatment of gram-negative infections. Patients with shock or neutropenia may benefit from combination therapy that includes an aminoglycoside."
21200195,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21200195/,"BACKGROUND: Variation in rates of breast reconstruction after mastectomy has raised concerns about the quality of decisions about reconstruction. The authors sought to evaluate patient decision making about reconstruction, using a validated measure of knowledge and preferences related to reconstruction.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of early-stage breast cancer survivors from four university medical centers was conducted. The survey included measures of knowledge about specific reconstruction facts, personal goals and concerns, and involvement in decision making. A multivariable linear regression model of characteristics associated with knowledge and a logistic regression model of factors associated with having reconstruction were developed.
RESULTS: A total of 84 patients participated (59 percent response rate). Participants answered 37.9 percent of knowledge questions correctly. Higher education (beta, 15 percent; p = 0.003) and having reconstruction (beta, 21 percent; p < 0.0001) were associated with higher knowledge. The goals ""use your own tissue to make a breast"" (odds ratio, 1.53; 95 percent CI, 1.15, 2.05) and ""wake up after mastectomy with reconstruction underway"" (odds ratio, 1.66; 95 percent CI, 1.30, 2.12) were associated with reconstruction. The goal ""avoid putting foreign material in your body"" was associated with no reconstruction (odds ratio, 0.64; 95 percent CI, 0.48, 0.86). Most patients reported they mainly made the decision or made the decision with the doctor equally (93 percent; 95 percent CI, 85 to 97 percent) and that their degree of involvement was about right (85 percent; 95 percent CI, 75 to 91 percent).
CONCLUSIONS: Women treated with mastectomy in this study were not well-informed about breast reconstruction. Treatments were associated with patients' goals and concerns, however, and patients were highly involved in their decisions. Knowledge deficits suggest that breast cancer patients would benefit from interventions to support their decision making."
21200196,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21200196/,"BACKGROUND: Necrosis with partial loss of mastectomy flaps is an all-too-common complication of otherwise advantageous skin-sparing mastectomies. Central to the problem of predictable flap viability is the thickness of the skin flaps. Seeking a balance between the preservation of adequate flap thickness and maintenance of oncologic principles, the authors sought guidelines to help the oncologic surgeon identify the non-breast-bearing subcutaneous layer of tissue between the epithelial/dermal tissue of the breast and its parenchyma.
METHODS: Breast specimens of women receiving reduction mammaplasty were prospectively examined by an experienced, blinded breast pathologist. Subcutaneous tissue thickness was measured from caudal dermis to breast parenchyma and correlated with age, body mass index, and breast specimen weight.
RESULTS: No significant correlation was found between body mass index, age, or breast sample weight and the thickness of the subcutaneous tissue. Measurements did reveal a consistent and distinct layer of non-breast-bearing subcutaneous tissue between the dermis and the breast parenchyma, with a median thickness of about 1 cm.
CONCLUSION: Both oncologic safety and a viable skin flap can be achieved if the subcutaneous layer present in most breasts is used as a guide for elevating the skin flaps, with subsequent oncologically safe resection of the cancer-containing breast parenchyma."
21203781,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21203781/,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess the necessity of post-marketing safety monitoring focused on osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) in patients with bone metastatic cancer treated with denosumab (AMG162).
METHODS: The ONJ safety data from three randomized phase III trials were pooled, and risk ratios and power were computed using traditional methods and simulation.
RESULTS: A total of 89 ONJ cases (1.57%; 95% CI, 1.26-1.92) were reported with 52 (1.83%; 95% CI, 1.37-2.39) occurring in the denosumab group (n = 2,841) and 37 (1.30%; 95% CI, 0.92-1.79) in the zoledronic acid group (n = 2,836). Overall, the pooled risk ratio (RR) for ONJ was 1.40 (95% CI, 0.92-2.13; p = 0.11). In the trials reporting superior therapeutic efficacy of denosumab, the RR for ONJ was 1.61 (95% CI, 0.99-2.62; p = 0.052). However, neither separately nor pooled had any trial adequate power (>80%) to detect excess relative risks of ONJ of up to 76%, assuming fixed ONJ rates in the control arms. The joint power of the trials to detect the observed excess relative risk of 40% was only 36%. The rate of mucosal healing in patients with ONJ appeared similar in both groups (RR, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.66-2.45; p = 0.5).
CONCLUSIONS: Although the overall frequency of ONJ was low, post-marketing risk-benefit studies with this novel compound appear warranted focusing specifically on this rare toxicity, which can potentially have a high impact on quality of life."
21204977,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21204977/,"CONTEXT: Examination of factors related to the retention or voluntary turnover of Registered Nurses (RNs) has mainly focused on urban, acute care settings.
PURPOSE: This paper explored predictors of intent to leave (ITL) a nursing position in all rural and remote practice settings in Canada. Based on the conceptual framework developed for this project, potential predictors of ITL were related to the individual RN worker, the workplace, the community context, and satisfaction related to both the workplace and the community(s) within which the RN lived and worked.
METHODS: A national cross-sectional mail survey of RNs in rural and remote Canada provided the data (n = 3,051) for the logistic regression analysis of predictors of ITL.
FINDINGS: We found that RNs were more likely to plan to leave their nursing position within the next 12 months if they: were male, reported higher perceived stress, did not have dependent children or relatives, had higher education, were employed by their primary agency for a shorter time, had lower community satisfaction, had greater dissatisfaction with job scheduling, had lower satisfaction with their autonomy in the workplace, were required to be on call, performed advanced decisions or practice, and worked in a remote setting.
CONCLUSIONS: The statistical evidence for predictors of ITL supported our framework with determinants related to the individual, the workplace, the community, and satisfaction levels. The importance of community makes this framework uniquely relevant to the rural health context. Our findings should guide policy makers and employers in developing retention strategies."

DESIGN: A behavioral study comparing recently detoxified alcoholics with normal, healthy controls.
SETTING: Emotional intelligence and decoding of emotional non-verbal cues have been shown to be impaired in alcoholics. This study explores whether these deficits extend to conditional reasoning about social contracts.
PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-five recently detoxified alcoholics (17 men and eight women) were compared with 25 normal controls (17 men and eight women) matched for sex, age and education level.
MEASUREMENTS: Wason selection task investigating conditional reasoning on three different rule types (social contract, precautionary and descriptive), revised Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test, Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire (modified version) and additional control measures.
FINDINGS: Conditional reasoning was impaired in alcoholics. Performance on descriptive rules was not above chance. Reasoning performance was markedly better on social contract and precautionary rules, but this performance was still significantly lower than in controls. Several emotional intelligence measures were lower in alcoholics compared to controls, but these were not correlated with reasoning performance.
CONCLUSIONS: Conditional reasoning, including reasoning about social contracts and emotional intelligence appear to be impaired in alcoholics. Impairment seems to be particularly severe on descriptive rules. Impairment in social contract reasoning might lead to misunderstandings and frustration in social interactions, and reasoning difficulties about precautionary rules might contribute to risky behaviors in this population."
21205363,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21205363/,"BACKGROUND: Cognitive and psychiatric features are important components of dementia. Early onset dementia (EOD) has been found to be associated with a greater genetic basis. If this is the case, EOD could have genetic association with psychiatric illnesses, given the presence of more behavioral disturbances in this condition. There is a definite need to explore the presence of psychiatric symptoms and disorders in families of patients with dementia.
METHODS: The authors compared 52 proband families of dementia and 45 control families in order to assess the familial co-aggregation of major psychiatric illnesses. The cumulative risk in first degree relatives in the two groups for major psychiatric illnesses was calculated using Kaplan Meier Survival analysis. Early onset and late onset dementia proband families were compared separately with control families for the same.
RESULTS: There was a significantly higher morbid risk for psychosis in dementia proband families (generalized Wilcoxon, Breslow -4.165, p = 0.041). Also, the morbid risk was higher in early onset dementia proband families (generalized Wilcoxon, Breslow -6.16, p = 0.013) while it was not so in late onset dementia proband families (generalized Wilcoxon, Breslow -2.99, p = 0.084).
CONCLUSION: There is a possible genetic overlap between dementia and psychosis. This appears to be more pronounced with early onset dementia than with late onset dementia."

Multislice CT was able to detect and classify coronary plaques, compared with intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). The aim of the present study was to determine the accuracy of multislice computed tomography (CT) in addition to conventional angiography to identify aorto-ostial coronary stenosis characteristics before revascularisation.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with coronary ostial stenosis were selected for the study. All patients had selective coronary angiography and retrospectively ECG-gated multislice CT (Siemens AG, Munich, Germany). IVUS was performed in patients with ambiguous ostial stenosis revealed by angiography. Forty significant aorto-ostial lesions (38 patients) were analysed by two independent observers in comparison with an expert consensus blinded or not to the coronary CT data sets. Using CT in addition to angiography permitted observers to obtain a strong agreement for assessment of calcified lesions (kappa value 0.75), a good agreement for aortic plaques location and ideal stent position in aorto-ostial coronary stenosis.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that CT associated with an angiogram allows a better identification of aorto-ostial plaques morphology and ideal stent position in aorto-ostial coronary stenosis before angioplasty."
21205599,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21205599/,"AIMS: It has been stated that experienced physicians with a high volume of carotid artery stent (CAS) procedures have low complication rates, including cerebrovascular accidents (CVA). Complication rates, however, are not known for physicians with a low volume of CAS (<50 CAS/yr) but with a high volume of other peripheral endovascular procedures. Since the techniques used in CAS are similar to those used routinely in other peripheral interventions, we hypothesise that high volume peripheral interventional operators with appropriate training would have low complication rates during CAS procedures.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We reviewed all CAS procedures that were performed from 2004-2009 by an experienced physician with a high peripheral interventional volume (>250 interventions/year). Filter-based embolic protection devices were used during each CAS procedure. Each patient was followed for 30 days and data on major adverse cardiac and cerebral events (MACCE) collected. Ninety-two patients with ninety-five lesions were treated with CAS. Recent CVA was the indication in half of the patients and asymptomatic high-grade stenosis was the indication in the other half. Twenty-one (23%) patients had previous history of CEA and six (7%) patients had previous CAS in the contralateral side. All CAS procedures were technically successful. One patient (1.1%) had a TIA with total resolution of symptoms in ten minutes. There were no major strokes. MACCE rate was 1.1% at 30 days.
CONCLUSIONS: We found a very low complication rate following CAS with embolic protection performed by an experienced physician who has a relatively low CAS volume but a high volume of other peripheral interventions."
21206012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21206012/,"OBJECTIVE: Mixed results have been reported of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and their association with restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The current study examines whether multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), covering the full genomic region of MMP2 and MMP3, were associated with restenosis in the GENDER study population.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The GENetic DEterminants of Restenosis (GENDER) study enrolled 3104 consecutive patients after successful PCI. The primary endpoint was clinical restenosis, defined as target vessel revascularization (TVR), occurring in 9.8% of the patients. From the Hapmap database, 19 polymorphisms of MMP2 and 11 of MMP3 were selected. Furthermore, in a subpopulation, a genome-wide association analysis (GWA) was performed. No significant association was found with any of the investigated SNPs, including the previously reported 5A/6A polymorphism (rs3025058), with regard to TVR using single SNP analysis or haplotype analysis.
CONCLUSION: We found no significant association of MMP2 or MMP3 with TVR with this SNP-broad gene approach. Although we did not test all the known polymorphisms of these genes, using tagging analyses we examined those SNPs covering all known haplotypes of MMP2 and MMP3 to conclude that these genes do not correlate with a genetic risk of coronary restenosis after successful PCI."
21206103,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21206103/,"CONTEXT: Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are a recently classified pancreatic neoplasm with an increasing incidence. IPMN is often misdiagnosed as chronic pancreatitis because of symptoms of relapsing abdominal pain, pancreatitis, and steatorrhea and imaging findings of a dilated pancreatic duct of cystic lesions that are frequently confused with pseudocysts. Early recognition of IPMN allows for prompt surgical resection before malignant transformation.
CASE REPORTS: We report two cases of patients with long histories of chronic pancreatitis (more than 15 years) that went on to develop IPMN. Both patients presented with symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, steatorrhoea and eventually weight loss. Biochemical and radiological findings were suggestive of chronic pancreatitis although no clear causes for this were identified. Both patients were followed up with multiple repeat scans with no reported sinister findings. Many years after the initial diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis, radiological investigations identified pathological changes suggestive of neoplastic development and histology confirmed IPMN.
CONCLUSIONS: The cases demonstrate the ongoing challenges in diagnosing and managing IPMN effectively; highlights the important aspects of epidemiology in differentiating chronic pancreatitis and IPMN; continues the discussion surrounding the relationship between IPMN and chronic pancreatitis."
21206288,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21206288/,"BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive surgical approaches for total hip replacement, such as the modified Smith-Petersen approach, have been reported to be advantageous over alternative techniques because of reduced soft tissue damage and improved immediate postoperative rehabilitation. This study compares the advantages of the Smith-Petersen approach against the lateral Hardinge approach for femoral neck fractures in geriatric patients.
METHODS: In a randomized-controlled trial, 48 patients were treated by a hemiarthroplasty of the hip using either a modified Smith-Petersen or a Hardinge approach. Age, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, body mass index, blood loss, pain, and postoperative mobilization were compared between groups to detect statistically significant differences. The same outcome measures were analyzed for significant differences between patients with or without complications in each group.
RESULTS: The Smith-Petersen approach yielded a statistically significant increase in postoperative pain within the first 4 days and an increase in operation time. Complications were also associated with a significantly higher intraoperative time in the same group. However, 6 months postoperatively, there were no significant differences in the Harris Hip score between groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite early postoperative differences, postoperative mobility does not seem to be greatly influenced by the choice of either an anterior modified Smith-Petersen or a lateral Hardinge approach for hip hemiarthroplasty. Operative time was significantly linked to postoperative complications. In this respect, it can be concluded that it is not be the approach itself that determines the early postoperative result, but the routine the individual surgeon has with it."
21206293,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21206293/,"BACKGROUND: Viral respiratory infections (VRIs) are a common reason for ambulatory visits, and 35% are treated with an antibiotic. Antibiotic use for VRIs is not recommended, and it promotes antibiotic resistance. Effective patient-physician communication is critical to address this problem. Recognizing the importance of physician communication skills, licensure examinations were reformed in the United States and Canada to evaluate these skills.
OBJECTIVE: To assess whether physician clinical and communication skills, as measured by the Canadian clinical skills examination (CSE), predict antibiotic prescribing for VRI in ambulatory care.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: A total of 442 Quebec general practitioners and pediatricians who wrote the CSE in 1993-1996 were followed from 1993 to 2007, and their 159,456 VRI visits were identified from physician claims.
MEASURES: The outcome was an antibiotic prescription from a study physician dispensed within 7 days of the VRI visit. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to estimate the association between antibiotic prescribing for VRI and CSE score, adjusting for physician, patient, and encounter characteristics.
RESULTS: Better clinical and communication skills were associated with a reduction in the risk of antibiotic prescribing, but only for female physicians. Every 1-standard deviation increase in CSE score was associated with a 19% reduction in the risk of antibiotic prescribing (risk ratio, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.68-0.97). Better clinical skills were associated with an even greater reduction in risk among female physicians with higher workloads (risk ratio, 0.48; 95% confidence interval, 0.29-0.79).
CONCLUSION: Physician clinical and communication skills are important determinants of antibiotic prescribing for VRI and should be targeted by future interventions."

METHODS: Forty patients were recruited, 20 of whom were affected by hypercholesterolemia and 20 of whom were considered healthy. A videocapillaroscopic examination was carried out on the periodontal mucosa in the proximity of the frenulum (II, V sextant).
RESULTS: The difference between the parameters of the hypercholesterolemia group and the control group was evaluated with the Mann-Whitney U-test for non-parametric ordinal data; the level of significance being P<0.05. The videocapillaroscopy documented extremely significant differences between the two groups, regarding the following parameters: total diameter of the loop (P=0.0017), diameter of the afferent loops (P=0.0004), diameter of the efferent loops (P=0.00008) and periodontal density (P=0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: The capillaroscopic examination revealed a morphological alteration of the periodontal microcirculation in patients with hypercholesterolemia, which is an expression of peripheral vascular phlogosis."
21207163,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21207163/,"BACKGROUND: Postmastectomy breast reconstruction is an important component of breast cancer care, but few receive it at the time of the mastectomy. Virtually nothing is known about receipt of reconstruction after initial cancer therapy and why treatment might be delayed.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 5-year follow-up survey was mailed to a population-based cohort of mastectomy-treated breast cancer patients who were initially surveyed at time of diagnosis in 2002 and reported to the Los Angeles and Detroit SEER registries (N = 645, response rate 60%). Outcomes were receipt of reconstruction (immediate [IR], delayed [DR], or none) and patient appraisal of their treatment decisions.
RESULTS: About one-third (35.9%) had IR, 11.5% had DR, and 52.6% had no reconstruction. One-third delayed reconstruction because they focused more on other cancer interventions, and nearly half were concerned about surgical complications and interference with cancer surveillance. Two-thirds of those with no reconstruction said that the procedure was not important to them. A large proportion of all patients were satisfied with their reconstruction decision-making (89.4% IR, 78.4% DR, 80.4% no reconstruction, P = NS). However, only 59.3% of those with no reconstruction felt that they were adequately informed about their reconstructive options (vs 82.7% IR and 78.4% DR, P < .01).
CONCLUSIONS: There was modest uptake of breast reconstruction after initial cancer treatment. Factors associated with delayed reconstruction were primarily related to uncertainty about the procedure, concern about cancer surveillance, and low priority. Those without reconstruction demonstrated significant informational needs, which should be addressed with future research efforts."
21208086,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21208086/,"OBJECTIVE: To test the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference between the chitosan-containing and conventional nonfluoridated dentifrices in inhibition of enamel demineralization around orthodontic brackets.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixteen orthodontic patients who were scheduled to have extraction of four first premolars for orthodontic reasons were divided into two groups after the power of the study was estimated. Patients in the experimental group were instructed to use chitosan-containing dentifrice (AloeDent), and patients in the control group were instructed to use nonfluoridated dentifrice (Sensodyne Mint). After 60 days, the teeth were extracted and longitudinally sectioned. The demineralization was assessed by cross-sectional microhardness. The determinations were made at the bracket edge cementing limits and at occlusal and cervical points, 100 µm and 200 µm away from the edge. In all these positions, indentations were made at depths of 10, 20, 30, 50, 70, and 90 µm from the enamel surface. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey test were used for statistical evaluation at P < .05 level.
RESULTS: ANOVA showed statistically significant differences for the factors of dentifrice type, position, and depth (P  =  .000). Statistically significant differences for microhardness values between two tested dentifrices were observed up to 20 µm of depth from the enamel surface (P < .05). Lower microhardness values were found for nonfluoridated dentifrice. Significant microhardness differences were also determined between materials at occlusal and cervical 0 µm positions (P < .05). At these positions, chitosan-containing dentifrice showed lower demineralization than the control.
CONCLUSION: Chitosan-containing dentifrice may reduce the enamel decalcification found in patients with poor oral hygiene. The null hypothesis is rejected."
21208384,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21208384/,"AIM: To critically examine the orthodox view that young people's health and wellbeing are continuing to improve in line with historic trends.
METHODS: Transdisciplinary synthesis is used to analyse and integrate a wide range of evidence on young people's health and wellbeing. Synthesis seeks coherence in the overall conceptual picture rather than precision in the empirical detail.
RESULTS: The orthodox view rests mainly on declining mortality among teenagers and young adults, and findings that most say they are healthy, happy and satisfied with life. With health improving for most, the focus of attention is on social inequalities in health. However, mortality rates understate the growing importance of non-fatal, chronic health problems, especially mental illness; self-reported health and happiness are flawed indicators of overall well being. Evidence suggests that rates of mental illness in young people have increased over time, and are higher than in older age groups. Explanatory factors include quite fundamental features of modern societies, which go beyond inequality and disadvantage; trends in these factors predict a deterioration in health and wellbeing.
CONCLUSION: Contrary to the dominant view that young people have never been healthier, their health and wellbeing may have declined over several generations. Which perspective is right has important implications for understanding and addressing youth mental health problems, implications that go well beyond medical interventions."
21208577,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21208577/,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the bereavement exclusion criterion for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) major depressive episode (MDE) is to identify subjects with a modest, self-limited, ""normal"" depressive syndrome. One would therefore expect less severe depressive symptoms and a different and better outcome for bereaved subjects who were excluded from the diagnosis of MDE as compared to MDE controls. In a previous cross-sectional study, we have shown such expectations were not met. Herein, we further challenge the accuracy of the bereavement exclusion criterion regarding response to treatment.
METHOD: In a database of 12,615 subjects seeking treatment for depression, 1,138 (9.0%) individuals met DSM-IV MDE criteria except the bereavement exclusion criterion. This sample was matched for age, gender, educational level, and number of previous depressive episodes with 1,138 MDE patients. The bereavement exclusion and MDE groups were prospectively assessed for outcome after 6 weeks of treatment. Primary outcome measures included the number of DSM-IV MDE symptoms and the presence/absence of DSM-IV MDE Criterion A symptoms at follow-up.
RESULTS: The bereavement exclusion individuals had higher levels of DSM-IV MDE symptoms (P = .005) and self-rated depression (P < .0001) than MDE controls. Both groups had a similar 6-week outcome: 37.7% versus 39.9%, respectively, were responders to treatment, and 80.1% versus 82.2% no longer had the MDE DSM-IV symptom criteria at follow-up (P = .33).
CONCLUSIONS: The DSM-IV bereavement exclusion for MDE is inadequate according to response to treatment, at least in this sample of individuals seeking treatment for depressive symptoms. It is proposed that bereavement, just as any stressful event, could be noted but without its affecting the treatment decision."
21208585,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21208585/,"OBJECTIVE: Animal studies have shown sex differences in the impact of prenatal maternal stress on the offspring. The aim of this prospective case-control study was to assess the effect of prenatal depression on newborn and 1-year-old infant characteristics as related to gender, controlling for confounding variables.
METHOD: We screened 205 pregnant women from April 2004 to November 2006 for depressive symptoms. Inclusion in the prenatal depression group (n = 34) was based on meeting DSM-IV criteria for major depressive episode. We excluded postnatal depression from the control group (n = 79) by routine screening at 2 and 6 months. Newborn and 1-year-old infant characteristics were evaluated with the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS) and the Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment, respectively.
RESULTS: Despite our use of numerous exclusion criteria (eg, at-risk pregnancy, preterm delivery), prenatal depression highly correlated with anxiety and stress scores. Male newborns of mothers with prenatal depression had lower scores than controls on the motor skills and regulation of states NBAS clusters (P = .03 and P = .026, respectively). At 1 year, infants of prenatally depressed mothers presented higher scores on generalized anxiety (P = .002), particularly in males (P = .009); activity/impulsivity (P = .042); and sleep problems (P = .023) than controls.
CONCLUSIONS: As in animal studies, depression during pregnancy may affect infant development in a way that is related to gender. Early gender differences observed to be associated with depression, stress, and anxiety during pregnancy may be a key to understanding the higher prevalence in males of child psychiatric disorders."
21208591,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21208591/,"OBJECTIVE: Depression is associated with immune activation as well as oxidative stress. Statins have in vitro and in vivo antiinflammatory and antioxidative properties. We prospectively investigated whether the use of statins was associated with a reduced risk of development of depression in individuals who have had a cardiac event or intervention.
METHOD: Participants were recruited between May 2005 and March 2006 from the Geelong Hospital, Geelong, Australia, a tertiary hospital in regional Australia that serves a catchment area shown to be representative of the broader Australian community. Patients who were hospitalized for angioplasty, myocardial infarction, or coronary artery bypass graft surgery (N = 193) were followed up prospectively for 9 months to assess development of depression. Depression data were collected 3 months postdischarge (T1) by structured clinical interview (using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, version 5) and 9 months postdischarge (T2) by self-report (using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale). Major depressive disorder, minor depression, and dysthymia were diagnosed according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria. Data on statins were collected from medical records. The association between statin therapy and depression was tested using both linear and logistic regression models controlling for clinical, psychological, and demographic confounders.
RESULTS: At discharge, 157 participants (81.3%) were receiving statin therapy. Adjusting for possible confounders, taking statins at discharge had a protective effect on depression at T1, reducing the likelihood of dysthymia, minor depression, or major depression by 69% (95% CI, 0.097-0.972; P = .045). At the T2 end point, statin therapy again had a protective effect and was associated with a 79% reduction in the likelihood of depression (95% CI, 0.052-0.876; P = .032). The linear regression model to predict depression at T2 was significantly different from zero (F(11,180) = 8.686, P < .001) and explained 36.3% of the variance in depression.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of statins was associated with significant reduction in the risk of depression in individuals who have had a cardiac event. This supports the role of oxidative and inflammatory processes in depression and opens the door to rational and novel pathophysiologically based therapies distinct from conventional antidepressants."
21208595,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21208595/,"BACKGROUND: Dimensional models of personality are under consideration for integration into the next Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), but the clinical utility of such models is unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To test the ability of clinical researchers who specialize in personality disorders to diagnose personality disorders using dimensional assessments and to compare those researchers' ratings of clinical utility for a dimensional system versus for the DSM-IV.
METHOD: A sample of 73 researchers who had each published at least 3 (median = 15) articles on personality disorders participated between December 2008 and January 2009. The Five-Factor Model (FFM), one of the most-studied dimensional models to date, was compared to the DSM-IV. Participants provided diagnoses for case profiles in DSM-IV and FFM formats and then rated the DSM-IV and FFM on 6 aspects of clinical utility.
RESULTS: Overall, participants had difficulty identifying correct diagnoses from FFM profiles (t₇₂ = 12.36, P < .01), and the same held true for a subset reporting equal familiarity with the DSM-IV and FFM (t₂₃ = 6.96, P < .01). Participants rated the FFM as less clinically useful than the DSM for making prognoses, devising treatment plans, and communicating with professionals (all t₆₉ > 2.19, all P < .05), but more useful for communicating with patients (t₆₉ = 3.03, P < .01).
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that personality disorder expertise and familiarity with the FFM are insufficient to correctly diagnose personality disorders using FFM profiles. Because of ambiguity inherent in FFM profile descriptors, this insufficiency may prove unlikely to be attenuated with increased clinical familiarity with the FFM."
21208765,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21208765/,"BACKGROUND: Surges in patient volumes compromise emergency departments' (EDs') ability to deliver care, as shown by the recent H1N1 influenza (flu) epidemic. Media reports are important in informing the public about health threats, but the effects of media-induced anxiety on ED volumes are unclear.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to examine the effect of widespread public concern about flu on ED use.
METHODS: We reviewed ED data from an integrated health system operating 18 hospital EDs. We compared ED visits during three 1-week periods: (a) a period of heightened public concern regarding flu before the disease was present (""Fear Week""), (b) a subsequent period of active disease (""Flu Week""), and (c) a week before widespread concern (""Control Week""). Fear Week was identified from an analysis of statewide Google electronic searches for ""swine flu"" and from media announcements about flu. Flu Week was identified from statewide epidemiological data.
RESULTS: Data were reviewed from 22 608 visits during the study periods. Fear Week (n = 7712) and Flu Week (n = 7687) were compared to Control Week (n = 7209). Fear Week showed a 7.0% increase in visits (95% confidence interval, 6-8). Pediatric visits increased by 19.7%, whereas adult visits increased by 1%. Flu Week showed an increase over Control Week of 6.6% (95% confidence interval, 6-7). Pediatric visits increased by 10.6%, whereas adult visits increased by 4.8%.
CONCLUSION: At a time of heightened public concern regarding flu but little disease prevalence, EDs experienced substantial increases in patient volumes. These increases were significant and comparable to the increases experienced during the subsequent epidemic of actual disease."
21209505,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21209505/,"INTRODUCTION: Endotracheal intubation can produce various degrees of temporary and sometimes permanent damage to the laryngotracheal mechanism. Recent development of computer based voice analysis technology can now detect a minute changes in acoustic waveforms which a normal human ear cannot. In the study we compared and analyzed the acoustic waveforms of 35 patients undergoing surgery under intubation anaesthesia.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present series is to analyze the effects of short term intubation with computerized voice laboratory.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Values of acoustic waveforms obtained from 35 patients were compared 48 hours after the short term endotracheal intubation anaesthesia. The comparisons were made in terms of perturbation (jitter and shimmer), harmonic- to noise ratio (HNR) and fundamental frequency (F0).
RESULTS: The pre-intubated voice characteristics when compared with the post-intubation group did not reveal any statistical difference (P>0.05). However, there was only a minimal decrease in F0.
CONCLUSION: The study revealed that, short term intubation anaesthesia does not alter the acoustic characteristics. The analysis of acoustic waveforms is a non invasive technique that helps to evaluate the effects of tracheal intubation on laryngeal function, a technique that warrants further evaluation."

Primary goal of this procedure is to achieve good cosmetic outcome, reduced post operative pain, early recovery and reduced hospital admission.
OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this study is to see the feasibility and benefit of performing advance laparoscopic surgery in a place where basic laparoscopic surgery is done and to share my experience while performing it.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study of case sheets and discharge summary from 1st May 2008 till 1st August 2009 was done. Altogether eight patients underwent different advanced laparoscopic procedure. Cases done for the fi rst time in the institute and those done by himself were only included. Technical feasibility, use of devices like harmonic scalpel, need for incision extension, operative time, blood product requirement, ambulation and enteral feed, post operative hospital stay and patients satisfaction regarding minimal scars were assessed.
RESULT: Total eight patients underwent advance laparoscopic surgery. There were two common bile duct (CBD) exploration of which one was transcystic exploration, one total laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection (APR) for rectal cancer, one laparoscopic assisted right hemicolectomy for carcinoma ceacum, one laparoscopic assisted sigmoid colectomy for recurrent sigmoid volvulus, two laparoscopic right nephrectomy for non functioning right kidney, one retroperitoneal pyelolithotomy and one laparoscopic assisted splenectomy for massive splenomegaly with haemolytic anaemia. All procedures were technically feasible with basic laparoscopic instruments. However harmonic scalpel was required for splenectomy due to difficult hilum dissection. Ureteroscope was used as a choledochoscope in CBD exploration. Blood transfusion was required only in patient with low preoperative haemoglobin. Early ambulation and enteral feed was done within 24 hours in all and within 48 hours in patients who had bowel anastomosis. Post operative hospital stay was 5-8 days. Cosmetic scar was appreciated by all. Although long term oncological outcome is yet to come in malignancy case, biopsy report of laparoscopic APR identified 13 nodes which shows complete nodal dissection on oncological principal basis.
CONCLUSION: Advanced laparoscopy is feasible, safe and effective in the hand of surgeons performing basic laparoscopic surgeries with guidance from surgeons who have long experience on same procedures but by open method."
21209587,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21209587/,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the perioperative outcome and long-term survival of patients who underwent surgical resection for recurrent rectal cancer within a multimodal approach in the era of total mesorectal excision (TME).
BACKGROUND: Introduction of TME has reduced local recurrence and improved oncological outcome of patients with rectal cancer. Local recurrence after TME still occurs in 2% to 8% of patients and presents a challenge to surgical and medical oncologists. However, there has been very limited data on the perioperative and long-term outcome of patients who are operated for local recurrence in the era of TME.
METHODS: A total of 107 patients who were identified from a prospective rectal cancer database underwent surgical exploration for recurrent rectal cancer after previous TME between October 2001 and April 2009. Risk factors of perioperative morbidity were analyzed using a multivariate logistic regression model. Independent predictors of disease-specific survival were identified by a Cox proportional hazards regression model, as were those of local recurrence and disease recurrence at any site.
RESULTS: Surgical resection was performed in 92 patients and negative resection margins were achieved in 54 (58.7%) of these. Recurrent disease was located intraluminally and extraluminally in 35 (38.0%) patients and 57 (62.0%) patients, respectively. A total of 19 (20.6%) patients had metastatic extrapelvic disease at the time of surgery. Perioperative surgical morbidity and in-hospital mortality accounted for 42.4% and 3.3%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, partial sacrectomy was associated with surgical morbidity (P = 0.004). Three- and 5-year disease-specific survival rates were 61% and 47%. Three-year survival rate of patients with extrapelvic disease who underwent R0 resection was 42%. On multivariate analysis, surgical morbidity (P = 0.001), presence of extrapelvic disease (P = 0.006), and noncurative (R1; R2) resection (P < 0.0001) were identified as independent adverse predictors of disease-specific survival, whereas a transabdominal resection (as opposed to an abdominoperineal resection/pelvic exenteration) was associated with a more favorable prognosis (P = 0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: Surgical resection of local recurrence from rectal cancer in the era TME can be carried out with acceptable morbidity and curative resection rates. Curative resection remains the major prognostic factor and may enable long-term survival even in patients with extrapelvic disease."
21209945,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21209945/,"BACKGROUND: When domestic taurine cattle diffused from the Fertile Crescent, local wild aurochsen (Bos primigenius) were still numerous. Moreover, aurochsen and introduced cattle often coexisted for millennia, thus providing potential conditions not only for spontaneous interbreeding, but also for pastoralists to create secondary domestication centers involving local aurochs populations. Recent mitochondrial genomes analyses revealed that not all modern taurine mtDNAs belong to the shallow macro-haplogroup T of Near Eastern origin, as demonstrated by the detection of three branches (P, Q and R) radiating prior to the T node in the bovine phylogeny. These uncommon haplogroups represent excellent tools to evaluate if sporadic interbreeding or even additional events of cattle domestication occurred.
METHODOLOGY: The survey of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control-region variation of 1,747 bovine samples (1,128 new and 619 from previous studies) belonging to 37 European breeds allowed the identification of 16 novel non-T mtDNAs, which after complete genome sequencing were confirmed as members of haplogroups Q and R. These mtDNAs were then integrated in a phylogenetic tree encompassing all available P, Q and R complete mtDNA sequences.
CONCLUSIONS: Phylogenetic analyses of 28 mitochondrial genomes belonging to haplogroups P (N = 2), Q (N = 16) and R (N = 10) together with an extensive survey of all previously published mtDNA datasets revealed major similarities between haplogroups Q and T. Therefore, Q most likely represents an additional minor lineage domesticated in the Near East together with the founders of the T subhaplogroups. Whereas, haplogroup R is found, at least for the moment, only in Italy and nowhere else, either in modern or ancient samples, thus supporting an origin from European aurochsen. Haplogroup R could have been acquired through sporadic interbreeding of wild and domestic animals, but our data do not rule out the possibility of a local and secondary event of B. primigenius domestication in Italy."
21210310,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21210310/,"BACKGROUND: Normal function of the upper limb is seldom restored after limb-sparing surgery for tumors of the proximal humerus. The literature suggests superior shoulder function is achieved in the short term with reverse total shoulder arthroplasty compared to other techniques when performed for conditions with rotator cuff deficiency. It is unclear whether this superiority is maintained when reverse total shoulder arthroplasty is performed for tumors.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: When performed for tumors, we determined whether reverse total shoulder arthroplasty restores function and improves motion, the complications associated with the surgery, and whether reverse total shoulder arthroplasty with autologous grafting is associated with bone resorption.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 14 patients who had undergone reverse total shoulder arthroplasty for tumors of the proximal humerus. Four patients died, leaving nine patients for review. The surviving patients were evaluated clinically and radiographically. The minimum followup was 0.6 years (mean, 7.7 years; range, 0.6-12 years).
RESULTS: At last followup, mean active abduction was 157° and mean functional Constant-Murley score was 76%. One patient had a deep infection and one developed a loose prosthesis; both were treated with single-stage exchange. At last followup, both patients had reasonable function without evidence of infection or loosening. Radiographic graft resorption was seen in all but one patient.
CONCLUSIONS: Our observations suggest, at medium-term followup, reverse total shoulder arthroplasty is a reasonable option for tumors of the proximal humerus. It has low morbidity, restores a mean active abduction of 157°, and limits the impairment of activities of daily living.

21210313,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21210313/,"BACKGROUND: Distal femoral osteotomies (DFO) can be used to correct deformities around the knee. Although osteotomies can be fixed with either internal or external fixation techniques, the advantages of one over the other are unclear.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked whether (1) for both techniques, we could accurately correct the deformities based on our preoperative goals for mechanical axis deviation (MAD) and lateral distal femoral angle (LDFA), and (2) intraoperative times, (3) preoperative and postoperative knee ROM, and (4) complications differed.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified 26 patients (34 limbs) who underwent femoral osteotomies. We compared accuracy of correction (based on correction of the MAD and the LDFA), duration of surgery, preoperative and postoperative knee ROM, and complications. The minimum followup was 20 months (mean, 29 months; range, 20-40 months).
RESULTS: We achieved the desired MAD within 10 mm of the goal in 18 of 21 limbs with the unilateral frame and in 12 of 13 limbs using fixator-assisted plating. Operative time for fixator-assisted plating was longer (122 ± 34 minutes) than when using a unilateral frame (94 ± 65 minutes). Preoperative and postoperative knee ROMs were similar for both techniques and there were no major complications.
CONCLUSIONS: We obtained accurate correction of deformities with both fixation techniques. Our experience suggests the method to be used should be left to the discretion of the surgeon and the needs and wishes of the patient after adequate explanation of the advantages and disadvantages.

21210315,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21210315/,"BACKGROUND: Using a tethering technique, a porcine model of scoliosis has been created. Ideally, tether release before placement and evaluation of corrective therapies would lead to persistent scoliosis.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: Does release of the spinal tether result in persistent deformity?
METHODS: Using a unilateral spinal tether and ipsilateral rib cage tethering, scoliosis was initiated on seven pigs. The spinal tether was released after progression to a Cobb angle of 50°. Biweekly radiographs were taken for 18 weeks after tether release to evaluate longitudinal changes in coronal and sagittal Cobb angles. Postmortem fine-cut CT scans were used to evaluate vertebral and disc wedging and axial rotation; results were compared to a previously published data set of 11 animals euthanized before release of the tether (control group).
RESULTS: Radiographic analysis demonstrated two responses to tether release: a persistent deformity group and an autocorrective group. Differences between these two groups included number of days with the tether in place before reaching a Cobb angle of 50° and degree of deformity immediately after scoliosis induction. CT analysis of the tether release versus tether intact groups demonstrated progression in vertebral body wedging without differences in apical rotation.
CONCLUSIONS: With the appropriate inducing parameters, release of the spinal tether does not systematically result in deformity correction. Tether release resulted in a reduction in Cobb angle in the first several weeks followed by steady curve progression. Deformity progression was confirmed using detailed CT morphometric analysis."
21210540,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21210540/,"AIM: To analyse the performance of HbA(1c) in diagnosing Type 2 diabetes based on fasting plasma glucose and/or 2-h plasma glucose measurements after a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test.
METHODS: This is a study of diagnostic test accuracy in individuals referred to the Clinical Pathology Department for oral glucose tolerance testing. After fasting overnight, HbA(1c), fasting plasma glucose and 2-h plasma glucose were measured. The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to evaluate the diagnostic performance of HbA(1c).
RESULTS: Four hundred and ninety-eight subjects (195 male, mean age 56 years) were enrolled and 115 (23.1%) were diagnosed with diabetes according to glucose-based methods and only 56 (11.2%) individuals were identified by HbA(1c) ≥ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) (sensitivity 20.9%, specificity 95.3%). There is poor agreement between the newly recommended criterion and the current glucose-based diagnostic criteria (κ = 0.217; P < 0.001), probably because the diagnostic methods identify different populations of patients. Adding a glucose-based method into an algorithm, as proposed by the UK Department of Health, improved HbA(1c) performance.
CONCLUSIONS: HbA(1c) ≥ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) showed limited sensitivity to diabetes diagnosis, although with high specificity. The results suggest that this cut-off point would not be enough to diagnose diabetes. Its use as the sole diabetes diagnostic test should be interpreted with caution to assure the correct classification of diabetic individuals."
21211481,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21211481/,"OBJECTIVE: In this article we investigate the possibility to account for selection bias in observational data by using econometric techniques.
METHODS: One-year costs of 15,237 patients who received a drug-eluting stent (DES) or a bare metal stent (BMS) in Belgium in 2004 were compared. The treatment choice between DES and BMS could be influenced by patient characteristics; therefore, cost estimates could be biased by overt and/or hidden selection bias. Overt bias was addressed by regression adjustment and propensity score matching. Hidden selection bias was dealt with by using an instrumental variable (IV) approach.
RESULTS: Due to the higher purchase price DES patients incur higher (unadjusted) costs in the short-term; these costs are, however, compensated in the long-term due to less in-stent restenosis and hospitalizations. Analyses indicated that, for the diabetic population, the null hypothesis of similar average 1-year costs of patients receiving a BMS or DES cannot be rejected. For the non-diabetic patients a significant cost difference between BMS and DES patients was found. It cannot be ruled out that the treatment-effect model does not correct for all observable or unobservable characteristics and that the estimated treatment effect is biased, possibly due to weak instruments.
CONCLUSION: It is interesting and necessary to explore the use of econometric tools in cost and cost effectiveness analysis to investigate the effect of a technology in everyday practice and to take into account patient and disease characteristics and uncertainty. Further research is however necessary to investigate how we can fully correct for selection bias when using observational data."

METHODS: Data were derived from the Adalimumab Trial evaluating Long-term efficacy and safety for Ankylosing Spondylitis (ATLAS). The study team specified 90 a priori hypotheses regarding the direction and magnitude of the expected associations between the overall and single-attribute scores of the HUI-3 and other health status and quality-of-life measures: Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36), Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality-of-Life Questionnaire, Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index, Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index, Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index, and Patient's and Physician's Global Assessments of Disease Activity. With baseline data, correlation coefficients were calculated and interpreted according to the guidelines suggested by Guyatt for negligible (0-0.19), weak (0.20-0.34), moderate (0.35-0.50), and strong (>0.5) associations. The a priori hypotheses were tested using Pearson's correlation coefficients.
RESULTS: A total of 315 patients with active AS were randomized and enrolled in ATLAS. The correlation coefficients between the HUI-3 scores and other health-related quality-of-life instruments confirmed 61.1% of the a priori hypotheses, with an additional 35.5% being under- or overestimated by one correlation category.
CONCLUSION: These results provide evidence of the cross-sectional, convergent, and discriminative validity of the HUI-3 for deriving utility scores in patients with AS."
21211501,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21211501/,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of tissue selectivity of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on mortality and morbidity in patients following acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study using a Medicaid claims database was conducted. Patients hospitalized for an AMI and subsequently filling a prescription for an ACE inhibitor were followed longitudinally for the occurrence of cardiovascular-related hospitalizations and all-cause mortality. A subanalysis was also conducted to account for switching/discontinuation of ACE inhibitor therapy. Stepwise (forward conditional) Cox-proportional hazards models were used to analyze the effect of tissue selectivity on study outcomes.
RESULTS: The final study sample consisted of 689 AMI and the results indicated that tissue-selective ACE inhibitors had a protective effect against hospitalization due to stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA) (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.265; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.101-0.698). A similar lower rate in hospitalizations due to heart failure was observed in the group using tissue-selective ACE inhibitors; however, the results were not statistically significant (HR = 0.681; 95% CI = 0.436-1.063). A protective effect was also observed on the combined outcome of hospitalization due to any cardiovascular condition (HR = 0.712; 95% CI = 0.536-0.945). Hospitalizations due to recurrent AMI, need for coronary revascularization procedures, and mortality were not significantly different between patients using tissue-selective and non-tissue-selective ACE inhibitors. The completer subanalysis provided similar findings regarding the impact of tissue selectivity on study outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Tissue-selective ACE inhibitors may have a protective effect against hospitalization due to stroke/TIA or heart failure when compared to non-tissue-selective ACE inhibitors for patients following AMI."
21211687,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21211687/,"OBJECTIVES: This study describes 5-year follow-up results of catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF).
BACKGROUND: Long-term efficacy following catheter ablation of AF remains unknown.
METHODS: A total of 100 patients (86 men, 14 women), age 55.7 ± 9.6 years, referred to our center for a first AF ablation (63% paroxysmal; 3.5 ± 1.4 prior ineffective antiarrhythmic agents) were followed for 5 years. Complete success was defined as absence of any AF or atrial tachycardia recurrence (clinical or by 24-h Holter monitoring) lasting ≥ 30 s.
RESULTS: Arrhythmia-free survival rates after a single catheter ablation procedure were 40%, 37%, and 29% at 1, 2, and 5 years, respectively, with most recurrences over the first 6 months. Patients with long-standing persistent AF experienced a higher recurrence rate than those with paroxysmal or persistent forms (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.9, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.0 to 3.5; p = 0.0462). In all, 175 procedures were performed, with a median of 2 per patient. Arrhythmia-free survival following the last catheter ablation procedure was 87%, 81%, and 63% at 1, 2, and 5 years, respectively. Valvular heart disease (HR: 6.0, 95% CI: 2.0 to 17.6; p = 0.0012) and nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (HR: 34.0, 95% CI: 6.3 to 182.1; p < 0.0001) independently predicted recurrences. Major complications (cardiac tamponade requiring drainage) occurred in 3 patients (3%).
CONCLUSIONS: In selected patients with AF, a catheter ablation strategy with repeat intervention as necessary provides acceptable long-term relief. Although most recurrences transpire over the first 6 to 12 months, a slow but steady decline in arrhythmia-free survival is noted thereafter."
21211992,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21211992/,"PURPOSE: Filter tilt is often seen with conical filters and adversely affects retrievability and clot trapping efficiency. In addition, tilt may also alter flow dynamics. This study uses computational fluid dynamics to evaluate flow past an unoccluded and partially occluded Celect inferior vena cava filter (Cook, Bloomington, Indiana). In particular, the hemodynamic response to thrombus volume and filter tilt is examined, and the results are compared with flow conditions known to be thrombogenic.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Computer models of an upright and tilted Celect filter are constructed using high-resolution digital photographs and methods of computer-aided design. The three-dimensional models are placed inside a model cava, and steady-state flow past unoccluded and partially occluded filters is computed.
RESULTS: The volume of stagnant and recirculating flow increases with thrombus volume. In addition, as filter tilt increases, the cava wall in the direction of filter tilt is subjected to low-velocity flow and gives rise to regions of low wall shear stress.
CONCLUSIONS: Flow conditions caused by the tilted Celect filter may elevate the risk of intra/perifilter thrombosis and facilitate vascular remodeling. This latter condition may increase the potential for incorporation of the hook of the filter into the vena cava wall, thereby complicating filter retrieval. These findings also suggest that further long-term clinical follow-up with conical filters should be pursued with a specific evaluation of tilt as a factor of intrafilter thrombus and thrombosis."
21211999,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21211999/,"BACKGROUND: Tricuspid regurgitation is common in patients with advanced heart failure. The ideal operative strategy for managing tricuspid valve regurgitation (TR) in patients undergoing left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation is unclear. This study was designed to evaluate the effect on outcomes of concomitant tricuspid valve repair (TVR) for moderate to severe (3(+)/4(+)) TR at the time of LVAD implantation.
METHODS: Patients with >3(+) TR who underwent LVAD implantation from 2005 to 2009 were retrospectively evaluated. Pre-, intra- and post-operative data, including hemodynamics, inotrope requirements and end-organ function parameters, were considered. Outcomes of patients receiving TVR were compared with those who did not receive TVR (NTVR).
RESULTS: Seventy-two LVADs were implanted during the study period. Forty-two (58%) patients had ≥ 3(+) TR prior to LVAD implantation. Eight patients underwent TVR and 34 patients did not undergo TVR (NTVR). There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics or severity of TR between the two groups. The TVR group had a longer cardiopulmonary bypass time (p < 0.01) and required more blood products (p < 0.05). Higher post-operative creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) values were noted in the TVR group. One patient in the TVR group and 3 patients in the NTVR group required right-sided mechanical assistance (p = 0.6). There was no significant difference in short- or long-term mortality between the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: TVR for ≥ 3(+) TR prolonged operative time and showed similar outcomes compared with LVAD implantation alone. A benefit of performing TVR was not demonstrated. As such, TVR may not be necessary at the time of LVAD implantation."
21212375,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21212375/,"BACKGROUND: Passive mobilization of shoulder region joints, often in conjunction with other treatment modalities, is used for the treatment of people with shoulder pain and minimal movement restriction. However, there is only limited evidence supporting the efficacy of this treatment modality.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether passive mobilization of shoulder region joints adds treatment benefit over exercise and advice alone for people with shoulder pain and minimal movement restriction.
DESIGN: This was a randomized controlled clinical trial with short-, medium- and longer-term follow-up.
SETTING: The study was conducted in a metropolitan teaching hospital.
PATIENTS: Ninety-eight patients with shoulder pain of local mechanical origin and minimal shoulder movement restriction were randomly allocated to either a control group (n=51) or an experimental group (n=47).
INTERVENTION: Participants in both groups received advice and exercises designed to restore neuromuscular control at the shoulder. In addition, participants in the experimental group received passive mobilization specifically applied to shoulder region joints.
MEASUREMENTS: Outcome measurements of shoulder pain and functional impairment, self-rated change in symptoms, and painful shoulder range of motion were obtained at 1, 3, and 6 months after entry into the trial. All data were analyzed using the intention-to-treat principle by repeated-measures analyses of covariance.
RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were detected in any of the outcome measurements between the control and experimental groups at short-, medium-, or longer-term follow-up.
LIMITATIONS: Therapists and participants were not blinded to the treatment allocation.
CONCLUSION: This randomized controlled clinical trial does not provide evidence that the addition of passive mobilization, applied to shoulder region joints, to exercise and advice is more effective than exercise and advice alone in the treatment of people with shoulder pain and minimal movement restriction."
21213147,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21213147/,"QUESTIONS: Are the guidelines for serological testing in pregnancy followed, and are the results on hand on admission to the labour ward?
METHODS: From 1.1.2007 to 31.12.2007, all patients' records were checked for serological analyses on admission to the labour ward. The serologies tabulated included tests for rubella, toxoplasmosis, hepatitis B, syphilis, HIV, varicella, cytomegalovirus infection (CMV) and parvovirus B19.
RESULTS: A total of 723 pregnant women were included. Rubella and toxoplasmosis serologies were missing in 1.66% of cases, hepatitis B in 2.77%, syphilis in 12.72%, and HIV in 30.57%. Serological testing for varicella, CMV and parvovirus B19 were carried out in only about 10% of patients. We found that 95.81% of Swiss/Austrian/German patients were immune to rubella compared to 89.59% for patients from other origins. A total of 50.0% of Swiss/Austrian/German patients and 27.44% of patients from other origins were immune to toxoplasmosis. As for hepatitis B antibodies (0.25 vs. 1.26%) and syphilis (only 1 patient tested positive), no significant differences were found. HIV tests were negative for all patients.
CONCLUSIONS: To sum up, in our collective, serologic testing for rubella, toxoplasmosis and hepatitis B is carried out in almost all pregnant women. The high rate of women not screened for HIV infection clearly contradicts the recommendations of the Federal Office of Public Health and calls for increased education of physicians."
21213156,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21213156/,"OBJECTIVE: Using New Zealand as a case study, to determine whether ethnicity is appropriate for communicating sun exposure health promotion messages.
DESIGN: This study reviews recent literature on minimising skin cancer risk and achieving sufficient serum vitamin D levels. It draws on a variety of scientific literature, reports and media statements to determine appropriate sun exposure messages for minimising skin cancer risk and achieving sufficient vitamin D status among the New Zealand population, which is diverse with regards to both ethnicity and skin colour.
RESULT(S): Due to a unique combination of factors, New Zealand and Australia lead the world in melanoma incidence. Devising ways of minimising skin cancer risk and achieving optimal vitamin D blood levels among the New Zealand population provide major challenges for researchers and health promoters. These challenges include the many unknowns and uncertainties about vitamin D, such as determining what constitutes an optimal level as well as its association with specific diseases. There is strong evidence that skin cancer, including melanoma, is caused by excess harmful sun exposure with skin colour having long been established as a risk factor. More recently, there has been significant focus in New Zealand on the potential beneficial aspects of sun exposure, mainly in assisting vitamin D synthesis, especially for Maori and Pacific people. But research also shows that Maori and Pacific people are increasingly at risk of developing melanoma. In New Zealand, where there is a high rate of ethnic intermarriage and ethnicity is culturally constructed, there is likely to have been a weakening of the relationship between ethnicity and skin colour. Skin colour information is required to understand both the risks and benefits of sun exposure. In the immediate future, ethnicity appears likely to remain an important reference point for assessing the risks and benefits of sun exposure in New Zealand. However, we contend that while ethnic-based channels may be useful for communicating appropriate sun exposure messages, there are dangers in such advice based on membership of particular ethnic group(s). Rather skin colour, along with other key variables, such as season and time of day, should be the core considerations for assessing and discussing risk. In the longer term, direct measures of skin type are needed when assessing the risks and benefits of sun exposure, including the potential protective effects against various illnesses.
CONCLUSION: While ethnic-based dissemination channels may be useful for communicating about the risks and benefits of sun exposure in New Zealand, discussion of risk factors should focus on skin colour."
21214057,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21214057/,"OBJECTIVES: Recent downward trends in breast cancer incidence have been attributed to declining use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). To determine whether this is a credible conclusion, this study calculated population attributable risk (PAR) for HRT and other modifiable breast cancer risk factors.
METHODS: PAR calculation needs both the prevalence of a risk factor, and the relative risk (RR) for breast cancer incidence for that risk factor. Prevalences were calculated for Canadian women, aged 50-69, participating in the National Population Health Survey, 1994-2006. RR were derived from published research: 1.4 for HRT use, 1.4 for excessive alcohol use, 1.15 for physical inactivity, 1.25 for smoking, 1.4 for BMI over 30 kg/m2. Trends for PAR were calculated for the risk factors separately, as well as combined. Age-adjusted breast cancer incidence rates were calculated for Canadian women aged 50-69 for the years 1994-2004.
RESULTS: Between 1998 and 2004, PAR for HRT decreased by 50%. PAR for other risk factors showed only small changes, and the combined PAR decreased by 18.6%. Age-adjusted breast cancer incidence for women aged 50-69 peaked in 2000 at 330.0/100,000, then dropped by 17.2% by 2004.
CONCLUSION: Patterns of PAR for HRT use in Canada are consistent with the noticeable decrease in breast cancer incidence observed for women of the same age group. Combining PAR for all risk factors indicated that changes in HRT use overpowered any trends of other risk factors. The combined PAR suggest that alterations in lifestyle could have considerable impact on breast cancer incidence."
21214060,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21214060/,"OBJECTIVES: Given the limited knowledge on chlamydial reinfection (CR) in Canada, we examined the extent and predictors of CR in Montréal, a large Canadian city.
METHODS: We retrospectively studied all Montréal residents aged > or =10 years for whom > or =1 laboratory-confirmed chlamydial infection was reported to the public health department between 1988 and 2007 (n = 44,580). Each person was passively followed for two years after baseline infection or until reinfection. Socio-demographic factors and histories of other notifiable diseases were examined as potential predictors. Cox multivariate regression was used to model the time to CR. Survival analyses were stratified by age group (<25 vs. > or =25 years).
RESULTS: We estimated an overall two-year CR rate of 6.4%, an incidence density of 3.5 per 100 person-years, and a median time to reinfection of nine months. CR significantly increased over time. Among persons <25 years, reinfection was significantly more likely among females [adjusted hazard ratio (AHR): 1.58] and younger participants (10-14 years: AHR: 2.98; 15-19 years: AHR: 1.81). Residing within the South Central sector was deleterious for six months following initial infection after which it became protective. Among persons > or =25 years, a history of sexually transmitted infections increased the risk of reinfection (AHR: 1.79).
CONCLUSION: CR is a significant and growing problem in Montreal. The current recommendation for a single repeat screening six months posttreatment might be usefully complemented with additional screenings. Our results also underscore the importance of screening high-risk populations, particularly young women."
21214091,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21214091/,"BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: Down-sized ring annuloplasty has been shown to induce left ventricular remodeling in patients with functional ischemic mitral regurgitation (FIMR). To determine if this remodeling comprised papillary muscle (PM) relocation, a chronic FIMR porcine model was used to assess the impact on three-dimensional (3D) PM positioning, by implanting a down-sized rigid ring annuloplasty.
METHODS: Six out of ten FIMR pigs that underwent a down-sized mitral ring annuloplasty (CE Classic size 26-28) survived for six weeks postoperatively. 3D cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was carried out at one week preoperatively, and repeated at one and six weeks postoperatively, to assess the direct distances (in mm) from the anterior papillary muscle (APM) and posterior papillary muscle (PPM) to each trigone. Three reference planes were also constructed to determine APM and PPM displacement in the lateral, anterioposterior, and apical directions.
RESULTS: Relative to the preoperative situation, at one week postoperatively a reduced displacement of the APM was observed in an anterior direction (from 18.8 to 16.2 mm; p < 0.05) and from the posterior trigone (from 40.5 to 37.4 mm; p < 0.05) at end-diastole. Relative to one week postoperatively, at six weeks postoperatively a reduced PPM displacement was observed from the anterior trigone (43.0 versus 42.0 mm; p < 0.05) at end-systole. Relative to the preoperative situation, no overall tendency of surgically induced PM relocation was observed at one or six weeks postoperatively.
CONCLUSION: A down-sized ring annuloplasty did not induce an overall pattern of PM relocation in pigs with chronic FIMR."
21214303,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21214303/,"BACKGROUND: The research question guiding this study was, ""Does receiving individualized feedback about the findings of a research study that the hospice participated in affect clinical practice?"" Three issues were examined: (1) Did anyone at the hospice recall receiving the research results? (2) Were the findings shared with the hospice staff? and (3) Did the findings influence clinical practice in the hospice?
METHODS: The sample was 170 hospices that participated in a previous study examining the written materials used by hospices to prepare families for death. Participating hospices were sent individualized feedback concerning the signs of impending death and types of information that were present in their hospice's materials. Approximately 1 year later, participating hospices received a follow-up survey.
RESULTS: Sixty-five hospices (40.1%) completed the survey, 33 of these (50.8%) said they received the results of the previous research, 9 (13.8%) said they did not, and 23 (35.4%) said they did not know. All hospices that said that they received the data shared it with the others in the agency. Twenty-six (78.8% of those who recalled receiving the data) said that they made some change to how they prepare families for the patient's death and 11 said the changes were related to the research results they received.
CONCLUSION: The findings of this study suggest that providing feedback to agencies or individuals who participate in some descriptive studies may be used to promote improvements in clinical care."
21214306,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21214306/,"INTRODUCTION: Telemedicine options for symptom assessment include both telephonic means (call centers) and Internet sites. Although symptom assessment call centers have been available for decades, symptom assessment over the Internet is relatively new. It is not well known what types of symptoms Internet users are seeking assessment for and whether extant telephone triage algorithms would be applicable to Internet users.
METHODS: Symptom assessments on a heavily used Internet site (MayoClinic.com) were compared with symptom calls to a U.S. call center (Ask Mayo Clinic).
RESULTS: Internet users sought symptom assessments about adult symptoms 13 times more often than children's symptoms. In contrast, over the telephone, adult symptoms were addressed 2.1 times more frequently than children's symptoms. Despite the differences in frequencies of adult and child symptom assessments, users of the Internet and telephone callers asked about specific symptoms with similar relative frequencies. Analysis of 20 adult symptom types shared by the Web and call center revealed that by excluding only 2 assessments (nasal symptoms and leg pain) the remaining 18 showed a significant correlation in counts of use (r(2) = 0.68, p < 0.001 for linear trend).
CONCLUSIONS: Internet users have symptoms assessed in similar proportions to callers, with a few exceptions. Compared with callers, Web users are much more likely looking for information about adult symptoms. Callers are proportionally asking more about acute symptoms, whereas Internet users appear more interested in symptom assessment of chronic conditions."
21214670,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21214670/,"BACKGROUND: Obesity occurring earlier than 2 years of age is categorized as ""benign"" childhood obesity. In other words, no treatment is required for this type of obesity, and its course can simply be followed without any particular intervention. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether early infantile obesity is actually benign childhood obesity.
METHODS: The stature (length) and weight growth distance curves and growth velocity curves were determined for an obese infant (patient A), of his parents in infancy, and of his younger sister to determine whether their obesity in infancy was the benign childhood obesity. These data were also compared with other obese infants and those of normal infants.
RESULTS: Patient A's weight growth velocity declined until the age of 6 months and was then constant from 7 months onward. Because patient A's weight growth velocity curve followed the same pattern as that seen in a normal infant, despite differing in degree, the reason why this patient became obese in early infancy was probably insufficient deceleration of his weight growth velocity compared to that of a normal infant. In addition, the weight growth patterns and growth velocities of his parents and young sister during infancy were similar to those of the patient.
CONCLUSIONS: The present four subjects had benign childhood obesity. In addition, six other cases of infantile obesity have been encountered at the authors' pediatric outpatient clinic. The clinical characteristics of infantile obesity are discussed."
21214902,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21214902/,"BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization alert for the H1N1 influenza pandemic led to the implementation of certain measures regarding admission of patients with flu-like symptoms. All these instructions were adopted by the Greek National Health System. The aim of this study was to retrospectively examine the characteristics of all subjects admitted to the Unit of Infectious Diseases with symptoms indicating H1N1 infection, and to identify any differences between H1N1 positive or negative patients. Patients from the ED (emergency department) with flu-like symptoms (sore throat, cough, rhinorhea, or nasal congestion) and fever >37.5 °C were admitted in the Unit of Infectious diseases and gave pharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swabs. Swabs were tested with real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR).
FINDINGS: Patients were divided into two groups. Group A comprised 33 H1N1 positive patients and Group B (control group) comprised of 27 H1N1 negative patients. The two groups did not differ in terms of patient age, co-morbidities, length of hospitalization, temperature elevation, hypoxemia, as well as renal and liver function. There were also no significant differences in severity on admission. C-reactive protein (CRP) (mean 12.8 vs. 5.74) and white blood count (WBC) (mean 10.528 vs. 7.114) were significantly higher in group B than in group A upon admission. Obesity was noted in 8 patients of Group A (mean 31.67) and 14 patients of Group B (mean 37.78). Body mass index (BMI) was lower in H1N1 positive than in H1N1 negative patients (mean 31.67 vs. 37.78, respectively; p = 0.009).
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients in both groups were young male adults. CRP, WBC and BMI were higher among H1N1 negative patients. Finally, clinical course of patients in both groups was mild and uneventful."

This study compares the portion of drug resistant genotype clusters, representing recent transmission, within and between communities implementing programs differing only in their directly observed therapy (DOT) practices.
METHODS: Genotype clusters were defined as 2 or more patient members with matching IS6110 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and spoligotype patterns from all culture-positive tuberculosis cases diagnosed between January 1, 1995 and December 31, 2001. Logistic regression was used to compute maximum-likelihood estimates of odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) comparing cluster members with and without drug resistant isolates. In the universal DOT county, all patients received doses under direct observation of health department staff; whereas in selective DOT county, the majority of received patients doses under direct observation of health department staff, while some were able to self-administer doses.
RESULTS: Isolates from 1,706 persons collected during 1,721 episodes of tuberculosis were genotyped. Cluster members from the selective DOT county were more than twice as likely than cluster members from the universal DOT county to have at least one isolate resistant to isoniazid, rifampin, and/or ethambutol (OR = 2.3, 95% CI: 1.7, 3.1). Selective DOT county isolates were nearly 5 times more likely than universal DOT county isolates to belong to clusters with at least 2 resistant isolates having identical resistance patterns (OR = 4.7, 95% CI: 2.9, 7.6).
CONCLUSIONS: Universal DOT for tuberculosis is associated with a decrease in the acquisition and transmission of resistant tuberculosis."

METHODS: Children aged 5 years and less with an ED visit between February and April of a non pandemic season were recruited and followed-up by telephone interviews to ascertain the development of new respiratory and gastrointestinal infections. Approximately half of the parents were called 7-10 days after their child's ED visit. The other half were called at least 14 days after the visit and served as the ED-unexposed group. The principal outcome was the onset of a new infection in the week preceding the phone interview, using standardized definitions. Proportions of children with new infections were calculated in both groups and logistic regression was used to adjust for potential confounders.
RESULTS: A total of 304 children (mean age 2.4 years) were followed. Of the 137 children with a recent ED visit, 21 (15.3%) developed an infection compared to 39 of 167 (23.4%) of those without a recent visit. The relative risk (RR) associated with ED exposure was 0.7 (95%CI 0.4-1.1). As 85 children with a recent ED visit presented to the ED with a viral infection, we repeated the analysis excluding them to improve our capacity to detect new infections: 9 children (17.3%) developed an infection (RR = 0.7 [95%CI 0.4-1.4]). The only factor associated with an increased risk of infection was an intra-familial infectious contact (RR 9.9; 95%CI 1.7-58.9).
CONCLUSION: A visit to a pediatric ED does not result in a detectable increased risk of infection above the risk in the community. This is likely explained by the high baseline risk of infections in young children. However, we cannot eliminate the possibility that a risk of infection may still exist and would warrant a larger study to document."
21215419,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21215419/,"BACKGROUND: Recently, new electrophysiological ALS criteria incorporating fasciculation potentials (FPs) as evidence for lower motor neuron signs (Awaji Criteria (AC)) was proposed to provide earlier detection of early-stage ALS than revised El Escorial electrophysiological criteria (REEC). However, serial electrophysiological analysis is lacking to ascertain the original intention. The objective for this study was to elucidate whether electrophysiological criteria set for AC detects ALS earlier than REEC's counterpart in patients with ALS.
METHODS: Of the 51 patients who were clinically suspected of ALS, 35 patients prospectively received serial electrophysiological studies every 3 months until (1) both electrophysiological AC and REEC criteria were met in more than two muscles representing both of the cervical and lumbosacral segments or (2) either clinically definite or clinically probable REEC criteria was met. The intervals were determined between the initial disease onset and when the respective electrophysiological criteria were met.
RESULTS: Electrophysiological diagnostic criteria were met in 94.3% by AC and 40% by REEC at the initial visits. The intervals between the disease onset and the time of meeting the electrophysiological criteria were shorter in AC (mean: 9.0 months) than in REEC (mean: 15.2 months) (P<0.01). Eleven patients who met only AC electrophysiological criteria on the initial study subsequently met REEC electrophysiological criteria with the mean interval of 3.8 months. A higher percentage of bulbar-type ALS (83.3%) met AC than limb-onset ALS (43.4%) (P<0.05). FPs tended to be more frequently observed than fib/psw in the muscles outside the region of initial clinical onset.
CONCLUSION: Electrophysiological criteria of AC were met earlier than that of REEC in ALS patients, especially in patients with bulbar onset. Early recognition of ALS by AC may allow effective therapeutic intervention in the early disease stage."
21215437,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21215437/,"INTRODUCTION: Pelvic exenteration (PE) remains one of the most mutilating surgical procedures with important postoperative morbidity. Laparoscopic approach has emerged in an attempt to reduce postoperative complications. The aim of the present study was to compare outcomes between laparoscopic pelvic exenteration combined with a vaginal or perineal approach, versus classical approach.
METHODS: A cohort study was performed by identifying patients who underwent laparoscopic pelvic exenteration, and retrospectively comparing data with open cases from the same period of time, from 2000 to 2008.
RESULTS: Fourteen patients underwent laparoscopic PE and 29 patients underwent an open exenterative procedure. All patients except one (97.6%) had received prior radiotherapy. Eighteen patients (41.9%) underwent total PE, 17 anterior PE (39.5%), and 8 posterior PE (18.6%). Urinary diversion (UD) technique consisted of 24 Miami pouch (68.6%), 9 Bricker diversion (25.7%), 1 Kock pouch (2.9%), and 1 ureterostomy (2.9%). Most frequent postoperative complications were related to the urinary diversion (45%) and bowel reconstruction (27.9%). Median estimated blood loss for the laparoscopy and laparotomy group was 400 ml (range 200-700 ml) and 875 ml (range 200-1600 ml), respectively. Transfusion rate was also significantly higher in the laparotomy group. Operative time, margin status, length of hospital stay, operative and postoperative morbidity, and disease and overall survival were not significantly different between both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic PE is feasible with curative intent to selected patients. Potential postoperative advantages of laparoscopic approach when compared to classical approach, oncological safety of the procedure, and QOL considerations need to be further investigated."
21215999,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21215999/,"BACKGROUND: Previous largely cross-sectional studies suggest that fruit and vegetable consumption reduces the risk of allergic disease in children, but results are conflicting.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between current fruit or vegetable intake and allergic disease in 8-year-old Swedish children, and to evaluate the potential effect of disease-related modification of consumption.
METHODS: Cross-sectional data were obtained from a Swedish birth cohort study. Information on fruit and vegetable consumption as well as symptoms and diagnoses of allergic diseases was obtained by parental questionnaires at the 8-year follow-up. Allergen-specific IgE levels against food and inhalant allergens were obtained from blood samples collected at age 8 years. In total, 2447 children were included. Data were analyzed with logistic regression.
RESULTS: An inverse relation was observed between total fruit consumption and rhinitis (odds ratio, highest vs lowest quartile, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.45-0.86; P for trend, .002), whereas no association was observed for total vegetable intake. In analyses of individual foods, intake of apples/pears and carrots was inversely associated with rhinitis, asthma, and atopic sensitization. Fifty percent of the children with rhinitis were sensitized against birch pollen, which may cross-react with apples and carrots. After exclusion of children who reported food-related allergic symptoms, most of the observed inverse associations moved toward the null and became nonsignificant.
CONCLUSION: We confirm the inverse associations between fruit intake and allergic disease in children observed in earlier studies. However, our data also indicate that disease-related modification of consumption contributed to this association."
21216124,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21216124/,"OBJECTIVE: Susceptibility-weighted MR imaging (SWI) is usually obtained without administration of intravenous gadolinium (Gd). However, it is occasionally necessary to perform SWI after Gd is injected. The effects of Gd on SWI have not been systematically examined. The aim of this prospective study was to investigate whether performing SWI after Gd would influence the diagnostic image quality, parenchymal signal and vascular enhancement. An additional aim is to suggest potential future applications for Gd-enhanced SWI.
METHODS: SWI was performed in 31 subjects before and after Gd administration. 17 cases were examined in a 1.5T scanner and the remaining 14 were scanned at 3T. The pre- and post-Gd images were analysed for signal changes in the cerebral grey matter (GM), white matter (WM) as well as for enhancement in the superficial and deep venous system. The visibility of the veins was graded on subtraction maps.
RESULTS: The Gd-enhanced images showed no image quality degradation and no significant signal intensity change in the GM and WM as compared to the pre-Gd images (p>0.05). After Gd-administration significant enhancement of the venous sinuses was noticed (p<0.005), while the deep and cortical veins were poorly enhanced as confirmed by the calculated subtraction maps. The results showed no significant difference at variable MRI field strengths.
CONCLUSION: It is possible to perform SWI after Gd injection without information loss or signal change in the parenchyma. The most significant difference is the enhancement of the cerebral venous sinuses. Potential future applications are discussed."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The reading performance figures for all eligible film readers over a 36 month period were reviewed to determine the number of films read as first and second reader, the recall rates, the cancers detected, and the cancers missed by each reader.
RESULTS: During the 3 year period, screen-reading volumes varied from 7009 to 53,598. There were six low-volume readers, 16 medium-volume readers, and 15 high-volume readers (>25,000 cases in the 3 year period). No statistically significant differences were found in the first read specificity or the recall rate between the three groups.

21216326,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21216326/,"AIM: To determine whether the location of the computed tomography (CT) whirl sign can be used to help differentiate caecal from sigmoid volvulus.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-one patients (mean age 64.6 years) underwent multidetector CT and had confirmed colonic volvulus. There were 15 patients with caecal volvulus and 16 with sigmoid volvulus. Axial and coronal images were retrospectively evaluated on the picture archiving and communication system (PACS) by two reviewers in consensus without knowledge of the final diagnosis to determine whether a CT whirl sign was present and, if so, was the location to the right of midline or in the midline/left. The location of the twisting at imaging was correlated with whether the patient had caecal or sigmoid volvulus. Fisher's exact test was used to determine whether there was an association between the location of the twist (right versus mid-left) and the location of the colonic volvulus (caecal versus sigmoid). The non contrast CT (NCCT) examinations of 30 additional patients without colonic volvulus were evaluated for the presence or absence of a CT whirl sign.
RESULTS: All 31 patients with colonic volvulus had a CT whirl sign. No patient who underwent NCCT for kidney stones demonstrated a CT whirl sign. According to Fisher's exact test, there was a highly significant association (p<0.0001) between the location of the twist (right versus mid-left) and the location of the colonic volvulus (caecal versus sigmoid). Using the location of the twist as a predictor of whether the volvulus was caecal or sigmoid provided a correct diagnosis for 93.3% (14/15) of the patients with caecal volvulus and 100% (16/16) of those with sigmoid volvulus, yielding an overall diagnostic accuracy of 96.8% (30/31).
CONCLUSION: The location of the mesenteric twist (CT whirl sign) is a highly accurate finding in discriminating caecal from sigmoid volvulus."
21216677,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21216677/,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To estimate whether additional bleeding control can be safely achieved during laparoscopic myomectomy using bipolar electrosurgery over the suture sites in patients with blood oozing despite sufficient myometrial sutures.
DESIGN: Retrospective case control study (Canadian Task Force classification II-1).
SETTING: University teaching hospital.
PATIENTS: One hundred twenty-six women who underwent laparoscopic myomectomy performed by one surgeon.
INTERVENTIONS: Changes in maximum tensile strength of various suture materials were measured at tensinometry after bipolar electrosurgery or diathermy. Bipolar electrosurgery was performed over suture sites during laparoscopic myomectomy after adequate suturing (bipolar group, n = 64). Clinical outcomes were compared with those in matched controls (control group, n = 62].
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Polyglactin 910 (Vicryl) and glycolide-lactide copolymer (Polysorb) sutures exhibited no substantial changes in maximum tensile strength after 2 seconds of bipolar electrosurgery. However, both sutures demonstrated a decrease in maximum tensile strength of 43.5% and 17.4%, respectively, after 4 seconds of bipolar electrosurgery at 40 W. Compared with the control group, in the bipolar group mean (SD) postoperative hemoglobin concentration was higher (11.1 [1.3] g/dL vs 10.5 [1.3] g/dL), total drainage volume was less (244.6 [133.7] mL vs 380.2 [196.0] mL), a drain was required for a shorter time (2.0 [0.7] days vs 2.8 [0.7] days), and hospital stay was shorter (4.3 [1.6] days vs 5.3 [1.7] days) (p <.05).
CONCLUSIONS: During laparoscopic myomectomy, additional bleeding control can be achieved by using careful short duration bipolar electrosurgery over the suture site. However, application of excessive bipolar electrosurgery (>40 W and ≥ 4 seconds) tends to weaken suture material."
21216785,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21216785/,"AIMS: Mortality attributed to a disease is an important public health measure of the 'burden' of that disease. A discrepancy has been noted between the high mortality rates associated with heart failure (HF) and the share of deaths ascribed to HF in official mortality statistics. It was our main aim to estimate excess mortality associated with HF and use the estimates to better understand the burden of HF.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Excess mortality was defined as the difference in mortality rates between individuals with and those without HF. An epidemiological model was formulated that allowed deriving age-specific excess mortality rates in HF patients from HF incidence and prevalence. Incidence and prevalence were estimated from yearly collected cross-sectional data from four nationally representative General Practice registries in the Netherlands. The year 2007 was chosen as a reference. Next, excess mortality rates were used to calculate numbers of deaths among HF patients and compare the figures with national cause-of-death statistics. The latter were found to be more than three times smaller than the former (roughly 6000 vs. 21 000). Further, by applying HF prevalence and mortality rates to a life table of the Dutch population, average numbers of life years lost due to HF were calculated to be 6.9 years.
CONCLUSION: National mortality statistics strongly underestimate the number of deaths associated with HF. Moreover, the high mortality rate in HF patients amounts to a remarkably large number of life years lost given the advanced age of disease onset."
21217152,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21217152/,"BACKGROUND: Many home fires begin in the kitchen. Kitchen smoke alarms are more likely to produce nuisance alarms, but few previous studies have examined the role of alarm sensor and battery types on the functionality of smoke alarms located nearest to the kitchen.
METHODS: Data were analysed from a 2×2 factorial randomised controlled trial conducted in rural Iowa homes (n=628). Enrolled households were randomly assigned into one of four smoke alarm/battery combinations: ionisation/zinc, ionisation/lithium, photoelectric/zinc and photoelectric/lithium. Alarm functionality was determined using a smoke test. Alarm type and battery type were compared using an intent-to-treat analysis. Logistic regression was used to identify factors that might impact the functionality of smoke alarms located nearest to the kitchen 42 months after installation.
RESULTS: Photoelectric alarms with lithium batteries had the highest rate of functionality (90.2%), whereas ionisation alarms with carbon/zinc batteries had the lowest (76.5%). Forty-two months following installation, 6.4% more of photoelectric alarms were functional than ionisation alarms, and 7.9% more of alarms with lithium batteries were functional than those with carbon/zinc batteries. Logistic regression revealed that when the indicator of nuisance alarms was included, the effect of alarm type became statistically insignificant and ionisation alarms were less likely to be functional at 42 months, partly due to increased nuisance alarms.
CONCLUSIONS: Alarm type is an important consideration for certain locations. Photoelectric alarms may be more appropriate for installation nearest to the kitchen despite their increased cost. These findings can help guide consumer choices to increase protection against home fire-related injuries and deaths."

OBJECTIVE: To determine the influence of age, comorbidities, and treatment type on mortality in elderly patients with acute Type II odontoid fractures.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Prior studies have documented increased morbidity and mortality among geriatric patients sustaining odontoid fractures. However, there is limited data regarding the effect of patient age, medical comorbidities, and treatment selection on mortality after Type II odontoid (C2) fractures in the elderly.
METHODS: An institutional registry was used to identify all Type II odontoid fractures sustained by patients aged 65 and older from 1991 to 2006. Demographic information, date of injury, associated injuries, treatment type, and comorbidities were abstracted from medical records. Mortality was ascertained using the National Death Index. Risks of mortality and their associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated at 3 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression was used to evaluate independent factors affecting mortality stratified by age (65-74 years, 75-84 years, ≥ 85 years) and treatment type (operative or nonoperative treatment, and halo or collar immobilization).
RESULTS: Of 156 patients identified with Type II odontoid fracture, the average age was 82 years (SD = 7.8; Range: 65-101). One hundred and twelve patients (72%) were treated nonoperatively. At 3 years postinjury, there was a 39% (95% CI: 32-47) mortality rate for the entire cohort. Mortality for the operative group was 11% (95% CI: 2-21) at 3 months and 21% (95% CI: 9-32) at 1 year compared with 25% (95% CI: 17-33) at 3 months and 36% (95% CI: 27-45) at 1 year in the nonoperative group. The Cox regression model showed that the protective effect of surgery was seen in patients aged 65 to 74 years, in whom the hazard ratio associated with surgery for mortality after odontoid fracture was 0.4 (95% CI: 0.1-1.5). Those aged 75 to 84 years had a hazard ratio of 0.8 (95% CI: 0.3-2.3), and patients 85 years or older had a hazard ratio of 1.9 (95% CI: 0.6-6.1; P value for interaction between age and treatment = 0.09) with operative treatment having a protective effect in patients aged 65 to 74 years.
CONCLUSION: In a cohort of elderly patients, Type II odontoid fractures were associated with a high rate of mortality, regardless of intervention."
21217439,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21217439/,"STUDY DESIGN: Comparison of intra- and interobserver reliability of digitized manual and computer-assisted intervertebral motion measurements and classification of ""instability.""
OBJECTIVE: To determine if computer-assisted measurement of lumbar intervertebral motion on flexion-extension radiographs improves reliability compared with digitized manual measurements.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Many studies have questioned the reliability of manual intervertebral measurements, although few have compared the reliability of computer-assisted and manual measurements on lumbar flexion-extension radiographs.
METHODS: Intervertebral rotation, anterior-posterior (AP) translation, and change in anterior and posterior disc height were measured with a digitized manual technique by three physicians and by three other observers using computer-assisted quantitative motion analysis (QMA) software. Each observer measured 30 sets of digital flexion-extension radiographs (L1-S1) twice. Shrout-Fleiss intraclass correlation coefficients for intra- and interobserver reliabilities were computed. The stability of each level was also classified (instability defined as >4 mm AP translation or 10° rotation), and the intra- and interobserver reliabilities of the two methods were compared using adjusted percent agreement (APA).
RESULTS: Intraobserver reliability intraclass correlation coefficients were substantially higher for the QMA technique THAN the digitized manual technique across all measurements: rotation 0.997 versus 0.870, AP translation 0.959 versus 0.557, change in anterior disc height 0.962 versus 0.770, and change in posterior disc height 0.951 versus 0.283. The same pattern was observed for interobserver reliability (rotation 0.962 vs. 0.693, AP translation 0.862 vs. 0.151, change in anterior disc height 0.862 vs. 0.373, and change in posterior disc height 0.730 vs. 0.300). The QMA technique was also more reliable for the classification of ""instability."" Intraobserver APAs ranged from 87 to 97% for QMA versus 60% to 73% for digitized manual measurements, while interobserver APAs ranged from 91% to 96% for QMA versus 57% to 63% for digitized manual measurements.
CONCLUSION: The use of QMA software substantially improved the reliability of lumbar intervertebral measurements and the classification of instability based on flexion-extension radiographs."

OBJECTIVE: To report on the safety of repetitive transcranial electric stimulation (RTES) for eliciting motor-evoked potentials during spine surgery.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Theoretical concerns over the safety of RTES have hindered broader acceptance of transcranial electric motor-evoked potentials (tceMEP), despite successful implementation of spinal cord monitoring with tceMEPs in many large spine centers, as well as their apparent superiority over mixed-nerve somatosensory-evoked potentials (SSEP) for detection of spinal cord injury.
METHODS: The records of 18,862 consecutive patients who met inclusion criteria and underwent spine surgery with tceMEP monitoring were reviewed for RTES-related complications.
RESULTS: This large retrospective review identified only 26 (0.14%) cases with RTES-related complications; all but one of these were tongue lacerations, most of which were self-limiting.
CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that RTES is a highly safe modality for monitoring spinal cord motor tract function intraoperatively."
21217487,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21217487/,"BACKGROUND: In light of recent data, controversy surrounds the apparent 30-day survival benefit of patients achieving a fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to packed red blood cell (PRBC) ratio of at least 1:2 in the face of massive transfusions (MT) (≥10 units of PRBC within 24 hours of admission). We hypothesized that initial studies suffer from survival bias because they do not consider early deaths secondary to uncontrolled exsanguinating hemorrhage. To help resolve this controversy, we evaluated the temporal relationship between blood product administration and mortality in civilian trauma patients receiving MT.
METHODS: Patients requiring MT over a 22-month period were identified from the resuscitation registry of a Level I trauma center. Shock severity at admission and timing of shock-trauma admission, blood product administration, and death were determined. Patients were divided into high- and low-ratio groups (≥1:2 and<1:2 FFP:PRBC, respectively) and compared. Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test was used to examine 24-hour survival.
RESULTS: One hundred three patients (63% blunt) were identified (66 high-ratio and 37 low-ratio). Those patients who achieved a high-ratio in 24 hours had improved survival. However, severity of shock was less in the high-group (base excess: -8.0 vs. -11.2, p=0.028; lactate: 6.3 vs. 8.4, p=0.03). Seventy-five patients received MT within 6 hours. Of these, 29 received a high-ratio in 6 hours. Again, severity of shock was less in the high-ratio group (base excess: -7.6 vs. -12.7, p=0.008; lactate: 6.7 vs. 9.4, p=0.02). For these patients, 6-hour mortality was less in the high-group (10% vs. 48%, p<0.002). After accounting for early deaths, groups were similar from 6 hours to 24 hours.
CONCLUSIONS: Improved survival was observed in patients receiving a higher plasma ratio over the first 24 hours. However, temporal analysis of mortality using shorter time periods revealed those who achieve early high-ratio are in less shock and less likely to die early from uncontrolled hemorrhage compared with those who never achieve a high-ratio. Thus, the proposed survival advantage of a high-ratio may be because of selection of those not likely to die in the first place; that is, patients die with a low-ratio not because of a low-ratio."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our prospective study was approved by the institutional review board, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Between October 2004 and January 2006, 18 patients with histologically proven PCa on biopsy and scheduled for radical prostatectomy were included and underwent 3D-MRSI with and without an ERC. The prostate was divided into 14 regions of interest (ROIs). Four readers independently rated (on a 5-point scale) their confidence that cancer was present in each of these ROIs. These findings were correlated with whole-mount prostatectomy specimens. Areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curve were determined. A difference with a P < 0.05 was considered significant.
RESULTS: A total of 504 ROIs were rated for the presence and absence of PCa. Localization of PCa with MRSI with the use of an ERC had a significantly higher areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (0.68) than MRSI without the use of an ERC (0.63) (P = 0.015).
CONCLUSION: The use of an ERC in 3D MRSI in localizing PCa at 3 Tesla slightly but significantly increased the localization performance compared with not using an ERC."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 40 consecutive patients (age, 67 ± 11 years) underwent 128-slice dual-source CT of the chest including nonenhanced, arterial, and venous phase of contrast. CT was performed in the HPM with a pitch of 3.2 during continuous breathing (group A) and during breath-hold (group B), and at standard pitch of 1 during deep-inspiratory breath-hold (group C). The 3 protocols were scanned in a random order in each patient. Two blinded readers independently assessed the image quality of 5 regions in both the lungs using a semiquantitative 3-point score. Image noise was measured as the standard deviation of attenuation. Presence and size of pulmonary nodules were noted and measured on each CT dataset. Lung volume was measured using dedicated semi-automated segmentation software.
RESULTS: Interobserver agreement for image quality ratings was excellent (κ = 0.91). There were no significant differences in the number of lung regions having an image quality other than excellent between group A (2.5%) and B (1.5%, P = 0.48), whereas significantly less regions had impaired image quality in group B compared with group C (5.5%, P < 0.01). Image quality impairment in group C was because of breathing in 36% and cardiac pulsation in 64%. Image noise in group C (9 ± 2 HU) was significantly lower than that in group B (30 ± 2 HU, P < 0.001) whereas no significant difference was found between group A and B (P = 0.52). There were no significant differences for the depiction (P = 1.0) and size (P = 0.94) of lung nodules among the 3 modes. Average lung volume in group A was 75% ± 15% of that in deep inspiration (group B/C) being significantly smaller (P < 0.05). Estimated effective radiation doses in group C and group B were 5.8 ± 0.5 mSv and 1.6 ± 0.1 mSv, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: CT of the lung can be accomplished using the HPM at a low radiation dose with a diagnostic image quality even without suspended respiration."

A comparison study using the insulin resistant animal model, the Zucker rat and the SMF-exposed Wistar rat was carried out.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Zucker rats were compared to Wistar rats either exposed to a 128 mT or 0 mT SMF (sham exposed) and analysed. This moderate-intensity SMF exposure of Wistar rats was performed for 1 h/day during 15 consecutive days.
RESULTS: Wistar rats exposed to the SMF showed increased levels of carbohydrate and lipid metabolites (i.e., lactate, glycerol, cholesterol and phospholipids) compared to sham-exposed rats. Zucker rats displayed a normoglycemia associated with a high insulin level as opposed to Wistar rats which presented hyperglycemia and hypoinsulinemia after exposure to the SMF. During the glucose tolerance test, unexposed Zucker rats and Wistar rats exposed to the SMF exhibited a significantly higher hyperglycemia compared to sham-exposed Wistar rats suggesting an impairment of glucose clearance. In muscle, glycogen content was lower and phospholipids content was elevated for both unexposed Zucker rats and Wistar rats exposed to the SMF compared to Wistar rats sham control.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that the metabolic alterations following exposure to a static magnetic field of moderate intensity could trigger the development of a pre-diabetic state."

Wound lactate levels were significantly higher in infected compared with non-infected diabetic foot ulcers (P=0.001). Non-infected diabetic foot ulcers that healed within 6 months of treatment showed a significantly lower wound fluid lactate concentration at baseline as opposed to those that did not heal (P=0.007).
CONCLUSIONS: Non-healing diabetic foot ulcers are characterized by high wound fluid lactate levels. Assessment of wound fluid lactate concentration might be helpful for confirming the suspicion of soft tissue infection, particularly when clinical signs are atypical."

METHODS: We prospectively compiled data on a series of 338 patients with diabetes with 356 episodes of foot infection who were hospitalized in the Diabetic Foot Unit of La Paloma Hospital from 1 October 2002 to 31 April 2010. For each patient we did a probe-to-bone test at the time of the initial evaluation and then obtained plain X-rays of the involved foot. All patients with positive results on either the probe-to-bone test or plain X-ray underwent an appropriate surgical procedure, which included obtaining a bone specimen that was processed for histology and culture. We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, predictive values and likelihood ratios of the procedures, using the histopathological diagnosis of osteomyelitis as the criterion standard.
RESULTS: Overall, 72.4% of patients had histologically proven osteomyelitis, 85.2% of whom had positive bone culture. The performance characteristics of both the probe-to-bone test and plain X-rays were excellent. The sequential diagnostic approach had a sensitivity of 0.97, specificity of 0.92, positive predictive value of 0.97, negative predictive value of 0.93, positive likelihood ratio of 12.8 and negative likelihood ratio of 0.02. Only 6.6% of patients with negative results on both diagnostic studies had osteomyelitis.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians seeing patients in a setting similar to ours (specialized diabetic foot unit with a high prevalence of osteomyelitis) can confidently diagnose diabetic foot osteomyelitis when either the probe-to-bone test or a plain X-ray, or especially both, are positive."
21219525,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21219525/,"AIMS: This article provides insight into the potential economic viability of nurse practitioner employment in Dutch general practices.
BACKGROUND: General practitioners face the challenging task of finding the most efficient and effective mix of professionals in general practice to accommodate future care demands within scarce health care budgets. To enable informed decision-making about skill mix issues, economic information is needed.
DESIGN: Discursive paper.
METHOD: A descriptive and explorative design was chosen to study the economic viability of nurse practitioner employment in general practice. The conditions under which the nurse practitioner is able to earn back his/her own cost of employment were identified. Preferences and expectations of general practitioners and health insurers about nurse practitioner reimbursement were made transparent.
RESULTS: Although general practitioners and health insurers acknowledge the importance of the nurse practitioner in accommodating primary care demands, they have polarised views about reimbursement. The employment of nurse practitioners is seldom economically viable in current practices. It requires a reallocation of (80% of) the general practitioner's freed up time towards practice growth (12% number of patients).
CONCLUSION: The economic viability of the nurse practitioner has proven difficult to achieve in every day health care practice. This study provided insight into the complex interaction of the (cost) parameters that result in economic viability and feeds a further discussion about the content of the nurse practitioner role in general practice based on optimal quality of care vs. efficiency.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Effective and efficient health care can only be provided if the actual care needs of a population provide the basis for deciding which mix of professionals is best equipped to deal with the changing and increasing demand of care. A macro-level intervention is needed to help a broad-scale introduction of the nurse practitioner in general practice."
21219685,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21219685/,"BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) is recognised as a major public health problem in the prisons of sub-Saharan Africa. In Cameroon, the main prisons have created diagnostic and treatment units linked to the National Tuberculosis Programme (NTP).
OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of routine TB control activities in a prison population by determining the prevalence of undetected pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB).
METHODS: In 2009, a PTB case-finding survey was undertaken at the Central Prison of Yaounde (CPY), Cameroon. All prisoners with cough of ≥1 week's duration were screened by sputum smear microscopy. Smears were sent to the national reference laboratory for culture and drug susceptibility testing (DST). Voluntary testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was offered to all inmates.
RESULTS: Among 3219 inmates screened, 40 (1.2%) identified with PTB had been missed by the prison TB control programme. Missed PTB was positively associated with severe crowding, low body mass index and previous TB treatment. Of the 40 inmates, four (10%) were TB-HIV co-infected. The DST of three inmates revealed resistance to anti-tuberculosis drugs.
CONCLUSION: Despite a well-performing TB control programme in the CPY, the number of undetected PTB cases remains unacceptably high. It is doubtful whether TB transmission can be controlled under conditions of confinement, such as the CPY."
21220248,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21220248/,"OBJECTIVE: The nocturnal blood pressure (NBP) reduction is less than normal in the patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (type 2 DM). L-carnitine deficiency may cause changes of NBP by leading to hyperglycemia, insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction in patients with type-2 DM. The purpose of the study was to investigate whether there is a difference in levels of L-carnitine in dipper and nondippers patients with type 2 DM.
METHODS: This is a cross-sectional observational cohort study. We compared the 50 (33 females, 17 males) patients with type 2 DM and the 35 healthy persons (18 females, 17 males) as a control group. In all cases, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) was performed and L-carnitine was measured. The independent samples t test, Chi-square test, Mann-Whitney U test and Pearson correlation analysis were used in the statistical evaluation of data.
RESULTS: We found that the percentage of nondipper pattern was 72% in patients with type 2 DM. L-carnitine levels were lower in patients with type 2 DM (52.77 ± 12.34 µmol/L) than those of control group (79.18 ± 10.59 µmol/L), and these differences were statistically significant (p=0.05). L-carnitine levels were lower in nondipper cases (50.02 ± 16.30 µmol/L) than those of dipper cases (53.83 ± 10.50 µmol/L), but these differences were not statistically significant (p=0.125).
CONCLUSION: Nondipper pattern is common in patients with type 2 DM. Nondipper pattern is associated with damage of target organ. Therefore, determination of nondipper pattern by ABPM is very important. L-carnitine levels were found to be lower in nondipper patients than in dipper patients with type 2 DM. Although, these differences were statistically nonsignificant, more detailed studies should be performed to determine the frequencies and relationship between nondipper pattern and L-carnitine levels in patients with type-2 DM."
21220546,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21220546/,"BACKGROUND: There has been concern regarding the fixation of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, with soft tissue grafts being strong and stiff enough to allow for early accelerated postoperative rehabilitation. Therefore, some have recommended supplementary fixation for soft tissue tibia interference screw fixation with a staple, to improve the strength and stiffness of the fixation. Unfortunately, with staple supplementation, there is a risk for symptomatic hardware, which may require a second surgery to remove the staple.
HYPOTHESIS: Supplementary fixation with a bioabsorbable knotless suture anchor will improve the structural properties of soft tissue tibia bioabsorbable interference screw (BIS) fixation and be comparable with supplementary fixation with a staple.
STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study.
METHOD: Fifteen porcine tibias and flexor profundus tendons were randomized into 3 fixation study groups: group 1, BIS; group 2, BIS + staple; and group 3, BIS + push-lock screw. The structural properties of the 3 fixation groups were tested under displacement-controlled cyclic loading and load to failure.
RESULTS: No significant difference in mean stiffness (N/mm ± SEM) under cyclic loading was found for BIS (335.31 ± 15.43), BIS + staple (344.81 ± 44.97), and BIS + push-lock (353.28 ± 38.93). Under load-to-failure testing, there were no differences found in stiffness, yield load, displacement at yield load, displacement at ultimate load, and energy absorbed among the 3 fixation methods. BIS + push-lock fixation had a significantly higher ultimate load than BIS alone and BIS + staple (917.85 ± 58.30 N vs 479.83 ± 66.04 N, P = .0003 vs 618.89 ± 8.94 N, P = .004).
CONCLUSION: Supplementary fixation with staple or push-lock screw did not significantly increase the structural strength and stiffness of the BIS soft tissue graft fixation under cyclic loading, but it did show improvement under load-to-failure testing for ultimate tensile load.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The indication for supplementary fixation for tibial BIS soft tissue graft fixation depends on the fixation that the BIS achieves at the time of the surgery because the tensile load is transferred to the secondary fixation if and only when there is slippage of graft at the primary fixation. The supplementary fixation may be of value in those cases with poor bone quality, such as revision surgery with tunnel widening and/or graft-tunnel mismatch, or possibly in cases with older patients or patients with disorders affecting bone mineral density."
21221036,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21221036/,"BACKGROUND: There are arguments about whether acoustic neuromas are epiarachnoid or subarachnoid tumors.
OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively examine 118 consecutively operated-on patients with acoustic neuromas to clarify this point.
METHODS: Epiarachnoid tumors are defined by the absence of an arachnoid membrane on the tumor surface after moving the arachnoid fold (double layers of the arachnoid membrane) toward the brainstem. In contrast, subarachnoid tumors are characterized by the arachnoid membrane remaining on the tumor surface after moving the arachnoid fold. Based on this hypothesis, we used intraoperative views and light and electron microscopy to confirm the existence of an arachnoid membrane after the arachnoid fold had been moved.
RESULTS: The tumors were clearly judged to be subarachnoid tumors in 86 of 118 patients (73%), an epiarachnoid tumor in 2 patients (2%), whereas a clear judgment was difficult to make in the remaining 30 patients (25%).
CONCLUSION: The majority of acoustic neuromas are subarachnoid tumors, with epiarachnoid tumors being considerably less common."
21221790,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21221790/,"BACKGROUND: Obesity is associated with a proinflammatory state.
AIM: To determine whether obesity at diagnosis is a risk factor for Crohn's disease vs. ulcerative colitis and also vs. community controls and whether there is a U-shaped relationship between body mass index at diagnosis and risk of Crohn's disease versus ulcerative colitis.
METHODS: A total of 524 consecutive inflammatory bowel disease patients attending gastroenterology clinics were administered a questionnaire inquiring about weight at diagnosis and height as well as other risk factors for inflammatory bowel disease. An opportunistic control group of 480 community controls aged 50-70 were randomly selected from the registers of four local general practices as part of another study.
RESULTS: Obesity at diagnosis was more common in subjects with Crohn's disease versus ulcerative colitis odds ratio 2.02 (1.18-3.43) p = 0.0096 and also Crohn's disease versus community controls in the 50-70 year age group (odds ratio 3.22 (1.59-6.52) p = 0.001). There was evidence of a 'dose response' with increasing degrees of obesity associated with increased risk. Low BMI at diagnosis was also associated with risk of Crohn's disease versus ulcerative colitis. A U-shaped relationship between BMI and risk of Crohn's was supported by the strong inverse association of BMI at diagnosis (p = 0.0001) and positive association of BMI at diagnosis squared (p = 0.0002) when they were fitted together into the model.
CONCLUSIONS: Obesity may play a role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease and it may be that obesity-related enteropathy is a distinct entity or a sub-type of Crohn's disease."
21222167,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21222167/,"BACKGROUND: Surgical outcomes of multiorgan resection (MOR) for T4 gastric carcinoma reported in the literature are widely variable. We herein report a large surgical series of T4 gastric carcinoma.
METHODS: One hundred seventy-nine patients with cT4 gastric carcinoma were recruited onto the study. Patient characteristics, surgical strategy and related complications, long-term survival, and prognostic factors of T4 gastric carcinoma were analyzed.
RESULTS: Of 179 cT4 gastric carcinoma, there were 57 cT4 (pT3) with MOR, 91 pT4 with MOR, and 31 cT4 without MOR. pT4 with MOR were more likely to be associated with nodal metastasis, cellular dedifferentiation, and lymphoperineural infiltration compared to those of pT0-3 (P < 0.01 for all). For 91 pT4 with MOR, their surgical mortality and morbidity rates were 4.4 and 28.6%, respectively; their 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 55.2, 22.4, and 12.2%, respectively. The long-term survival of cT4 (pT3) with MOR was superior to pT4 with MOR (P = 0.006) and cT4 without MOR (P = 0.004). There was a striking difference between pT4 with MOR, R0 and pT4 with MOR, and R1 or R2 (P = 0.007). By means of multivariate analysis, lymph node status, liver invasion, and positive surgical margin were independent prognostic factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Aggressive surgical management of pT4 gastric carcinoma should be limited to patients without adverse prognostic factors such as advanced nodal involvement and pancreatic invasion."
21223278,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21223278/,"BACKGROUND: Low-level violent behavior, particularly school bullying, remains a critical public health issue that has been associated with negative mental and physical health outcomes. School-based prevention programs, while a valuable line of defense to stave off bullying, have shown inconsistent results in terms of decreasing bullying. This study explored whether school safety measures (eg, security guards, cameras, ID badges) were associated with student reports of different forms of peer victimization related to bullying.
METHODS: Data came from the 2007 School Crime Supplement of the National Crime Victimization Survey. Chi-square tests of independence were used to examine differences among categorical variables. Logistic regression models were constructed for the peer victimization outcomes. A count variable was constructed among the bullying outcomes (0-7) with which a Poisson regression model was constructed to analyze school safety measures' impacts on degree of victimization.
RESULTS: Of the various school safety measures, only having adults in hallways resulted in a significant reduction in odds of being physically bullied, having property vandalized, or having rumors spread. In terms of degree of victimization, having adults and/or staff supervising hallways was associated with an approximate 26% decrease in students experiencing an additional form of peer victimization.
CONCLUSIONS: Results indicated that school safety measures overall were not associated with decreased reports of low-level violent behaviors related to bullying. More research is needed to further explore what best promotes comprehensive safety in schools."
21223305,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21223305/,"BACKGROUND: We measured blood alcohol content (BAC) levels of attendees at professional sporting events and assessed the factors associated with higher BACs.
METHODS: We conducted BAC tests of 362 adult attendees following 13 baseball games and three football games. We ran multivariate analyses to obtain factors associated with the risk of having a higher BAC.
RESULTS: In this assessment, 40% of the participants had a positive BAC, ranging from 0.005 to 0.217. Those who reported tailgating before the event had 14 times the odds of having a BAC > 0.08 and those under age 35 had nearly 8 times the odds of having a BAC > 0.08 (both compared to a zero BAC). Attendees of Monday night football games were more likely to have positive BACs compared to attendees at all other games.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that it is feasible to assess BAC levels of attendees at professional sporting events. Our findings suggest that a significant number of attendees at professional sporting events may have elevated BAC levels, particularly young adults and those who participated in tailgating activities. Further research using a representative sample is warranted to confirm the findings from this preliminary study."
21223403,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21223403/,"AIMS: The purpose was to examine differences in perceptions of work environment and quality of care between nurse managers and staff nurses, and the relationship between nurses' perceptions of the work environment and intention to leave.
BACKGROUND: It is important for managers to understand how staff nurses perceive the work environment as these perceptions may affect nurses' intention to leave the organization. Few studies have examined the perceptions of nurses compared with nurse manager/directors regarding the organizational influences on intention to leave.
METHODS: This study was a cross-sectional, non-experimental design. A total of 336 nurses and managers participated from two Midwestern hospitals. Participants completed the Perceived Nurse Work Environment Scale (PNWE), Anticipated Turnover Scale (ATS), and a researcher developed perception of quality scale. Data were analysed for descriptive statistics, Analysis of Variance, and Pearson's correlation.
RESULTS: Significant differences were found between nurses and managers on perceptions of work environment. Managers rated work environment higher than staff on all subscales. Work environment was related to anticipated turnover.
CONCLUSIONS: Managers and staff nurses are 'not on the same page' in perceptions of work environment.
IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Nurse managers need to understand the organizational influences that may affect nurses' intention to leave. Strategies to improve the work environment are necessary to meet the needs of the staff nurse."
21223498,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21223498/,"OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (LANSS) screening tool can satisfy Rasch model expectations and therefore be transformed into an interval level measurement scale, suitable for use as an outcome measure in clinical studies.
DESIGN: Rasch analysis (using the software RUMM2020) of LANSS data from both a random selection of all chronic pain patients and also specific chronic pain diagnostic categories.
PATIENTS: Original LANSS data from a previous study of 2,480 patients with chronic pain were used. Specific diagnostic groups examined included diabetic neuropathy, postsurgical pain, osteoarthritis, posttraumatic injury, and low back pain.
OUTCOME MEASURES: The following assessments were made: fit to the Rasch model, scale reliability, scale multi-dimensionality, and differential item functioning.
RESULTS: The overall fit to the Rasch model was only acceptable in two groups; diabetic neuropathy and chronic postsurgical pain. For these groups, the scale is unidimensional (measures a single construct) and there is no evidence of differential item functioning across gender and age groups. The scale only has reliability consistent with use at the group level.
CONCLUSIONS: Neuropathic screening tools such as the LANSS have been used as outcome measures in clinical studies. Rasch analysis demonstrates that the LANSS can be used as such in specific populations of patients with neuropathic pain, however it's reliability in this context does not support use at the individual level and it cannot be used as a generalised measurement tool across pain diagnostic groups. The LANSS remains primarily a diagnostic tool."
21223571,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21223571/,"INTRODUCTION: Clara cell protein 10 (CC-10) has been associated with inflammatory and infectious pulmonary diseases. This study evaluates CC-10 concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid as a potential marker of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
METHODS: Between January 2003 and December 2007, BAL fluid samples obtained from critically ill patients at the intensive care unit of the Maastricht University Medical Centre clinically suspected of having VAP were included. Patients were divided into two groups: (1) microbiologically confirmed VAP (the VAP group) and (2) microbiologically unconfirmed VAP (the non-VAP group). The concentration of CC-10 was measured by means of a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit, and retrospective analysis was performed. Areas under the curve of receiver operating characteristic curves were calculated for CC-10 concentrations.
RESULTS: A total of 196 patients (122 men, 74 women) were included. A total of 79 (40%) of 196 cases of suspected VAP were microbiologically confirmed. The median CC-10 concentration in the VAP group was 3,019 ng/mL (range, 282 to 65,546 ng/mL) versus 2,504 ng/mL (range, 62 to 30,240 ng/mL) in the non-VAP group (P = 0.03). There was no significant difference in CC-10 concentrations between patients treated with or without corticosteroids (P = 0.26) or antibiotic therapy (P = 0.9). The CC-10 concentration did not differ significantly between patients with Gram-positive versus Gram-negative bacteria that caused the VAP (P = 0.06). However, CC-10 concentrations did differ significantly between the late-onset VAP group and the non-VAP group.
CONCLUSIONS: The CC-10 concentration in BAL fluid yielded low diagnostic accuracy in confirming the presence of VAP."

DESIGN AND METHODS: Study group was consisted of 50 healthy subjects and 100 type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) patients. Following measuring of serum PON1 activity, isolation of DNA and genotyping analyses were performed.
RESULTS: PON1 activity of the patients with complications was significantly reduced by 23.5% compared to the group of diabetic patients and by 26.3% than the controls. According to multivariate analysis, we observed a three times significant effect of Q/R 192 polymorphism on the susceptibility to the occurrence of complications.
CONCLUSIONS: Protective effects of paraoxonase against peroxidation of LDL particles are important in T2D complications. Although both of the two polymorphisms are associated, 192 polymorphism seems to be stronger predictor of the risk of diabetic complications."
21224424,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21224424/,"PURPOSE: To elucidate whether echogenicity (EG) of the basal ganglia and thalami (BGT) represents a physiologic phenomenon in preterm neonates (<32 weeks gestation).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was approved by the medical ethics committee, and informed consent was obtained from the parents. Sequential neonatal cranial ultrasonographic (US) images obtained in 130 preterm neonates were evaluated for EG of the BGT. In 110 of the 130 neonates, MR imaging was performed around or within the first months after term-equivalent age to assess myelination and changes in BGT signal. Cranial US studies obtained in 83 low-risk near-term neonates were used for comparison.
RESULTS: Diffuse homogeneous bilateral EG of the BGT was seen in 120 (92%) of 130 preterm neonates and in seven (8%) of 83 low-risk neonates (P < .001). In preterm neonates, EG of the BGT faded with age and was no longer seen 1 month after delivery. This finding was associated with frontal echodensity, which is a normal prematurity-related cranial US phenomenon that occurs in the white matter (P < .001). No association with changes on MR images was found.
CONCLUSION: In preterm neonates, diffuse homogeneous EG of the BGT is a frequent and normal prematurity-related finding."
21224742,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21224742/,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the willingness to pay (WTP) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) ratio with the stated preference data and compare the results obtained between chronic prostatitis (CP) patients and general population (GP).
METHODS: WTP per QALY was calculated with the subjects' own health-related utility and the WTP value. Two widely used preference-based health-related quality of life instruments, EuroQol (EQ-5D) and Short Form 6D (SF-6D), were used to elicit utility for participants' own health. The monthly WTP values for moving from participants' current health to a perfect health were elicited using closed-ended iterative bidding contingent valuation method.
RESULTS: A total of 268 CP patients and 364 participants from GP completed the questionnaire. We obtained 4 WTP/QALY ratios ranging from $4700 to $7400, which is close to the lower bound of local gross domestic product per capita, a threshold proposed by World Health Organization. Nevertheless, these values were lower than other proposed thresholds and published empirical researches on diseases with mortality risk. Furthermore, the WTP/QALY ratios from the GP were significantly lower than those from the CP patients, and different determinants were associated with the within group variation identified by multiple linear regression.
CONCLUSIONS: Preference elicitation methods are acceptable and feasible in the socio-cultural context of an Asian environment and the calculation of WTP/QALY ratio produced meaningful answers. The necessity of considering the QALY type or disease-specific QALY in estimating WTP/QALY ratio was highlighted and 1 to 3 times of gross domestic product/capita recommended by World Health Organization could potentially serve as a benchmark for threshold in this Asian context."
21224745,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21224745/,"BACKGROUND: In hip resurfacing arthroplasty a metal implant (prosthesis) is used to resurface the patient's native femoral head. The assessment of bone function around the implant is important in evaluating any subsequent complications. The use of bone single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) imaging may enhance this evaluation.
OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study was to ascertain whether SPECT/CT imaging is feasible in the presence of the metal implant. A secondary objective was to deduce the impact attenuation correction has on the detected counts originating from bone covered by the metal implant.
METHODS: A phantom was constructed to allow assessment of counts obtained from a point source (PS) imaged in the vicinity of a hip resurfacing implant. Three implant cup sizes (4, 8 and 10) were assessed and images acquired with a PS positioned adjacent to the implant pin and under the cup. Multiple acquisitions were undertaken both with and without surrounding soft tissue equivalent material. The images were analysed with and without attenuation correction and the recovered counts compared with that ofa PS imaged in free space (control).
RESULTS: Attenuation-corrected counts did not vary significantly with cup size (P=0.427), PS position (P=0.999), presence of soft tissue equivalent material (P=0.193) or a combination of PS position and soft tissue(P=0.193). The attenuation-corrected counts recovered from a PS (soft tissue equivalent material present) showed an overestimation, compared with the control, both when positioned adjacent to the pin and under the cup; mean 8% (4-16%) and 4% (1-6%), respectively.
CONCLUSION: The results of the study suggest that the application of the attenuation correction technique is applicable to bone SPECT/CT images of the femoral head-neck junction acquired in the presence of a hip resurfacing implant."

OBJECTIVE: To assess whether offering a smaller hot meal, in addition to the existing size, stimulates people to replace their large meal with a smaller meal.
DESIGN: Longitudinal randomized controlled trial assessing the impact of introducing small portion sizes and pricing strategies on consumer choices.
SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: In all, 25 worksite cafeterias and a panel consisting of 308 consumers (mean age=39.18 years, 50% women).
INTERVENTION: A small portion size of hot meals was offered in addition to the existing size. The meals were either proportionally priced (that is, the price per gram was comparable regardless of the size) or value size pricing was employed.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Daily sales of small and the total number of meals, consumers' self-reported compensation behavior and frequency of purchasing small meals.
RESULTS: The ratio of small meals sales in relation to large meals sales was 10.2%. No effect of proportional pricing was found B=-0.11 (0.33), P=0.74, confidence interval (CI): -0.76 to 0.54). The consumer data indicated that 19.5% of the participants who had selected a small meal often-to-always purchased more products than usual in the worksite cafeteria. Small meal purchases were negatively related to being male (B=-0.85 (0.20), P=0.00, CI: -1.24 to -0.46, n=178).
CONCLUSION: When offering a small meal in addition to the existing size, a percentage of consumers that is considered reasonable were inclined to replace the large meal with the small meal. Proportional prices did not have an additional effect. The possible occurrence of compensation behavior is an issue that merits further attention."
21225106,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21225106/,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the influence of low birth weight in full-term infants on body composition at school age.
METHOD: This is a cross-sectional study nested in a cohort of 375 infants recruited at birth between 1993 and 1994 in the state of Pernambuco, Brazil. At 8 years of age, the body composition of 213 children from this cohort was assessed by measurement of triceps and subscapular skinfold thickness and mid upper arm circumference. Multivariable linear regression analysis was used to identify the influence of low birth weight, socioeconomic condition, maternal nutritional status, and child morbidity on triceps skinfold thickness.
RESULTS: Mean triceps and subscapular skinfold thickness, mid upper arm circumference, and upper arm muscle and fat areas were lower in children born at term with low weight than in those with appropriate birth weight. However, these differences were not statistically significant. Multivariable linear regression analysis showed that the relative majority of variance in triceps skinfold thickness (12.3%) was explained by socioeconomic variables, particularly per capita family income (9.1%), followed by anemia and past hospitalization (which, together, explained 5.6% of variance) and maternal body mass index, which contributed toward 2.4% of this variance. Low birth weight had no influence on triceps subcutaneous fat deposition in this age group.
CONCLUSION: Socioeconomic factors and a history of morbidity had a greater influence on body composition than low birth weight in schoolchildren born at term."
21225147,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21225147/,"CONTEXT: Anismus is a prevalent functional cause of outlet delay. It is characterized by symptoms of obstructed defecation associated with paradoxical contraction of the pelvic floor muscles.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the ability of two dimensional anal ultrasonography to identify anismus patients with paradoxical contraction or normal relaxation, comparing findings with manometric measurements.
METHODS: Forty-nine women presenting with outlet delay and a mean validated Wexner constipation score of 13.5 were included in a prospective study. Following screening with anal manometry, the patients were assigned to one of two groups: G-I -with normal relaxation and G-II -patients with anismus. Dynamic anorectal ultrasonography was used to quantifier the movement of the puborectalis muscle and to measure changes in the angle between two converging lines drawn from the 3 o'clock and the 9 o'clock positions of the endoprobe circumference to the internal border of the puborectalis muscle. The angle decreases during straining in patients with normal relaxation, but increases in patients with anismus. The agreement between the two techniques was verified with the Kappa index.
RESULTS: In manometry, during straining the anal canal pressure decreased by 41.3% in G-I and increased by 168.6% in G-II, indicating a diagnosis of anismus for the second group. In US, during straining, the angle produced by the movement of the puborectalis muscle decreased from 63 ± 1.31 to 58 ± 1.509 degrees (P = 0.0135) in 23 of the 30 patients in G-I, indicating normal relaxation, and increased from 66 ± 0.972 to 72 ± 0.897 degrees (P = 0.0001) in 16 of the 19 patients in G-II, indicating anismus. The index of agreement between manometry and two dimensional anal ultrasonography was moderate: 77% (23/30) for G-I and 84% (16/19) for G-II.
CONCLUSION: Two-dimensional dynamic anal ultrasonography showed similar results previously suggested by anal manometry at identifying patients with normal relaxation or paradoxical contraction."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included CTPA examinations of 79 patients (50 female, 52 ± 18 years). Studies were evaluated by two independent inexperienced readers who marked all vessels containing PE. After 3 months all studies were reevaluated by the same two readers, this time aided by CAD prototype. A consensus read by three expert radiologists served as the reference standard. Statistical analysis used χ(2) and McNemar testing.
RESULTS: Expert consensus revealed 119 PEs in 32 studies. For PE detection, the sensitivity of CAD alone was 78%. Inexperienced readers' initial interpretations had an average per-PE sensitivity of 50%, which improved to 71% (p < 0.001) with CAD as a second reader. False positives increased from 0.18 to 0.25 per study (p = 0.03). Per-study, the readers initially detected 27/32 positive studies (84%); with CAD this number increased to 29.5 studies (92%; p = 0.125).
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that CAD significantly improves the sensitivity of PE detection for inexperienced readers with a small but appreciable increase in the rate of false positives."
21225547,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21225547/,"BACKGROUND: The inclusion of patient perceptions in the assessment of health-care quality has gained in importance in recent years. The main instruments applied for this purpose are different types of patient interviews. Complaint data have rarely been used thus far.
METHODS: On the basis of 19 117 complaints and inquiries to the office of the federal government commissioner for patient issues, this article examines to what extent this data source can be systematically used in health-care research and describes which groups of persons addressed their concerns to the commissioner for patient issues between the years 2004 and 2007. In this context, an investigation is done to determine whether reported or reconstructed data on sociodemographic characteristics are sufficient for analysis. A comparison with population-wide data also indicates to what extent the results can be considered representative for the concerns of patients or insurants in Germany. The letters and inquiries were subjected to a quantitative content analysis.
RESULTS: The terms ""gender"", ""region"" and ""insurance status"" can be consistently encoded in a high percentage of those who make complaints and inquiries. The items ""age"" and ""employment status"" can be reconstructed to a lesser degree. However, a structural comparison of ""responders"" and ""non-responders"" shows that the results from the sample with these characteristics can be generalised for all concerns addressed. Data on the education and migration background were insufficient for analysis. Compared to the general population, a disproportionately high number of older and/or retired people (EM/EU pension) as well as unemployed persons and persons from Berlin and the new federal states contact the commissioner for patient issues. However, changes over time show a successive approach to population-wide distributions.
CONCLUSIONS: The results recommend this unique data source for continuous coverage. The data documentation should thus be further standardised and integrated into a complaint management system that includes all relevant complaint offices in Germany."
21225548,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21225548/,"GOAL: Using data from a sample of breast cancer patients it was examined whether the utilisation of inpatient rehabilitation after breast cancer surgery within one year of primary therapy is unequally distributed. Furthermore, it was considered which reasons are associated with the omission of rehabilitation.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Subjects were women after primary manifestation of breast cancer (stages: T(1)-T(3); N(0)-N(2); M(0)) aged 25-70 years. The data were collected as part of an ongoing prospective study on the role of social factors in the long-term course of breast cancer. Patients were interviewed immediately after primary surgery and a second time 1 year later. Interviews were performed by specially trained interviewers using semi-structured schedules. 3 gynaecological clinics in Hannover were involved. Logistic regression models were used for performing the main analyses.
RESULTS: The data of 238 patients were used; 150 (63.3%) of them went to inpatient rehabilitation. Women with 12/13 years of school education were less likely to go to a rehabilitation clinic than women with lower qualifications; no social gradients in terms of occupational position emerged. A strong predictor for rehabilitation was chemotherapy, and in employed women radiotherapy was associated with lower utilisation. The reasons for not going to rehabilitation appear to be rather personal. They were motivated by patients' avoidance of being faced with cancer, and by the desire to take up the every day life that was interrupted by disease. These reasons are not socially patterned.
CONCLUSION: We found no evidence for social barriers for utilising inpatient rehabilitation, but rather that medical and particularly individual reasons apply."
21225676,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21225676/,"OBJECTIVE: To understand racial disparities in the use of total joint replacement, we examined whether there were racial differences in patient-provider communication about treatment of chronic knee and hip osteoarthritis in a sample of African American and white patients referred to Veterans Affairs orthopedic clinics.
METHODS: Audio recorded visits between patients and orthopedic surgeons were coded using the Roter Interaction Analysis System and the Informed Decision-Making model. Racial differences in communication outcomes were assessed using linear regression models adjusted for study design, patient characteristics, and clustering by provider.
RESULTS: The sample (n = 402) included 296 white and 106 African American patients. Most patients were men (95%) and ages 50-64 years (68%). Almost half (41%) reported an income <$20,000. African American patients were younger and reported lower incomes than white patients. Visits with African American patients contained less discussion of biomedical topics (β = -9.14; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] -16.73, -1.54) and more rapport-building statements (β = 7.84; 95% CI 1.85, 13.82) than visits with white patients. However, no racial differences were observed with regard to length of visit, overall amount of dialogue, discussion of psychosocial issues, patient activation/engagement statements, physician verbal dominance, display of positive affect by patients or providers, or discussion related to informed decision making.
CONCLUSION: In this sample, communication between orthopedic surgeons and patients regarding the management of chronic knee and hip osteoarthritis did not, for the most part, vary by patient race. These findings diminish the potential role of communication in Veterans Affairs orthopedic settings as an explanation for well-documented racial disparities in the use of total joint replacement."
21225799,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21225799/,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the incidence of HPV in diffuse high grade pre-cancerous lesions of the larynx.
METHODS: Patient charts were searched for those who presented between October 2008 and June 2009 with diffuse vocal fold leukoplakia. Biopsy proven laryngeal lesions with high grade dysplasia or carcinoma-in-situ (CIS) were examined for patient characteristics and presence of high-risk type HPV detected by in situ hybridization technique.
RESULTS: Fifteen patients with precancerous lesions were identified. Average age was 63 years and 13 were male. One lesion was identified as positive for high-risk HPV, all other lesions were negative. At current follow up, no patient has demonstrated progression to invasive carcinoma.
CONCLUSION: HPV may not play a role in non-progressing diffuse high-grade lesions of the larynx."
21226557,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21226557/,"BACKGROUND: Stratum corneum (SC) readily dislodgeable exfoliation could affect percutaneous absorption and thus influence treatment and toxicological effects. Urea, a classical enhancer, is absorbed less than 1% in vivo in man and might be a useful marker to quantify chemical-drug exfoliation. This study develops a simple model utilizing washing and tape-stripping to quantify surface loss of chemicals topically applied on human skin and estimate the extent of chemical-drug SC exfoliation.
METHODS: Urea, 10% as a model hydrophilic chemical marker, was applied to human skin on identical sites (5 cm(2)/area with 1.8 mg/cm(2) urea) in vitro and in vivo. At time points 0, 4, and 6 h, the area was washed, rubbed, and stripped five times with cellophane tape. Quantitative urea was performed by colorimetric assay.
RESULTS: The data of the in vitro protected non-exfoliating model, as the control, showed no statistical difference between 0-, 4-, and 6-h recovery (P > 0.05). In the air-exposed model in vivo exfoliation in man, the recovery decreased from 98.8 ± 3.7% to 93.9 ± 6.8% in 4 h and 86.4 ± 3.0% in 6 h (P = 0.02). In the cloth-covered model in vivo, the recovery decreased from 99.4 ± 5.8% to 84.9 ± 5.3% in 4 h (P = 0.04), which reached 73 ± 2.8% within 6 h (P = 0.007).
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that urea, measured with washing, rubbing, and tape-stripping, can be used as a possible chemical-drug SC readily dislodgeable exfoliation and friction rubbing metric. In addition, this might help to determine the rule of skin exfoliation in dermatopharmacologic and dermatoxicologic assessment."
21226619,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21226619/,"INTRODUCTION: This is the first case study to report on using stereotactic body radiotherapy as an alternative and novel treatment modality for embolization to reduce the risk of operative bleeding for a metastatic renal cell tumor.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 58-year-old woman presented with an asymptomatic large 7-cm tumor on the parieto-occipital vertex of the skull. Given the location of this lesion along with its vascular histology, it was a challenge to provide safe and effective treatment using conventional management strategies.
CONCLUSION: We report on a rare presentation of a metastatic renal cell cancer and the use of stereotactic body radiotherapy as an innovative radiation approach to deliver high-dose radiation safely to control this large aggressive and vascular metastasis. The success of this management strategy allowed for minimal intraoperative blood loss, and the patient continues with local control 1-year posttreatment."
21226754,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21226754/,"AIMS: The aim of this study was to examine whether a nurse-administered minimal psychological intervention for depressive symptoms improves diabetes-specific quality of life and glycaemic control in older persons with diabetes.
BACKGROUND: Depression is common among persons with diabetes and may have a negative impact on diabetes. Interventions aimed at reducing depressive symptoms may positively influence diabetes-specific quality of life as well.
METHODS: A pragmatic, randomized controlled trial was carried out comparing the intervention with usual care among 208 Dutch primary care patients of ≥60 years with type 2 diabetes and co-occurring minor to moderate depression. Data on symptom distress and emotional distress were collected during 2003-2006, and haemoglobin A1c levels were obtained from general practices. Data were analysed using mixed model, repeated measures ANCOVAS. Hba1c was collected retrospectively from general practices between December 2006-February 2007. In July 2007 we retrieved some additional HbA1c data from the medical records of the university hospital.
RESULTS: Only in higher-educated persons did the intervention have statistically significant effect on both emotional distress and symptom distress (DSC-R total score at 9 months P=0.001; PAID, 9 months P=0.03). Furthermore, we found an effect on symptom distress in men (9 months P=0.01), and on emotional distress in persons with a shorter diabetes duration (<7 years) (9 months P=0.04). A significant trend over time for haemoglobin A1c was found in favour of the intervention, with a statistically significant difference between groups after 9 months (P=0.02).
CONCLUSION: The nurse-administered intervention had limited effects on diabetes-specific quality of life. As only certain subgroups benefited, ways of increasing effectiveness in other groups should be explored. The potentially beneficial effect on glycaemic control is encouraging and needs further research because of small numbers in the analysis."
21226938,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21226938/,"BACKGROUND: Although Campylobacter is the leading cause of reported bacterial gastro-enteritis in industrialized countries, little is known on its recurrence. The objective of this study is to describe the risk and the patient characteristics of recurrent episodes of human campylobacteriosis reported in Quebec.
METHODS: Laboratory-confirmed cases of campylobacteriosis reported in the province of Quebec, Canada, through ongoing surveillance between 1996 and 2006 were analyzed. The risk of having a recurrent episode of campylobacteriosis was described using life table estimates. Logistic regression was used to assess if gender, age and patient residential location were associated with an increased risk of recurrence.
RESULTS: Compared to the baseline risk, the risk for a recurrent disease event was higher for a period of four years and followed a decreasing trend. This increased risk of a recurrent event was similar across gender, but higher for people from rural areas and lower for children under four years of age.
CONCLUSIONS: These results may suggest the absence of durable immunity or clinical resilience following a first episode of campylobacteriosis and periodical re-exposure, at least among cases reported through the surveillance system."
21226954,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21226954/,"BACKGROUND: Local pelvic recurrence after radical cystectomy for muscle invasive bilharzial related squamous cell carcinoma accounts for 75% of treatment failures even in organ confined tumors. Despite the proven value of lymphadenectomy, up to 60% of patients undergoing cystectomy do not have it. These factors are in favor of adjuvant radiotherapy reevaluation. objectives: to evaluate the effect of adjuvant radiotherapy on disease free survival in muscle invasive bilharzial related squamous cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder and to test the predictability of radio-sensitivity using the anti apoptotic protein Bcl-XL.
METHODS: The study prospectively included 71 patients, (47 males, 24 females) with muscle invasive bilharzial related squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder (Stage pT2a-T3N0-N3M0) who underwent radical cystectomy in Assiut university hospitals between January 2005 and December 2006. Thirty eight patients received adjuvant radiotherapy to the pelvis in the dose of 50Gy/25 fractions/5 weeks (Group 1), while 33 patients did not receive adjuvant radiotherapy (group 2). Immunohistochemical characterization for bcl-xL expression was done. Follow up was done every 3 months for 12 to 36 months with a mean of 16 ± 10 months. All data were analyzed using SPSS version 16. Three years cumulative disease free survival was calculated and adjusted to Bcl-XL expression and side effects of the treatment were recorded.
RESULTS: The disease free cumulative survival was 48% for group 1 and 29% for group 2 (log rank p value 0.03). The multivariate predictors of tumor recurrence were the positive Bcl-XL expression (odd ratio 41.1, 95% CI 8.4-102.3, p < 0.0001) and radiotherapy (odd ratio 0.19, 95% CI 0.05-0.78, p < 0.02). With Cox regression, the only independent multivariate predictor of radio-sensitivity was the Bcl-XL expression with odd ratio 4.6 and a p value < 0.0001. All patients tolerated the treatment with no life threatening or late complications during the period of follow up.
CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant radiotherapy for muscle invasive bilharzial related squamous cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder has potential effectiveness and minor side effects. Moreover, Bcl-XL expression is a valuable tool for predicting those who might not respond to this adjuvant treatment."
21226967,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21226967/,"BACKGROUND: Obesity is associated with metabolic risk factors. Body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, waist-hip ratio (WHR) and waist-height ratio (WHtR) are used to predict the risk of obesity related diseases. However, it has not been examined whether these four indicators can detect the clustering of metabolic risk factors in Chinese subjects.
METHODS: There are 772 Chinese subjects in the present study. Metabolic risk factors including high blood pressure, dyslipidemia, and glucose intolerance were identified according to the criteria from WHO. All statistical analyses were performed separately according to sex by using the SPSS 12.0.
RESULTS: BMI, waist circumference and WHtR values were all significantly associated with blood pressure, glucose, triglyceride and also with the number of metabolic risk factors in both male and female subjects (all of P < 0.05). According to receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, the area under curve values of BMI, waist circumference and WHtR did not differ in male (0.682 vs. 0.661 vs. 0.651) and female (0.702 vs. 0.671 vs. 0.674) subjects, indicating that the three values could be useful in detecting the occurrence of multiple metabolic risk factors. The appropriate cut-off values of BMI, waist circumference and WHtR to predict the presence of multiple metabolic risk factors were 22.85 and 23.30 kg/m² in males and females, respectively. Those of waist circumference and WHtR were 91.3 cm and 87.1 cm, 0.51 and 0.53 in males and females, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The BMI, waist circumference and WHtR values can similarly predict the presence of multiple metabolic risk factors in Chinese subjects."
21227468,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21227468/,"BACKGROUND: To assess whether cholangiocytes of rats with liver cirrhosis are more tolerant to ischemic changes than normal rats, and whether this is due to arteriovenous fistulas.
METHODS: Ninety-eight Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into the normal group (n = 30) and the cirrhosis group (n = 68), and then each group was divided into controls and those with bile duct ischemia. At 0 h, 6 h, 3 d, and 14 d after the induction of bile duct ischemia, the liver of each rat was removed and stained with toluidine blue to compare cholangiocyte morphology. Cholangiocyte apoptosis was evaluated by a deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay. Expression of VEGF, HIF1, NF-kB(p65) was assessed by quantitative analysis of the products of reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Resin casts were used to reproduce the intrahepatic vasculature of cirrhotic rats, and the presence of communications between the portal vein and hepatic artery was assessed with stereomicroscopy.
RESULTS: Rats with liver cirrhosis were more tolerant than normal rats 6 h after bile duct ischemia (P < 0.05); at 3 and 14 d after the ischemic insult, there was no significant difference between the cirrhotic rats and normal rats. Levels of expression of VEGF, HIF1, and NF-kB(p65) genes, either in normal rats or cirrhotic rats, were significantly elevated compared with those in the control group (∗, ∗∗P < 0.05), but a lower extent changes appeared in the cirrhotic rats (∗∗∗P < 0.05). Several communications could be observed between the portal vein and hepatic artery.
CONCLUSION: Cholangiocytes of cirrhotic rats appear to be more tolerant to ischemia of bile duct than non-cirrhotic rats. This may be due to the protective role of arterioportal fistulas."
21227643,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21227643/,"OBJECTIVES: Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is controversial as a causative factor of head and neck cancers despite the relatively high frequency of HPV infection in extragenital organ cancers. We aimed to clarify whether HPV directly affects the oncogenesis and biologic behavior of glottis cancer (GC).
METHODS: Paraffin block was obtained from 95 patients who were diagnosed as GC and 15 normal controls. HPV genotyping chip, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used for identification of prevalence, phenotype, and physical status of HPV. We compared results with the clinicopathological parameters of GC patients.
RESULTS: HPV was detected in 7.4% (7 of 95) of GC patients, whereas 0% (0 of 15) of controls. Of the HPV-positive tumors in GCs, HPV-16 was the single most common type and HPV-16 prevalence rate was 57.1% (4 of 7). Among the HPV-16 infected GCs, integration of HPV-16 was found only in one case (1 of 4). There was no significant difference in HPV prevalence between GC and controls and HPV had no significant relation with any clinicopathologic parameters of GC patients.
CONCLUSION: HPV infection may not be a causative factor in the oncogenesis and biologic behavior of GC."
21227749,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21227749/,"OBJECTIVE: In the elderly, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is frequently under diagnosed. This study was undertaken to assess the accuracy of the Berlin questionnaire to diagnose OSA in a large healthy elderly population.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Six hundred forty-three participants aged 65.6 years were examined. All subjects completed the Berlin questionnaire and underwent at-home respiratory recording. Presence of OSA was defined by an AHI>15.
RESULTS: Of the respondents, 202 subjects (31.4%) were in an OSA high-risk group according to the Berlin questionnaire. The high-risk subjects were significantly heavier, had greater waist and hip circumferences, higher AHI, and reported more frequently hypertension and diabetes. Habitual snoring was present in 54% of the sample, sleepiness in 12% of participants, and a BMI>30 and a history of hypertension in 42.1%. Being in the high-risk group predicted an AHI>15 with a sensitivity of 77%, a specificity of 39%, a positive predictive value of 63% and a negative predictive value of 55%. Among Berlin questionnaire categories, snoring correctly classified 61% of the sample and explained the 5% variance of AHI.
CONCLUSIONS: The Berlin questionnaire did not provide a high level of diagnostic specificity to discriminate OSA in an elderly population. Although not sufficiently accurate, this questionnaire can be used to identify subjects for sleep study assessment."
21228383,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21228383/,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to localize the cell bodies of palisade endings that are associated with the myotendinous junctions of the extraocular muscles.
METHODS: Rhesus monkeys received tract-tracer injections (tetramethylrhodamine dextran [TMR-DA] or choleratoxin subunit B [CTB]) into the oculomotor and trochlear nuclei, which contain the motoneurons of extraocular muscles. All extraocular muscles were processed for the combined immunocytochemical detection of the tracer and SNAP-25 or synaptophysin for the visualization of the complete muscle innervation.
RESULTS: In all muscles--except the lateral rectus--en plaque and en grappe motor endings, but also palisade endings, were anterogradely labeled. In addition a few tracer-labeled tendon organs were found. One group of tracer-negative nerve fibers was identified as thin tyrosine hydroxylase-positive sympathetic fibers, and a second less numerous group of tracer-negative fibers may originate from the trigeminal ganglia. No cellular or terminal tracer labeling was present within the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus or the trigeminal ganglia.
CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm those of earlier studies and furthermore suggest that the somata of palisade endings are located close to the extraocular motor nuclei--in this case, probably within the C and S groups around the periphery of the oculomotor nucleus. The multiple en grappe endings have also been shown to arise from these cells groups, but it is not possible to distinguish different populations in these experiments."
21228593,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21228593/,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Traditionally, tobacco is considered as part of the military culture. A cross-sectional survey was designed to clarify if smoking habit increases the caries risk in a sample of Italian adults attending a Military Academy.
METHODS: Clinical examinations including dental caries and presence of bleeding at probing were carried out following WHO criteria. Related socio-behavioural factors were collected. Four calibrated examiners observed 763 subjects (men = 722; 94.6% and women = 41; 5.4%).
RESULTS: One of the 763 subjects did not declare the smoking status and was excluded from the analysis. Hundred twenty-six (16.5%) subjects claimed to have never smoked, 200 (26.3%) were coded as light smokers and 436 (57.2%) as heavy tobacco users. Statistically significant linear trend across the educational level (p = 0.03), self-satisfaction with the appearance of teeth and gums (p = 0.04) and dental check-up in the past 6 months (p = 0.02) was found among the 3 subgroups. Almost the entire sample showed caries experience (84.1%). Mean DS ranged from 0.6 in the nonsmokers subgroup to 1.1 in the heavy smokers. Differences among means were statistically significant for DS, DMFS and Significant Caries Index (p = 0.01, 0.04 and 0.03, respectively). The zero-inflated regression model showed that caries severity was significantly associated with smoking habit (p = 0.02), dental check-up in the past 6 months (p = 0.01), self-satisfaction with the appearance of teeth and gums (p < 0.01) and healthy gums (p = 0.04).
CONCLUSION: Heavy smokers attending a Military Academy showed a higher prevalence of caries, confirming a correlation between the disease and tobacco use."
21228662,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21228662/,"BACKGROUND: A 1-cm distal clearance margin is recommended for mid/low rectal cancers.
OBJECTIVE: We evaluate whether shorter distal margins after restorative rectal resection affect oncologic outcomes for patients with a clear circumferential margin.
DESIGN: From a prospective cancer database, patients undergoing restorative proctectomy for mid/lower third rectal cancer from 1991 to 2006 with a distal margin of ≤ 1 cm (group A) were compared with those with >1-cm distal margin (group B) for demographics, tumor, treatment, and outcomes. The impact of a distal margin ≤ 0.5 cm was also similarly assessed.
RESULTS: Of 784 patients, distal resection margin was ≤ 1 cm in 198 and >1 cm in 586. Local recurrence occurred in 26 patients (3.3%). Mean distal resection margin was 2.3 ± 1.6 cm. Group A was associated with a lower level of tumor (1.3, 0.1-9 cm vs 2, 0.1-9 cm; P < .001), a higher rate of handsewn anastomosis (29.5% vs 12.9%, P < .001), and fewer T3/T4 tumors (28.2% vs 39.1%, P = .06). The 5-year local recurrence rate was 4.4% in group A and 4.3% in group B, and was 6.4% in patients with a distal margin <5 mm and 4.1% in those with a distal margin >5 mm. On multivariable analysis, local recurrence or disease-free survival was not associated with distal margin irrespective of whether this was <1 or <0.5 cm, adjusting for age, sex, use of adjuvant therapy, T stage, and differentiation.
CONCLUSIONS: A distal resection margin of <1 cm for patients undergoing restorative radical resection for low-lying rectal cancer does not adversely influence oncologic outcomes when other factors are carefully considered and a multimodality approach is used. This factor, when carefully considered, will help avoid a permanent stoma in some circumstances."

The aims of this study were to determine whether effective biliary drainage in patients with obstructive jaundice caused by HCC can affect clinical outcome and to identify those factors that affect effective biliary drainage and clinical outcome.
METHODS: The clinical records of 68 patients with obstructive jaundice caused by HCC who underwent endoscopic or percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage from 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2008 were analyzed. Effective biliary drainage was defined as a decrease in total bilirubin level of more than 30% of the preprocedural value within 4 weeks.
RESULTS: (i) Effective biliary drainage was achieved in 51.5% of the patients who underwent a biliary drainage procedure. The independent risk factors for ineffective biliary drainage were total bilirubin more than 13 mg/dl and Child-Turcotte-Pugh class C. (ii) Patients with effective biliary drainage showed a significant improvement of Child-Turcotte-Pugh class and received additional treatment for HCC. (iii) The mean survival times of patients who received effective or ineffective biliary drainage were 247 and 44 days, respectively. (iv) The independent risk factors of mortality were an age of more than 63 years, ineffective biliary drainage, and no following treatment for HCC.
CONCLUSION: When effective biliary drainage was achieved after an appropriate biliary drainage procedure in patients with obstructive jaundice caused by HCC, survival improved."

METHODS: thirty-three patients treated with intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) were included. RT doses ranged between 60- 66.6 Gy to SV, 74-77.7 Gy to P and 50.4- 60 Gy to PLN. Max acute R toxicity was graded by a physician according to the RTOG side effect criteria during the period from the initiation of therapy until the end of the third month. Max late R and B toxicities were graded 3 months after the completion of RT by a physician using the RTOG GI and urogenital toxicity score and by patients using EORTC QLQ - PR25 self questionnaire separately. The effects of R and B doses and additional PLN irradiation on acute and late R and B toxicities and compatibility of patient- and physician-graded toxicity scores were investigated. RTOG GI and urogenital toxicity scores and EORTC QLQ - PR25 self questionnaire results were correlated.
RESULTS: significant factors for acute R toxicity were: max R; R volume receiving ≥ 68 Gy; and PLN irradiation. PLN irradiation was marginally significant for late R toxicity; the mean B dose was a significant factor for late B toxicity.
CONCLUSION: the results of this study suggest that although PLN irradiation increased acute R toxicity, it has no effect on late R and B toxicity. Patient- and physician-evaluated late R and B toxicity scores were concordant."
21229629,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21229629/,"PURPOSE: the aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of atelectasis (AT) on overall survival of patients with non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
METHODS: the study included patients of both sexes with unresectable stage III and IV NSCLC with good performance status (PS) (ECOG ≤ 2). Patients were divided into two groups: with AT (AT+) and without AT (AT-): Factors analyzed included sex, age, histologic type, ECOG performance status, stage of disease and treatment modality. Overall survival was estimated according to Kaplan-Meier method, and multivariate analysis was used to identify independent prognostic factors.
RESULTS: we evaluated 247 patients (83% males and 17% females); 47/247 (19%) of patients belonged to AT+ group. In this group 21% of patients had stage IIIA, 46% IIIB stage, and 33% IV stage. Overall survival was significantly longer in the AT+ group (15.23 vs. 9.03 months, p=0.001). AT+ patients in stages III and IV had significantly longer overall survival than AT- patients in the same stages (p=0.001, p=0.002, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that atelectasis (p=0.001), stage of disease (p=0.001), and treatment modality (p=0.005) were independent prognostic factors associated with survival.
CONCLUSION: atelectasis is favorable prognostic factor concerning overall survival in patients with NSCLC."

METHODS: interventional pain management was carried out by sympathetic block or spinal analgesia. Patients were allocated into 2 groups according to the tumor localization, namely group 1 (n=61; patients with pancreatic cancer confined to the head of pancreas), and group 2 (n=55; patients with pancreatic cancer confined to the body or tail of pancreas).
RESULTS: among the patients who had interventional pain management, sufficient analgesia was achieved by sympathetic block in 9 of the 14 (64.3%) of them in group 1 and only in 3 of the 11 (27.3%) patients in group 2. Spinal analgesia was used in 5 of the 14 (35.7%) patients who required interventional pain management in group 1 and in 8 of the 11 (72.7%) patients in group 2 (p>0.05).
CONCLUSION: pain palliation could be achieved by sympathetic block in patients with cancer localized in the head of pancreas while patients with tumor localized in the body and tail experienced sufficient pain palliation by spinal analgesia rather than sympathetic block."

METHODS: We used data from a nested case-control study comprising 374 subjects with either an incident stroke or a myocardial infarction and 1496 controls. All subjects were aged 55 years and older and participated in the Rotterdam Study. Mean follow-up was 4.2 years (range, 0.1 to 6.5 years). We evaluated which correlates of coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease contribute to the prediction of either a new incident myocardial infarction or a stroke. Logistic regression modeling and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC area) were used to quantify the predictive value of the established risk factors and the added value of IMT.
RESULTS: The ROC area of a model with age and sex only was 0.65 (95% CI, 0.62 to 0.69). Independent risk factors were previous myocardial infarction and stroke, diabetes mellitus, smoking, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and total and HDL cholesterol levels. These risk factors increased the ROC area from 0.65 to 0.72 (95% CI, 0.69 to 0.75). This model correctly predicted 17% of all subjects with coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease. When common carotid IMT was added to the previous model, the ROC area increased to 0.75 (95% CI, 0.72 to 0.78). When only the IMT measurement was used, the ROC area was 0.71 (95% CI, 0.68 to 0.74), and 14% of all subjects were correctly predicted. There was no difference in ROC area when different measurement sites were used.
CONCLUSIONS: Adding IMT to a risk function for coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease does not result in a substantial increase in the predictive value when used as a screening tool."
11441202,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11441202/,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is a frequent finding in young patients with stroke. The aim of this study was to assess whether PFO is a family trait.
METHODS: Sixty-two consecutive patients younger than 60 years of age with ischemic stroke and 62 age and gender-matched control siblings were examined by means of contrast transcranial Doppler (TCD) of the middle cerebral artery, using a standardized protocol. The reliability of TCD examination in our laboratory was assessed against transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). All TCD recordings were reviewed by a blinded experienced observer from another center. Disagreements between readers were resolved by unblinded consensus review.
RESULTS: Siblings of patients with PFO had a significantly higher prevalence of PFO than had siblings of patients without PFO (61.5% versus 30.6%; OR 3.64 [1.3 to 10.5]; P=0.015). The kappa statistics indicated that agreement of pairs (patients/control siblings) was not due to chance. The strength of the association was sex dependent. In women pairs, prevalence of a PFO was 76.5% in siblings of patients with PFO and 25% in siblings of patients without PFO, giving an OR of 9.8 (95% CI 2 to 47.9; P<0.01). In contrast, in men, no significant difference was observed in the prevalence of PFO between siblings of patients with or without PFO (respectively 33.3% and 35%), giving an OR of 0.9 (95% CI 0.2 to 4.9; P=0.9).
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that, in women, PFO is a family trait."

METHODS: Data from Sponsors Report, which quantifies the exposure that sponsors of selected televised sporting events receive during broadcasts of those events, were compiled for all motor sports events covered by the service for the period 1997 through 1999.
RESULTS: From 1997 through 1999, tobacco companies achieved 169 hours of television advertising exposure and $410.5 million of advertising value for their products by sponsoring motor sports events. If tobacco companies comply with the Master Settlement Agreement and maintain their advertising at 1999 levels, they will still be able to achieve more than 25 hours of television exposure and an equivalent television advertising value of $99.1 million per year.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite a federal ban on tobacco advertising on television, tobacco companies achieve the equivalent of more than $150 million in television advertising per year through their sponsorship of motor sports events. The Master Settlement Agreement likely will do little to address this problem."
11441779,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11441779/,"OBJECTIVES: To gather information that describes the extent of gambling and problem gambling in Prince Edward Island (PEI), to rigorously analyze the relation between gambling activities and problem gambling, to document cognitive and emotional correlates of problem gambling, and to identify an at-risk gambling group.
METHOD: We selected a random, stratified sample (n = 809) to represent the adult population of PEI. We administered both the South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS) and an early version of the Canadian Problem Gambling Index (CPGI) to participants who had gambled.
RESULTS: The current rate of problem gambling was 3.1%. Problem gamblers were likely to be under age 30 years, to be single, and to report cognitive, emotional, and substance abuse correlates. Multiple-regression analysis identified a unique and substantial relation between problem gambling and video lottery terminal (VLT) use. We identified a group of at-risk gamblers (scoring 1 or 2 on the SOGS), comprising 14% of the sample.
CONCLUSIONS: Gambling and problem gambling patterns in PEI resemble those in most other provinces. The relation found between problem gambling, VLT use, and cognitive, emotional, and substance use correlates should apply to the greater population as well."
11442152,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11442152/,"PURPOSE: To describe a particular form of absence epilepsy (AE) characterized by an atypical EEG pattern (fast rhythmic discharges) during sleep and an unfavorable course with the persistence of seizures at a late age and drug resistance.
METHODS: We reviewed the medical files of 31 patients diagnosed with AE at our institution been 1995 and 1999 for whom an EEG during sleep had been recorded. Patients with fast rhythmic discharges during sleep were selected for the study.
RESULTS: Five patients showed the usual criteria of childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) or juvenile absence epilepsy (JAE), but with fast discharges of rhythmic spikes (10-15 Hz) during sleep. such as those typically observed in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Four patients were of adult age at the time of the last examination. Intellectual capacities were ""borderline"" in each case, with visible social and learning handicaps. Absences were the initial seizure event in all patients, but four patients developed generalized tonic-clonic seizures during the course of the disease. Treatment using a combination of antiabsence drugs such as valproate and lamotrigine led to only marginal improvement.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings illustrate the utility of sleep EEG in detecting the fast rhythmic discharges that are markers of drug resistance in AE and suggest the existence of transitional forms of AE that are intermediate between idiopathic and cryptogenic/symptomatic generalized epilepsies."
11442153,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11442153/,"PURPOSE: We investigated the response to antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy in patients with localisation-related epilepsy associated with different underlying causes.
METHODS: Five hundred and fifty adolescent and adult patients who had partial epilepsy treated with AEDs and who had undergone magnetic resonance imaging of brain were followed up prospectively from 1984 at a single centre. More than 70% were newly diagnosed. None had had epilepsy surgery.
RESULTS: Three hundred and twelve (57%) patients had been seizure free at their last clinic visit for at least a year. Patients with mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS; n = 73, 42% seizure free) were less likely to be controlled (p < 0.01) than were those with arteriovenous malformation (AVM; n = 14, 78%), cerebral infarction (n = 46, 67%), primary tumour (n = 35, 63%), cortical gliosis (n = 81, 57%), cerebral atrophy (n = 49, 55%), and cortical dysplasia (CD; n = 63, 54%). Among the seizure-free patients, those with MTS were more likely to require more than one AED compared with those with other aetiologies (48 vs. 35%; p < 0.05). There was no difference in outcome between patients with symptomatic and cryptogenic epilepsy (n = 361, 58% vs. n = 189, 56% seizure free, respectively). Patients with MTS, CD, and cryptogenic epilepsy were more likely (p = 0.02) to have a family history of epilepsy than were the other groups. MTS patients also had a higher incidence of febrile convulsions (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with focal-onset epilepsy became seizure free on AED treatment. MTS-related seizures had the worst prognosis. Although many patients with this pathology may benefit from epilepsy surgery, a considerable number will be controlled with AED therapy."
11442166,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11442166/,"PURPOSE: Cryptogenic epilepsy, the group of epilepsy syndromes for which an etiology is unknown, comprises approximately 20% of all epilepsy syndromes. We selected patients in this subgroup of epilepsy and tested them for evidence of Toxoplasma gondii IgG antibodies by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. T. gondii is found in up to 20% of the U.S. population forming dormant brain cysts in the latent bradyzoite form. We investigated the hypothesis that dormant T. gondii infection might be associated with cryptogenic epilepsy.
METHODS: We selected patients with cryptogenic epilepsies and tested them for evidence of T. gondii IgG antibodies by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A control group was also tested for comparison.
RESULTS: We have found a statistically-significant elevation of T. gondii antibodies among cryptogenic epilepsy patients as compared to controls [59% increase in optical density (OD), p = 0.013]. This association persisted after adjustment for subjects' gender and age in a multiple logistic regression model; however, it was no longer as statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that chronic T. gondii infection with brain cysts may be a cause of cryptogenic epilepsy."
11442179,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11442179/,"PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence of sleep-related symptoms and sleep-related breathing disorders by polysomnography in patients with normal-tension glaucoma (NTG).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This comparative case series included 23 patients with NTG, 14 NTG suspects, and 30 comparison patients without NTG. A sleep history was obtained and determined to be positive or negative. Polysomnography was offered for patients with a positive sleep history. Prevalence of a positive sleep history and prevalence of sleep disorders were the main outcome measures.
RESULTS: The NTG, NTG suspect, and comparison groups did not differ with respect to age, body mass index, systemic disease, gender, or race. Thirteen (57%) of 23 patients with NTG, 6 (43%) of 14 NTG suspects, and 1 (3%) of 30 comparison patients had a positive sleep history (P = 0.001). Nine of 13 patients with NTG and four of six NTG suspects with a positive sleep history chose to undergo polysomnography. Seven (78%) of nine patients with NTG and all four NTG suspects undergoing polysomnography were diagnosed with a sleep disorder. Five patients with NTG had sleep apnea and two had sleep hypopnea. Two NTG suspects had sleep apnea; one had sleep hypopnea; and one had upper airway resistance syndrome. The one comparison patient with a positive sleep history had upper airway resistance syndrome by polysomnography.
CONCLUSIONS: Sleep-disturbed breathing may be a risk factor for NTG. Although we do not provide evidence for a cause-and-effect relationship, various physiologic factors produced by sleep-disturbed breathing may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of this optic neuropathy. We recommend obtaining a sleep history from patients with NTG and performing polysomnography in those patients with sleep disturbance symptoms."
11443020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11443020/,"OBJECTIVES: to identify the factors associated with hospital admission and the differences in management and outcome of stroke patients between hospital and home.
DESIGN: a prospective community stroke register (1995-8) with multiple notification sources.
SETTING: an inner city multi-ethnic population of 234 533 in South London, UK.
PARTICIPANTS: 975 subjects with first in a lifetime strokes, whether or not they were admitted to hospital. Patients dying suddenly and those already hospitalized at the time of stroke were excluded.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: factors associated with hospital admission; differences in management in the acute phase of stroke; mortality and dependency assessed by the Barthel index 3 months post-stroke.
RESULTS: 812 patients were admitted to hospital for stroke; 163 were managed in the community. Factors independently associated with hospital admission included stroke severity, pre-stroke independence, atrial fibrillation, having an intracranial haemorrhage and having a non-lacunar infarction. Computed tomography scan rates were higher in admitted (78%) than non-admitted patients (63%; P=0.001). By 3 months, 285 (35%) of the admitted patients had died compared with 13 (8%) of non-admitted patients (P<0.001). Of the admitted patients, 241 (47%) had a Barthel index > or =18 compared with 106 (72%) of those who were not admitted (P<0.001). After adjusting for case-mix variables, the odds ratios for death and dependency (Barthel index<18) in admitted and non-admitted patients were 2.21 (0.96-5.12) and 2.39 (1.35-4.22) respectively.
CONCLUSION: patients with clinical indicators for a more severe stroke were more likely to be admitted to hospital. Hospitalized stroke patients may have poorer survival and disability rates than those who remain at home, even after adjustment for case mix. There may be some aspects of acute hospital care that may be detrimental to outcome in certain groups of stroke patients. This requires further investigation."
11443023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11443023/,"BACKGROUND: the Mini Nutritional Assessment is a validated clinical tool for the assessment of nutritional status in older people. Moderate to severe malnutrition is common in elderly patients in hospital and is associated with a poor outcome.
OBJECTIVES: to determine whether the Mini Nutritional Assessment can predict the outcome of hospital stay in older individuals.
SETTING: a tertiary-care geriatric hospital.
METHODS: we evaluated nutritional status using the Mini Nutritional Assessment in 1319 patients (mean age 84.2, 70% women) admitted between February 1996 and January 1998; 1145 complete assessments were available for analysis. The assessment was carried out on admission and studied in relation to length of stay and in-hospital mortality for all patients, and discharge to a nursing home for those living at home before admission.
RESULTS: Mini Nutritional Assessment scores averaged 19.9+/-3.8 (mean+/-SD) with a range of 8.0-27.5, and a median of 20.5. A score below 17, corresponding to malnutrition, was associated with an almost threefold increase in mortality and in the rate of discharge to a nursing home; this contrasted with a score above 24, which indicates satisfactory nutritional status (11.3% vs 3.7%; P<0.01 and 20.3% vs 7.7%; P<0.001, respectively). Length of stay was longer in the low scoring group (42.0 days vs 30.5 days; P<0.0002).
CONCLUSION: Poor nutritional status as measured by the Mini Nutritional Assessment was associated with increased in-hospital mortality, a higher rate of discharge to nursing homes and a longer length of stay."
11443024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11443024/,"OBJECTIVES: to determine if skin wrinkling in a site that had received limited sun exposure may be a marker of health status and biological age.
DESIGN: population-based, cross-sectional study.
PARTICIPANTS: we evaluated the health status of representative samples of elderly Greek-born people living in Melbourne, Greeks living in rural Greece, Anglo-Celtic Australians living in Melbourne and Swedes living in Sweden. We carried out microtopographic assessment of their skin and measured plasma dehydroepiandrosterone concentrations.
METHODS: we derived activities of daily living, well-being, memory and general health status scores from a cross-cultural questionnaire. We measured skin wrinkling using cutaneous microtopographic methods and plasma dehydroepiandrosterone by enzyme immuno-assay.
RESULTS: skin wrinkling was positively correlated with age (r(s)=0.27, P<0.0001) and negatively with body mass index (r(s)=-0.19, P<0.0001). Therefore, all analyses were controlled for these variables. Plasma dehydroepiandrosterone was higher in smokers than non-smokers (2.86 vs 2.08; P<0.001) and men had significantly higher plasma dehydroepiandrosterone than women (2.74 vs 1.69; P<0.0001). In the pooled data, skin wrinkling was negatively associated with general health score (r(s)=-0.13, P<0.01) and activities of daily living score (r(s)=-0.14, P<0.05) after controlling for age, body mass index and smoking. These associations were more pronounced in women. Finally, those with the least skin wrinkling had the highest dehydroepiandrosterone level (r(s)=-0.12, P=0.06) after adjusting for age, smoking and sex.
CONCLUSION: skin wrinkling in a site with limited sun exposure might be used as a marker of health status and, to some extent, biological age--particularly for women."

OBJECTIVES: to examine whether elderly mentally ill continuing-care National Health Service patients fulfilled a variety of eligibility criteria for their placement, and to identify the characteristics of patients who met local eligibility criteria.
DESIGN: descriptive study.
SETTING: four continuing-care units for elderly mentally ill patients in and around London.
SUBJECTS: 67 continuing-care inpatients.
METHODS: interview with nurse carer and, where possible, the patient with the use of standard global, functional, behavioural and cognitive rating scales. We determined fulfillment of Royal College of Psychiatrists' guideline criteria and three local eligibility criteria for elderly mentally ill continuing care. We identified clinical differences between those eligible and ineligible.
RESULTS: although there were wide variations between local eligibility criteria, their effects were the same. In total, 58% of patients fulfilled all local eligibility criteria; 42% fulfilled none. Patients who fulfilled local eligibility criteria scored much higher on ratings of aggression, activity disturbance (wandering, and purposeless and inappropriate activity) and paranoid and delusional ideation. Ten percent of patients fulfilled Royal College of Psychiatrists' criteria but not local eligibility criteria.
CONCLUSIONS: comprehensive and unambiguous national eligibility criteria should be introduced to reflect clinical needs and provide equity of access."

OBJECTIVE: to examine the relationship between physical activity and risk of hip fracture in frail older people.
DESIGN: a case-control study.
SETTING: Auckland, New Zealand.
SUBJECTS: a random sample of individuals hospitalized with a fracture of the femoral neck (n=911) and 910 randomly selected age- and sex-matched individuals from the lists of a random sample of general practitioners.
METHODS: we sought information on physical activity and other potential risk factors for hip fracture from cases and controls, using a standardized interviewer-administered questionnaire. We conducted multivariate analyses, separately for those living in private homes and residential institutions.
RESULTS: increasing hours of physical activity per week protected against the risk of hip fracture among individuals living in private homes, including those who are over 80. However, among individuals living in institutions, physical activity levels were extremely low (<15% participated in >/=2 h per week) and there was limited evidence of a protective effect.
CONCLUSIONS: efforts to prevent hip fractures in individuals living in care homes and institutions should focus on passive interventions which are known to be effective."

The object of this study was to assess the outcomes of LTAC and LTPC and compare them with those of institutional open procedure used as controls.
METHODS: Perioperative data and surgical outcomes of patients who underwent TAC or TPC were analyzed and compared retrospectively at a single institution between 1991 and 1999.
RESULTS: A total of 73 TACs performed during a 9-year period were evenly distributed between laparoscopic (n = 37) and open (n = 36) approaches. There were no significant differences between patient groups with respect to genders, age, weight, proportion of patients with inflammatory bowel disease, and the number of patients undergoing ileorectal anastomosis. The median operative time was longer with the laparoscopic method (270 vs 178 min; p = 0.001), but the median length of hospital stay was significantly shorter (6 vs 9 days; p = 0.001). The short-term postoperative complication rate up to 30 days from surgery was not statistically different (25% vs 44%; p = 0.137), although there was a clear trend toward a reduced number of overall complications in the laparoscopic group (9 vs 24). Wound complications were significantly fewer (0% vs 19%; p = 0.015) and postoperative pneumonia was nonexistent in laparoscopic patients. Long-term complications also were less common in the laparoscopic group (20% vs 64%; p = 0.002), largely because of reduced incidence of impotence, incisional hernia, and ileostomy complications. Total proctocolectomy was performed laparoscopically in 15 patients and with an open procedure in 13 patients over the same period. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups with respect to gender, age, weight, and diagnosis. Median operating time was longer for the laparoscopic patients (400 vs 235 min; p = 0.001), whereas the length of hospital stay, morbidity, and mortality were not significantly different.
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that LTAC can be performed safely with a statistically significant reduction in wound and long-term postoperative complications, as compared with its open counterpart. Operating time is increased, but there is a marked reduction in length of hospital stay. Preliminary results demonstrate that LTPC also is technically feasible and safe, with equal morbidity, mortality, and hospital stay, as compared with open procedures. Studies with larger numbers of patients and a randomized controlled trial giving special attention to patient quality-of-life issues are needed to elucidate the real advantages of this minimally invasive technique."
11443491,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11443491/,"OBJECTIVE: To examine whether there are ethnic differences in oxygen consumption during fixed periods of exercise.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional.
SUBJECTS: Twenty-seven African-American and 120 Caucasian overweight adult women (body mass index=32.8+/-4.1 kg/m(2), age=36.7+/-5.6 y) prior to initiating a weight loss program.
MEASUREMENTS: Measurement of oxygen consumption occurred during four stages of a graded exercise test, with body composition assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences between overweight African-American and Caucasian women for absolute oxygen consumption or oxygen consumption adjusted for either body weight or fat-free mass across four levels of a submaximal graded exercise test.
CONCLUSION: The results from this study suggest that African-American and Caucasian women do not differ in energy expenditure during fixed workloads of exercise, suggesting that this may not contribute to differences in energy balance and body weight regulation between women in these two ethnic groups."

SUBJECTS: One-hundred and twelve Caucasian children (54 males, 58 females), aged 8.7+/-0.9 y, were studied.
RESULTS: An analysis of the association between relative body mass index (BMI) at follow-up (%) and some indexes of adiposity like relative BMI (%), waist circumference, subscapular and triceps skinfolds, the sum of four skinfolds and percentage fat mass measured at baseline, showed that relative BMI (relBMI) at baseline had the highest association with relBMI at follow-up (r=0.77; P<0.001); waist circumference had a slightly lower significant association with relBMI at follow-up (r=0.74; P<0.001). In a multiple regression analysis, waist circumference (adjusted for age) accounted for approximately 64% of the variation of relBMI at follow-up (P<0.001). RelBMI measured at baseline accounted for approximately 59% of the variation of relBMI at follow-up (P<0.001). Multiple logistic regression analysis included waist circumference, adjusted for age, mother's BMI and relBMI measured at baseline as independent variables in the final equation. In particular, each centimeter increase of waist circumference at the age of 8 y doubled the risk of having a relBMI greater than 120% at the age of 12 y.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study, the first which has approached this investigation in children, showed that waist circumference measured at the age of 8 y, which is simple to perform and easy to reproduce, may be a promising index to assess adiposity as well as to predict overweight at puberty."

DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: Cross-sectional study, with a consecutive sample of 55 patients with chronic pain (20 men, 35 women). Comparison of CRE and physical activity indices obtained in patients with data available in the literature for age-matched healthy subjects.
SETTING: A multidisciplinary pain center in a city of more than 1,000,000 inhabitants.
OUTCOME MEASURES: A physical working capacity index (PWC65%/kg) and physical activity level scores and subscores obtained with two questionnaires (the Baecke and the Five-City Project questionnaires).
RESULTS: The physiological gender difference in CRE indices that characterizes healthy subjects was not observed in patients with chronic pain. When compared with values previously obtained in controls, male patients presented with a very significant 34% reduction in PWC65%/kg. The 17% reduction found in women hardly reached significance level. The Baecke total physical activity score was significantly higher in female than in male patients, a finding not observed in healthy controls. There was no significant difference between male and female patients in the Five-City Project total physical activity score expressed in kilocalories per day per kilogram (i.e., normalized for body weight), although data from the literature show that healthy men present with a significantly higher level of physical activity compared with healthy women.
CONCLUSIONS: Data on CRE and the physical activity level of patients with chronic pain obtained in this study show that chronic pain may have a greater impact on male than female patients. Sociocultural factors are probably at the origin of this phenomenon."
11444780,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11444780/,"OBJECTIVE: This study tests the hypothesis that chronic inflammatory foci in the placentas of siblings that undergo multifetal pregnancy reduction are associated with shortened gestational length.
METHODS: Among 446 patients who underwent multifetal pregnancy reduction (MPR), 56 delivered at Mount Sinai Hospital, 37 (66%) had their placentas referred to surgical pathology and 29 (78%) of the 37 patients had tissue sampled from the placenta of the reduced sibling. Slides were reviewed (by C.M.S.) blinded to clinical data. Lesions were diagnosed using previously published criteria. Specifically, inflammatory lesions were correlated with the various perinatal parameters. Non-parametric testing considered p < 0.05 to be significant.
RESULTS: Ten (35%) of 29 patients had chronic inflammation in the reduced placenta. Their gestational age at delivery was 33.1 +/- 3.2 weeks, compared to 35.8 +/- 2.3 weeks in those without chronic inflammation (Z = -2.53, p = 0.01). There was no difference between the cases with and those without chronic inflammation in the reduced placenta, in regard to past reproductive history or clinical assessment of the MPR procedure (e.g. the number of attempts, duration of the procedure, or post-procedural complications).
CONCLUSION: The majority of patients who underwent MPR did not develop a chronic inflammatory response to the process of 'resorbing' the placental tissues of the reduced sibling. However, a significant number (35%) of women who delivered viable offspring after MPR had chronic inflammation in the placenta, and had a shortened gestational length."
11444886,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11444886/,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate if acupuncture has a measurable effect on the resting electron EEG.
SUBJECTS: 14 healthy volunteers with no neurological condition took part in the study.
METHODS: Using a digital storage EEG recorder and quantitative frequency analysis techniques data were obtained before, during and after acupuncture stimulation. To minimize the effect of artefacts all data were collected with the subject alert, but with eyes closed. Manual stimulation of the LI 4 acupuncture site was undertaken for periods of 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 min. Frequency analysis of the EEG data from each acupuncture event was compared to the baseline data to show any significant changes over the bandwidth 0.3 to 30 Hz. Only changes greater than 2 standard deviations were considered significant.
RESULTS: In 10 subjects the frequency spectra remained unchanged during acupuncture, but in three significant increases were recorded in the amplitude of very low frequencies between 0.5 and 2 Hz and in one subject there was an increase in the amplitude of the alpha band during acupuncture. All spectra returned to their baseline values immediately after acupuncture.
OUTCOME: The changes recorded in the delta band of individuals during acupuncture were large but highly variable. They arose at a frequency that is on the limit of the recording equipment and where recording and physiological artefacts are known to occur, although there was no evidence of artefactual contamination of the data. The one case in which there was an increase in the alpha band is attributed to suppression of the dominant rhythm initially brought about by anxiety concerning the procedure which subsequently disappeared during acupuncture as the subject relaxed.
CONCLUSION: It is clear that there are no changes brought about by acupuncture in the resting EEG in the frequency range 2-30 Hz and no evidence to attribute changes below 2Hz to a direct affect of acupuncture."
11445630,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11445630/,"OBJECTIVE: The 36-item Short Form Health Survey Questionnaire (SF-36) is a widely used generic health status measure. Recently it has been adapted to produce a disease-specific measure for MS-the 54-item Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life Scale (MSQOL-54)-composed of five unchanged SF-36 scales; three altered SF-36 scales (one item added to each scale); and five new scales incorporating 15 additional items. This study evaluates the impact of these additions by comparing the measurement properties of the MSQOL-54 with the SF-36.
METHODS: A total of 150 patients with MS, representing a broad spectrum of disease severity, completed a range of questionnaires, which included the MSQOL-54 (from which the SF-36 score was computed). Of these, 44 people completed the measures before and after inpatient rehabilitation to evaluate responsiveness. Standard psychometric methods were used to evaluate the measurement properties.
RESULTS: The measurement properties of the unchanged scales, inevitably, remain identical. Those of the three altered scales are virtually identical. Of the five new scales, the validity of the two sexual scales is questioned because of the high percentage of missing data, and the validity of the overall quality-of-life scale is limited as demonstrated by the low to moderate correlations with other related and unrelated measures. Responsiveness of the new scales also appears limited.
CONCLUSION: Modifying existing measures by simply adding clinically chosen items may not be as useful as anticipated in improving the measurement properties of an instrument."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty patients with surgically confirmed RCC underwent US using B-mode and power Doppler methods with or without an intravenous microbubble echo-enhancing agent. After depicting and defining the tumour extent by B-mode US, the first-pass effect/enhancement by the echo-enhancing agent within the lesion, and that of a reference area of unaffected renal cortex, were recorded on-line by calculating the mean pixel intensity. Time-intensity curves, i.e. the rise time and gradient of both the suspected tumour and reference areas, were constructed.
RESULTS: Using B-mode US, the extent of all tumours was delineated (mean tumour size 3.8 cm, SD 0.6). After applying the microbubble agent all tumours were enhanced, whereas the perfusion was decreased (in 48%), increased (in 16%) or similar (in 36%) compared with the cortical reference area. Using the Hounsfield classification, these results correlated well with the hypo/hypervascularity shown on CT.
CONCLUSION: Ultrasonography has considerable potential in diagnosing RCC, if combined with echo-enhancing methods, harmonic imaging and computer-based calculation of tumour vascularization. Dynamic US studies should provide a diagnostic yield similar to that of CT."
11446843,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11446843/,"OBJECTIVE: To report our experience in managing complex anterior urethral strictures with a dorsally/dorsolaterally placed penile/preputial vascularized flap, and to discuss the advantages of this procedure over a traditional ventrally placed flap.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1995 and 1999, 40 patients (mean age 40.5 years) with recurrent strictures of the pendulous and/or bulbar urethra were treated with longitudinal penile/circumpenile flap substitution urethroplasty. Nineteen patients underwent dorsal placement of the flap as an onlay (DO), whereas 21 patients had a ventral onlay (VO). Five patients needed inferior pubectomy to facilitate high proximal placement of the flap.
RESULTS: Both groups had statistically similar ages, number of previous interventions, stricture site, length and follow-up. After a median follow-up of 27.5 months, the stricture recurred in three (24%) of the VO and two (11%) of the DO groups (P > 0.05). One patient in the VO group required surgical closure of the urethral fistula. Flap pseudo-diverticulum and/or sacculation with postvoid dribble occurred in six patients in the VO and none in the DO group (P = 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Dorsal placement of the pedicled flap is anatomically and functionally more appropriate than the traditional VO placement. DO preputial/penile flap urethroplasty is a versatile procedure and can be applied even for long anterior urethral strictures, including reconstruction of the meatus and high proximal bulbar strictures."
11446851,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11446851/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the re-operation rate on the distal ureter after upper pole heminephrectomy with incomplete ureterectomy.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The case notes from one institution were reviewed retrospectively; 60 upper pole heminephrectomies with incomplete ureterectomy were undertaken in 39 girls and 16 boys (mean age at primary surgery 27 months, range 3--88).
RESULTS: Thirty-two children (58%) had an antenatal diagnosis while 12 (22%) presented with a urinary tract infection (UTI) and six (11%) with urinary incontinence. Twenty-nine of the 60 renal units (48%) had an associated ureterocele and in nine (15%) the ureter was ectopic. Ten infants (18%) underwent initial puncture of a ureterocele. Five patients (8%), all females, required lower urinary tract re-operation. The indications for secondary surgery were recurrent UTIs in all and a prolapsed ureterocele in one. All five had ultrasonographic evidence of a dilated ureteric stump. Reflux into the retained stump was detected in one child.
CONCLUSIONS: The re-operation rate for a redundant ureteric stump in this series was 8%. The risk of injury to the good ureter may outweigh the benefits of a complete ureterectomy."
11446907,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11446907/,"BACKGROUND: Throughout this work we have studied the capacity of Brucellacapt test to replace Coombs test in the serological diagnosis of human brucellosis.
METHODS: A total of 66 initial sera from patients with diagnostic of brucellosis were studied. The patients were divided in two groups: 42 patients showing a primo-infection (group1), and 24 patients with a previous case of brucellosis (group 2). As a controls, for the group 1 we have used 100 sera from healthy donors, and for group 2, 28 sera from people that have had clinical brucellosis but actually are in good health. All serum samples were tested in either Coombs and Brucellacapt tests. The diagnostic yield was calculated using ROC (receiver-operating characteristic) plots.Moreover, the results obtained in Coombs and Brucellacapt tests with 397 serum samples from 66 patients with brucellosis were compare with a non-parametric method.
RESULTS: The sensibility and specificity for group1 were respectively 1 and 0.98 for Coombs and, 1 and 0.95 for Brucellacapt tests. For group 2, the results in Coombs test were 1 and 0.80, and in Brucellacapt test 0.95 and 0.74. In this second group, the area under the ROC plot was 0.950 for Coombs and 0.904 for Brucellacapt tests. Non statistical differences were observed comparing both serological tests using the Wilcoxon method (Z= -0.213; p=0.8).
CONCLUSIONS: Brucellacapt and Coombs tests yield similar diagnostic results in the follow-up of serological samples from patients with brucellosis, and its should consider as interchangeables."
11447550,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11447550/,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the outcome of patients in whom knee arthroscopy proved to be normal.
TYPE OF STUDY: Retrospective study.
METHODS: Knee arthroscopy is probably the most common procedure performed in orthopaedic practice. A number of patients who undergo this procedure do not have any abnormality detected. Is negative arthroscopy really such an unnecessary procedure? Hospital records of patients who had undergone knee arthroscopy were retrospectively studied and all patients with a normal knee arthroscopy were selected. Fifty-three patients (55 knees) with a normal arthroscopy were included into the study. Patients were then interviewed either by telephone or questionnaire to ascertain current symptoms, job changes, and patient perception of the procedure.
RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 43 months. Fifty percent of the patients had a history of injury, and the preoperative diagnosis was thought to be a meniscal lesion or a rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament in 38% of patients. Sixty-eight percent of the patients felt that they were better and there were no complications. The incidence of all symptoms were significantly reduced after arthroscopy.
CONCLUSIONS: A significant number of patients felt that they were better after the knee arthroscopy. The reason for this is not entirely clear. It may well be attributable to a placebo effect, the fact that patients now know that there is no abnormality and learn to live with the symptoms, or there may be an additional benefit of the procedure itself."
11448433,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11448433/,"BACKGROUND: Telomerase replaces DNA sequences that are lost with cell division. Increased activity has been documented in malignant cells. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) has a 90% sensitivity for diagnosis of papillary carcinomas, but a specificity of 52%. This often leads to unnecessary surgery.
METHODS: Telomeric repeat amplification protocol assays were performed on FNA specimens of thyroid nodules in 19 patients. These results were compared with the surgical pathology using chi-square analysis.
RESULTS: There were 5 malignant and 14 benign nodules. Telomerase activity was found in 3 of 5 malignant (60%) and 9 of 14 benign (64%): sensitivity was 60%, specificity was 36%.
CONCLUSION: Telomerase assays did not add any additional information to FNA alone. Inflammatory changes associated with benign and malignant lesions can possess telomerase activity independent of the malignant state."
11448438,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11448438/,"BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is administered to patients with esophageal carcinoma with the belief that this will both downstage the tumor and improve survival. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is currently the most accurate method of staging esophageal cancer for tumor (T) and lymph node (N) status. Because both EUS and neoadjuvant therapy for esophageal carcinoma are relatively new, there are few data examining the relationship between EUS stage and histological stage (the stage after resection) in patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy.
METHODS: To determine the effect of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy on T and N stage as determined by EUS, we retrospectively compared two groups of patients with esophageal cancer staged by EUS. One group (33 patients) underwent neoadjuvant therapy (Walsh protocol: 5-fluorouracil, cisplatin, and 4000 rads of external beam radiation) followed by resection. The second group (22 patients), a control group, underwent resection without neoadjuvant therapy. We then compared histological stage to determine if there was a downstaging in the patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy. Survival was evaluated as well.
RESULTS: EUS accurately predicted histologic stage. In the control group EUS overestimated T stage in 3 of 22 (13%), underestimated N stage in 2 of 22 (9%), and overestimated N stage in 2 of 22 (9%) of patients. Preoperative radiochemotherapy downstaged (preoperative EUS stage versus pathologic specimen) 12 of 33 (36%) of patients whereas only 1 of 22 (5%) of patients in the control group was downstaged. Complete response (no tumor found in the surgical specimen) was observed in 5 of 33 (15%) of patients receiving radiochemotherapy. Survival was prolonged significantly in patients receiving radiochemotherapy: 20.6 months versus 9.6 months for those (stage II or III) patients not receiving radiochemotherapy (P <0.01). Operative time, operative blood loss, and length of stay were not significantly different between groups. Perioperative mortality was higher in the radiochemotherapy group (13%) compared with the no radiochemotherapy group (5%) but did not achieve statistical significance.
CONCLUSIONS: EUS accurately stages esophageal carcinoma. Neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy downstages esophageal carcinoma for T and N status. In our nonrandomized study, neoadjuvant therapy conferred a significant survival advantage. Operative risk appears to be increased in patients receiving neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy prior to esophagectomy."
11449017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11449017/,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether genetic factors contribute to the association between low birth weight and increased blood pressure among adolescents.
DESIGN: Historical cohort study of twin pairs. It was evaluated whether (1) a negative association between birth weight and systolic blood pressure was found in the overall twin sample and (2) whether the intrapair difference in birth weight correlated with the intrapair difference in systolic blood pressure-thereby controlling for the effect of genetic factors (all in monozygotic and on average half in dizygotic pairs).
SETTING: The Minnesota Twin Family Study.
PARTICIPANTS: 1311 pairs of adolescent twins.
MAIN RESULTS: A negative association between birth weight and systolic blood pressure was retrieved in the overall sample. The regression coefficient after controlling for current weight was -1.88 mm Hg/kg (SE 0.61), which corresponds to results from previous studies of singleton adolescents. The regression coefficient fell to -0.64 mm Hg/kg (SE 0.86) when the intrapair analyses were used. The largest reduction was observed among monozygotic twins: from -2.44 mm Hg/kg (SE 0.75) in the overall monozygotic twin sample to -1.06 mm Hg/kg (SE 1.14) in the analyses of the within monozygotic pair differences.
CONCLUSION: The association between low birth weight and increased blood pressure later in life is well established. ""The fetal programming hypothesis"" suggests that the association is caused by intrauterine malnutrition while a new hypothesis ""the fetal insulin hypothesis"" proposes that genetically determined insulin resistance also contributes significantly to the association. A recent twin study of middle aged twins showed no evidence for an influence of genetic factors while this larger study provides support for the fetal insulin hypothesis: the association between birth weight and blood pressure attenuated among adolescents when genetic factors were controlled. Together this suggests an important contribution of genetic factors to the association between fetal growth and systolic blood pressure in adolescence."
11449097,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11449097/,"OBJECTIVE: To describe one patient with a puzzling therapy-resistant unilateral chronic otitis media, analyze his diagnosis, and describe three similar patients with the same symptoms and signs, i.e., a chronic ear problem together with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
STUDY DESIGN: Thorough analysis of one patient with a chronic ear problem and GERD, both of which responded favorably after antireflux therapy consisting of omeprazole and conservative antireflux measures (raising the head of the bed by 20 to 25 cm, avoiding meals and drinks 3 hours before retiring, and other dietary and lifestyle modifications), and a search for more patients with similar coexisting conditions.
SETTING: Tertiary referral center.
METHODS: Patients with chronic ear problems and GERD were thoroughly analyzed by the otorhinolaryngologist and the gastroenterologist. The latter used endoscopy and Savary-Miller's classification of esophagitis, a 24-hour ambulatory dual esophageal pH monitoring, and esophageal manometry.
RESULTS: Four patients were identified who had a chronic ear problem and simultaneous GERD. It is reasoned that the GERD leads to nasopharyngitis and this to a chronic ear problem. All the patients responded favorably to anti-GERD therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: GERD may manifest itself as an extraesophageal manifestation, such as nasopharyngitis, leading to ear disease. Therapy-resistant chronic middle ear disease may be caused by GERD."
11449108,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11449108/,"BACKGROUND: Oculoauriculovertebral dysplasia (OAVD) (Goldenhar's syndrome) is a congenital syndrome with ipsilateral deformity of the ear and face, epibulbar lipodermoids, coloboma, and vertebral anomalies. Goldenhar's anomaly has often been associated with a degree of congenital hearing deficits, almost always of a conductive origin, but a sensorineural component is also suspected in some cases, evident through malformations of the inner ear.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Both temporal bones of a 10-day-old deceased patient with oculoauriculovertebral dysplasia were examined by light microscopy.
RESULTS: The ear deformities included deformity of the auricle, atresia of the external auditory canal, and malformation of the tympanic cavity and ossicles. Abnormalities of the stria vascularis and the semicircular canals were also demonstrated. Further inner ear deformities were not identified in this case.
CONCLUSION: These histopathologic findings appear to confirm the conductive component of the congenital hearing deficit, but a sensorineural component could not be omitted. The ear alterations favor early developmental field defects. The causes of this condition are controversial. Recent results in genetic research pertaining to the MSX class genes permit better understanding of the variety, variability, and different degrees of severity of the anomalies described here."
11449107,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11449107/,"HYPOTHESIS: This study aimed to assess the possibility of hearing restoration after acoustic tumor removal.
BACKGROUND: Hearing restoration surgery may be indicated after surgery of bilateral acoustic tumors or surgery of acoustic tumor in the only hearing ear. The choice is between cochlear implantation and brainstem implantation.
METHODS: From the temporal bone collection at the House Ear Institute, Los Angeles, the author histologically examined eight temporal bones from seven patients who had undergone acoustic tumor removal during their lifetime. Special emphasis was put on examining the patency of the cochlear turns and on survival of the spiral ganglion cells and cochlear nerve.
RESULTS: This study showed that after translabyrinthine acoustic tumor removal, there is progressive osteoneogenesis of the cochlea associated with almost complete degeneration of the spiral ganglion cells and cochlear nerve. Similar findings were noticed after middle fossa removal of acoustic tumor with unsuccessful hearing preservation.
CONCLUSIONS: The histologic changes described in the cochlea and cochlear nerve represent the effects of ischemia resulting from inadvertent cutting of the blood supply during acoustic tumor removal. It is possible to do cochlear implantation after acoustic tumor removal provided that the result of promontory electrical stimulation test is positive (the cochlear nerve is intact) and that implantation is done at the time of acoustic tumor removal or shortly thereafter, before cochlear ossification is complete."
11449193,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11449193/,"OBJECTIVES: In many studies it has been reported, that leptin may play an important role not only in the regulation of food intake and body weight but can modify immune response. The aim of our study was to estimate the effects of the administration of exogenous leptin on serum concentration of proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin 6-IL 6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha-TNF alpha) and anti-inflammatory cytokine (interleukin 10 - IL 10) during LPS induced acute inflammation. We also estimated leptin's influence on pituitary, thyroid, adrenal and gonadal hormones in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced acute inflammation.
METHODS: Male rats Wistar-Kyoto were divided into four groups, which received respectively: placebo (0.9% NaCl), LPS, leptin and leptin with LPS. The TNF alpha and IL 6 serum concentrations were measured after 2 hours and IL 10 after 4 hours. The pituitary, thyroid, adrenal and gonadal hormones serum concentrations were measured after 2 and 4 hours. Cytokine concentrations were estimated using ELISA tests and hormones concentrations using RIA tests.
RESULTS: Leptin did not have an effect on both cytokine responses (proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory) in the time of LPS-induced acute inflammation. Leptin enhanced LPS-induced increasing of corticosterone secretion after 2 hours and decreased LPS-induced inhibition of testosterone secretion after 4 hours.
CONCLUSIONS: Leptin can modulate hormone response during LPS-induced acute inflammation."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical records of 53 patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension from a tertiary center neuroophthalmology practice were reviewed. Thirty-seven patients were identified who had a history of snoring, difficulty sleeping, or daytime somnolence. The data from polysomnograms were tabulated to determine the frequency of apneas, hypopneas, and arousals.
RESULTS: Fourteen of 37 patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension and symptoms of sleep disturbance underwent polysomnography. There were two men and 12 women varying in age from 24 to 58 years (mean, 39.4 +/- 11.9). These patients were obese with body mass indexes varying from 33.0 to 63.2 (mean, 46.0 +/- 9.5). A diagnosis of sleep apnea was made in six and upper airway resistance syndrome in seven patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Sleep-related breathing problems were common in our patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Obesity was common in these patients and may be playing a causative role in sleep apnea and idiopathic intracranial hypertension. It is suggested that idiopathic intracranial hypertension patients who have symptoms of sleep disturbance should be further evaluated for the presence of sleep-related breathing problems."
11450926,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11450926/,"BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence that clinical guidelines can lead to improvements in clinical care. However, they are not self-implementing. Outreach visits may improve prescribing behaviour.
METHODS: Within a before-and-after pragmatic randomized controlled trial, involving all general practices in one health district, routine methods were used to distribute guidelines for management of Helicobacter pylori eradication. Intervention practices were offered a visit and the conduct of an audit by a pharmacist trained in the techniques of outreach visiting. The intervention was evaluated using level three Prescribing Analysis and Cost (PACT) data for metronidazole and omeprazole for the two 12 month periods around the introduction of the guidelines.
RESULTS: Of the 38 intervention practices 19 accepted an outreach visit and three accepted the offer of an audit. There was a significant increase in omeprazole use during the study of 0.24 [95 per cent confidence interval (CI) +0.19 to +0.29] dose units per year but no effect from the offer [-0.02 (95 per cent CI -0.12 to +0.08) dose units] or acceptance of a visit [-0.03 (95 per cent CI -0.15 to +0.08) dose units]. The results for metronidazole were similar, with an increase in use of 0.028 (95 per cent CI +0.018 to +0.038) dose units per year. The effect of the intervention was a non-significant change in prescribing of -0.005 (95 per cent CI -0.025 to +0.015) dose units. Accepting a visit had little effect on prescribing: a change of 0.003 (95 per cent CI -0.021 to +0.027) dose units.
CONCLUSIONS: The routine use of untargeted outreach visiting is probably not a worthwhile strategy."
11451265,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11451265/,"OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine whether strategies to reduce procedural distal embolization and late repeat revascularization have resulted in more favorable outcomes after saphenous vein graft (SVG) angioplasty.
BACKGROUND: Angioplasty of SVG lesions has been associated with frequent procedural and late cardiac events. Therefore, evolving strategies have been attempted to improve outcomes after SVG angioplasty.
METHODS: We compared our earlier experience (1990 to 1994) of 1,055 patients with 1,412 SVG lesions with a recent group (1995 to 1998) of 964 patients with 1,315 lesions.
RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar between the groups. However, there were significantly more unfavorable lesion characteristics (older, longer and significantly more degenerated SVGs) in the recent series. Between the two periods, there was decreased use ofatheroablative devices, whereas stent use increased. The procedural success rates (96.6% vs. 96.1%) were similar. However, one-year outcome (event-free survival) was significantly improved in the more recent experience (70.7% vs. 59.1%, p < 0.0001), especially late mortality (6.1% vs. 11.3%, p < 0.0001). Multivariate analysis showed stent use to be the only protective variable for both periods.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that despite higher risk lesions, strategies to reduce distal embolization have maintained high procedural success. Late cardiac events, including mortality, have also been substantially reduced."
11451294,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11451294/,"BACKGROUND: The Fragmin and fast Revascularization during InStability in Coronary artery disease (FRISC II) trial compared the effectiveness of an early invasive versus a noninvasive strategy in terms of the incidence of death and myocardial infarction (MI) in patients with unstable coronary artery disease (CAD).
OBJECTIVES: In this subanalysis, we sought to evaluate gender differences in the effect of these different strategies.
METHODS: The patients (749 women and 1,708 men) were randomized to early invasive or noninvasive strategies. Coronary angiography was performed within the first 7 days in 96% and 10% of the invasive and noninvasive groups, respectively, and revascularization was performed within the first 10 days in 71% and 9% of the invasive and noninvasive groups, respectively.
RESULTS: Women presenting with unstable CAD were older, but fewer had previous infarctions, left ventricular dysfunction and elevated troponin T levels. Women had fewer angiographic changes. There was no difference in MI or death at 12 months among women in the invasive and noninvasive groups (12.4% vs. 10.5%, respectively), in contrast to the favorable effect in the invasively treated group of men (9.6% vs. 15.8%, p < 0.001). In an interaction analysis, there was a different effect of the early invasive strategy for the two genders (p = 0.008).
CONCLUSIONS: Women with symptoms and/or signs of unstable CAD are older, but still have less severe CAD and a better prognosis compared with men. In contrast to its beneficial effect in men, an early invasive strategy did not reduce the risk of future events among women. Further research is warranted to identify the most appropriate treatment strategy in women with unstable CAD."
11452177,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11452177/,"PURPOSE: Evidence has suggested that postexercise gated Tc-99m sestamibi SPECT (GSPECT) provides combined information about resting wall motion and exercise perfusion. No data have been published about possible differences in wall motion analysis between postexercise and resting GSPECT.
METHODS: Fifty patients underwent postexercise (symptom-limited bicycle stress) and rest GSPECT and cardiac catheterization with contrast ventriculography. In 35 patients, additional rest planar Tc-99m RBC radionuclide ventriculography (RNV) was performed. Four observers independently performed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) calculations and visual analysis of regional wall motion (graded in four stages) for all studies.
RESULTS: The LVEF calculations in GSPECT revealed a statistically significant difference between postexercise (45.8 +/- 15.7%) and rest (48.0 +/- 16.1%; P < 0.05) determination. Postrest GSPECT LVEF showed a better correlation with LVEF determination performed with contrast ventriculography and RNV than did postexercise GSPECT LVEF. The reduced postexercise wall motion could be shown in segments with exercise-induced ischemia and in those with normal regional perfusion but not in segments with irreversibly abnormal perfusion.
CONCLUSIONS: Postexercise GSPECT provides reliable information regarding global wall motion even in severe coronary artery disease, but regional wall motion is underestimated compared with rest GSPECT, because of an imprecise surface detection algorithm in ischemic wall segments and possibly postexercise stunning in severe coronary artery disease."
11453238,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11453238/,"BACKGROUND: This study was designed to verify if the dimension of the interdental papilla may be a prognostic factor for the clinical outcome of the coronally advanced flap (CAF) in the treatment of gingival recessions.
METHODS: Thirty-three Miller Class I recessions were treated in 33 patients using the CAF procedure. Two types of measurements were performed: 1) clinical measurements (probing depth, recession depth, width of keratinized tissue, clinical attachment level) were recorded at baseline and 3 months after surgery and 2) all recessions were photographed and transformed into computer images. A specific software allowed recording of both linear and square measurements. The following digital measurements were recorded at baseline: 1) base, height, and area of the mesial and distal papillae adjacent to the involved tooth and 2) width/depth of the recession and the area of the exposed root surface of the involved tooth. The residual recession area, if any, was recorded 3 months after surgery. The digital measurements of the height and of the area of the papilla were used in statistical analysis (multiple linear regression and logistic regression) to evaluate a possible correlation with root coverage (mm2) and/or with complete root coverage.
RESULTS: Root coverage was not significantly correlated to the papilla area (P= 0.3692) or to papilla height (P= 0.0968). The complete root coverage was not correlated to the papilla area (P= 0.3181), but it was correlated to papilla height (P= 0.0499).
CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that the root coverage following CAF procedure is not significantly correlated to papilla dimension. However, complete root coverage is significantly more frequent in sites with lower height of the adjacent papilla."
11453396,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11453396/,"OBJECT: The authors' goal in this study was to challenge the proposed mechanism of the occlusive hyperemia theory, in which it is asserted that stagnating flow in the former feeding arteries of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) leads to parenchymal hypoperfusion or ischemia, from which postoperative edema and hemorrhage originate.
METHODS: Cortical oxygen saturation (SaO2) was measured in 52 patients by using microspectrophotometry in areas adjacent to AVMs before and after resection. The appearance of the former feeding arteries was categorized as normal (Group A); moderately stagnating (Group B); and excessively stagnating (Group C) on postoperative angiographic fast-film series. Patients and SaO2 values were pooled accordingly and compared using analysis of variance and Duncan tests (p < 0.05). Angiographic stagnation times in former feeding arteries were correlated in a linear regression/correlation analysis with SaO2 data (p < 0.05). All values are given as the mean +/- standard deviation. The average median postoperative SaO2 in Group C (15 patients) was significantly higher than in Groups B (17 patients) and A (20 patients) (Group C, 75.2 +/- 8.5; Group B, 67.5 +/- 10.8; Group A, 67.1 +/- 12 %SaO2), as was the average postoperative increase in SaO2 (Group C. 25.9 +/- 14.9; Group B, 14.6 +/- 14; Group A, 11.1 +/- 14 %SaO2). Angiographically confirmed stagnation times were also significantly longer in Group C than in Group B (Group C, 5.6 +/- 2.5; Group B, 1.3 +/- 0.6 seconds). A significant correlation/regression analysis showed a clear trend toward higher postoperative SaO2 levels with increasing stagnation time.
CONCLUSIONS: Stagnating flow in former feeding arteries does not cause cortical ischemia, but its presence on angiographic studies is usually indicative of hyperperfusion in the surrounding brain tissue after AVM resection. In the context of the pathophysiology of AVMs extrapolations made from angiographically visible shunt flow to blood flow in the surrounding brain tissue must be regarded with caution."

DESIGN: Prospective case series.
SETTING: Four community NHs.
PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-one long-stay incontinent NH residents of mean age 88 years, 75% female.
MEASUREMENTS: The percentage of hourly checks for wetness and the appropriate toileting rate (continent voids divided by total voids) were measured during 3 days (7 a.m.-7 p.m.) of PV, and for an average of 5 nights (7 p.m.-7 a.m.), during which a modified PV protocol, designed to be minimally disruptive to sleep, was carried out.
RESULTS: Fourteen residents (23%) responded well to daytime PV, with average wetness and appropriate toileting rates of 5% and 73%, respectively. In the group as a whole, nighttime PV was not effective, with wetness and appropriate toileting rates of 49% and 18%, respectively. Among those who responded well to daytime PV, wetness rates during nighttime PV remained significantly higher than during the day (24% vs. 5%; P = .000), and nighttime appropriate toileting rates were significantly lower (39% vs. 73%; P = .002). The poor response rate at night was primarily observed between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.
CONCLUSIONS: In this sample of incontinent NH residents, nighttime PV, even when carried out so as to minimize sleep disruption, was not an effective intervention. Although residents who responded well to daytime PV responded better to nighttime PV than those who did not respond to daytime PV, their wetness rates remained relatively high and their appropriate toileting rates were low. These data suggest that routine nighttime toileting programs should not be carried out for the majority of incontinent NH residents. Instead, individualized care based on resident's preferences, willingness to toilet at night, and sleep patterns should be emphasized."

Multiple logistic regression was used to assess the relationship of handedness with CD, UC, and IBD in the cohorts combined and adjusted for sex.
RESULTS: Both cohorts combined showed increased adjusted relative odds of 2.13 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97--4.65; p=0.059), 2.13 (95% CI 0.92--4.91; p=0. 077), and 2.13 (95% CI 1.20--3.78; p=0.010) for CD, UC, and IBD, respectively in left handers.
CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests a link between IBD and left handedness which may be genetic and/or environmental in origin."
11455278,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11455278/,"BACKGROUND: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) provides an immediate support for acute deterioration of hemodynamic and pulmonary status, but what is the best decision for these critical patients? Biventricular assist device (BVAD) or left ventricular assist device (LVAD)? We proposed a protocol of step-by-step conversion from ECMO to LVAD after assurance of the reversibility of right ventricle and pulmonary function.
METHODS: After femoral venoarterial ECMO was inserted for the critical patients, the left atrial drainage was added to the ECMO firstly and the femoral arterial inflow was shifted to the ascending aorta for preventing possible peripheral vascular complications. Temporary clamp of right heart drainage was tried to test right heart function 24 to 48 hours later. The sweep gas flow of oxygenator could be reduced gradually to test the pulmonary function. Therefore, the right heart drain and the oxygenator could be withdrawn to become a non-pulsatile LVAD or shift to pneumatic LVAD directly. There were four clinical experiences with successful conversion without temporary right ventricular assist device.
RESULTS: All of them were able to convert their ECMO to LVAD smoothly in 8.0+/-2.5 days. Three of them were shifted to non-pulsatile LVAD, and one was converted to HeartMate. All but one could be weaned from the ventilator. No BVAD was needed in these patients. Due to the shortage of donor hearts, only one had the chance to undergo heart transplantation.
CONCLUSIONS: The protocol did provide a good guideline for decision-making for those under ECMO support necessitating bridge to transplantation."
11455717,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11455717/,"OBJECTIVE: To establish whether or not tutor subject-matter expertise influences student achievement in content-based examinations in the problem-based learning (PBL) curriculum at the University of Transkei (UNITRA) Medical School.
DESIGN: A retrospective study of MB ChB III student achievement in end-of-block modified essay questions (MEQ) examinations in microbiology, pathology and pharmacology for the years 1994-1999, inclusive. Pooled scores from the expert-tutored groups were compared with those from the groups tutored by non-experts using analysis of variance (ANOVA) or t-test. Subject expert tutors were those with postgraduate specialisation in the given discipline.
SETTING: The Medical School, Faculty of Health Sciences, UNITRA, Umtata.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Whether pooled mean MEQ scores in end-of-block examinations for microbiology, pathology or pharmacology differ according to the subject-matter expertise of the tutor.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in mean scores obtained for pharmacology (51.1 +/- 0.6 versus 52.6 +/- 0.7, P = 0.109) and pathology (49.8 +/- 0.6 versus 49.9 +/- 0.8, P = 0.919). The difference between the scores in microbiology was small (3 percentage points) but statistically significant, with the groups tutored by microbiologists scoring higher than those tutored by pathologists or pharmacologists (54.1 +/- 1.0 versus 51.2 +/- 0.8, P = 0.032).
CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrating that in the UNITRA Medical School PBL curriculum tutor subject-matter expertise has little or no influence on student achievement in the discrete areas of tutor expertise."
11455829,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11455829/,"OBJECTIVE: We present 267 patients undergoing surgery for renal carcinoma, comparing the incidental tumour and symptomatic tumour with different parameters and evaluating the prognostic significance of the incidental diagnosis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Of the 267 patients, 110 (41.2%) were diagnosed incidentally. The different variables analysed were: age, sex, tumour size, if unilateral or bilateral, histological type, stage, degree of cellular differentiation and survival. The mean follow-up period was of 43.32 mos in the symptomatic patients and 41.85 mos in the patients diagnosed incidentally. The data obtained was analysed with the SPSS statistic pack.
RESULTS: No significant difference was detected between both groups in regards to age, sex, if unilateral or bilateral and histological type. Comparing tumour size, a statistic difference was observed with slices at 6 cm. When analysing the stage and degree of cellular differentiation, a significant difference is found with tumours diagnosed incidentally presenting better differentiation and a lower stage at the moment of diagnosis. Survival after 5 yrs was of 65.7% for symptomatic patients in comparison to 81.7% for the incidental group, which implies high statistical signification (log rank = 0.0018).
CONCLUSIONS: In our series no significant differences were detected between incidental and symptomatic tumours when comparing age, sex, anatomic side and histological type. Significant differences were indeed detected in relation to size, degree of cellular differentiation, tumour stage and survival."
11455845,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11455845/,"BACKGROUND: Microalbuminuria is associated with some cardiovascular risk factors. However, it is presently unclear whether microalbuminuria is associated with other cardiovascular risk factors and markers of insulin resistance in both men and women.
DESIGN: The baseline parameters of the on-going prospective D.E.S.I.R. Study (Data from an Epidemiological Study on the Insulin Resistance syndrome) were analysed.
METHODS: The subjects (n = 3878, age 30-64) had a medical and biological checkup including arterial pressure, ECG, lipids, haematocrit, leukocyte count, insulin and urinary albumin concentration.
RESULTS: Arterial pressure was significantly higher in microalbuminuric than in normoalbuminuric men and women. The heart rate and the prevalence of smoking were higher in microalbuminuric than in normoalbuminuric men, but not in women. Total- and LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein-B, leukocyte count, uric acid, haematocrit, haemoglobin and red cell volume were greater in microalbuminuric than in normoalbuminuric men. Total- and HDL-cholesterol were lower whereas triglycerides and uric acid were significantly greater in microalbuminuric than in normoalbuminuric women. The 9-year calculated absolute cardiovascular risk was higher in microalbuminuric than in normoalbuminuric men (4.18% vs. 2.79%, respectively, P < 0.0001) but was similar in women (0.75% vs. 0.69%, respectively, NS). Fasting blood glucose and insulin were higher in microalbuminuric than in normoalbuminuric men, but not in women. A multiple regression showed that microalbuminuria was associated with systolic arterial pressure, fasting glucose, leukocyte count and haematocrit in men, and with systolic arterial pressure and triglycerides in women.
CONCLUSIONS: Microalbuminuria is associated with most cardiovascular risk factors and markers of insulin resistance in men, but no consistent association is observed in women. The determinants of microalbuminuria appear different in men and women, suggesting a different pathophysiology and perhaps significance of microalbuminuria in men and women."

11456034,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11456034/,"BACKGROUND: Plasma amino-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level is a sensitive and specific indicator of cardiac dysfunction.
AIM: To determine whether plasma NT-proBNP level is elevated at the time of presentation with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and whether it may assist in the diagnosis of heart failure and myocardial ischaemia in the Emergency Department.
METHODS: Plasma NT-proBNP levels were measured prospectively in 201 unselected presentations to the Emergency Department with suspected ACS where cardiac injury markers were requested by clinicians as part of routine assessment. NT-proBNP levels were correlated with clinical, electrocardiogram (ECG), biochemical and radiological findings.
RESULTS: Elevated NT-proBNP level detected heart failure with high sensitivity (95-96%). Among patients without heart failure, NT-proBNP levels were increased more frequently in patients with previously diagnosed ischaemic heart disease. Elevated NT-proBNP level predicted cardiomegaly and a cardiac cause of presentation. However, the NT-proBNP level was not associated with ECG or biochemical markers of myocardial ischaemia, and only one-third of patients with ACS showed an increase of 40% or more in NT-proBNP level at repeat measurement of cardiac injury markers 5 h after presentation.
CONCLUSIONS: Although elevated NT-proBNP level detected heart failure with high sensitivity, NT-proBNP level did not assist in the diagnosis of acute myocardial ischaemia. These findings indicate that the major determinant of elevated NT-proBNP level on presentation with suspected ACS was underlying cardiac dysfunction rather than acute myocardial ischaemia. This suggests that NT-proBNP measurement in patients with a suspected cardiac reason for presentation to the Emergency Department may identify a previously unrecognized group of patients without acute ischaemia who may nevertheless benefit from further investigation of cardiac function."
11456048,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11456048/,"BACKGROUND: Induction chemotherapy can produce dramatic necrosis in sarcomas-raising the question of whether or not radiation is necessary. This study reviews the clinical outcome of a subset of patients with high-grade extremity soft tissue sarcomas (STS) who were treated with induction chemotherapy and surgical resection but without radiation.
METHODS: Nonmetastatic, large, high-grade STS of the pelvis and extremities were treated with intra-arterial cisplatin, adriamycin, and, after 1995, ifosfamide. After induction, oncologic resection and histologic evaluation were performed. Good responders with good surgical margins were not treated with radiation.
RESULTS: Thirty-three patients, with a median follow-up of 5 years, were included. Limb salvage rate was 94%. Median tumor necrosis was 95%. Four patients developed metastatic disease with three subsequent deaths. Two local recurrences occurred; both patients were salvaged with reresection and adjuvant external beam radiotherapy, although one died of metastatic disease 10 years later. Relapse-free and overall survival is 80% and 88% at 5 and 10 years by Kaplan-Meier analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Intensive induction chemotherapy can be extremely effective for high-grade STS, permitting limb-sparing surgery in lieu of amputation. Radiation may not be necessary if a good response to induction chemotherapy and negative wide margins are achieved. All patients with large, deep, high-grade STS of the extremities should be considered candidates for induction chemotherapy."
11456141,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11456141/,"BACKGROUND: The present study aimed to assess the impact of inhaled nitric oxide on survival following correction of congenital heart defects with residual pulmonary arterial hypertension.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Inhaled nitric oxide was utilized for the management of residual pulmonary hypertension in 24 children following surgical correction of their underlying heart defects. Their ages ranged from 15 days to 14 months (median 5 months). Pulmonary artery hypertension was diagnosed either by direct pulmonary artery pressure monitoring or by echocardiography. Inhaled nitric oxide was used electively in 22 patients when the ratio of the mean pulmonary arterial pressure and mean systemic arterial pressure exceeded 0.5. In the remaining 2 patients, nitric oxide was used only to manage a pulmonary hypertensive crisis. Inhaled nitric oxide was also used a second time in 2 patients who developed delayed pulmonary hypertensive crisis. Twenty-two patients showed an initial response to therapy and the pulmonary artery pressures dropped significantly. Of the patients on direct pulmonary artery pressure monitoring, a pulmonary artery to systemic artery pressure ratio below 0.3 on prolonged therapy was associated with a survival ratio of 4/6 (including 1 neurological death and one reoperation); that between 0.3 and 0.5 with a survival ratio of 3/4. Three out of four patients with sustained echocardiographic and clinical response also survived and were discharged from the hospital. All the patients who showed a lack of response to (n=2), tolerance to (n=1), or dependence on (n=6) the use of inhaled nitric oxide died. In addition, all 5 patients who had a pulmonary hypertensive crisis died, 3 in spite of successful resuscitation with nitric oxide. Thus, excluding one neurological death and one re-operation, only 9 (41%) out of 22 patients survived.
CONCLUSIONS: Though inhaled nitric oxide is effective in lowering pulmonary pressure, it does not appear to improve the survival rate following repair of congenital heart disease in those with associated severe pulmonary hypertension. A randomized trial between the use and non-use of inhaled nitric oxide is warranted to determine its exact role in influencing survival in patients with residual pulmonary hypertension following surgical repair."
11456430,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11456430/,"OBJECTIVES: People with acute bronchitis may show little evidence of bacterial infection. If effective, antibiotics could shorten the course of the disease. However, if they are not effective, the risk of antibiotic resistance may be increased. The objective of this review was to assess the effects of antibiotic treatment in patients with a clinical diagnosis of acute bronchitis.
SEARCH STRATEGY: The authors searched MEDLINE, Embase, reference lists of articles, personal collections up to 1996 and Sci-search from 1989 to 1996.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized trials comparing any antibiotic therapy with placebo in acute bronchitis.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: At least two reviewers extracted data and assessed trial quality.
PRIMARY RESULTS: The results of eight trials involving 750 patients from eight years of age to 65 and older and including smokers and nonsmokers were included. The quality of the trials was variable. A variety of outcome measures was assessed. In many cases, only outcomes that showed a statistically significant difference between groups were reported. Overall, patients taking antibiotics had slightly better outcomes than those taking placebo. They were less likely to report feeling unwell at a follow-up visit (odds ratio, 0.42; 95 percent confidence interval [CI] 0.22 to 0.82), to show no improvement on physician assessment (odds ratio, 0.43; CI, 0.23 to 0.79) or to have abnormal lung findings (odds ratio, 0.33; CI, 0.13 to 0.86), and had a more rapid return to work or usual activities (weighted mean difference, 0.7 days earlier; CI, 0.2 to 1.3). Antibiotic-treated patients reported significantly more adverse effects (odds ratio, 1.64; CI, 1.05 to 2.57), such as nausea, vomiting, headache, skin rash or vaginitis.
REVIEWERS' CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotics appear to have a modest beneficial effect in the treatment of acute bronchitis, with a correspondingly small risk of adverse effects. The benefits of antibiotics may be overestimated in this analysis because of the tendency of published reports to include complete data only on outcomes found to be statistically significant."
11457419,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11457419/,"BACKGROUND: We investigated the combination of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) with the beta-adrenoceptor/serotonin 1A (5-HT(1A)) antagonist pindolol, based on the concept that 5-HT(1A) receptor blockade would eliminate the need for desensitization of presynaptic 5-HT(1A) receptors and therefore hasten the onset of action and improve the efficacy of SSRIs. However, since pindolol plasma levels after 2.5 mg three times a day are about 60 nmol/L, and the K(i) for the 5-HT(1A) receptor is 30 nmol/L, it is questionable whether pindolol levels in the brain would be sufficient to antagonize 5-HT(1A) receptors. Using microdialysis in the guinea pig, we correlated brain and plasma levels of pindolol with its capability of augmenting paroxetine-induced increases in brain 5-HT levels. In addition, central beta-receptor antagonism of pindolol was studied by investigating blockade of beta-agonist-induced increases in brain cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) formation.
METHODS: Using microdialysis and jugular vein catheterization, we studied the ability of systemically administered pindolol to antagonize central 5-HT(1A) and beta-adrenoceptors, while simultaneously monitoring pindolol plasma and brain concentrations.
RESULTS: Augmentation of paroxetine-induced increases in extracellular 5-HT levels in the ventral hippocampus was only observed at steady state plasma levels exceeding 7000 nmol/L (concurrent brain levels 600 nmol/L). In contrast, antagonism of beta-agonist-induced increases of brain cAMP levels was already observed at pindolol plasma levels of 70 nmol/L (concurrent brain levels < 3 nmol/L).
CONCLUSIONS: At plasma levels that are observed in patients after 2.5 mg three times a day ( approximately 60 nmol/L), pindolol produces only a partial blockade of presynaptic 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors and does not augment the SSRI-induced 5-HT increase in the guinea pig brain. It is therefore very unlikely that the favorable effects of combining pindolol with SSRIs, as reported in a number of clinical studies, are due to 5-HT(1A) antagonism. Since pindolol completely blocks central beta-adrenoreceptors at clinically relevant plasma levels, it is possible that beta-adrenoceptor antagonism is involved in mediating pindolol's beneficial effects."
11458038,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11458038/,"PURPOSE: We reviewed the evolution of appliances and devices used for treating post-prostatectomy urinary incontinence.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used the MEDLINE to search the literature from 1966 to March 2000 and then manually searched bibliographies to identify studies that our initial search may have missed.
RESULTS: The evolution of treatment for post-prostatectomy urinary incontinence may be traced back to the 18th century. Two main schools of thoughts simultaneously evolved. The first fixed urethral compression devices were constructed to enable urethral obstruction by fixed resistance. This outlet resistance allows voiding after intra-abdominal and intravesical pressure is elevated but it is sufficient to prevent leakage between urinations. The other school of thought preferred creation of dynamic urethral compression in which outlet resistance is not fixed but may be decreased when voiding is desired or elevated between urinations. Therapeutic fixed and dynamic urethral compression interventions may be further divided into external or internal compressive devices or procedures. External fixed compression devices may be traced back to antiquity. A penile clamp, similar to the later Cunningham clamp, and a truss designed to compress the urethra by external perineal compression were presented in the Heister textbook of surgery, Institutiones Chirurgicae, as early as 1750. Dynamic compressive devices applied externally were developed much later, such as the first artificial urinary sphincter, described by Foley, in 1947 and the Vincent apparatus, described in 1960. The modern era of fixed urethral compression began in 1961 with Berry. Acrylic prostheses impregnated with bismuth to allow radiographic visualization were produced in various shapes and sizes, and used to compress the urethra against the urogenital diaphragm. In 1968 the University of California-Los Angeles group under the direction of Kaufman began to use cavernous crural crossover to compress the bulbous urethra (Kaufman I). Later 2 other modifications were described, including approximation of the crura in the midline using a polytetrafluoroethylene mesh tape (Kaufman II) and an implantable silicone gel prosthesis (Kaufman III). With the advent of the artificial urinary sphincter pioneered by Scott in 1973 interest in passive urethral compression disappeared in favor of the implantation of an inflatable circumferential prosthetic sphincter. Recently there has been a trend back to passive urethral compression. Synthetic bolsters have been described that passively compress the bulbar urethra to achieve urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy.
CONCLUSIONS: Much creativity has been dedicated to solve the complex and challenging problem of post-prostatectomy urinary incontinence. Devices used for treating this condition may be grouped according to the mechanism of action and how they are applied. Passive urethral compression, long abandoned in favor of dynamic implantable sphincters, has reemerged. Further research in this field may determine which school of thought may provide the best solution for treating post-prostatectomy urinary incontinence."
11458113,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11458113/,"PURPOSE: While a fascial sling for treating children with intractable urinary incontinence is often successful in girls, its effectiveness in boys remains unclear. We determined the long-term efficacy of a rectus fascial sling in boys with neurogenic sphincteric incontinence and defined its urodynamic characteristics for achieving continence.
METHODS AND METHODS: We reviewed the charts of all boys who underwent a rectus fascial sling procedure for neurogenic incontinence to determine urinary continence status at the most recent office visit or by telephone interview, the type and dose of anticholinergic and sympathomimetic medications, the frequency of intermittent clean intermittent catheterization, status of the upper urinary tract and comparative urodynamic findings preoperatively and postoperatively.
RESULTS: We evaluated 7 boys 7 to 19 years old, of whom 4 were postpubertal, who fulfilled study criteria and had a followup of 1 to 9 years. In 4 patients a continent stoma was created concurrently at surgery. Postoperatively all patients were dry during the first 3 months after surgery. At the last followup 1 patient was completely dry, 3 had occasional nighttime wetting, 2 had occasional stress incontinence, and 1 had frequent daytime and nighttime wetting requiring subsequent bladder neck closure. Prepubertal and postpubertal males performed catheterization without difficulty and all required less frequent clean intermittent catheterization and medication postoperatively compared to preoperative status. None had hydronephrosis. Postoperatively urodynamic evaluation revealed normal bladder compliance, improved urethral resistance that did not decay with bladder filling and no uninhibited contractions.
CONCLUSIONS: The rectus fascial sling is effective for increasing bladder outlet resistance and decreasing the degree of incontinence in prepubertal and postpubertal males with neurogenic sphincteric incontinence. It has no long-term deleterious effects on bladder function and does not impair the ability to catheterize postoperatively. A fascial sling is an effective alternative to bladder neck closure when creating a continent stoma."
11458594,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11458594/,"BACKGROUND: The new '700 series' Medical Benefit Schedule (MBS) items for general practice introduce greatly increased potential for collaboration between general practitioners and other health professionals in patient care.
AIM: To investigate the current perceptions of Australian GPs with respect to the desirability and impact of 'sharing care' with nurses and other health professionals.
METHOD: Survey of a sample of GPs in Queensland and NSW participating in the Department of Veterans' Affairs Preventive Care Trial.
RESULTS: Fifty-two percent of GPs surveyed worked in a practice where a nurse was employed. The main role of the practice nurse was to do electrocardiograms, apply dressings, and triage duties. Practice nurses played only a minor role in health promotion and education. Seventy percent of GPs identified 'cost' and 58% 'lack of a Medicare item' as the major disincentives to the employment of a practice nurse. Seventy percent of GPs were satisfied with the level of communication with community based health professionals outside the practice, with 'time' nominated as the greatest barrier to optimal contact. Eighty-two percent of GPs considered other health professionals had a role in conducting preventive home visits for the older population, with 70% of GPs identifying that these health professionals had the potential to identify additional health problems, previously unaddressed.
CONCLUSION: Study findings demonstrate an acceptance by GPs of the nurses role and other health professionals in integrated patient care. Funding is seen as the major impediment to the greater utilisation of practice nurses in the general practice setting."
11459897,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11459897/,"BACKGROUND: Indices of physical function may have a hierarchy of items. In cases where this can be demonstrated it may be possible to reduce patient burden by asking them to complete only those items which relate directly to their own level of ability.
OBJECTIVES: To determine whether statistical procedures, operationalising what is known as item response theory (IRT), can be used to assess the unidimensionality of the 10 item physical functioning domain of the SF-36 in patients with Parkinson's disease and motor neuron disease, and, secondly, to determine whether it would be possible to administer subsets of items to certain patients, on the basis of their replies to other items in the scale, thereby reducing patient burden.
METHODS: Rasch analysis, a form of IRT methodology, of the 10 item physical functioning domain (PF-10) in two neurological patient samples was undertaken and the results compared with results of a Rasch analysis of data gained from a population survey (the third Oxford healthy lifestyles survey).
RESULTS: Evidence from the analyses suggests that the PF-10 does not form a perfect hierarchy on a unidimensional scale. However, certain items seem to form a hierarchy, and responses to some of them are contingent on responses to the other items.
CONCLUSIONS: Rasch analysis of the PF-10 in neurological patients has indicated that certain items of the scale are hierarchically ordered, and consequently not all respondents would need to complete them all: indeed those most severely ill would be required to complete less items than those with only limited disabilities. The implications of this are discussed."

OBJECTIVES: To determine if bipedal rats differ in upright posture compared with quadrupedal rats.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: It has been reported that surgically induced bipedalism in the rat leads to habitual upright posture. Based on this finding, bipedal rats have been used to study the changes erect posture induces in bone, ligament, muscle, and intervertebral discs. Previous studies have used direct observation as a means to describe posture. This study is the first to quantify postural differences between bipedal and quadrupedal rats.
METHODS: Eleven bipedal rats were created by forelimb and tail amputation within 24 hours of birth. Eleven quadrupedal rats served as controls. Specialized cages were used with infrared sensors, and a computer program measured the total amount of time in the upright stance, the number of stands, and the amount of horizontal movement in the upright stance. Statistical comparisons were made between bipedal and quadrupedal rats hourly and over a 24-hour period of time.
RESULTS: Quadrupedal rats assumed an upright posture for a significantly greater amount of time than bipedal rats when monitored over 24 hours (P = 0.016). Quadrupedal and bipedal rats did not differ in the number of stands (P = 0.63) or in the amount of horizontal movement in the upright stance (P = 0.34) over 24 hours. Similar results were obtained when comparing hourly intervals.
CONCLUSION: This study quantifiably indicates that bipedal rats do not assume a more erect posture and spend no more time in an upright position compared with quadrupedal rats. The upright posture may not be the cause of some previously reported anatomic changes observed in the bipedal rat."

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the functional outcome of two-stage anterior and posterior instrumented fusion without fixation to the sacrum on 11 patients with neuromuscular scoliosis from thoracolumbar myelomeningocele.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: To our knowledge, there are no published results of combined anterior and posterior correction and fusion without inclusion of the sacrum in neuromuscular scoliosis from thoracolumbar myelomeningocele. In this article we present our experience and critically evaluate the functional outcome on 11 patients with neuromuscular scoliosis.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: From July 1, 1992 through June 30, 1995, 11 consecutive patients with severe thoracolumbar scoliosis were admitted at our hospital. The mean age at operation was 12 years 9 months (range 9 years 9 months to 14 years 6 months). All patients underwent a two-stage anterior and posterior spinal reconstruction. The patients were evaluated before surgery and after surgery.
RESULTS: All patients were observed for a mean of 4 years 11 months (range 42-88 months) from the time of second stage procedure. Before treatment the mean scoliosis was 81 degrees (range 55-110 degrees ); this was reduced to a mean of 31 degrees (range 8-70 degrees ), and at the final follow-up the correction had deteriorated slightly to a mean of 35 degrees (range 12-80 degrees ). No patient had increased neurologic deficit or showed other major complication.
CONCLUSIONS: Pelvic obliquity in thoracolumbar neuromuscular scoliosis from lumbosacral myelomeningocele spontaneously corrected when the scoliotic deformity is adequately addressed with instrumented fusion without inclusion of the sacrum. The correction obtained remained stable at follow-up. In the absence of a control group we believe that sparing lumbar segments from primary fusion offers these patients a better freedom of mobility."
11462311,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11462311/,"BACKGROUND: Strict glycaemic control in type 2 diabetic patients is recommended in a number of treatment protocols. However, although better glycaemic control prevents or postpones chronic diabetic complications, it remains uncertain how this affects quality of life in the short and long term.
AIM: To study the impact of insulin therapy on glycaemic control and quality of life in type 2 diabetic patients, with secondary failure on maximal oral medication.
DESIGN OF STUDY: Two separate sets of analyses were performed: a longitudinal analysis of those patients converted to insulin therapy and a comparison of 12-week outcomes between the two randomisation groups.
SETTING: Ten general practices, participating in the Nijmegen Monitoring Project.
METHOD: Patients, poorly controlled on maximal oral therapy, were stratified with respect to age and sex, and randomly allocated to insulin therapy in two different schedules: (a) after a 12-week period with enhanced compliance to diet and oral therapy: or (b) as soon as secondary failure was established. Patients were referred to a diabetologist to start insulin therapy and were referred back to their general practitioner (GP) as soon as glycaemic control was stable. We assessed fasting blood glucose, HbA1c functional health, and quality of life (Sickness Impact Profile, COOP/WONCA charts, Diabetes Symptom Checklist) at baseline, after the patient was referred back to the GP, and nine months later.
RESULTS: Of the 38 included patients, three patients dropped out and seven patients were not switched over to insulin therapy. In patients starting insulin therapy, mean HbA1c and fasting blood glucose level decreased from 9.5% to 7.6%, and from 12.0 mmol to 8.4 mmol, respectively (P < 0.001). The better control was accompanied by a decrease in hyperglycaemic complaints (P = 0.01). No increase in hypoglycaemic complaints was found. There were no statistically significant changes in quality-of-life parameters. After 12 weeks, patients directly referred to insulin therapy showed a statistically significant improvement in HbA1c and fasting glucose level, in contrast to patients with enhanced compliance. Quality-of-life scores did not significantly differ statistically.
CONCLUSION: Insulin therapy in poorly controlled type 2 diabetic patients from general practice resulted in a significant clinical improvement of glycaemic control, accompanied by a reduction of hyperglycaemic complaints, without an increase in hypoglycaemic complaints or an adverse influence on quality of life."

It is suggested that those who perceive that their daily lives are affected should have priority for services. However, many people do not seek medical help, even though they may be severely affected.
AIM: To investigate unmet need in relation to the prevalence and impact on everyday life of urinary incontinence in men and women over the age of 65 years.
DESIGN OF STUDY: Cross-sectional survey to measure prevalence of urinary incontinence, the impact on people's lives, use of protection, and health services.
SETTING: Stratified random sample of 2000 community-living elderly (equal numbers of men and women, aged 65 to 74 years and over 75 years) in 11 general practices in a British city.
RESULTS: The response rate was 79%. The overall prevalence of incontinence in the previous month was 31% for women and 23% for men. Women generally had more severe frequency of incontinence and a greater degree of wetness than men. Protection use was greater in women than in men. Only 40% of men and 45% of women with incontinence had accessed health services. Significant predictors of the use of health services were: incontinence reported as a problem, increased frequency of incontinence, and greater degree of wetness. About one-third of people who leaked with severe frequency or who reported that it was a problem had not accessed NHS services for incontinence.
CONCLUSIONS: Urinary incontinence is a common problem for older men and women living in the community and can have a deleterious effect on their lives. There is the opportunity to improve the lives of many older people with urinary incontinence, probably by a combination of increased public, patient, and professional awareness that should lead to earlier presentation and initiation of effective care."
11462920,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11462920/,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhotic patients generally carries a poor prognosis either due to recurrence or to postoperative morbidity or both. Several factors affect the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma resection as presence of cirrhosis of the liver, tumor diameter and tumor capsulation.
METHODOLOGY: Thirty-eight patients with large hepatocellular carcinoma greater than 5 cm with a background of cirrhotic liver were divided into two groups according to tumor diameter. Group A (n = 20) with tumors less than 10 cm in diameter, and group B (n = 18) with tumors larger than 10 cm. All patients underwent preoperative investigations including clinical laboratory tests, sonography, computed tomography, selective angiography and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. All patients were subjected to different types of hepatic resection.
RESULTS: A significant difference in tumor size, capsulation, and operation time were recorded between the two groups, of patients. No significant difference was detected between both groups regarding sex, age, viral markers, pathologic features, and Child classification. Hospital mortality occurred in 5% versus 11.1% of both groups, respectively. Postoperative jaundice and ascitis occurred in 30%, 35% versus 44.4%, 72.0%, respectively (P < 0.005, P < 0.04). Late mortality occurred in 65% of patients in group A and in 77% of group B. Recurrence was detected in 42% of group A and 62% in group B. Recurrence after resection in capsulated tumors was significantly lower than in noncapsulated tumors in group A (P < 0.01), but not significant in group B. Also, survival rate in patients with capsulated tumors was significantly better in both groups (P < 0.01) than that with noncapsulated tumors.
CONCLUSIONS: Resection of hepatocellular carcinoma with diameter larger than 10 cm recorded bad prognosis regarding recurrence and mortality rates than tumors less than 10 cm. However, capsulated tumors gave better postoperative prognosis than noncapsulated ones."
11462928,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11462928/,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: To determine an appropriate surgical treatment for patients with multiple liver metastases, we evaluated the efficacy of treatment in patients with 5 or more liver tumors in both lobes after metastasis from colorectal carcinoma which we refer to as H3 liver metastasis.
METHODOLOGY: Seventy-two cases of H3 liver metastasis were classified as follows into four types according to tumor distribution in the liver: type A (n = 16), multiple metastases present in one lobe, and, in the other, confined to one segment; type B (n = 12), multiple metastases present bilaterally, but with tumors larger than 2 cm in diameter confined to one lobe or to three segments; type C (n = 10), multiple and diffuse metastases present in both lobes and all tumors 2 cm or less in diameter; and type D (n = 34) metastatic tumors larger than 2 cm in diameter occurring in every segment of the both lobes. Hepatectomy was performed within a possible range as a rule for all cases, and intrahepatic arterial infusion was performed in unresectable cases. In cases that responded to intrahepatic arterial infusion, hepatectomy was considered and performed when technically possible and potentially curative.
RESULTS: The proportion of cases treated with hepatectomy were: type A, 56.3%; type B, 8.3%; type C, 10.0%; and type D, 2.9%. The regional intrahepatic arterial infusion ratios and response rates to it were 18.8% and 0.0% in type A, 91.7% and 33.3% in type B, 80.0% and 71.4% in type C, and 64.7% and 0.0% in type D, respectively. One type B patient whose tumor showed complete resolution after intrahepatic arterial infusion and one type C patient with a partial response underwent hepatectomy. The cumulative survival rate at two years was significantly lower in type D (3.2%), than in the other types (type A, 33.3%; type B, 36.4%; and type C, 11.7%).
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that hepatectomy should be performed in cases of type A, and that intrahepatic arterial infusion may be effective as neoadjuvant chemotherapy for type B or C. However, there is no effective treatment for type D at present."

METHODS: Ninety-seven consecutive, unselected, children (mean age 3.2 +/- 3.6 years, 1 day--15 years) underwent an open valvotomy for critical (n=36) or severe (n=61) AS between 1979 and 2000 in Southampton. Twenty-six were neonates (1--31 days), 27 were infants (1--12 months) and 44 were older children (1--15 years). Mean follow-up was 10 +/- 5.4 years, 1 month--21.9 years.
RESULTS: Two neonates died early giving an overall operative mortality of 2.1% (7.7% for the neonates and 0% for infants and older children). The mean aortic gradient was reduced from 76 to 24.5 mmHg (P < 0.0001). Residual or recurrent AS occurred in 17 patients and severe aortic regurgitation in eight patients. Kaplan--Meier 10-year freedom from residual or recurrent AS was 83.1 +/- 4.7% and from severe aortic regurgitation was 95.3 +/- 2.7%. Twenty-five patients required an aortic re-operation or re-intervention, 18 of whom had an aortic valve replacement (AVR) (mean valve size 21.8 +/- 0.9 mm, range 21--25 mm). Ten-year freedom from any aortic re-operation or re-intervention was 78.4 +/- 5.2% and from AVR was 85.1 +/- 4.6%. There were ten late deaths. Overall 10-year survival, including hospital mortality, was 90.2 +/- 3.1% (69.7 +/- 9.7% for the neonates, 92 +/- 5.4% for the infants and 100% for older children, (P < 0.0001). Ten-year survival for children with isolated AS (n = 69) was 100% and for those with associated cardiovascular problems (n = 28) was 67.3 +/- 8.9% (P < 0.0001). All survivors are in New York Heart Association functional class I.
CONCLUSIONS: Open valvotomy remains the gold standard in the management of AS in neonates, infants and older children. It is associated with low operative mortality and provides lengthy freedom from recurrent AS and regurgitation. Re-operations are common but if AVR is required, implantation of an adult-sized prosthesis is usually possible. There is a late death-hazard for those with severe associated lesions, but the survival prospects for the patients with isolated AS are excellent."
11463545,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11463545/,"OBJECTIVE: Different types of colloidal priming for cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) have been used to reduce fluid load and to avoid the fall of plasma colloid osmotic pressure (COP) that leads to edema formation and consequently can cause organ dysfunction. The discussion about the optimal priming composition, however, is still controversial. We investigated the effect of a hyperoncotic CPB-prime with hydroxyethyl starch (HES) 10% (200;0.5) on extravascular lung water (EVLW) and post-pump cardiac and pulmonary functions.
METHODS: In 20 randomized patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG), a colloid prime (COP: 48 mmHg, HES-group, n = 10) and a crystalloid prime (Ringer's lactate, crystalloid group, n = 10) of equal volume were compared with respect to the effects on cardiopulmonary function. Cardiac index (CI), mean arterial pressure (MAP), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI), pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRI), alveolo-arterial oxygen difference (AaDO(2)), pulmonary shunt fraction (Q(s)/Q(T)), EVLW (double-indicator dilution technique with ice-cold indocyanine green), COP, fluid balance and body weight were evaluated peri-operatively.
RESULTS: Pre-operative demographic and clinical data, CPB-time, cross-clamp time and the number of anastomoses were comparable for both groups. During CPB, COP was reduced by 20% in the HES-group (18.9 +/- 3.7 vs. 23.7 +/- 2.2 mmHg, P < 0.05) while it was reduced by more than 50% of the pre-CPB value (9.8 +/- 2.0 vs. 21.4 +/- 2.1 mmHg, P < 0.05) in the crystalloid group (P < 0.05 HES- vs. crystalloid group). Post-CPB EVLW was unchanged in the HES-group but it was elevated by 22% in the crystalloid group (P < 0.05 HES- vs. crystalloid group), CI was higher in the HES-group (3.4 +/- 0.3 vs. 2.7 +/- 0.5l/min, P < 0.05). Fluid balance was less in the HES-group (813 +/- 619 vs. 2143 +/- 538, P < 0.05). Post-operative weight gain could be prevented in the HES-group but not in the crystalloid group (1.5 +/- 1.2 vs. -0.3 +/- 1.5, P < 0.05). No significant differences were seen for MAP, PAP, PCWP, SVRI, PVRI, AaDO(2) and (Q(s)/Q(T)) between the two groups at any time.
CONCLUSIONS: Hyperoncotic CPB-prime using HES 10% improves CI and prevents EVLW accumulation in the early post-pump period, while pulmonary function is unchanged. This effect can be of benefit especially in patients with congestive heart failure."
11463546,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11463546/,"OBJECTIVE: It has been demonstrated that positron emission tomography (PET) predicts the functional recovery of viable but ischemically compromised myocardium. Reversible contractile dysfunction after revascularization has been reported for 'hibernating myocardium' and stunned myocardium, however, there are little data concerning the time-course and the extent of improvement of the two different pathophysiological conditions.
METHODS: Twenty-nine patients with advanced coronary artery disease and severely reduced left ventricular function (EF 18--35%) who were referred for isolated coronary artery bypass grafting underwent preoperative PET viability assessment and were functionally assessed by two-dimensional echocardiography preoperatively at 11 days, 14 weeks, and more than 12 months after surgical revascularization. Intraoperative biopsies were taken from dysfunctional areas defined by PET as segments of normal perfusion and normal metabolism (stunned myocardium) and from areas with a 'mismatch' between perfusion and metabolism (hibernating myocardium). The degree of morphological alterations was evaluated by electron microscopy.
RESULTS: In 70% of the 240 dysfunctional segments, 'stunned myocardium' was present whereas 'hibernating myocardium' could be detected in only 24% (P < 0.01). Hibernating myocardium was associated with more severe preoperative wall motion abnormalities and incomplete postoperative recovery. After 1 year, 31% of 'stunned' segments vs. only 18% of 'hibernating' segments showed complete functional restoration (P < 0.05). This incomplete improvement was associated with more severe morphological alterations including depletion of sarcomeres, accumulation of glycogen, loss of sarcoplasmatic reticulum, and cellular sequestration.
CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that in patients with severe ischemic left ventricular dysfunction 'stunned myocardium' is more prevalent than 'hibernation'. Functional normalization is more frequent in 'stunned' segments, whereas areas of 'hibernation' showed more severe tissue injury and protracted recovery. Different degrees of myocardial injury coexist in most patients, which determines the time-course and the extent of improvement after revascularization."
11463554,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11463554/,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the results of the surgical treatment of patients with stage IIIB non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) invading the mediastinum (T4).
METHODS: Twenty-nine patients were operated on from 1986 to 1999. Histology was squamous cell carcinoma in 17 patients, adenocarcinoma in eight, large cell carcinoma in two and neuroendocrinal carcinoma in two. Three patients received a preoperative chemotherapy (n = 2) or radiochemotherapy (n = 1). The lung resection consisted of a pneumonectomy in 25 patients and a lobectomy in four. The procedure was extended to one of the following structures: superior vena cava (SVC) (n = 17), aorta (n = 1), left atrium (n = 5) and carina (n = 6). Seventeen patients had a postoperative regimen including radiochemotherapy (n = 12), radiotherapy (n = 4), or chemotherapy (n = 1).
RESULTS: Complete R0 resection was achieved in 25 patients, whereas four patients had a microscopically (n = 1) or macroscopically (n = 3) residual disease. The operative mortality rate was 7% (n = 2). Non-fatal major complications occurred in eight patients (28%). Overall 5-year survival rate was 28% (median 11 months), including the operative mortality. The median survival of the 18 patients with an N0 or N1 disease was 16 months whereas the median survival of the 11 patients with an N2 disease was 9 months. At completion of the study, 22 patients have died, two postoperatively and 10 from pulmonary causes without evidence of cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgical management of T4 NSC lung cancer invading the mediastinum should be considered, in the absence of N2 disease, when a complete resection is achievable."

METHODS: In a prospective study, 185 patients with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of bladder outlet obstruction and benign prostatic enlargement were randomized to undergo either TUVRP or standard TURP. Inclusion criteria were benign prostatic enlargement, moderate or severe lower urinary tract symptoms and/or a significant urinary residual (>60 ml), while patients with previous prostatic surgery, prostate cancer or neurogenic bladder disorders were excluded. Prostate size, residual urine, urinary flow rate and symptoms as well as associated bother (using the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and the American Urological Association Bother Score (AUA-BS)) were assessed preoperatively. Intraoperative blood loss and fluid absorption were evaluated by measuring serum hemoglobin and respiratory alcohol concentration. Patients were followed for 1 year with the evaluation of flow rates, residual urine volumes, symptom scores and complications at 3, 6 and 12 months.
RESULTS: A significant difference was seen in the weight of the resected tissue (TURP 30.3 g vs. TUVRP 21.9 g, p<0.003). There were no significant differences in blood loss, intraoperative fluid absorption or procedure time between TUVRP and TURP, although more patients in the TURP group required blood transfusions (13 vs. 7) and mean procedure time was longer for TUVRP (71.0 vs. 65.9 min). The postoperative improvements in IPSS, AUA-BS, residual and Q(max) were significant in both groups (p<0.01 for each) but without difference between the two groups. The rate of complications (urinary tract infections, urethral stricture, reintervention rate) during follow-up was the same in both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective randomized comparison of the clinical outcome and morbidity of standard TURP versus TUVRP, there were no significant differences in any of the parameters evaluated except for the weight of the resected tissue."

Solution R (Uro-trainer), which contains 6% citric acid, is a solution licensed for use in the management of struvite stone disease in the UK. We report our experience.
METHODS: 23 kidneys in 22 patients (10 male and 12 female patients, mean age 45, range 15-60 years) underwent solution R irrigation following debulking of the stone with percutaneous nephrolithotomy (n = 20), ureteroscopy and shock wave lithotripsy (n = 2) combined with open procedures (n = 4) between 1994 and 1998. The original stone configuration consisted of 14 staghorn, 4 partial staghorn and 5 large burden stones. Irrigation was performed through a nephrostomy tube (n = 20) or in a retrograde fashion (n = 3) using a closed infusion pump system (40 ml/h). The response to treatment was checked using a nephrostogram and/or plain X-ray.
RESULTS: In 6 (26%) kidneys, after an average duration of 2 (1-5) days, irrigation had to be abandoned due to loin pain, leak or sepsis. The average duration of irrigation was 6.4 (1-20) days. At the end of irrigation, a total of 4 (17.4%) kidneys had complete radiographic clearance, while the stone was reduced to calyceal dust in 3 (13%). Partial response was seen in 11 (47.8%) and no response in 5 (21.8%) kidneys. Following additional alternative intervention(s) in 6 (26%) kidneys (4 with partial and 2 with no response) further clearance was achieved in 3 (13%) and calyceal dust status in 3 (13%). The response was better if the stone was reduced to less than 10mm prior to irrigation. At the mean follow-up of 2.44 (1-4) years, of 13 kidneys with stone clearance or calyceal dust, 9 suffered recurrence or re-growth, 5 of which required further interventions. Only 4 (17.4%) of 23 kidneys remained stone free.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with complex stone disease, adjuvant solution R irrigation can reduce the stone burden. There is a considerable potential for side effects necessitating close monitoring for sepsis and electrolyte abnormalities. However, the overall success rate for solution R is limited."
11464061,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11464061/,"OBJECTIVES: To compare the outcome of outpatient ureteroscopic laser lithotripsy (URSL) for ureteral stone larger than 10 mm in longest diameter (group 1) with those less than or equal to 10 mm (group 2).
METHODS: 134 patients with solitary ureteral stone were treated by outpatient URSL. No exclusion criteria with regards to stone size, level or composition were applied. Semirigid ureteroscopy and holmium-YAG laser lithotripsy was performed under general anaesthesia as outpatient procedure. Radiological follow-up by intravenous urogram was performed 3 months postoperatively. Patients' demographic data, stone parameters, operative details and treatment outcome were collected prospectively and compared between the two groups.
RESULTS: Among the 134 ureteral stones, 41(31%) were larger than 10 mm. Group 1 contained more upper and middle ureteral stones than group 2 (68 vs. 40% p = 0.001). Operating time was significantly longer for group 1 (68.9 vs. 46.8 min, p<0.001) and postoperative stenting rate was higher (83 vs. 60%, p = 0.01). There was no difference between the groups in terms of 3 months stone clearance rate (92.7 vs. 91.4%, p = 0.8). Complication rate was higher in group 1 (22 vs. 5.4%, p = 0.004) especially for lower stones (46.2 vs. 5.4%, p = 0.001) but most of which were minor complications that were treated conservatively. One patient in group 1 (2.4%) developed ureteral stricture at the longstanding stone impaction site despite postoperative stenting. The stricture resolved subsequent to balloon dilatation.
CONCLUSIONS: URSL can treat stones larger than 10 mm in longest diameter at all levels safely and effectively in an outpatient setting."
11464064,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11464064/,"OBJECTIVE: Perineal compression during bicycling appears to be responsible for some cases of erectile dysfunction.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In 46 healthy athletic men transcutaneous penile oxygen pressure (tpO(2)) at the glands of the penis was measured, using a transcutaneous measurement device. It has been shown that the tpO(2) levels measured at the glans correlate with the penile blood flow. Our measurements were performed before, during and after cycling in an upright and a reclining position in a crossover study.
RESULTS: The mean transcutaneous pO(2) at the glans in a standing position before biking was 60.5+/-8.1 mm Hg. It decreased after sitting on the saddle in an upright position to 17.9+/-3.9 mm Hg. Continued cycling in a seated upright position showed pO(2) levels of 18.3+/-5.2 mm Hg, with a full return to normal pO(2) values after a 10-min recovery period in a standing position. Cycling in a reclining position resulted in pO(2) levels of 59.4+/-4.2 mm Hg, a similar level to that obtained before exercising.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study demonstrated that there is a deficiency in penile perfusion caused by perineal arterial compression. Cycling in a reclining position - in which no perineal compression was seen - caused no alteration in penile blood flow during exercising. Therefore, we suggest cycling in a reclining position to avoid health hazards - such as penile numbness and hypoxygenation of the corpora cavernosa, which can result in impotency."
11464118,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11464118/,"BACKGROUND: Sildenafil citrate (Viagra), a drug used to treat erectile dysfunctions, causes adverse reactions such as headache, flushing or nasal congestion. Sildanefil's potency as inhibitor of diamine oxidase was investigated, as side effects may also be induced by histamine itself due to an impaired histamine metabolism.
METHODS: Placental diamine oxidase inhibition experiments were performed with consecutive dilutions of sildenafil citrate (10(-5) to 10(-9) mol/l). In 9 male volunteers in vivo diamine oxidase inhibition was investigated after taking 100 mg sildenafil (Viagra).
RESULTS: Sildenafil citrate did not inhibit placental diamine oxidase either in vitro or in vivo. However, infusion of 300 mg of cimetidine inhibited diamine oxidase activity by 27 +/- 7% 15 min after infusion, demonstrating that drugs may inhibit diamine oxidase in vivo.
CONCLUSION: As side effects of sildenafil are not caused due to inhibition of diamine oxidase, sildenafil citrate seems to be harmless for patients suffering from histamine intolerance."
11464321,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11464321/,"PURPOSE: To describe a condition that occurs following an upper respiratory illness, which represents injury to various branches of the vagus nerve. Patients with this condition may present with breathy dysphonia, vocal fatigue, effortful phonation, odynophonia, cough, globus, and/or dysphagia, lasting long after resolution of the acute viral illness. The patterns of symptoms and findings in this condition are consistent with the hypothesis that viral infection causes or triggers vagal dysfunction. This so-called postviral vagal neuropathy (PVVN) appears to have similarities with other postviral neuropathic disorders, such as glossopharyngeal neuralgia and Bell's palsy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five patients were identified with PVVN. Each patient's chart was reviewed, and elements of the history were recorded.
RESULTS: Each of the 5 patients showed different features of PVVN.

11464322,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11464322/,"PURPOSE: Concurrent radiation and chemotherapy is being evaluated as an alternative treatment to surgery for patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, because organ preservation maybe possible without compromising survival. However, the response to concurrent chemoradiation treatment varies from patient to patient, and there is currently no available molecular predictor of response for this particular treatment modality. There is some evidence to indicate that glutathione S-transferase-pi (GST-pi), which is one of the drug detoxifying enzymes, may decrease the effectiveness of platinum-based chemotherapy in the treatment of a variety of tumor types. This study was performed to investigate whether GST-pi expression was correlated with response to concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy in patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Diagnostic biopsy specimens of 36 patients who underwent concurrent chemoradiotherapy for the treatment of advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck were examined for GST-pi expression by using immunohistochemistry with polyclonal antihuman GST-pi antibodies. GST-pi expression scores were compared among responders and nonresponders.
RESULTS: Although the staining rate with antiGST-pi was slightly lower in the responder group in comparison with the nonresponders (82% vs 100%), the difference was not statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: GST-pi expression is unlikely to be a valuable predictor of response to concurrent chemotherapy and radiation treatment in patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck."
11464357,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11464357/,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: We did not find clinical studies of the alkalization of ropivacaine in the literature. The objectives of this study were: (1) to determine the quantity of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO(3)), which alkalinizes 0.75% ropivacaine (with and without adrenaline); (2) to verify the physico-chemical alterations arising from this alkalization; and (3) to determine whether alkalinized ropivacaine produces a higher-quality epidural block measured via sensory-motor onset, block spread and anesthesia duration.
METHODS: It was determined in the laboratory that 0.012 and 0.015 mEq of NaHCO(3), respectively, alkalinized 10 mL of the 0.75% ropivacaine solutions without and with adrenaline (1:200,000). In the second phase, the study was random and double-blind and involved 60 patients divided into 3 groups of 20 (G1, G2, and G3). Via epidural lumbar blocks, these groups received, respectively, 10 mL of 0.75% ropivacaine plus 0.5 mL of 0.9% NaCl (solution A), 10 mL of 0.75% ropivacaine plus 0.0012 mEq of NaHCO(3) (solution B), and 10 mL of 0.75% ropivacaine (with adrenaline) plus 0.015 mEq of NaHCO(3) (solution C). The pH, PCO(2) (partial CO(2) pressure), and the nonionized fractions of the 0.75% ropivacaine solutions were compared before and after the addition of 0.9% NaCl or NaHCO(3) or adrenaline plus NaHCO(3). The motor and sensory onsets, block spread, and the duration of the block were evaluated.
RESULTS: The values of the pH, PCO(2), and nonionized fractions increased significantly in solutions B and C in relation to solution A. No differences among the groups were observed in relation to block spread and sensory-motor onset. The duration of the sensory blocks was significantly greater in the patients in groups G2 and G3.
CONCLUSION: This study indicates that the quantity of NaHCO(3) needed to alkalize 10 mL of 0.75% ropivacaine at room temperature is 0.012 mEq. When the solution contains adrenaline 1:200,000 (mg.mL(-1)), up to 0.015 mEq of NaHCO(3) may be added. The alkalization of the 0.75% ropivacaine solution did not cause a reduction of sensory-motor onset, but did provide a significant increase in the duration of the epidural block with no significant differences between the solutions with and without adrenaline."
11464374,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11464374/,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of bed rest following embryotransfer (ET) on the results of an in vitro fertilization (IVF) program.
DESIGN: A prospective randomized study.
SETTING: Gyn.-Obst. Department--Assisted Reproduction Centre, 1st Medical Faculty of Charles University Prague and General Hospital, Prague.
METHODS: After randomisation of patients on two groups (N--no bed rest, L--bed rest), embryo transfer (ET) was performed and all patients stand-up 20 minutes later. Group N went home, group L continued bed rest in the hospital overnight. We compared results of IVF in both groups.
RESULTS: Both groups (N = 20 patients, L = 18 patients) were comparable in the age, number of previous IVF attempts, stimulation protocol, person performing ET, number of transferred embryos, percentage of ICSI, percentage of diagnosis ""tubal infertility"" and age of embryos in the day of ET. Results for group N (no bed rest) were in all parameters better than for group L: implantation rate (IR) (22.5% versus 14.5%), IR of high quality embryos (25.8% versus 16.7%), pregnancy rate (50% versus 22.2%, p = 0.08), Take-home baby rate (40% versus 11%, p = 0.07). No of results reached clear statistical significance as the study was finished for ethical reasons (worse results of more difficult therapy in group L).
CONCLUSION: The overnight bed rest in the hospital following ET did not ameliorate results of IVF. There is a strong tendency to negative effect of bed rest. Similar results may be found on other authors, but they did not extend the sense of their studies to the question of negative effects of the bed rest after ET, being satisfied with the result of ""no worse results after no bed rest""."
11464574,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11464574/,"PURPOSE: Our purpose was to determine the risk of premature delivery among singleton pregnancies derived from assisted reproduction technology (ART).
METHODS: Ninety-five singleton ART pregnancies and 190 matched spontaneous pregnancies were assessed for preterm delivery rates, pregnancy complications, and cesarean section rates in a retrospective study at an academic medical center.
RESULTS: Among the ART singleton deliveries group (n = 95), 19 (20%) were preterm, which was statistically significantly higher than the 4% (8 of 190) found in the control group. Among the pregnancies achieved by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) in the severe male-factor infertility subgroup (n = 22), only one preterm delivery occurred (4.5%).
CONCLUSIONS: Singleton ART pregnancies are at an increased risk of preterm delivery compared to singleton pregnancies after spontaneous conception. The higher rate may be attributed to various infertility cofactors, such as uterine malformations, previous operative procedures that involved cervical dilatation, and a history of pelvic infection. This is supported by the finding that ICSI-derived pregnancies in couples with strict male-factor infertility are not at an increased risk of preterm delivery."
11465172,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11465172/,"BACKGROUND: Controversy exists regarding the perfusion status of chronically dysfunctional yet viable myocardium. Studies investigating the pathophysiology of this condition have reached different conclusions, with some suggesting that myocardial blood flow (MBF) in these regions is normal at rest with regional dysfunction resulting from repetitive stress-induced ischemia (stunned myocardium), whereas others have proposed that MBF is chronically reduced at rest (hibernating myocardium). However, adequately powered experimental studies investigating this question in an appropriate animal model using clinically available techniques have not been performed. Based on the mixed results of prior studies, we hypothesized that these chronically dysfunctional yet viable regions may actually represent a mixture of hibernation and stunning. Consequently, the purpose of this study was to quantitatively determine the distribution of MBF in left ventricular regions with chronically impaired resting function but preserved viability in a large population of animals with single-vessel coronary stenosis in an attempt to further elucidate the mechanism(s) responsible for chronic, reversible myocardial dysfunction.
METHODS: Fifty-two adult mini-swine with 90% proximal left circumflex (LCx) stenosis underwent dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) with 13N-ammonia and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose and dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) (5 to 40 microg/kg/min) 1 month after stenosis creation. Values of MBF and FDG uptake by PET and wall motion score index (WMSI) by DSE were compared using a standard 16-segment model.
RESULTS: Of 312 possible LCx segments seen on PET, 303 (97.1%) were visualized by DSE. Of the 303 LCx segments, 279 (92.1%) had rest dysfunction (WMSI > or = 2) by DSE. One hundred eighty-two segments (60.1%) had decreased (< 85% reference) MBF at rest with preserved to increased (> 60% reference) FDG uptake and were classified as hibernating. Ninety-two segments (30.4%) had preserved MBF (> or = 85% reference) and were classified as stunned. Five segments (1.7%) with reduced (< or = 60% reference) FDG uptake by PET and akinesis or dyskinesis at rest (WMSI > or = 3) and no contractile reserve were considered infarcted. Hibernating segments had significantly higher FDG uptake at rest (360.7+/-48.3 vs 212.3+/-17.7% septal values; p < 0.001) than stunned segments consistent with greater resting ischemia. Likewise, mean rest WMSI was also worse in hibernating versus stunned segments (2.35+/-0.04 vs 2.13+/-0.04; p < 0.001). There was no difference in the percentage of hibernating versus stunned segments exhibiting contractile reserve during dobutamine infusion (55.5 vs 63.7%; p = 0.4), indicating similar degrees of viability.
CONCLUSIONS: Myocardial hibernation and stunning appear to frequently coexist in regions served by a stenotic coronary vessel. Hibernating regions appear to have greater resting ischemia based on higher values of FDG uptake and greater resting dysfunction. Reversible left ventricular dysfunction in the setting of chronic coronary artery disease is likely due to a combination of these two mechanisms."
11465228,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11465228/,"BACKGROUND: Severe thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications after mechanical heart valve replacement essentially depend on the intensity of oral anticoagulation and the fluctuation of individual international normalized ratio (INR) values.
METHODS: After heart valve replacement with Medtronic Hall, St. Jude Medical, and CarboMedics implants, patients were randomly divided into two groups, one controlling INR values at home, the other being monitored by family practitioners.
RESULTS: Almost 80% of the INR values recorded by patients at home were within the stipulated therapeutic range, INR 2.5 to 4.5, compared with just 62% of INR values recorded by family practitioners. The overall complication rate (hemorrhages and thromboembolic events) of the self-management group was significantly (p < 0.05) decreased compared with the conventional group.
CONCLUSIONS: Through INR self-management, an improvement in the quality of ongoing oral anticoagulation could be shown. Starting this form of therapeutic control early after mechanical heart valve replacement appears to effect a further reduction in anticoagulant-induced complications."
11465635,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11465635/,"RATIONALE: Polydrug abuse is a problem that has been infrequently examined. In the present study, drug self-administration procedures were used to investigate the reinforcing effects of drug combinations.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the absolute and relative response rates maintained by orally delivered methadone, cocaine, and their combinations under sequential and concurrent access. Choice between drug combinations containing different concentrations of cocaine was also determined.
METHODS: Oral intake of methadone, cocaine, and their combinations was studied with rhesus monkeys during daily 3-h sessions. Lip contact (the operant response) was reinforced by delivery of liquid contingent upon completion of a fixed-ratio schedule. In one series, the drugs and drug combinations were studied sequentially with the water vehicle concurrently available. In the next series, the drugs and drug combinations were concurrently available. In the third series, pairs of drug combinations containing different concentrations of cocaine were also concurrently available.
RESULTS: Methadone, cocaine and their combinations functioned as reinforcers. Under sequential access, response rates for the drug combinations and the component drugs were often similar. However, under concurrent access, response rates for the drug combinations were greater than response rates for the component drugs at the highest FR size for each condition. Also, drug combinations containing higher cocaine concentrations were preferred to combinations containing lower cocaine concentrations.
CONCLUSIONS: Combinations of methadone and cocaine have relatively greater reinforcing effects than the component drugs, and these greater reinforcing effects are better detected with concurrent measures than with sequential measures."
11465700,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11465700/,"OBJECTIVE: Controversy surrounds the cost-effectiveness of rheumatologist care compared with generalist care for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Rheumatologists can provide 2 distinct types of care for RA patients: primary care and specialist care. We sought to examine the relationship between cost and type of care in a population-based cohort of patients with RA.
METHODS: Data regarding specialty of care and use of health services (i.e., total direct medical costs, surgeries, radiographs, laboratory tests, hospital days) were collected from a community sample of 249 patients with RA (defined using the 1987 American College of Rheumatology diagnostic criteria) among Rochester, Minnesota residents > or =35 years of age. In a randomly selected subset of 99 of these RA patients, detailed information on all physician encounters was collected and categorized according to whether or not the care received constituted ""primary care"" according to the Institute of Medicine definition. Using these data, we evaluated the influence of type of care as well as specialty of provider on utilization. For these analyses, total direct costs included all inpatient and outpatient health care costs incurred by all local providers (excluding outpatient prescription drugs).
RESULTS: The 249 patients with RA (mean age 64 years, 75% women) were followed up for a median of 5.4 years, while the subset of 99 RA patients (mean age 64 years, 77% women) were followed up for a median of 4.7 years. The overall median direct medical costs per person per year were $2,749 and $2,929 for the total cohort and for the subset of 99 patients, respectively. Generalized linear regression analyses (considering all visits of the 249 RA patients) revealed that after adjusting for demographics and disease characteristics, rheumatologist care (compared with nonrheumatologist care) was not associated with higher total direct medical costs (P = 0.85) or more hospital days (P = 0.35), but was associated with slightly more radiographs (P = 0.037) and significantly more laboratory tests (P < 0.0001). When considering only primary care, such care by rheumatologists was, again, not associated with higher total direct medical costs (P = 0.11) or more hospital days (P = 0.69) or more laboratory tests (P = 0.54), but was associated with slightly more radiographs (P = 0.035).
CONCLUSION: Rheumatologist care is not more costly than generalist care for patients with RA. Important differences (especially in the use of laboratory tests) become apparent when the type of care provided as well as the specialty of the provider are considered in the analyses."
11465785,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11465785/,"BACKGROUND: Beliefs about the causation of schizophrenia could influence the attitudes patients' families adopt towards the patient and may also influence their help-seeking behaviour. Indian families have been typically described as often believing in causes like supernatural forces and therefore seeking help from magico-religious healers. In the changing mental health scenario in India, this impression needs verification.
METHOD: Key relatives living with 254 chronic schizophrenia patients were interviewed and asked to name the causes they believed were behind the illness. A list of possible causes was provided for the families to select from, and relatives were also encouraged to mention other possible causes, not featured in the list. The possible causes identified and the factors related to attributions made were analysed.
RESULTS: A supernatural cause was named by only 12% of the families and as the only cause by 5%. Psychosocial stress was most commonly cited cause, followed by personality defect and heredity. A small number of families (14%) could not name any cause and 39% named more than one cause. Patient gender and education, duration of illness and the key relative's education and the nature of relationship were related to the type of causal attributions made.
CONCLUSION: Families living with patients suffering chronic schizophrenia receiving treatment in urban India rarely subscribe to the idea of supernatural causation of the illness. The causal attributions made by them are fairly rational and understandable, given the relative lack of exposure to proper information about the illness."

METHODS: Population based cohort study of people with diabetes. Resting pulse rate was measured in 30 second intervals. Diabetic retinopathy was evaluated from masked gradings of fundus photographs.
RESULTS: People with higher pulse rates were more likely to have 4 year progression of retinopathy, progression to proliferative retinopathy, and incident macular oedema than those with lower pulse rates. However, these associations were attenuated after controlling for blood pressure, glycosylated haemoglobin, and other risk factors.
CONCLUSION: Pulse rate may be a clinical indicator of overall risk of diabetic retinopathy, but is not independently associated with the condition."
11466667,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11466667/,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to discover if the documented decline in nutritional status in predialysis patients could be prevented by dietetic intervention.
DESIGN: Longitudinal prospective interventional study.
SETTING: General hospital nephrology clinic.
PATIENTS: Eleven patients with progressive chronic renal failure not yet requiring dialysis, all with creatinine clearance below 25 mL/min were studied. Mean age was 63.9 +/- 14.5 years.
INTERVENTION: Patients received nutritional counseling from a renal dietitian on at least 3 occasions over a period of 6 months. Following assessment, patients were advised on dietary changes according to individual need, aiming for adequate energy intake to achieve or maintain a body mass index of 20 to 25 and protein intake of 0.8 to 1.0 g/kg/d. Dietary supplements were prescribed when necessary.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in nutritional status were assessed by Subjective Global Assessment, anthropometric measures (weight, triceps skinfold thickness, mid arm muscle circumference, and grip strength), and biochemical markers (serum albumin, serum transferrin, and insulin-like growth factor-1).
RESULTS: None of the patients showed decline in Subjective Global Assessment category, and 2 of the patients improved. All anthropometric and biochemical measures of nutritional status were stable or increased over the course of the study, and mid arm muscle circumference increased significantly (P <.05), contrasting with published data showing a decline in these measures in patients not receiving dietetic intervention.
CONCLUSION: With dietetic intervention, it may be possible to maintain or improve nutritional status in this group."
11467270,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11467270/,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of a risk factor checklist and training video for general practitioners in reducing inter-practice variation and improving the appropriateness of referrals (assessed by their positive predictive value or PPV) of patients with suspected otitis media with effusion (OME or 'glue ear') to secondary care.
METHODS: Fifty general practices (177 practitioners) from the NHS Trent region and the West of Scotland were cluster-randomised either to a control group (n = 12) or to one of three intervention groups (training video (n = 16), checklist (n = 11), or both (n = 11)). Data on all paediatric ear, nose and throat (ENT) referrals and diagnostic results at ENT clinics were collected for a one-year period pre- and post-intervention. Referral rates for OME and for closely related conditions were calculated for children aged 0-15 years, based on each practice's list size. PPV was defined as the proportion of referrals resulting in bilateral hearing loss > or = 20 dB at the ENT outpatient department.
RESULTS: There was a significant improvement in the PPV, adjusted for patients' waiting time between general practitioner (GP) referral and being seen at the ENT department. The improvement in PPV pre- and post-intervention was 15% (95% confidence interval, CI: -12.1% to 41.7%) for the practices receiving both interventions, compared with a degradation of 20% pre- and post-intervention (95% CI: -32.9% to -6.4%) for practices receiving only one intervention and a degradation of 34% for those receiving no intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: Disseminating a risk factor checklist and training video on glue ear to GPs using a multi-channel approach can improve the quality of referrals to ENT."
11467387,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11467387/,"AIM: Distraction osteogenesis is a technique used to lengthen the shortened mandible. However, the long term stability of the distracted mandibular bone is not known. The aim of this study was to assess if the sheep mandible relapses following lengthening, and to assess the quality of distracted bone up to 1 year post lengthening.
METHODS: Twenty-four sheep had bilateral external mandibular distractors applied, with three sheep as controls. Titanium marker screws were positioned both proximal and distal to the distraction zone in all sheep. Following a 5 day latency period, the interdental gap was distracted 1 mm/day for 20 days, with a subsequent 20 day consolidation period. Ante-mortem serial X-rays were used to assess for relapse by measuring the distance between the screws. The animals were sacrificed at either 3, 6, 9 or 12 months post-distraction. At post mortem, the distance between the screws was re-measured. The distracted bone was assessed mechanically and histologically.
RESULTS: The mean mandibular lengthening obtained was 13.2 mm. There was no relapse of the mandible over 12 months. The distracted bone had attained the strength and stiffness of undistracted bone by 6 months post-distraction (p < 0.05). Histological evaluation revealed significant amounts of lamellar bone by 6 months post-distraction.
CONCLUSIONS: No relapse occurred for 12 months post distraction lengthening. The bone formed following distraction was stable and of good quality. These findings lend support to the use of distraction osteogenesis in clinical practice."
11467635,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11467635/,"OBJECTIVE: A study was designed to reevaluate hemoconcentration as an early marker of severe and/or necrotizing pancreatitis and compare it against contrast-enhanced CT, the gold standard to diagnose acute necrotizing pancreatitis.
METHODS: This prospective study covers the years 1988-1999 for 316 patients (202 male, 114 female) with a first attack of acute pancreatitis. The role of the hematocrit as an early marker of severe and/or necrotizing pancreatitis has been retrospectively evaluated against the prospectively obtained data. They all underwent a CT within 72 h after admission. In addition to the CT-controlled diagnosis of interstitial/necrotizing pancreatitis, the following variables were used to assess severity: initial organ failure according to the Atlanta classification; indication for artificial ventilation and/or dialysis; Ranson score adjusted for etiology; Imrie score; Balthazar score; length of stay in intensive care unit (ICU); total hospital stay; development of pancreatic pseudocysts; indication for operation (necrosectomy); and mortality. Hemoconcentration on admission was defined as a hematocrit level >43.0% for male and >39.6% for female patients. Logistic regression was used to assess the correlation between hemoconcentration and the severity of variables.
RESULTS: Hematocrit, as a single parameter measured on admission, had the same sensitivity and negative predictive value as the more complicated Ranson and Imrie scores obtained only after 48 h. However, its specificity, positive predictive value, and total accuracy were lower. Hemoconcentration significantly correlated with the Balthazar score (differential diagnosis between interstitial and necrotizing pancreatitis), stay in ICU, and total hospital stay. Sensitivity and specificity of the hematocrit cut-off level of 43.0% for male and 39.6% for female patients to detect necrotizing pancreatitis were 74% and 45%, respectively. The positive predictive value was 24% and the negative predictive value 88%. Receiver operation characteristics (ROC) curve values for several cut-offs did not result in more ideal levels.
CONCLUSION: Hemoconcentration does not significantly correlate with important clinical outcome variables of acute pancreatitis including organ failure and mortality rate. Its prognostic value is comparable to the more complicated Ranson and Imrie scores obtained only after 48 h. The major value of this single easily obtainable and cheap parameter on admission lies in its high negative predictive value. In the absence of hemoconcentration, contrast-enhanced CT may be unnecessary on admission unless the patient does not improve."
11467639,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11467639/,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic value of push enteroscopy in patients with chronic diarrhea and malabsorption of unclear origin.
METHODS: From January, 1997, to September, 1999, 16 consecutive patients with chronic diarrhea and biological signs of intestinal malabsorption but no evidence of celiac disease were explored by push enteroscopy. Previous duodenal histological findings had been normal in seven patients and abnormal but inconclusive in nine patients. Endoscopic and histological findings in the duodenum and in the jejunum were compared.
RESULTS: Push enteroscopy with jejunal biopsy yielded a diagnosis in comparison with duodenal biopsy in two of 16 (12%) patients, respectively, in two of the nine (22%) patients with abnormal but inconclusive findings on duodenal biopsy, and none of the seven patients with normal duodenal histology. In the two patients in whom jejunal biopsy had diagnostic value but duodenal biopsy did not, the final diagnoses were invasive intestinal lymphoma and microsporidiosis.
CONCLUSION: Push enteroscopy had diagnostic value in only 12% of patients with malabsorption of unclear origin, all of whom had had abnormal but inconclusive duodenal histological findings. Push enteroscopy with jejunal biopsy appears to have limited diagnostic value in patients with chronic diarrhea and malabsorption, especially when duodenal biopsies are histologically normal."
11467650,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11467650/,"OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to investigate a possible positive correlation between B2-microglobulin (B2-M) serum levels and the severity and activity of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); and to examine whether B2-M levels reflect IBD extent.
METHODS: We examined B2-M serum levels in 87 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, 74 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 68 control subjects, using an enzymatic method. The reliability of the measuring method was assessed by evaluating serum B2-M in 18 patients suffering from chronic renal failure (CRF). The severity and activity of IBD was estimated using the van Hees Activity Index and the True-love-Witts criteria for CD and UC patients respectively. Endoscopic evaluation for UC patients was done according to Baron's et al. classification; Riley's et al. criteria were used for histological evaluation.
RESULTS: B2-M serum levels were significantly increased in all CD patients except those in remission. After 6 months treatment a second blood sample taken from CD patients with initially elevated B2-M levels proved to be compatible with CD severity at that time. Such a positive correlation was not assessed in UC patients; therefore, a second blood sample was considered unnecessary. Furthermore, CD patients with pancolitis, ileal-caecal, or small intestinal disease had higher B2-M levels than those with left-sided, anal, or perianal disease.
CONCLUSIONS: B2-M serum levels could prove to be a useful marker in assessing not only the activity, severity, and extent of CD but the treatment efficacy as well."
11467659,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11467659/,"OBJECTIVE: Obesity is an increasing problem for industrialized nations. The incidence of colorectal cancer has also risen during the last decades. However, information is scarce about the association between the colorectal cancer precursors, adenomatous polyps, and body composition. Our aim was to find out if body fatness is related to the presence of polyps and of growth of adenomas of < or =9 mm observed in situ over 3 yr.
METHODS: Twenty-eight outpatients with colorectal polyps and 50-75 yr of age were compared with 34 sex- and age-matched (+/-5 yr) polyp-free healthy controls. The polyp patients were randomly selected from a double blind 3-yr placebo-controlled endoscopic follow-up and intervention study against growth and recurrence of polyps among 116 polyp-bearing outpatients. Triceps skinfold thickness (TSF) was measured by a Harpenden caliper and total body fat percentage (BF%) by Futrex 5000. Dietary intake was calculated in a 5-day dietary record by weighing. Demograpic data, including smoking and alcohol habits, were registered by an interview and self-administrated questionnaires. Weight and height were measured.
RESULTS: TSF and BF% ranked 66% of the individuals into the same quartiles, and 34% were ranked into the adjacent quartiles. The coefficient of correlation between TSF and BF% was highly significant (r = 0.90, p < 0.01, n = 62). TSF, BF%, and body mass index (kg/m2) did not differ between polyp patients and controls in either crude or adjusted analyses. Adenoma growth was, however, highly associated with increasing levels of TSF (p = 0.004), BF% (p = 0.02), and body mass index (p = 0.006).
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that high body fatness is a promoter of adenoma growth. Similar results were obtained with the caliper and Futrex 5000, which lends credibility to this study. For repeated documentation, a larger study population should be investigated. To our knowledge, this is the first case-control study to investigate the relationship between body composition and growth of adenoma by follow-up in situ over 3 yr."
11467691,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11467691/,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of anal incontinence and anal sphincter defects after a first vaginal delivery and assess the effect of a second delivery.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study using postal questionnaires assessing incontinence to flatus and stools at three and thirty months postnatally and anal endosonography at three months following delivery.
SETTING: Recruitment was from the antenatal clinic at the University Hospitals of Geneva, Switzerland.
POPULATION: One hundred women with a vaginal delivery of their first child.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of anal incontinence and anal sphincter defects.
RESULTS: Anal incontinence was reported by 16/92 (17%) of women at three months after delivery and by 11/77 (14%) at 30 months. At that time, 5/54 (9%) with no further delivery reported incontinence, compared with 6/ 23 (26%) of those who had had another delivery (RR 2.8, 95% CI 1.0-8.3). Anal sphincter defects were diagnosed by endosonography in 46/87 (53%) women and were associated with reported incontinence at both three months (RR 1.9; 95% CI 1.4-2.6) and 30 months (RR 1.9: 95% CI 1.3-2.8) after delivery. The prevalence of anal incontinence at 30 months was highest (5/13, 39%) among those in whom a sphincter defect was diagnosed by endosonography after their first delivery and with a second delivery.
CONCLUSION: Anal incontinence after childbirth is associated with defects of the anal sphincter diagnosed by endosonography. Subsequent deliveries increase the risk of incontinence, particularly among women with a sphincter defect diagnosed after the first delivery."

DESIGN: Population-based cohort study.
SETTING: Sweden. POPULATION Women aged less than 25 years at first birth (n = 275,933), having two successive live single births from 1973 through 1993.
METHODS: Odds ratios with 95 percent confidence intervals were calculated to estimate the effect of low maternal age at first birth. Analyses of first births were adjusted for year of first birth and maternal education and in second births also for previous pregnancy outcomes and interpregnancy interval.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Very preterm birth (less than 33 completed weeks) and moderately preterm birth (33-36 completed weeks).
RESULTS: Compared with women aged 20 to 24 years at first birth, mothers aged 13 to 15 years were at increased risk of very preterm birth (odds ratio = 4.8). The corresponding risks among women aged 16 to 17 years at first birth were doubled (odds ratio = 2.3). The influence of maternal age on risks of moderately preterm birth was similar, although the age-related risks were lower. At second birth, risks of preterm birth were reduced in all age groups. However, mothers who were 17 years or less at first birth, faced, compared with mothers aged 20-24 years, significantly larger reduction in risks of very and moderately preterm birth.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that there may be a biological effect of very young maternal age, affecting foremost very preterm birth."

Relevance of the trends and the possible impact on surgical skills and on innovative ability are discussed.
DESIGN: Observational study.
SETTING: Hospital care in The Netherlands.
SAMPLE: Data from a national hospital discharge database, from all 119 hospitals in The Netherlands.
METHODS: When a patient is discharged from the hospital. data on the diagnosis and treatment are registered by local medical officers and administrators. Registration of surgical procedures is based on the International Classification of Procedures in Medicine (ICPM, WHO 1978), the so-called WCC-standard. All hospitals but one (a cancer centre) in The Netherlands participate in this registration, resulting in 99.3% of all admissions. Data on gynaccological manpower were obtained from the Dutch College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. In order to standardise the frequency numbers per 1,000 women, yearly data of the female population according to age were obtained from the Central Office for Population Statistics.
RESULTS: The female population aged 20 years of age and older increased 3% between 1991 and 1998, from 5.8 million to 6.0 million. In the same period the number of gynaecologists grew from 604 to 625, also an increase of 3%. The total number of hysterectomies dropped from 21,433 in 1991 to 16,320 (-24 %) in 1998 (chi2 for trend 1,245.1. P < 0.001) Surgery of the uterine cavity, either performed hysteroscopically or blind, increased from 311 to 1,958 (+ 625%) cases per year (chi2 for trend 2,459.2, P < 0.001). No trend has been detected in the numbers of adnexal operations, including surgical treatment of tubal pregnancy (tubotomy or tubectomy). In 1998, 12% of all ovarian surgery and 28% of all surgery for ectopic pregnancies was performed laparoscopically. Surgery for female urinary incontinence experienced a strong decline of 46% in the studied period. The frequency of vaginal repair decreased with 1354 (-16%) cases. The abdominal prolapse surgery (abdominal sacral colpopexy, obliteration of the Douglas pouch) is steadily increasing, although the absolute numbers are small. In 1998 seven hundred and forty-three women underwent an abdominal approach of their prolapse repair, compared with 7239 that had the vaginal repair.
CONCLUSIONS: The declining trend of major gynaecological surgery in combination with the increasing number of gynaecologists will result in more difficulty for gynaecologists to acquire and maintain surgical skills and may therefore affect their ability to innovate within the surgical profession."

RESEARCH DESIGN: The Healthwise Communities Project (HCP) evaluation followed a quasi-experimental design.
SUBJECTS: Random households in metropolitan zip codes were mailed questionnaires before and after the HCP. A total of 5,909 surveys were returned.
MEASURES: The dependent variable was self-reported number of visits to the doctor in the past year. A difference-in-differences estimator was used to assess the intervention's community-level effect. We also assessed the intervention's effect on the variance of self-report utilization.
RESULTS: Boise residents had a higher adjusted odds of entering care (OR = 1.27, 95% CI 0.88, 1.85) and 0.1 more doctor visits compared with residents in the control cities; however, for both outcomes, the effects were small and not significant. Although the means changed little, the data suggest that the variance of utilization in Boise decreased.
CONCLUSIONS: The HCP had a small effect on overall self-reported utilization. Although the findings were not statistically significant, a posthoc power analysis revealed that the study was underpowered to detect effects of this magnitude. It may be possible to achieve larger effects by enrolling motivated people into a clinical trial. However, these data suggest that population-based efforts to provide health information have a small effect on self-reported utilization."
11468535,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11468535/,"BACKGROUND: The introduction of cyclosporine (CsA) has improved the short-term outcome of renal transplantation, but its effect on the long-term survival is not well known.
METHODS: We analyzed 128 cadaveric first renal transplant recipients with CsA and prednisone as basal immunosuppression followed for at least 10 years, and we have compared them with a group of 185 historical patients treated with azathioprine (Aza) and prednisone.
RESULTS: The 1-year graft survival was 83% in the CsA-treated patients and 68% in the Aza-treated patients (P<0.025), and the differences were significant for 3 years. Acute rejection accounted for the 10.9% of losses in CsA-treated patients and for 23.8% of losses in Aza-treated patients (P=0.046). Chronic allograft nephropathy was the cause of graft losses in 40.6% and 16.8% of cases (P=0.008). Patient survival at 5 years was 88% in CsA-treated patients and 79% in the Aza-treated patients (P<0.025). When analyzing the data of the 64 CsA-treated patients and the 84 Aza-treated patients with one functioning graft at 10 years, mean serum creatinine values were significantly higher in the CsA-treated patients at all time points but the increases were not significantly different. At 10 years, mean blood pressure was higher (P=0.002), and hypercholesterolemia (P=0.011) and hyperuricemia (P=0.000) were more prevalent in the CsA-treated patients.
CONCLUSIONS: CsA resulted in a better short-time patient and graft survival that was not maintained in the long-term outcome. Chronic allograft nephropathy was the leading cause of graft loss in CsA-treated patients. Graft function was poorer in the CsA-treated patients, but its decline was similar in the two groups."
11468856,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11468856/,"AIM: To determine whether preoperative platelet count influenced the prognosis for surgical treatment of pancreas cancer.
METHODS: Retrospective study of 144 patients operated on for pancreatic cancer: 49 with adenocarcinoma, operable with curative intent (group A), 86 in whom palliative resection or bypass was done (group B), and 9 in whom exploratory laparotomy was done. Preoperative platelet count was done for all patients. Groups A and B were divided into 2 subgroups (> 200,000 platelets/mm3 and < 200,000 platelets/mm3), and an additional subgroup was established for patients with > 300,000 platelets/mm3. Survival was analyzed in the resulting subgroups.
RESULTS: Among patients who underwent curative resection, statistical analysis revealed significantly better survival (p < 0.05) in patients with a platelet count > 200,000 platelets/mm3 and a very significant difference (p < 0.01) in the 300,000 platelets/mm3 subgroup. No differences were found in the subgroups of patients who underwent palliative surgery.
CONCLUSION: Preoperative platelet count may represent a prognostic factor in patients with pancreatic cancer operated on with curative intent. Our findings justify the need for clinical trials of antiangiogenic therapy."
11469093,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11469093/,"INTRODUCTION: The incidence of thromboembolic complications in patients with severe polytrauma in the ICU is not well known. Only a few publications deal with this problem. Systematic investigations in this high-risk patient group are not routinely used.
METHOD: From January 1996 to January 1998, 50 polytrauma patients with a mean ISS > 15 were included in a clinical study to evaluate the incidence of thromboembolism in this patient group. Further inclusion criteria were a minimum stay of 72 h in the ICU and mechanical ventilation for a minimum time of 72 h. All patients were examined with color-coded duplex sonography according to a standardized protocol. The duplex sonography was performed before the patients were first mobilized in the ICU (15 +/- 12.8 days).
RESULTS: If not otherwise indicated all values are given as mean +/- SD. The age of the patients was 38 years (range 17-77 years), the severity of trauma was characterized by an ISS of 40 (range 16-70). Eight of the included patients died during their stay in the ICU after developing a multiple organ failure. According to autopsy data none of them had a deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolus. Eight patients (19%) developed deep venous thrombosis, and 4 patients with thrombosis developed pulmonary embolism.
CONCLUSION: The incidence of deep venous thrombosis in polytrauma patients seems to be much higher than expected reviewing the results of other publications. The low detection rate of other authors results from using only clinical signs. The routine use of color-coded duplex sonography is effective in detecting unsuspected deep vein thrombosis."
11469214,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11469214/,"AIMS: To compare the outcome of short- and long-term survival of patients with Q wave vs non-Q wave myocardial infarction.
METHODS: A total of 6676 patients with acute myocardial infarction were enrolled on the TRAndolapril Cardiac Evaluation (TRACE) register between 1990 and 1992. Medical history, electrocardiographic diagnosis of Q wave and non-Q wave myocardial infarction, echocardiographic estimation of left ventricular systolic function determined as wall motion index, infarct complications, and survival were documented. The factors influencing the postmyocardial infarction outcome of these patients were studied after 30 days and after 8 years of follow-up, respectively.
RESULTS: Cox proportional-hazard models demonstrated that the electrocardiographic Q waves had significant influence on survival during the first 30 days [risk ratio 1.4 (95% confidence limits 1.2-1.7)] but no influence thereafter [1.0 (0.9-1.1)]. The result was the same in univariate and multivariate analyses. Subgroup analysis defined by age, sex, wall motion index, presence of congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, subsequent myocardial infarctions and use of thrombolytic therapy did not disclose importance of Q waves on mortality.
CONCLUSION: The electrocardiographic presence of Q waves is associated with increased mortality during the initial 30 days after a myocardial infarction, but has no influence thereafter."
11469431,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11469431/,"INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to investigate the temporal changes in sinus node function in postcardioversion chronic atrial fibrillation (AF) patients and their possible relation with the recurrence rates of AF.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In 37 chronic AF patients, internally cardioverted to sinus rhythm, corrected sinus node recovery time (CSNRT), and the pattern of corrected return cycle lengths were assessed 5 to 20 minutes and 24 hours after conversion. The last 20 consecutive patients also were evaluated after autonomic blockade. Twenty subjects with normal atrial structure and no history of AF served as the control group. Patients were followed-up for 1 month for recurrence, and the density of supraventricular ectopic beats per hour was obtained during the first 24 hours after conversion. Fifteen patients (40.5%) relapsed during follow-up. CSNRT values at 600 msec (371 +/- 182 msec) and 500 ms (445 +/- 338 msec) were significantly higher than those of control subjects (278 +/- 157 msec, P = 0.050, and 279 +/- 130 msec, P = 0.037, respectively). Significant temporal changes in CSNRT also were observed during the first 24 hours after conversion (600 msec: 308 +/- 120 msec, P = 0.034; 500 msec: 340 +/- 208 msec, P = 0.017). No significant interaction and temporal effects were observed with regard to corrected return cycle length pattern. Similar data regarding CSNRT and corrected return cycle length pattern were obtained after autonomic blockade. Patients with abnormal CSNRT after cardioversion had higher recurrence rates (50%) than those with normal function (37%; P = NS). Patients who relapsed had a higher density of supraventricular ectopic beats per hour (159 +/- 120) compared with those who did not (35 +/- 37; P = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Depressed sinus node function is observed after conversion of chronic AF. Recovery from this abnormality and its independence from autonomic function suggest that AF remodels the sinus node. Our data do not support a causative role of sinus node function in AF recurrence, but they do indicate such a role for the density of atrial ectopic beats."
11469882,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11469882/,"BACKGROUND: Although the status of the axillary lymph nodes is widely accepted to be associated with prognosis in breast cancer patients, there is a need for biomarkers to be analyzed as indicators of responsiveness to treatment. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that the expression of apoptosis genes, bcl-2 and bax, predicts survival and responsiveness to chemotherapy in node-negative breast cancer patients.
METHODS: One hundred thirty premenopausal women with primary breast carcinoma were studied for the expression of bcl-2 and bax genes. The relationship between the expression of bcl-2 and bax proteins and a series of markers of known prognostic value [such as tumor size, nuclear grade, receptors of the steroid hormones estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PgR)]. The association of these proteins with survival and responsiveness to chemotherapy was also examined.
RESULTS: Sixty (46%) and sixty-four (49%) breast cancer cases were found positive for bcl-2 and bax, respectively, as indicated by immunohistochemistry. A statistically significant association was found between expression of bcl-2 and tumor size (P = 0.001), low grade (grade I) (P = 0.002), positivity of ER (P = 0.001), positivity of PR (P = 0.03), and superior disease-free survival (DFS) (P = 0.04), and superior overall survival (OS) (P = 0.03). In contrast, no similar associations were observed for the bax gene. Overall, there was a trend toward an association between adjuvant chemotherapy and DFS (P = 0.08) and OS (P = 0.07). This trend became statistically significant when the patients were analyzed by individual gene expression. In bax-positive patients, chemotherapy improves 6-year DFS (P = 0.01) and OS (P = 0.03) while similar effects were not observed in the other subgroups of patients.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that bcl-2 expression is associated with a number of favorable prognostic factors and better clinical outcome, while bax expression seems to have positive predictive value for responsiveness to chemotherapy in lymph node-negative breast cancer patients."
11471296,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11471296/,"PURPOSE: CE-MRA is a powerful tool for the non-invasive evaluation of carotid artery occlusive disease. However, due to certain drawbacks, it has not completely replaced DSA. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if Gd-BOPTA, a contrast agent with high T1 relaxivity, can increase the diagnostic accuracy of CE-MRA.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The CE-MRA examinations of 54 consecutive patients were evaluated by two experienced radiologists, independently. The examinations of 27 patients were contrasted either with 20 ml Gd-BOPTA or with 20 ml Gd-DTPA. The reviewers were blinded to the contrast agent chosen and to the ultrasound results. They rated the overall image quality and the degree of the ICA stenoses.
RESULTS: For the estimation of the degree of the ICA stenoses there was a high interrater validity. In comparison to the ultrasound findings, 6 of 50 high-degree stenoses were underestimated as moderate stenoses. In one of seven sonographically occluded vessels, MRA revealed residual patency in the vessel lumen. It was not possible to identify the contrast agent that was taken for a study. Subjective estimation of the image quality (arterial contrast of the ICA, contrast of the other vessels, and general impression) did not significantly change with the contrast agent employed.
CONCLUSION: The diagnostic accuracy of CE-MRA for the evaluation of internal carotid artery stenoses is not improved by Gd-BOPTA if identical volumina of contrast media are applied. The potential of this contrast agent can be the reduction of the amount of contrast without loss of diagnostic information. Further studies are necessary."
2492785,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2492785/,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine whether high doses of fish oil concentrate followed by low-dose maintenance therapy can sustain the initial plasma triglyceride reductions.
DESIGN: Before-and-after trial with 3-month treatment periods.
SETTING: Outpatient lipid clinic at a university medical center.
PATIENTS: Sixteen patients with hypertriglyceridemia recruited from the General Internal Medicine Clinics. Five had concomitant hypercholesterolemia (type IIb).
INTERVENTION: Fish oil supplementation at two doses. After basal measurements, 9.8 g/d omega-3 fatty acids were provided for study months 1 to 3, and 3.9 g/d were provided for study months 4 to 6.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Blood was drawn monthly and plasma was analyzed for levels of triglycerides, low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and apolipoprotein B, high-density-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and apolipoprotein A1, and glucose and glycohemoglobin. During therapy with the higher dose, mean plasma triglyceride levels were reduced from 3.65 +/- 0.35 mmol/L at baseline to 1.85 +/- 0.20 mmol/L at 1 month, but increased by 30% to 2.40 +/- 0.30 mmol/L by the third month of therapy (P less than 0.05): this increase could not be explained by changes in body weight or compliance. Plasma triglyceride levels continued to increase with low-dose therapy and remained only 11% below baseline values by the sixth month of therapy (P = not significant). Although fish oil therapy increased HDL cholesterol levels (+18% at high dose; 99% CI, 5% to 31%), favorable changes were not seen in LDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, or apolipoprotein A1 levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Fish oil concentrate at high doses followed by low-dose maintenance therapy cannot sustain the initial large plasma triglyceride reductions. Moreover, the efficacy of the higher dose becomes less pronounced after the first month of therapy. This reduced efficacy during prolonged therapy, and the lack of beneficial effect on apolipoprotein and LDL cholesterol levels, may limit the practical benefit of fish oil in the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia."
2493192,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2493192/,"PURPOSE, PATIENTS, AND METHODS: We used decision analysis to calculate the economic implications of routine testing for Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection of the cervix. This study compared performing endocervical cultures in all women seeking routine gynecologic care to a no-test strategy. Estimates derived from the medical literature were varied in a sensitivity analysis, and a Monte Carlo technique was used to incorporate the estimates of experts into the analysis.
RESULTS: We found that routinely testing for gonorrhea reduced overall medical costs when the prevalence of infection exceeded 1.5 percent. This result was most sensitive to variation in the cost of the culture and the assumption that treatment prevents adverse sequelae. Reducing the estimated cost of the culture from $9 to $5 decreased the threshold prevalence from 1.5 to 0.8 percent. When we considered the variation in estimates of experts, the threshold prevalence increased from 1.5 to 2.1 percent.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that a strategy of testing and treating selected women with risk factors for gonorrhea will not only reduce the likelihood of the development of serious adverse sequelae but will also result in a reduction of medical costs."
2497830,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2497830/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a booklet given to patients being discharged from hospital giving details of their admission and treatment increased their knowledge and recall when reviewed in outpatient clinics.
DESIGN: Patients alternately allocated to receive a booklet or to serve as controls. Assessment by a questionnaire at first attendance at outpatient clinic after discharge. Data were collected over nine months.
SETTING: One general medical and cardiological ward in a large teaching hospital and associated outpatient clinics.
PATIENTS: One hundred and thirty one patients discharged taking at least one drug and scheduled to return to clinic within 12 weeks. Patients stratified by age and by the number of weeks between discharge and outpatient appointment.
INTERVENTION: A booklet was given to 65 patients at discharge from the ward; 66 patients served as controls.
MAIN RESULTS: Of the patients who received the booklet, 56 (86%) knew the names of their drugs, 62 (95%) the frequency of the dose, and 55 (85%) the reasons for taking each drug. The numbers in the control group were 31 (47%), 38 (58%), and 28 (42%) respectively. These differences were highly significant (p less than 0.001). Twenty six (40%) who received the booklet brought all their drugs to clinic compared with 12 (18%) control patients. Appreciably more of the first group of patients than control patients knew the reason they had been in hospital, and more of the first group indicated that they would take the correct action when their prescribed drugs ran out. Most general practitioners thought that the booklet was a good idea, that it was helpful, and that it was better than the existing interim discharge letter.
CONCLUSIONS: Giving patients an information booklet at discharge from hospital appreciably increased the accuracy and thoroughness of their recall of important medical details concerning their illness and its treatment. The booklet was shown to be feasible, helpful in the outpatient clinic, and preferred by most general practitioners."
2500168,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2500168/,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the influence of antihypertensive treatment and metabolic characteristics on the development of diabetes mellitus in middle aged men.
DESIGN: Prospective study over an average of nine years.
SETTING: Community based health survey of middle aged men carried out at the University of Uppsala.
SUBJECTS: Seventy three hypertensive men aged 49-54 and 65 normotensive controls matched for body mass index, glucose disappearance rate (k value) at an intravenous glucose tolerance test, and serum triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations.
INTERVENTIONS: Hypertensive group was treated with beta blockers, thiazides, hydralazine, or combinations of these drugs. Treatment was not randomised.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Intravenous glucose tolerance, fasting blood glucose and serum lipid and insulin concentrations, body weight and height, three skinfold measurements, and blood pressure were recorded both during an initial health screening survey in 1970-3 and at a follow up survey in 1980-3. In the period between the two surveys 12 hypertensive men and two controls developed diabetes. Review of values obtained at the initial survey showed that the hypertensive men who developed diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance could be distinguished from those hypertensive men who did not by virtue of a higher fasting serum insulin concentration (26.1 v 15.2 mU/l (confidence interval of difference -15.2 to -6.2)), a lower peak serum insulin concentration (78.9 v 94.3 mU/l (confidence interval of difference -1.1 to 41.1)), and a lower k value (1.29 v 1.68 (confidence interval of difference -0.02 to 0.68)). The insulin index (peak insulin concentration divided by fasting insulin concentration), however, decreased significantly in the hypertensive men over time irrespective of whether they developed diabetes but did not change in the controls. Furthermore, the serum triglyceride concentration increased in the treated group and decreased in the controls.
CONCLUSION: A severalfold difference in the incidence of diabetes between treated hypertensive and non-treated, normotensive men may be a consequence of the treatment, which may be particularly deleterious in men predisposed to diabetes."
2504343,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2504343/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of regular long distance running on the state of the hips in later life.
DESIGN: Retrospective study of a cohort of elite athletes and a group of normal, healthy, untrained controls examined 15 years after initial testing.
SETTING: Research project at school for physical education and sports.
SUBJECTS: 27 Former long distance runners (mean age 42), nine former bobsleigh riders (mean age 42), and 23 normal, healthy, untrained men (mean age 35) who had been examined in 1973 and who agreed to re-examination in 1988.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Radiological evidence of degenerative hip disease in 1988.
RESULTS: Physiological and exercise characteristics of all subjects had been recorded in 1973, and in 1988 these measurements were repeated together with radiological examination of the hips. An additive radiological index of hip disease based on grades of subchondral sclerosis, osteophyte formation, and joint space narrowing was significantly increased among runners as compared with bobsleigh riders and untrained controls. After adjustment for age the significant effect of type of sports activity remained (p = 0.032). In multivariate analyses age and milage run in 1973 (97 km/week) emerged as independent, significant, and positive predictors of radiological signs of degenerative hip disease in 1988 (p = 0.017 and p = 0.024 respectively). Among runners alone running pace in 1973 rather than milage run was the stronger predictor of subsequent degenerative hip disease. The milage run in 1988 was not particularly predictive of the radiological index, but endurance in 1988 was inversely related to degenerative hip disease seen radiologically.
CONCLUSION: Long term, high intensity, high milage running should not be dismissed as a potential risk factor for premature osteoarthritis of the hip."
2507006,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2507006/,"OBJECTIVE: To identify the main delay in the provision of hearing aids for people with impaired hearing and identify possible problems and short-comings caused by a community based hearing aid dispensing service.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort analysis based on data collected from patients on the duration of hearing impairment, from the referral letters in respect of the general practitioners' findings on otoscopy, and from the ear, nose, and throat assessment in the clinic with respect to the outcome of specialist otoscopy and management of the hearing impairment.
SETTING: General ear, nose, and throat outpatient clinic.
PATIENTS: 100 Consecutive patients aged 19-94 referred by general practitioners for the provision of hearing aids or for assessment and treatment of impaired hearing.
RESULTS: Most patients with impaired hearing did not seek medical advice for at least a year. The time from referral by the general practitioner to the provision of a hearing aid was under two months. General practitioners consistently recognised normality on otoscopy but failed to recognise abnormality in eight of 45 cases. Seven patients required further investigation to exclude serious disease and nine had conditions amenable to surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: The main cause of delay in treating impaired hearing is failure by patients to seek help promptly. Specialist assessment of patients with impaired hearing is preferable and does not necessarily cause delay in providing hearing aids. The provision of hearing aids should remain a hospital based service."
2508882,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2508882/,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the severity of psychiatric symptoms among residents of hostels for homeless people.
DESIGN: Survey of residents in two hostels in Oxford, comprising three weeks of background fieldwork, a demographic questionnaire, and rating behaviour over two weeks with a behavioural rating scale (REHAB) and mental state with the brief psychiatric rating scale.
SETTING: Two hostels for homeless people in Oxford.
SUBJECTS: 146 Medium to long term residents, of whom 48 were selected by hostel workers by the following criteria: continuous residence for at least two months, signs of persistent severe mental disability, and difficulty in coping independently in the community. Two subjects died during the study; three (previously long term psychiatric inpatients) declined to be assessed on the psychiatric scale.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Behavioural disturbance and mental state.
RESULTS: Only a third of the total sample had been born in Oxfordshire. Subjects had been accepted into the hostel either by arrangement with the local psychiatric service (22) or straight off the streets (26); 43 had had a previous (non-drug related) psychiatric admission. Subjects were significantly more likely than other residents to have spent longer (greater than 80 weeks) in a hostel in the past three years (p less than 0.02). With reference to norms for deviant behaviour, the 46 subjects assessed showed considerable deviant behaviour (average weekly scores: 0 (11 subjects), 1 (14), 2-3 (16), and greater than or equal to 4 (5] not significantly different from that expected in moderately to severely handicapped psychiatric inpatients (chi 2 = 1.3, df = 3, p greater than 0.7); 22 had scores equivalent to those in most severely handicapped inpatients. Of the 43 subjects assessed with the psychiatric rating scale, 16 had symptoms of neurosis, 29 of florid psychosis, and 32 of a deficit state. Symptoms of deficit state were positively correlated with ratings of low social activity on the behavioural scale (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient 0.30, p = 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: Hostels are having to care for long term severely affected psychiatric patients discharged into the community. The suitability of the services offered to such subjects should be assessed."

DESIGN: Comparison of the time trend in survival of patients living in the trial area with that of patients living in the rest of Finland.
SETTING: Trial area covered 17 of the 21 main hospital districts in Finland (serving more than two thirds of patients with multiple myeloma).
PATIENTS: 663 Men and 690 women in the trial area and 318 men and 307 women in the reference area aged under 71 in whom multiple myeloma was diagnosed during 1959-85. In the trial area the disease was diagnosed in 455 men and 493 women in 1959-78 and in 208 men and 197 women in 1979-85; in the reference area it was diagnosed in 234 men and 227 women in 1959-78 and in 84 men and 80 women in 1979-85.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Five year cumulative relative survival rates during 1959-85, annual relative survival rates in the first seven years of follow up during 1979-85, and fitted annual relative survival rates in the first five years of follow up during 1959-85.
RESULTS: During the first two years of follow up the annual relative survival rates did not differ between the two areas, but in the next five years of follow up patients in the trial area did better than those in the reference area. For cases diagnosed in 1979-85 the difference in the five year cumulative relative survival rates between patients in the trial area and those in the reference area was 10%, those in the trial area doing better. Generalised proportional hazards regression analysis of the first five years of follow up showed that the patients in the trial area had a survival advantage over those in the reference area. The model with the best fit included year of follow up, time of diagnosis, the joint effect of year of follow up and time of diagnosis, and the joint effect of area and time of diagnosis.
CONCLUSION: The patients in the trial area benefited from the clinical trials, which suggests that the use of a treatment protocol improves the end results of treatment. In other words, the results favour a systematic treatment schedule in preference to a schedule determined by the free choice of a clinician."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients (5 males, 9 females) with proximal femoral fracture following low energy trauma were included in the study. Patients with secondary osteoporosis and who received antiosteoporotic treatment prior to trauma were excluded. The patients were divided into two groups based on the bone mineral density measurement, including osteopenic group (n=7, mean age 69 years; range 63-74 years) and osteoporotic group (n=7, mean age 74.1 years; range 67-78 years). Cortical bone specimens for biopsy obtained from the patients who underwent endoprosthesis during partial hip arthroplasty and were evaluated using light microscope.
RESULTS: Mean cortical bone thickness was 3622.14 μM in osteopenic group, and 2323.14 μM in osteoporotic group (p<0.005). However, light microscope revealed similar characteristics for both groups.
CONCLUSION: Although a significant difference was found between the groups in terms of cortical thickness, bone microstructure showed similar characteristics in osteopenic and osteoporotic patients with low energy femoral neck fracture."
22449466,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22449466/,"BACKGROUND: Much continuing medical education is known to have a limited impact on subsequent clinical behaviour. An option to improve this is to ask participants to develop specific actions about their clinical behaviour changes.
METHODS: We aimed to investigate the content and outcomes of GPs' action lists produced on a one-day continuing professional development (CPD) course. Actions were recorded during a one-day course, and followed up six months later.
RESULTS: Of 1696 delegates attending the nine courses, 306 (18%) provided their action plan and 139 of these responded to the questionnaire at six months (response rate 45%). The 306 delegates recorded a total of 1443 actions (4.7 per delegate). Of these, 359 were subsequently explored by follow-up questionnaire at six months of which 147 (41%; 95% CI 36%-46%) were 'successful', an average of completed actions of 1.9 per GP. Four significant facilitators and four significant barriers to success were identified.
CONCLUSIONS: Delegates attending the one-day CPD course recorded an average of 4.7 intended practice changes, and completed 41%. Further research is needed on how to increase the number of planned and completed actions."
22449740,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22449740/,"BACKGROUND: Recurrences are common within the first months following atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation. However, prior studies using only intermittent ECG recording have not shown a powerful correlation with ultimate response.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to use continuous AF monitoring with an implanted monitor to assess the AF burden measured continuously during the first months postablation and the relationship to subsequent AF recurrences.
METHODS: Six hundred thirteen patients with symptomatic drug-refractory AF (17% with persistent AF) were part of this retrospective analysis. All patients underwent circumferential pulmonary vein isolation and were implanted with a subcutaneous AF monitor (Reveal XT, Medtronic) for collecting data on AF burden (AF%) during a 12-month follow-up period. AF freedom (responders) was defined as AF% ≤0.5% during each monthly telemetric follow-up. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to identify the value in AF% during the first months in the postablation blanking period that was predictive of later recurrence of AF. Sensitivity of 90% was selected as the target value.
RESULTS: After the first ablation procedure, 396 of the 613 patients (65%) were responders (AF ≤0.5%) at 12 months: 346 of 508 (68%) in the paroxysmal AF group and 50 of 105 (47%) in the persistent AF group. Using the receiver operating characteristic curve, the specificity corresponding to 90% sensitivity was 85% for AF% at 2 months. The corresponding threshold in the AF burden during the blanking period able to identify patients at risk for late recurrences was 4.5%, corresponding to a cumulative 65.9 hours (2.75 days) spent in AF during the first 2 months. In a multivariate analysis, AF% <4.5% during the first 2 months was highly significant (P <.001), and the odds ratio of responders/nonresponders was 39.8 (95% CI, 19.1-82.9).
CONCLUSION: The AF burden measured during the blanking period can predict the response to catheter ablation at 12 months. AF% ≥4.5% at 2 months assessed by continuous monitoring is a powerful predictor of subsequent AF recurrences after initial ablation, thus providing relevant clinical information to select patients for early reintervention."

Scintigraphy with metaiodobenzylguanidine (I(123) MIBG) evaluates innervation and cardiac adrenergic activation. The association of these two methods is not well established.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between HRR and washout rate (WO) of I(123) MIBG in patients with heart failure (HF).
METHODS: Twenty-five patients with ejection fraction < 45% underwent exercise testing, and analysis of the variation of HRR from the 1st to the 8th minute after exertion. Submitted to I(123) MIBG, they were separated into groups by WO: G1) <27% and G2) ≥ 27%. For the statistical analysis Mann-Whitney's U test and Spearman's correlation coefficient were used.
RESULTS: G2 showed a slower variation of HRR: 1st minute: G1: 21.5 (16.12 to 26.87) vs. G2: 11.00 (8.5 to 13.5) bpm, p = 0.001; 2nd minute: G1: 34 (29-39) vs. G2: 20 (14 - 26) bpm, p = 0.001; 3rd minute: G1: 46 (37.8 - 54.1) vs. G2: 30 (22 - 38) bpm, p = 0.005; 5th minute: G1: 51.5 (42 - 61) vs. G2: 39 (31.5 to 46.5) bpm, p = 0.013, and in the 8th minute: G1: 54.5 (46.5 - 62.5) vs. G2: 43 (34 - 52) bpm, p = 0.037. HRR in the 1st (r = -0.555, p = 0.004), and in the 2nd minute (r = -0.550, p = 0.004) were negatively correlated with WO.
CONCLUSION: Patients with high HF and WO showed an abnormal HRR compared with patients with normal WO. These findings suggest that adrenergic activation may influence the HRR."

AIM: To study the frequency of pathological smears in the group of women aged over 65 with a normal and sufficient cytological follow-up, according to the guidelines. To analyze the smear results and the former follow-up of this population to determine whether there is an interest to continue the smear screening after age 65.
METHODS: This is a retrospective multicenter study based on collecting data from three pathology laboratories of the region Rhone-Alpes. We study a population of women 65 and older with smears that have been made between 2004 and 2008.
RESULTS: Precancerous lesions and cervical cancer can be discovered after age 65 despite an adequate former follow-up. The rate of these women for having a pathological smear is 14,2‰, including 1,2‰ with cytological abnormalities in favour of cancer.
CONCLUSION: These results show that there is interest to continue the smear tests after age 65 at least, while considering medical and financial issues of a reasonable screening strategy."
22451085,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22451085/,"BACKGROUND: Pupillometry is a non-invasive investigation based on the concept that pupillary reagibility depends on a number of specific sensory, mental and emotional variables. By means of the receptor test based on the topical application of the cholinergic antagonist tropicamide cognitive deficits can be evaluated. The present study focuses on the question whether the receptor test is able to differentiate criminally responsible mentally disordered offenders (§ 21/2 StGB) with different durations of confinement concerning the presence of a functional psychosyndrome, as defined by Grünberger.
METHODS: Four groups of offenders with different durations of confinement (group A: confinement 0-2 years, n = 26, X = 33; group B: 2-5 years, n = 29, X = 34; group C: 5-10 years, n = 6, X = 36; group D: >10 years, n = 10, X = 43) were investigated by means of a computer-assisted TV pupillometer. After a baseline measurement 0.01% tropicamide was instilled into the eye. The second measurement was conducted 20 min after the first, the 3rd and 4th measurements in intervals of 20 min.
RESULTS: The groups with a longer duration of confinement showed a reduced activation and vigilance and increased fatigability as compared with the groups of shorter confinement. In the receptor test the group that had been imprisoned for 0-2 years showed more cognitive deficits than those imprisoned for ≥5 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of activation, fatigability and vigilance indicates that the duration of confinement plays a role in the development of a functional psychosyndrome. The results of the receptor test, in which the group with a longer duration of confinement showed less pronounced cognitive deficits and no significant changes of the tropicamide effect over time, suggest that in this group a dose change might be required to make the cognitive deficits evident."
22451261,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22451261/,"OBJECTIVE: Screening for psychological distress is an important tool for improving survivors' access to psychosocial care. The Brief Symptom Inventory-18 (BSI-18) has been widely used to identify psychological distress in cancer survivors, but few studies have reported on its validity. This study evaluated validity of the BSI-18 by comparing it to the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90).
METHODS: Concordance of cases identified by the BSI-18 and SCL-90 was examined in a sample of 193 adult survivors of childhood cancer.
RESULTS: Receiver operating characteristics analysis showed strong diagnostic utility of the BSI-18 (area under curve = 0.922). However, the standard BSI-18 case-rule demonstrated low sensitivity (45.2%) against the SCL-90. An alternative case-rule showed better results; sensitivity (87.10%), specificity (83.33%).
CONCLUSIONS: The BSI-18 is a useful measure for evaluating distress in adult survivors of childhood cancers; however, the standard BSI-18 case-rule has not been validated for this population, and an alternative case rule should be considered."
22451337,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22451337/,"BACKGROUND: Despite advances in primary THA, dislocation remains a common complication. In New Zealand (NZ), dislocations are reported to the National Joint Registry (NJR) only when prosthetic components are revised in the treatment of a dislocation. Closed reductions of dislocated hips are not recorded by the NJR.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We compared the true dislocation rate for patients receiving primary THA in the Wellington region with the rate reported by the NZ NJR for the same group of patients.
METHODS: The NZ NJR identified 570 patients undergoing primary THA from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2009, with addresses in the Wellington region. The mean age was 67.5 years (range, 27-96 years). The minimum followup was 2 years (mean, 3 years; range, 2-4 years).
RESULTS: Six patients required revision of at least one component for dislocation. There was 100% agreement between the hospital database and the NJR. Using the NJR criteria of revision of any component as an end point, the dislocation rate in the Wellington region after primary THA was 1.05%. The hospital database identified a further eight patients who presented with a dislocation of their primary THA and underwent a closed reduction. These patients were not recorded by the NJR. The true rate of all dislocations, which includes closed reductions, was 2.46%.
CONCLUSIONS: This article documents the discrepancy between the NZ NJR reported rate of revision for dislocation and the true rate of dislocation in primary THA. We recommend documentation of all dislocations by NJR in their database to allow more accurate comparisons between centers and research outcomes.

22451546,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22451546/,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study was to investigate whether virtual nonenhanced images can replace true nonenhanced images for the evaluation of biliary stones and to compare two virtual nonenhanced images obtained from dual-energy data sets during the late arterial phase (LAP) and portal venous phase (PVP) with true nonenhanced images.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred patients with gallstones (n = 77) or bile duct stones (n = 23) who had undergone dual-source dual-energy CT (using 80kVp and 140kVp with the ratio of dose-partitioning, 1:1.3), were included. The CT numbers for the stone, liver, and bile; stone size; and image noise were assessed for each image set. The conspicuity and size of the stones, image quality, and acceptability of the virtual nonenhanced images as a replacement for true nonenhanced images were assessed.
RESULTS: Virtual nonenhanced images from both LAP (VNE(LAP)) and PVP showed lower CT numbers for the stone and smaller stone size than did true nonenhanced images (p < 0.05). VNE(LAP) images failed to show stones in 16 patients (16%) with relatively radiolucent bile duct stones (< 78 HU) or small gallstones (< 9 mm(2), < 1.7 mm). There was no difference between the two virtual nonenhanced image sets except for the contrast-to-noise ratio of stone to bile and the image noise (CT numbers for the stone, liver, and muscle; stone size; and contrast-to-noise ratio of stone to liver, p = 1; the CT number for the bile, p = 0.1618; and effective dose, p = 0.7478). VNE(LAP) images were considered acceptable as a replacement for true nonenhanced images in 89% and 90% by reviewers 1 and 2, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Virtual nonenhanced images allow the detection of biliary stones with moderate accuracy, irrespective of the dual-energy contrast-enhanced phase. The detection of gallbladder stones of 9 mm(2) or smaller and of relatively radiolucent bile duct stones of 78 HU or lower is limited."
22451549,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22451549/,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study was to investigate whether virtual unenhanced adrenal nodule attenuation values can replace true noncontrast attenuation values.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-three incidentally discovered adrenal nodules (19 adenomas and four metastases) were identified in 19 patients (11 men and eight women; mean age, 65 years; age range, 38-84 years) who underwent unenhanced single-energy CT followed by contrast-enhanced dual-energy CT on the same scanner. A virtual unenhanced imaging dataset was generated from each dual-energy CT dataset. CT attenuation of each adrenal nodule was measured at the same location on virtual unenhanced images and true unenhanced images by three radiologists and mean values compared using the Student t test. Correlation between virtual unenhanced and true unenhanced values was determined using linear regression analysis. The mean difference and percentage of diagnostic agreement were also determined. Interreader variability was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).
RESULTS: The mean ± SD attenuation values for virtual unenhanced images and true unenhanced images were 14.7 ± 15.1 HU and 12.9 ± 13.4 HU, respectively (p = 0.2). Strong positive correlation was observed between virtual unenhanced images and true unenhanced images (R = 0.83-0.87). The mean difference between virtual unenhanced images and true unenhanced images was 1.8 ± 1.7 HU. Diagnostic agreement between virtual unenhanced images and true unenhanced images was 83-91% for three radiologists. No malignant nodules were misclassified as benign on virtual unenhanced images. The ICC was 0.88 and 0.96 for virtual unenhanced images and true unenhanced images, respectively, indicating high interreader agreement.
CONCLUSION: Virtual unenhanced and true unenhanced attenuation measurements of adrenal nodules were not significantly different and showed strongly positive linear correlation. This finding resulted in substantial diagnostic agreement between virtual unenhanced images and true unenhanced images for distinguishing benign from malignant nodules."
22451585,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22451585/,"BACKGROUND: There is little information regarding the incremental changes in the postoperative laxity of patellar tendon (PT) autografts versus allografts in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction.
HYPOTHESES: (1) There would be no significant increase in laxity between 6 weeks and 1 year postoperatively with PT autografts or allografts, (2) there would be no significant difference in laxity between PT autografts and allografts, (3) there would not be a significant difference in laxity between nonirradiated and low dose-irradiated PT allograft tissues, and (4) the physical examination findings would correlate with the instrumented laxity outcomes.
STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.
METHODS: A retrospective review of 238 ACL-deficient patients who underwent single-incision endoscopic ACL reconstruction with a PT autograft (n = 132) or allograft (n = 106; 58 irradiated and 48 nonirradiated) from a single surgeon was made looking at data from preoperatively and from 6 weeks to 1 year postoperatively. The objective measurements of ligament integrity included range of motion, Lachman test, pivot-shift test, and KT-1000 arthrometer instrumented laxity examination. Failure was defined as arthrometric side-to-side differences (maximum manual difference) ≥3 mm or a positive pivot shift. Statistical significance was defined as P < .05.
RESULTS: There were no differences in postoperative examination findings or instrumented laxity between PT autografts and allografts (irradiated or nonirradiated) in either subgroup. The postoperative improvement based on the Lachman examination, pivot-shift test, and arthrometric data in all study groups was significant (P < .001) in 98% (autograft: n = 130; allograft: n = 104) of patients, and arthrometric failure correlated with failure by physical examination. There was no significant change in graft laxity, as measured by KT-1000 arthrometer, from 6 weeks to 1 year postoperatively for 98% of patients. Finally, there was no statistical correlation in instrumented laxity results for either the autograft or allograft group with reference to age, gender, concurrent meniscectomy, meniscal repairs, interval to surgery, postoperative patellar pain, time to surgery, or irradiated versus nonirradiated allograft.
CONCLUSION: Laxity is not increased after the initial 6 weeks for either PT allograft or autograft constructs during the first postoperative year. There was no correlation between age, gender, concomitant injury, interval to surgery, or radiation of the graft with instrumented laxity results. Furthermore, our arthrometric data paralleled our clinical findings of stability at follow-up."
22452621,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22452621/,"AIM: The aim of this article was to evaluate the Revised Clinical Risk Index for Babies' (CRIB-II) severity of illness score as a predictor of moderate to severe functional disability (FD) in very premature infants.
METHODS: Population study of infants born <29 weeks' gestation cared for in all Neonatal Intensive Care Unit in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory between 1998 and 2003. FD at 2-3 years corrected age was defined as developmental delay (quotient < 2 standard deviation), non-ambulatory cerebral palsy (needing aids to walk), blindness (acuity <6/60 in better eye) or deafness (hearing aids). Sensitivity and specificity of CRIB-II scores to predict FD were performed by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.
RESULTS: Of study population of 2210, 480 (21.7%) died before hospital discharge. Among 1328 infants assessed, 217 (16.3%) had FD, 109 (8.2%) developmental delay, 75 (5.6%) cerebral palsy and 54 (4.1%) blindness or deafness. CRIB-II performed significantly better than gestation or birthweight (BW) alone in predicting mortality (area under the curve (AUC) ± standard error 0.83 ± 0.01, vs. 0.78 ± 0.01 and 0.76 ± 0.01, respectively). CRIB-II scores were significantly higher in FD than non-FD children (11.9 ± 2.9 vs. 10.1 ± 2.6), but the AUC for CRIB-II (0.68 ± 0.02) did not significantly differ from that of gestation (0.65 ± 0.02) and BW (0.65 ± 0.02).
CONCLUSION: CRIB-II improved prediction of mortality but did not perform better than gestational age or BW in predicting FD. We would caution clinicians against using the infant's condition at admission to predict long-term outcome."
22453495,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22453495/,"BACKGROUND: Our goal was to identify the changes of esophageal motility, lower esophageal sphincter (LES) function, and eating adaptation before and after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) and whether manometry should be a routine examination in patients who undergo this procedure.
METHODS: A total of 81 patients underwent manometry before surgery and 1 year after surgery. The control group consisted of 10 nonobese volunteers. Patients were classified as presenting with vomiting and without vomiting 1 year after surgery. Manometric variables were compared before and after surgery. Statistical analysis was performed using Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney test.
RESULTS: The patients (45.6%) had preoperative manometric findings, 29.8% had LES hypertonia, 18.9% LES hypotonia, 43.2% increase in wave amplitude of contraction, and three 8.1% abnormal peristalsis. One year after surgery manometry was abnormal in 62.9% of patients, 11.7% with hypertonia and 15.7% with hypotonia of the LES, 53% with changes in amplitude contraction and 19.6% with abnormal peristalsis. The control group showed no manometric abnormalities. Chronic vomiting was noted in 21% of patients. When comparing all variables between the pre and postoperative periods, there was no significant difference for all of them except for peristalsis. Comparing the results of manometric findings between the vomiting and non-vomiting groups, no significant changes were found in the variables studied.
CONCLUSIONS: There was an association between RYGBP and motor abnormalities in the esophagus but no differences in postoperative feeding adaptation. Thus, we conclude that esophageal manometry is not necessary as a routine preoperative examination."
22453721,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22453721/,"OBJECTIVES: This study evaluates trends of pregnant adolescents' utilization of pediatric emergency departments (PEDs), describes patient demographics, and reviews common pregnancy-related conditions seen in the PED.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cross-sectional study of a large pediatric emergency medicine research network database including 11 freestanding PEDs, 3 separate PEDs from a site with a general ED, and 8 general EDs that see pediatric patients. Pediatric patients (<19 years old) were identified from January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2007, by any International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision pregnancy or pregnancy-related condition diagnosis code. Demographic information (age, race, payer type) and disposition (admit, discharge home, transfer) were recorded.
RESULTS: There were 15,190 unique pregnancy-related visits with an overall annual growth rate of 2.8% (P = 0.03). There was a statistically significant increase in visits to freestanding PEDs (P = 0.02) and separate PED from a site with a general ED (P = 0.03), but there was not in the general EDs (P = 0.16). The 3 most common pregnancy-related conditions were abdominal pain, genitourinary infection, and hemorrhage in early pregnancy.
CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant adolescents make up a small (<1%) but growing proportion of overall visits to PEDs. Future direction should include an evaluation of the educational opportunities provided during pediatric residency and pediatric emergency medicine fellowship training and, if inadequacies exist, work to develop an innovative curriculum for this particular patient population."
22453726,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22453726/,"OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to describe the characteristics and outcome of pediatric patients presenting to an emergency department (ED) following out-of-hospital primary cardiac arrest (OHPCA), to determine if long-term survival is influenced by specific resuscitation interventions.
METHODS: This was a prospective observational study of cases of OHPCA during sport or exertion in young patients presenting to an ED over a 5-year period. Cases were identified from a resuscitation database, which documented patient demographics, nature of event, emergency treatment, response times, and clinical progress. These data were analyzed to determine outcomes.
RESULTS: Nine children were identified who presented following OHPCA during the study period. The mean age was 10.7 (±4.2) years. All were subsequently diagnosed with an underlying primary cardiac disorder. Six patients (66.6%) survived to make a full recovery. All patients who survived had received early chest compressions (within 5 minutes) and early defibrillation (within 10 minutes). The initial cardiac arrest rhythm in all survivors had been an electrically cardiovertable rhythm. Five (83%) of the 6 survivors did not receive epinephrine during resuscitation.
CONCLUSIONS: The importance of early chest compressions and defibrillation in collapsed young athletes is highlighted in this report. These interventions can result in full long-term neurological recovery. Use of epinephrine in these patients may be dangerous. We suggest that special consideration should be given to this subgroup of patients in the development of future resuscitation guidelines."
22453728,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22453728/,"OBJECTIVES: Research on spontaneous pneumothorax (SP) has focused on management strategies in adolescents and adults, yet pediatric population-based data are lacking. The objective of this study was to determine the incidence of SP in the pediatric population in different age groups.
METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of patients aged 0 to 17 years hospitalized with a diagnosis of SP from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Kids' Inpatient Database between 1997 and 2006. Trends of overall incidence and demographic information, including age, sex, length of stay, associated procedures, and associated conditions, were obtained and analyzed.
RESULTS: The overall incidence of SP in children younger than 18 years increased from 2.68 per 100,000 population in 1997 to 3.41 per 100,000 in 2006. Average age (15.1 years; SE, 0.1 years), age distribution (83% = 15-17 years old), and hospital length of stay (4.7 days; SE, 0.1 days) remained constant. Between 1997 and 2006, males rose from 3.7 times to 4.2 times as likely to develop SP as females. In 2006, 70% of all hospitalized SP patients had therapeutic procedures documented: chest tube (32%), bleb excision (20%), and thoracotomy (8%) were the most common. Emphysematous bleb (21%), asthma (10%), and tobacco use (4%) were the most common associated diagnoses in 2006.
CONCLUSIONS: Although uncommon in children, SP appears to be primarily a condition of males and adolescents and appears to be increasing in incidence in this population. According to these data, a large portion of children are being managed without procedural intervention."
22454133,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22454133/,"INTRODUCTION: there is little information about the relationship between age and management of COPD exacerbation (AECOPD), although older persons are known to be at a greater risk of hospital admission.
METHODS: we have investigated responses from the clinical and patient questionnaire elements of the 2008 UK COPD audit, splitting the data into age decile.
RESULTS: age ranged from 27 to 102. Patient-reported data suggested older patients had inferior knowledge of COPD, undertook less self-care and were less likely to recognise symptoms of exacerbation prior to hospitalisation. Clinician-reported data showed that although older patients had severe disease and symptoms, greater co-morbidity at presentation and higher mortality, fewer were seen in hospital or followed up subsequently by respiratory specialists. Older patients were more likely to have a DNR order signed within 24 h of admission, irrespective of co-morbidities or performance status. The observations were particularly applicable to those aged 80 or above.
CONCLUSIONS: clinicians should consider increasing age as a specific risk factor in the management of COPD. Acute units and community teams should review carefully their protocols and pathways for how they assess, manage, discharge and follow-up older patients with COPD exacerbation."
22454300,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22454300/,"PURPOSE: Most workers with chronic nonspecific musculoskeletal pain (CMP) do not take sick leave, nor consult a health care professional or search vocational rehabilitation. Yet, the knowledge of many researchers, clinicians and policy makers is largely based on people with CMP who discontinue work. The aim of this study was to explore characteristics of workers who stay at work despite CMP, and to compare these with sick-listed workers with CMP following vocational rehabilitation.
METHODS: The clinical characteristics of workers who stay at work despite CMP (n = 119) and sick-listed workers who follow vocational rehabilitation (n = 122) were described and the differences between these groups were assessed. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess differences between the groups and to determine which variables predicted group status.
RESULTS: Workers who stayed at work despite CMP reported significantly lower levels of fear avoidance (OR = 0.94), pain catastrophizing (OR = 0.93), perceived workload (OR = 0.93), and higher pain acceptance (OR = 1.11), life control (OR = 1.62) and pain self-efficacy (OR = 1.09) compared to sick-listed workers following rehabilitation, even after controlling for confounders. The groups did not differ on physical activity level, active coping and work satisfaction. Group status was predicted best by pain intensity, duration of pain, pain acceptance, perceived workload, mental health, and psychological distress (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.87-0.95).
CONCLUSIONS: A wide range of characteristics of workers who stay at work despite CMP were explored. Relevant differences from sick-listed workers with CMP were observed in all domains of the bio-psycho-social model. Six main predictors were identified that best discriminate between both groups."
22454412,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22454412/,"PURPOSE: Many oncology clinical trials departments (CTDs) are in serious fiscal deficit and their sustainability is in jeopardy. This study investigates whether the payment models used to fund industry versus cooperative group trials contribute to the fiscal deficit of a CTD.
METHODS: We examined the lifetime costs of all cooperative group and industry trials activated in the CTD of a cancer center between 2007 and 2011. A trial's lifetime is defined as being from the date the first patient was accrued until the last patient's actual or projected final follow-up visit. For each trial, we calculated the lifetime monthly net income, which was defined as monthly revenue minus monthly costs. Data sources included study protocols, trial budgets, and accrual data.
RESULTS: Of the 97 trials analyzed, 64 (66%) were cooperative group trials. The pattern of lifetime net income for cooperative group trials has a positive peak during patient accrual followed by a negative trough during follow-up. In contrast, the pattern for industry trials resembled an ""l"" shape. The patterns reflect the differing payment models: upfront lump-sum payments (cooperative group) versus milestone payments (industry).
CONCLUSION: The negative trough in the lifetime net income of a cooperative group trial occurs because follow-up costs are typically not funded or are underfunded. CTDs accrue more patients in new trials to offset that deficit. The CTD uses revenue from accrual to existing trials to cross-subsidize past trials in follow-up. As the number of patients on follow-up increases, the fiscal deficit grows larger each year, perpetuating the cycle."
22455254,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22455254/,"BACKGROUND: Placement of nasogastric tube is common surgical practice after bowel anastomosis. What is to be achieved by this prophylaxis is gastric decompression, a decreased likelihood of nausea and vomiting, decreased distension, less chance of pulmonary aspiration and pneumonia, less risk of wound separation and infection, less chance of fascial dehiscence and hernia, earlier return of bowel function and earlier discharge from hospital. We conducted a prospective observational study in Surgical Ward 2, Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, Karachi from January 2008 to December 2009 to assess whether routine use of nasogastric decompression in elective enteric anastomosis can be safely omitted.
METHOD: Patients who underwent elective enteric anastomosis were included in this study. These patients were managed prospectively without nasogastric decompression. Outcome were measured in terms of time of passing flatus, nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, pulmonary complications, wound infection, wound dehiscence, anastomotic leak, length of hospital stay and mortality.
RESULTS: Except for incidence of minor symptoms like nausea or vomiting, omission of NG tube did not lead to any serious complication like anastomotic leak, pulmonary complications wound dehiscence or death.
CONCLUSION: Nasogastric decompression can safely be omitted from a routine part of postoperative care after elective enteric anastomosis."
22455266,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22455266/,"BACKGROUND: Higher BMI in child hood is also associated with an increase risk for coronary heart disease in adulthood. Impaired glucose tolerance is highly prevalent in children and adolescents with severe obesity. Positive correlations between BMI and glucose, lipids and BP have previously been reported. The objective of this study was to find the correlation of BMI with cholesterol and sugar level in general population.
METHODS: This study was a part of 'Peshawar Heart Study', performed at Cardiology Department, Lady Reading Hospital, Peshawar in 2008-2009. Individuals with different ages, gender, professions, socioeconomic class were randomly selected from general population. Random blood sugar and cholesterol was measured with strip method. Height and weight of each individual was recorded and BMI calculated. All individuals were asked about any current medical illness and whether they were performing any exercise or not. Using SPSS-13, descriptive statistics were used for frequencies. Bivariate correlations were used for measuring correlation between BMI, sugar and cholesterol. Partial correlations were used to factor out the effect of other variables.
RESULTS: A total of 2,270 individuals, 1,798 (79.2%) male and 472 (20.8%) female were examined. Mean age was 38.47 +/- 12.66. Mean BMI was 26.38 +/- 4.97. Mean RBS was 113.7 +/- 47.145. Mean cholesterol was 168.47 +/- 28.23. Exercise was performed by 929 (40.90%) individuals. Diabetes was present in 113 (5.0%) and history of high cholesterol in 25 (1.1%) persons. When bivariate correlation analysis were done systolic BP, diastolic BP, RBS and cholesterol had positive correlation with BMI [correlation coefficient of 0.317 (p < 0.000), 0.319 (p < 0.000), 0.125 (p < 0.000) and 0.205 (p < 0.000) respectively]. These variables also showed a positive correlation among themselves. After factoring out the effects of age, exercise, gender and current medical status on the above correlations, the correlation of RBS and cholesterol with BMI decreased to 0.025 (p = 0.232) and 0.135 (p < 0.000) respectively and between sugar and cholesterol decreased to 0.018 (p = 0.401).
CONCLUSION: In general population BMI is positively correlated with RBS and cholesterol. With the effect of age, sex, exercise and current medical status, this correlation is reduced."
22455320,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22455320/,"OBJECTIVES: This survey explores how physicians perceive chronic non-cancer pain, and examines their opinions on current treatment options.
METHODOLOGY: The computer-based survey comprises a questionnaire that is completed by physicians, mostly at professional conferences and congresses, but also online. The focus is on pain specialists, primary care physicians and other specialists (such as neurologists and rheumatologists), to discover any differences in their approach to treating chronic non-cancer pain.
RESULTS: No common understanding existed of where severe pain starts on an 11-point Numeric Rating Scale. Overall, two-thirds of respondents aim for treatment to reduce pain intensity to an NRS score of 2-4, with primary care physicians tending to aim for lower scores. All three groups considered reduction of pain to be the most important treatment goal, followed by quality of life. Asked to rank the most important factors when choosing an analgesic agent to treat severe, chronic non-cancer pain, respondents ranked efficacy first, tolerability second, and quality of life third. In each rank, more primary care physicians chose these options than in the specialist groups. More pain specialists used classical strong opioids often or very often - and for longer - than did physicians in the other two groups. Nausea/vomiting, bowel dysfunction and somnolence were ranked the first, second and third main reasons, respectively, for treatment failure with these agents. Over 90% of respondents used combination treatment rather than monotherapy to treat severe, chronic pain, but no fewer than 176 different combinations were cited.
CONCLUSIONS: Pain reduction and improvement in quality of life are the most important treatment goals. Wide variation in treatment indicates that no single drug is particularly good for managing chronic pain, and suggests that current treatment is not evidence-based. Differences between the groups imply that first-line treatment is more cautious and conventional. The key limitations of this survey include its small sample size, informal implementation and lack of detail regarding the respondents surveyed."
22455528,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22455528/,"AIM: Prevalence and severity of dental caries in 14-year-olds of Northeast Italy were estimated, evaluating the dependence to SES.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: An epidemiological survey was performed among a randomised cluster sample of 560 (290 M and 270 F) 14-year-olds attending secondary schools, to evaluate DMFS following WHO indications. Association between caries occurrence and SES was evaluated in a logistic regression model. To account for high proportion of zero scores (DMFS and DS distribution highly positively skewed) data was moreover modelled with negative binomial regression and zero-inflated models.
RESULTS: Caries prevalence was 63.4% with a mean DMFS of 3.0 ± 3.8. A significant trend between means was observed regarding DS in the different SES levels: z = 2.22 p = 0.03 (occupational level) and z = 3.45 p<0.01 when SES was based on educational level. The Negative Binomial Regression model resulted more appropriate than the Poisson model because the dispersion parameter was significantly different from zero (alpha=1.5, 95% CI=1.3-1.8). Working class status showed significant association with DMFS (p=0.04) while using DS as dependent variable, working class subjects and subjects with medium-low and low educational level, showed a statistically significant association.

METHODS: Patients were randomized to (1) chloramphenicol 0.5%-dexamethasone 0.1%, 1 drop 4 times a day (n=41), or (2) chloramphenicol 0.5%-dexamethasone 0.1%, 1 drop 4 times a day, plus diclofenac 0.1%, 1 drop 3 times a day (n=38). Patients in the second group also received diclofenac 0.1% for 3 days before surgery. Topical treatment was administered for 28 days after phacoemulsification. On postoperative days 1, 14, and 28, best corrected visual acuity, macular thickness, endothelial cell density, and central corneal thickness (CCT) were measured.
RESULTS: The 2 groups did not have a statistically significant difference for CCT, endothelial cell density, macular thickness, and visual acuity at the 3 time points of the follow-up period.
CONCLUSIONS: The addition of diclofenac did not seem to offer any additional benefit after uneventful phacoemulsification."
22455835,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22455835/,"BACKGROUND: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic condition that normally presents high rates of psychiatric comorbidity. Depression, tic disorders and other anxiety disorders are among the most common comorbidities in OCD adult patients. There is evidence that the higher the number of psychiatric comorbidities, the worse the OCD treatment response. However, little is known about the impact of OCD treatment on the outcome of the psychiatric comorbidities usually present in OCD patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of exclusive, conventional treatments for OCD on the outcome of additional psychiatric disorders of OCD patients, detected at baseline.
METHODS: Seventy-six patients with primary OCD admitted to the treatment protocols of the Obsessive-Compulsive Spectrum Disorders Program between July 2007 and December 2009 were evaluated at pre-treatment and after 12 months. Data were analyzed to verify possible associations between OCD treatment response and the outcome of psychiatric comorbidities.
RESULTS: Results showed a significant association between OCD treatment response and improvement of major depression and dysthymia (p-value=0.002), other anxiety disorders (generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, specific phobia, posttraumatic stress disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia and anxiety disorder not otherwise specified) (p-value=0.054) and tic disorders (p-value=0.043).
LIMITATIONS: This is an open, non-blinded study, without rating scales for comorbid conditions. Further research is necessary focusing on the possible mechanisms by which OCD treatment could improve these specific disorders.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that certain comorbid disorders may benefit from OCD-targeted treatment."
22456094,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22456094/,"BACKGROUND: Subsyndromal symptoms of depression (SSD) in patients with schizophrenia are common and clinically important. While treatment of depression in major depressive disorder may partially ameliorate cognitive deficits, the cognitive effects of antidepressant medications in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and SSD are unknown.
METHODS: The goal of this study was to assess the impact of SSD and their treatment on cognition in participants with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder aged ≥40 years. Participants were randomly assigned to a flexible dose treatment with citalopram or placebo augmentation of their current medication for 12 weeks. An ANCOVA compared improvement in the cognitive composite scores, and a linear model determined the moderation of cognition on treatment effects based on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Calgary Depression Rating Scale scores between treatment groups.
RESULTS: There were no differences between the citalopram and placebo groups in changes in cognition. Baseline cognitive status did not moderate antidepressant treatment response.
CONCLUSIONS: Although there are other cogent reasons why SSD in schizophrenia warrant direct intervention, treatment does not substantially affect the level of cognitive functioning. Given the effects of cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia on functional disability, there remains an ongoing need to identify effective means of directly ameliorating them."
22456247,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22456247/,"OBJECTIVE: Although studies have demonstrated that an adolescent's parents and friends both influence adolescent substance use, it is not known whether the parenting experienced by one's friends also affects one's own use. Drawing on conceptions of shared parenting and the tenets of coercion theory, we investigated the extent to which three domains of parenting behaviors (parental knowledge, inductive reasoning, and consistent discipline) influenced the alcohol, cigarette, and marijuana use of not only their own adolescent children but also of members of their adolescents' friendship groups.
METHOD: Analyses of friendship nominations within each of two successive ninth-grade cohorts in 27 Iowa and Pennsylvania schools (N = 7,439 students, 53.6% female) were used to identify 897 friendship groups. Hierarchical logistic regression models were used to examine prospective associations between 9th-grade friendship group-level parenting behaviors and adolescent self-reported alcohol, cigarette, and marijuana use in 10th grade.
RESULTS: Adolescent substance use in 10th grade was significantly related to parenting behaviors of friends' parents, after controlling for adolescents' reports of their own substance use and their own parents' behaviors at the 9th grade level. These associations were particularly strong for parents' knowledge about their children and use of inconsistent discipline strategies. Significant interaction effects indicated that these relationships were strongest when adolescents received positive parenting at home. Some, but not all, of the main effects of friends' parents' parenting became nonsignificant after friends' substance use in ninth grade was included in the model.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that the parenting style in adolescents' friends' homes plays an important role in determining adolescent substance use. Implications of the joint contribution of parents and peers for prevention and intervention are discussed."
22456255,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22456255/,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the moderating effect of protective behavioral strategies on the relationship between negative urgency and alcohol outcomes.
METHOD: Participants were college students who endorsed participating in club/intramural or varsity athletics. The students (N = 234; 73.9% female) completed measures of negative urgency, protective behavioral strategies, alcohol use, and alcohol-related problems. Separate hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted for each subscale of the Protective Behavioral Strategies Scale to test for moderation.
RESULTS: Results indicated that protective behavioral strategies aimed at serious harm reduction moderated the relationship between negative urgency and alcohol use, whereas strategies aimed at avoiding excessive or rapid drinking moderated the relationship between negative urgency and alcohol-related problems. Strategies that involved planning drinking activities in advance did not moderate the relationship between negative urgency and alcohol outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: The current investigation provides further evidence for the role of protective behavioral strategies against known risk factors for alcohol use and related problems. Further, the paper suggests that type of strategy used matters when attempting to mitigate the relationship between negative urgency and alcohol outcomes. Limitations and future directions are discussed."
22456465,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22456465/,"BACKGROUND: adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a major cause of morbidity and healthcare utilisation in older people. The GerontoNet ADR risk score aims to identify older people at risk of ADRs during hospitalisation. We aimed to assess the clinical applicability of this score and identify other variables that predict ADRs in hospitalised older people.
METHODS: we prospectively studied 513 acutely ill patients aged ≥65 years. The GerontoNet ADR risk score was calculated for all patients. ADRs were identified through patient and physician consultation together with analysis of case notes. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to test the ability of the GerontoNet risk score to predict ADRs. Multivariate logistic regression examined the influence of individual variables on the presence of ADRs.
RESULTS: in-hospital ADRs were identified in 135 patients (26%). The area under the ROC curve was 0.62 (95% CI: 0.57-0.68). Variables which increased ADR risk include (i) renal failure (OR: 1.81, 95% CI: 1.12-2.92), (ii) increasing number of medications (OR: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.02-1.17) (iii) inappropriate medications (OR: 2.40, 95% CI: 1.26-4.50) and (iv) age ≥75 years (OR: 2.12, 95% CI: 1.23-3.70).
CONCLUSION: the GerontoNet ADR risk score incorrectly classified 38% of patients as low risk. Inappropriate medications and increasing age also contribute to ADR risk."
22456655,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22456655/,"BACKGROUND: Moderate alcohol consumption has been shown to be positively associated with increased bone mineral density (BMD). However, other lifestyle choices have also been shown to have an effect on bone health.
OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine the association between alcohol intake and BMD in women around menopause in the United Kingdom and to determine whether any association is independent of other lifestyle choices.
DESIGN: A cross-sectional study design was used to examine the relation between alcohol intake and BMD in a cohort of 3218 women aged 50-62 y from the Aberdeen Prospective Osteoporosis Screening Study. Women were grouped into clusters according to their lifestyle choices. ANCOVA was used to examine the effect of categorized alcohol intake on BMD adjusted for cluster of lifestyle and other baseline covariates. The ANCOVA was repeated for different types of alcoholic beverage (eg, beer, liquor, and wine) separately.
RESULTS: Three lifestyle clusters were identified and were based on different levels of the following 3 factors: smoking pack-years, fruit and vegetable intakes, and physical activity. In the lifestyle-adjusted models, women who consumed >1 drink/d of alcohol had a significantly greater femoral neck BMD (P = 0.008) and lumbar spine BMD (P = 0.007) than did those who never consumed alcohol. For separate alcoholic drinks, only beer had a positive significant effect on lumbar spine BMD after adjustment for lifestyle (P = 0.005).
CONCLUSION: Moderate alcohol intake appears to be positively associated with BMD independently of the type of lifestyle led by women around menopause."
22456690,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22456690/,"BACKGROUND: In clinical practice, individuals at increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are identified on the basis of age, sex, smoking, blood pressure, and serum total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. We examined whether CVD risk prediction improved when obesity (body mass index ≥30 kg/m(2)) and premature (<70 years) parental myocardial infarction (MI) were added to the classical risk factor model.
METHODS: Risk factors were measured in 1993-97 in 12,818 participants (53% female) aged 35-65 in the Dutch MORGEN project. Cases of fatal and nonfatal CVD during 10 years of follow up were identified through record linkage. Classical risk factor equations, obtained by Cox proportional hazard analysis, were extended with obesity, paternal MI, and maternal MI. We calculated the net reclassification index (NRI), a measure for correct reclassification of subjects, to check improvement in risk prediction using 5 and 10% increments in absolute CVD risk.
RESULTS: A CVD event occurred in 280 men and 140 women. Obesity and maternal MI were positively and significantly related to total CVD after adjustment for classical risk factors (both hazard ratios ∼1.5). Adding obesity and parental MI to CVD risk prediction yielded a significant NRI of 4.5% in men and a non-significant NRI of 2.6% in women when 5% risk categories were used. For 10% categories, the NRIs were slightly larger (5.5% and 3.3%, respectively). The improvements in risk prediction were mainly due to obesity.
CONCLUSION: Modest improvements in CVD risk prediction can be obtained when obesity and, to a lesser extent, parental MI are added to the risk function."
22456978,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22456978/,"OBJECTIVE: To examine relationships between work-based cultural activities and mental employee health in working Swedes.
HYPOTHESIS: A positive relationship between frequent cultural activity at work and good employee health was expected.
RESEARCH DESIGN: Random sample of working Swedish men and women in three waves, 2006, 2008 and 2010, on average 60 % participation rate.
METHODS: A postal questionnaire with questions about cultural activities organised for employees and about emotional exhaustion (Maslach) and depressive symptoms (short form of SCL). Employee assessments of ""non-listening manager"" and work environment (""psychological demands"" and ""decision latitude"") as well as socioeconomic variables were covariates. Cross-sectional analyses for each study year as well as prospective analyses for 2006-2008 and 2008-2010 were performed.
MAIN OUTCOME AND RESULTS: Lower frequency of cultural activities at work during the period of high unemployment. The effects of relationships with emotional exhaustion were more significant than those with depressive symptoms. The associations were attenuated when adjustments were made for manager function (does your manager listen?) and demand/control. Associations were more pronounced during the period with low unemployment and high cultural activity at work (2008). In a prospective analysis, cultural activity at work in 2008 had an independent statistically significant ""protective"" effect on emotional exhaustion in 2010. No corresponding such association was found between 2006 and 2008.
CONCLUSIONS: Cultural activities at work vary according to business cycle and have a statistical association with mental employee health, particularly with emotional exhaustion.
IMPLICATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH: There are particularly pronounced statistical protective effects of frequent cultural activity at work on likelihood of emotional exhaustion among employees."
22458272,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22458272/,"BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that metabolic syndrome (MbS) is associated with early senescence of bioprosthetic aortic valve prostheses. The purpose of this study was to determine whether MbS is also associated with accelerated failure of bioprosthetic valves prostheses in the mitral position.
METHODS: Records of all patients undergoing bioprosthetic mitral valve replacement (MVR) from 1993 to 2000 were reviewed.
RESULTS: Of 114 patients undergoing bioprosthetic MVR, 48 (42%) had MbS. Mean age was 73 years (vs. 74 years for no MbS). Patients underwent MVR for regurgitation (n = 97; 85%), stenosis (n = 12; 11%), or mixed lesions (n = 4; 4%). Etiology was degenerative (n = 35; 32%), rheumatic (n = 26; 24%), ischemic (n = 30; 28%), calcific (n = 9; 8%), and endocarditis (n = 8; 8%). Mean follow-up was 4.5 years. Overall survival at 5 and 10 years was 56% and 26%, respectively. Survival was similar between groups (p = 0.15). Five patients (2 MbS; 4% vs. 3 no MbS; 5%) required mitral reoperation at a mean of 3.8 years after initial MVR. The risk of prosthetic valve failure was not different between groups (p = 0.66). Despite no initial difference in transmitral gradients, gradients beyond five-year follow-up were greater for those with MbS (6.8 mmHg MbS vs. 4.7 mmHg no MbS, p = 0.007). Independent predictors of gradient progression beyond two years were MbS (p = 0.027) and female gender (p = 0.012). There were no significant differences in valve area, regurgitation, or ejection fraction.
CONCLUSIONS: Although overall survival following bioprosthetic MVR is challenging, MbS did not predict diminished survival or excess reoperative risk compared to non-MbS patients. The trend toward more rapid progression of transprosthetic gradients in MbS patients warrants further investigation."
22458341,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22458341/,"AIM: This article is a report of a study of associations between occurrence of serious fall-related injuries and implementation of low-low beds at The Northern Hospital, Victoria, Australia.
BACKGROUND: A 9-year evaluation at The Northern Hospital found an important reduction in fall-related injuries after the 6-PACK falls prevention program was implemented. Low-low beds are a key component of the 6-PACK that aims to decrease fall-related injuries.
DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study.
METHODS: Retrospective audit of The Northern Hospital inpatients admitted between 1999-2009. Changes in serious fall-related injuries throughout the period and associations with available low-low beds were analysed using Poisson regression.
RESULTS: During the observation of 356,158 inpatients, there were 3946 falls and 1005 fall-related injuries of which 60 (5·9%) were serious (55 fractures and five subdural haematomas). Serious fall-related injuries declined significantly throughout the period. When there was one low-low bed to nine or more standard beds there was no statistically significant decrease in serious fall-related injuries. An important reduction only occurred when there was one low-low bed to three standard beds.
CONCLUSION: The 6-PACK program has been in place since 2002 at The Northern Hospital. Throughout this time serious fall-related injuries have decreased. There appears to be an association between serious fall-related injuries and the number of available low-low beds. Threshold numbers of these beds may be required to achieve optimal usability and effectiveness. A randomized controlled trial is required to give additional evidence for use of low-low beds for injury prevention in hospitals."
22458907,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22458907/,"CONTEXT: Little has been reported on changes in pancreatic pathology practice after implementation of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA).
OBJECTIVES: We assessed the impact of EUS-FNA on cytologic diagnosis replacing histologic diagnosis for pancreatic disease and determined whether it fulfills Christensen criteria of a disruptive innovation effect.
DESIGN: Pattern of utilization during 20 years, diagnostic categories, and diagnostic accuracy of pancreatic cytology were compared before and after implementation of EUS-FNA. The disruptive effect of cytology relevant to biopsy was assessed by comparing the utilization trends and the accuracy of diagnosis over time.
RESULTS: The mean annual volume (standard deviation) of cytologic specimens increased from 24 (11) to 231 (10) after implementation of EUS-FNA, and that of histologic specimens increased from 97 (42) to 377 (148). The average percentage of annual cases managed by following cytology alone was 19% (10) before versus 51% (8) after implementation. The percentage managed by histology alone was 56% before versus 23% after implementation. Non-endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology decreased from 36% to 1%. Needle biopsies decreased from 7% to 1%, and other biopsy types from 29% to 9%. Unsatisfactory (7% versus 1%), atypical (16% versus 4%), and suspicious (16% versus 3%) diagnoses were significantly reduced. The accuracy of cytologic diagnosis significantly improved: the sensitivity (confidence interval) and specificity (confidence interval) for cancer diagnosis were 55% (38%-70%) and 78% (58%-89%) before versus 88% (84%-91%) and 96% (93%-98%) after implementation, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration improved the accuracy of cytologic diagnosis, reduced the number of indeterminate diagnoses, and replaced the need for tissue biopsy. Given its cost and simplicity as compared with tissue biopsy, this trend represents a disruptive innovation effect."
22458992,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22458992/,"BACKGROUND: Dyskeratosis congenita (DC), an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome (IBMFS), is caused by defects in telomere biology, which result in very short germline telomeres. Telomeres, long nucleotide repeats and a protein complex at chromosome ends, are essential for chromosomal stability. Several association studies suggest that short telomeres are associated with certain psychiatric disorders, including mood disorders and schizophrenia. There are two cases in the literature of schizophrenia and DC occurring as co-morbid conditions. We noted that many patients with DC in our cohort had neuropsychiatric conditions.
METHODS: Subjects were participants in NCI's IBMFS prospective cohort study. Psychiatric evaluation was incorporated into our clinical assessment in January 2009. Fourteen DC or DC-like patients, including six children, were evaluated in this study through in person interview by either a psychiatrist specialized in psychosomatic medicine or a child and adolescent psychiatrist.
RESULTS: Three of the six pediatric subjects and five of the eight adults had a neuropsychiatric condition such as a mood, anxiety, or adjustment disorder, intellectual disability, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or pervasive developmental disorders. The lifetime occurrence of any of these disorders in our study was 83% in pediatric subjects and 88% in adults. Notably, the literature reports neuropsychiatric conditions in 25% and 38% in chronically ill children and adults, respectively.
CONCLUSION: This pilot study suggests that patients with DC may have higher rates of neuropsychiatric conditions than the general population or other chronically ill individuals. This potential link between very short telomeres and neuropsychiatric conditions warrants further study."
22459335,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22459335/,"AIM: To verify whether exercise intensities at the crossover point (COP) and maximal lipid oxidation (Lipox(max)) can be used interchangeably regardless of exercise mode, this study compared COP, Lipox(max) and maximal fat oxidation rate (MFO) obtained during two modes of submaximal metabolic exercise tests: stationary cycling under laboratory conditions and walking/running on a track.
METHODS: After preliminary indirect maximal progressive tests, 15 healthy subjects randomly performed submaximal exercise tests on a stationary cycle ergometer (E) and on a track (T), during which gas exchanges and substrate oxidation rates were measured.
RESULTS: There were no significant mean differences in COP [heart rate (HR): 149±23 beats.min(-1) (T), 145±28 beats.min(-1) (E); VO(2): 2168±896 mL.min(-1) (T), 2052±714 mL.min(-1) (E)], Lipox(max) [HR: 127±27 beats.min(-1) (T), 126±23 beats.min(-1) (E); VO(2): 1638±839 mL.min(-1) (T), 1696±656 mL.min(-1) (E)] or MFO [498.3±192.0 mg.min(-1) (T), 477.7±221.5 mg.min(-1) (E)] between the two modes of exercise. However, Bland-Altman analysis showed a clear disagreement between the two exercise modes and, in particular, a large random error [bias±random error: for COP, -3.5±53.2 beats.min(-1) (HR), -116.8±1556.4 mL.min(-1) (VO(2)); for Lipox(max), -0.4±43.3 beats.min(-1) (HR), -5.7±1286.4 mL.min(-1) (VO(2)); and for MFO, -20.6±384.9 mg.min(-1)].
CONCLUSION: This study showed that, in young, healthy, reasonably fit subjects, exercise mode can affect intensities at the COP and the Lipox(max). These results, which now have to be confirmed in patients with metabolic defects, suggest the need to perform specific tests to make individualized adaptations to physical activity outside of clinical settings."

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of PDUS for the diagnosis of SpA alone or combined with other clinical, laboratory and imaging findings in patients consulting for a suspected SpA.
METHODS: Prospective, multicenter French cohort study (Boulogne-Billancourt, Brest, Caen, Grenoble, Marseille and Nancy). Outpatients consulting for symptoms suggestive of SpA (inflammatory back pain [IBP], arthritis or inflammatory arthralgia [IA], enthesitis or dactylitis [ED], HLA-B27 positive uveitis [B27+U], familiarity for SpA [Fam]) were recruited and followed up for at least 2 years. Sample size was set to 500 patients (for estimated prevalence of SpA of 30±5% after 2 years). At baseline, patients were submitted to standardized physical examination, pelvic X-ray, sacroiliac joints magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), HLA-B typing, and other tests judged useful for diagnosis. For each patient, a blinded PDUS examination of 14 enthesitic sites was performed at baseline and at years 1 and 2. Patients were planned to be followed during 5 years. The diagnosis of SpA ascertained by an experts' committee, blind to PDUS results, after at least 2 years of follow-up, with a revaluation of doubtful patients at 5 years will be used as gold standard for evaluating the diagnostic performance of PDUS and the best diagnostic procedure by combining PDUS, clinical symptoms and other tests.
RESULTS: Between January 2005 and September 2007, 489 patients were included (96% of the target population). Nineteen patients (0.2%) retired their informed consensus or were lost to follow-up immediately after their inclusion. At baseline, mean age of the 470 remaining patients was 40 years, mean duration of symptoms was 6.1 years; 42% of them were HLA-B27+ and 63% were female. Primary inclusion criterion was IBP in 53%, IA in 27%, ED in 9%, B27+U in 8% and Fam in 4%. Follow-up is still ongoing.
CONCLUSION: We have set up a unique diagnostic cohort which includes the entire spectrum of SpA manifestations. By using PDUS we expected to improve the diagnostic procedure of SpA."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-six patients treated with RTCT for HNSCC were included. All patients underwent (18)F-FDG PET-CT at baseline (""staging"" PET-CT), after 2 weeks of treatment (""early"" PET-CT) and 8-12 weeks after treatment (""late"" PET-CT). Changes in FDG uptake in the primary tumor (T) and lymph nodes (N) were correlated with local and regional control, respectively; overall metabolic response was correlated with relapse free survival (RFS) and disease specific survival (DSS).
RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 29.2 months, 19/26 patients were living and 17/19 had no evidence of disease. When comparing ""staging"", ""early"" and ""late"" PET results, a significant decrease of FDG SUV(max) in T and N was documented. When correlating changes in FDG uptake in T and N with local and regional control, a statistically significant correlation only with the ""late"" reduction was found. Statistical analysis failed to demonstrate any correlation between the ""early"" metabolic response and the patient clinical outcome while the ""late"" metabolic response revealed a strong correlation with RFS (p = 0.01) and DSS (p = 0.009).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with HNSCC, PET-CT performed after RTCT predicts the clinical outcome, since it strongly correlates with RFS and DSS. On the other hand, the predictive role of ""early"" metabolic response was not confirmed by this study."

METHODS: This randomized prospective study involved 40 patients, all diagnosed with unilateral UPJO; 20 each were randomly selected to undergo open dismembered pyeloplasty with pelvic reduction (group A) or pelvis-sparing pyeloplasty (group B). Patients were evaluated with ultrasound and DPTA renography scans 6 months postoperatively. Mean follow-up was 9 months.
RESULTS: The mean age in group B was 5.71 ± 6.36 years; in group A it was 4.81 ± 6.78 years. There was a decrease in mean anteroposterior renal pelvic diameter (from 49.9 to 26.35 ± 0.949 mm in A and 50.9 to 30.8 ± 1.556 mm in B) with improvement of split renal function (from 39 ± 22.47% to 42.4 ± 22.13% in A and 34.92 ± 16.79% to 38.8 ± 19.66% in B), glomerular filtration rate (from 37.25 ± 15.33 to 41.7 ± 19.34 ml/min in A and 31.3 ± 18.50 to 38.1 ± 23.23 ml/min in B) and draining curves on the 6-month scans, but without any significant difference between groups (p > 0.05).

DESIGN: A retrospective study.
SETTING: A tertiary care university hospital.
PATIENTS: Five thousand nine hundred ninety-eight patients who underwent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.
INTERVENTIONS: An evaluation of RWMAs recorded with intraoperative TEE before and after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in patients who had coronary angiography for suspected postoperative myocardial ischemia based on electrocardiogram (ECG), CK-MB, troponin T, hemodynamic compromise, low cardiac output, and malignant ventricular arrhythmia. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, odds ratio, 95% confidence interval, and chi-square analysis were used.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients (0.7%) underwent early coronary angiography for the suspicion of early graft dysfunction. Of the 32 patients with diagnosed early graft dysfunction, 5 patients (15.6%) had shown new intraoperative RWMAs as detected by TEE, 21 patients (65.6%) had no new RWMAs, no report was available in 5 patients (15.6%), and 1 examination (3.1%) was excluded because of poor imaging quality. The sensitivity of TEE to predict graft failure was 15.6%, the specificity was 57.1%, and the positive predictive and negative values were 62.5% and 12.9%, respectively. The odds ratio and 95% confidence interval was 0.1190 (0.0099-1.4257) when TEE was positive compared with coronary angiography. No association was found between new RWMAs detected with TEE and graft failure as documented with coronary angiography (p = 0.106).

Secondarily, how many included clozapine, prevalence in the elderly, high dosage and clinically relevant interactions were also assessed.
METHOD: Clinicodemographic and computerized prescription data on 29th March 2011 were collected. High dosage was defined as more than 1000 mg of chlorpromazine equivalents (CPZeqs). A t test for unpaired measures was applied to compare means of dosage (CPZeq) and age among patients on APP vs. monotherapy. The χ(2) test was applied to compare proportions of patients on a high dose on APP vs. monotherapy. GraphPad Prism 5 software was used to perform statistical analysis.
RESULTS: From 201 patients admitted on 29th March, 172 had any antipsychotic prescription. APP prevalence was 47.1%, corresponding almost to 24% of elderly patients. Quetiapine was the drug most prescribed in combination, achieving a prevalence rate of 56.8%. Clozapine was not included in 67% of all combinations. Supporting evidence for two-drug combinations was only found for 6 of the 10 most prescribed. Relevant interactions were found in 12 patients on APP. The mean CPZeq dose and percentage of patients on high dosage were significantly higher in the APP than in the monotherapy group (1162±776.1 mg vs. 455.4±369.3 mg; 54% vs. 9%, respectively; P<.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that APP was being considered earlier in the management plan than what guidelines recommend. This practice was associated with higher total antipsychotic doses. Until further clinical trials are available, a wise APP practice will require a thoughtful choice of products guided by patient's prior history and interaction liability, a proper consent by the patients or their representatives and a careful monitoring of clinical outcomes and emerging side effects in order to avoid indefinite administration of ineffective and potentially harmful combinations."
22460052,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22460052/,"PURPOSE: To assess the value and feasibility of computed tomographic gastrography and multiplanar reformatting in the preoperative evaluation of patients undergoing laparoscopic gastric resection.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients with gastric lesions were included in the study. A supine scan was performed after a hypotonic drug, an effervescent agent, and intravenous contrast. This was followed by delayed prone and decubitus scans. We created multiplanar reformats, transparency rendered images, and endoluminal images. The tumours were localized, and distances were measured to the esophagogastric junction and the pylorus.
RESULTS: Eleven patients underwent resections. Seven had laparoscopic wedge resections for aberrant pancreas (1 patient), carcinoid (1), Castleman disease (1), and gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) (4). One patient had an open subtotal gastrectomy for carcinoma due to adhesions. One had a hand-assisted sleeve resection for a gastrointestinal stromal tumour. Two had hand-assisted total gastrectomies for carcinoma and a GIST. For surgical planning, the surgeon rated the imaging extremely useful in 7 and useful in 4. Imaging was extremely useful or useful to localize laparoscopically invisible tumours in 6 patients and to relate tumours to the esophagogastric junction or pylorus and to assess localized vs extensive resection in 8. Correlation was excellent between the preoperative imaging and the intraoperative findings.
CONCLUSIONS: Computed tomographic gastrography and multiplanar reformatting are useful aids in preoperative planning of laparoscopic gastric resections."
22460087,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22460087/,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, pimecrolimus 1% cream has been demonstrated to reduce symptoms of atopic dermatitis in patients when applied topically.
MATERIAL/METHODS: In our study we compared the therapeutic effects of local 1% pimecrolimus to 1% hydrocortisone, and to a control group in a mouse model with atopic dermatitis in the external ear canals. Atopic dermatitis was created by application of Dinitrochlorobenzene in the external ear canals of mice. The development of atopic dermatitis was detected by clinical observation score and determination of total serum IgE levels. Pimecrolimus and hydrocortisone cream were topically applied to the external ear canal skin once a day for 14 days.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the hydrocortisone and the pimecrolimus therapy groups, while there was a statistically significant difference between these 2 groups and the control group (p<0.05) Assessment of the clinical observation scoring carried out on the 14th day of therapy revealed that there was no difference between the hydrocortisone and pimecrolimus groups. Biopsies were taken on the 14th day following treatment. Tissue samples were histologically evaluated; contact dermatitis was observed microscopically in the control group, but in the therapy groups only minimal evidence of contact dermatitis was found.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study reveal that the therapeutic efficacy of 1% pimecrolimus was equivalent to 1% hydrocortisone treatment in the artificially developed atopic dermatitis model in external ear canals of mice. These results clearly demonstrate that 1% pimecrolimus cream can be an effective alternative therapeutic agent in cases where steroid treatment proves to be insufficient or in cases where treatment must be discontinued due to its adverse effects."
22460305,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22460305/,"PURPOSE: We evaluated the effect of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) on disease-free survival in patients with stages I to III colorectal cancer (CRC).
METHODS: There were 3857 patients identified from our database. We used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to identify the best cutoff value of NLR. A 5-year disease-free survival was used as end point. Survival analysis was used to assess the NLR effect, after stratification by several clinopathologic factors.
RESULTS: In the ROC analysis, NLR = 3 had the highest sensitivity and specificity. Elevated NLR (>3) in colon cancer seemed to accompany larger tumor size (~5 cm) and more advanced T stage. By multivariate analysis, elevated NLR in colon cancer was associated with an increased risk of disease progression or cancer death [hazard ratio (HR) 1.377, 95  % confidence interval 1.104-1.717, P = 0.014]. However, elevated NLR in rectal cancer lost its significance in multivariate analysis (HR 1.121, 95  % confidence interval 0.941-1.336, P = 0.200). Patients with elevated NLR had worse outcome, especially for colon cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative NLR influenced the disease-free survival in patients with stages I to III CRC. Elevated NLR (>3) was associated with worse outcome (5-year disease-free survival 66.3  % vs. 78.9  % in colon cancer, P < 0.001; 60. 5 % vs. 66.2  % in rectal cancer, P = 0.008). The difference was larger in colon cancer than in rectal cancer. NLR should be considered as a prognostic factor for stages I to III CRC patients after curative surgery."
22460373,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22460373/,"PURPOSE: To explore which measures could predict the persistency of developmental language impairment (DLI) based on the association between the initial language assessment and the therapeutic prognosis of the child.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, the records of 42 children with diagnosis of DLI were analyzed. Participants' age varied from 21 to 63 months at the first language assessment, which included vocabulary, phonology, pragmatics and fluency tests. The performance of subjects in each test was scored from 0 to 4, based on the severity of the deficits, and the maximum score corresponded to age-adequate performance. As prognostic measure, we accounted the length of therapy (in sessions) of patients who were discharged, were referred to another service (because the deficits had become very mild), or remained in therapy (persistent language difficulties).
RESULTS: There was association between initial assessment (normal or mild alterations for vocabulary and pragmatics abilities) and prognosis (<135 therapeutic sessions). Vocabulary was the only variable able to predict the length of therapy. Being classified as severe in this measure caused the estimate of treatment to increase, in average, 112 sessions.
CONCLUSION: The first vocabulary assessment can contribute to predict the child's therapeutic prognosis. This finding is clinically and scientifically relevant to Speech-Language Pathology, since it offers an auxiliary resource to the prognosis and therapeutic planning in cases of DLI."
22460441,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22460441/,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To determine if the various imaging modalities for distant metastasis (DM) diagnosis alters life expectancy in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective.
METHODS: One hundred seventy patients (mean age, 59.1 years; male:female, 135:35) with HNSCC who developed DM were reviewed. The main outcome measures were the method of DM diagnosis and time from DM diagnosis to death while controlling for clinical parameters (age, gender, tobacco status, primary tumor site, initial TNM classification, number and site of DM, administration of palliative chemotherapy).
RESULTS: Tumor subsites were: 40 oral cavity, 75 oropharynx, 36 larynx, 10 hypopharynx, one nasopharynx, and eight unknown primary. Of the patients, 16.5% (28/170) had distant metastasis at presentation; the remaining 142 patients were diagnosed with DM at a median of 324 days from diagnosis. Although patients diagnosed with DM by positron-emission tomography (PET) scan were more likely to have multiple DM sites (P = .0001), there were no differences in life expectancy in patients who were diagnosed with or without PET scan (median, 185 vs. 165 days, P = .833). There were no differences in life expectancy based on age, gender, site of primary tumor, or number/site of DM. The use of palliative chemotherapy resulted in a significantly longer life expectancy (median, 285 vs. 70 days; P = .001).
CONCLUSIONS: Although a PET scan is more likely to diagnose multiple DM sites, there was no difference in life expectancy based on imaging modality. Patients who are symptomatic from their distant metastasis have a worse life expectancy, and palliative chemotherapy was able to increase life expectancy, even in patients who were symptomatic from the distant metastasis."
22460572,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22460572/,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: ERCP is the most common procedure for the diagnosis and treatment of bile duct and pancreatic disease, but Post-ERCP pancreatitis makes poor outcome in some cases. The protease inhibitors, nafamostat and gabexate, have been used to prevent pancreatitis related to ERCP, but there is some debate. We tried to evaluate the efficacy of gabexate and nafamostat for the prevention of post-ERCP pancreatitis.
METHODS: Two hundred forty two patients (73 patients in the gabexate group, 88 patients in the nafamostat group and 81 patients in the placebo group) were included in the study after selective exclusion. The incidence of pancreatitis after ERCP was compared among groups.
RESULTS: The incidence of pancreatitis were 6.8% in the gabexate group, 5.7% in the nafamostat group and 6.2% in the placebo group (p=0.954).
CONCLUSIONS: There was no meaningful difference among the gabexate, nafamostat and placebo group."
22460742,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22460742/,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of topical intranasal fluorescence application together with high-resolution computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging and/or magnetic resonance cisternography for the preoperative diagnosis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage and for intraoperative localization of CSF fistulas. We also assessed postoperative recurrence.
STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive study.
METHODS: Twenty-four cases underwent endonasal endoscopic repair for CSF leakage. Following intranasal topical application of fluorescein 10% to the middle turbinate-cribriform plate region and anterior wall of the sphenoid sinus, a color change of the fluorescein from yellow-brown to green was accepted as evidence of CSF leakage. A nasoseptal flap, collagen matrix, or fascia lata and septal cartilage graft were used for reconstruction of the CSF fistula.
RESULTS: The use of topical fluorescein application was helpful in diagnosing CSF rhinorrhea preoperatively and locating the CSF fistula intraoperatively. One case had both ethmoid roof and sphenoid sinus defects, and this case underwent a second operation for closure of the sphenoid defect. All CSF leakages were successfully repaired by endoscopic endonasal surgery using a nasoseptal flap.
CONCLUSIONS: Cases with traumatic CSF leakage pose a higher risk of meningitis than the cases with spontaneous CSF leakage. Topical application of fluorescein is highly specific and sensitive in identifying preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative CSF leakage. It is a simple, quick, and sensitive technique. The surgeon should be vigilant for multiple defects."
22461018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22461018/,"BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIM: Currently colonoscopy quality indicators emphasize our ability to improve polyp detection (e.g., preparation quality, withdrawal times of ≥6 min). The completeness of a polyp resection may also be an important determinant of quality and efficient colonoscopy. The primary aim of this study was to determine the incidence of an incomplete polyp resection despite a perceived complete polypectomy.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective quality assurance project conducted at the San Diego Veterans Affair Medical Center and University of California San Diego Medical Center from July 2007 to April 2008. The patients recruited to this study were undergoing surveillance and screening colonoscopy. The resection quality was evaluated in 65 polyps of 47 patients. Twenty-two polyps were removed with standard biopsy forceps, jumbo forceps (18), hot snare (18), and cold snare (7). Biopsies were taken from the post-polypectomy site base and perimeter for histologic examination in order to confirm histologic absence of all polypoid appearing mucosa.
RESULTS: The post-polypectomy sites of ten polyps (15%) were found to have residual polypoid tissue. Six were removed by standard biopsy forceps, jumbo forceps (2), hot snare (1), and cold snare (1). When compared to other polypectomy devices, standard biopsy forceps were more likely to result in an incomplete resection (27 vs. 9%; P = 0.076).
CONCLUSIONS: The endoscopist may not be visually accurate in determining when a polyp is completely resected, and alternative devices and techniques for polyp resection should be considered."
22461170,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22461170/,"OBJECTIVES: Public reporting and transparency of patient experience is an emerging national healthcare priority. The objectives of this report are to describe patient satisfaction scores in ambulatory otolaryngology and examine the association of teaching status across multiple service domains.
STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional patient-level analysis of Press Ganey outpatient medical practice surveys completed by otolaryngology patients in fiscal year 2010.
METHODS: The survey contains 29 Likert-scaled items that comprise an overall score and scores in six service domains: access, visit, nursing, care provider, personal issues, and assessment. The item ""likelihood-to-recommend practice"" was measured as an indicator of patient loyalty. Surveys were grouped according to teaching or nonteaching setting. Mean scores were compared by Kruskal-Wallis rank test for nonparametric data with Bonferroni's correction for multiple comparisons. A dichotomous variable (ALL-5s) was created to measure percentages of surveys with highest scores in each domain. Multivariate logistic regression adjusting for sex, age, geographical region, urban-rural status, and first visit was performed to evaluate the association of teaching status with ALL-5s in each domain. Pearson correlation (r) was used to evaluate correlation of individual survey items to the ""likelihood-to-recommend practice"" question.
RESULTS: A total of 36,089 surveys were included, of which 16,057 (44%) were from a teaching setting. The mean age of respondents was 54.1 years (range, 0-90 years), and 52.7% were female. Patients seen in the teaching setting had lower mean scores overall and in domains of access, visit, and personal issues (P = .004) but had higher mean scores for likelihood-to-recommend practice (P = .007). No differences were identified between groups in domains of nursing, care provider, and assessment. Multivariate analysis of association of teaching setting with ALL-5s demonstrated that patients in a teaching setting were more likely to have the highest scores (ALL-5s) in the domain of nursing (OR, 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.16; P = .002) and for the loyalty question of ""likelihood-to-recommend practice"" (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.05-1.19; P = .001), and less likely to have highest scores for the overall survey (OR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.83-0.93; P < .001) and domains of access (OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.84-0.94;P < .001) and visit (OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.85-0.94; P < .001). No association was identified between teaching status and domains of care provider, personal issues, and assessment. Survey items correlated with likelihood-to-recommend practice were similar between groups. Items most closely correlated with loyalty were all within the care provider domain consisting of ""likelihood-to-recommend care provider"" (r = 0.839), ""confidence in care provider"" (r = 0.785), and ""concern care provider showed"" (r = 0.733; P < .001). Items least closely correlated were within the visit domain related to waiting room comfort (r = 0.467), registration speed (r = 0.447), and wait time (r = 0.432; P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: Otolaryngology patients evaluated in the teaching setting report lower patient satisfaction overall, primarily related to access to care and visit-specific processes; however, they are more likely to display loyalty and recommend their practice and care provider. The teaching setting does not influence care provider satisfaction scores. Because practice loyalty is most closely correlated to provider-specific behaviors, otolaryngologists may consider enhancement of provider-patient communication to improve patient satisfaction regardless of the practice setting. Academic otolaryngology practices should consider focusing on access systems and process improvement to enhance the overall patient experience."
22461371,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22461371/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a Lasmar score obtained entirely by the use of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound provides results similar to those obtained using the original hysteroscopic technique.
METHODS: This was a prospective study performed on a series of patients presenting with symptomatic submucous fibroids and scheduled for hysteroscopic myomectomy. Ultrasound Lasmar scores were obtained by a single physician, a specialist in ultrasonography, in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. 3D images were evaluated by offline examination using multiplanar analysis. Classical Lasmar scores were obtained by a different physician, a specialist in hysteroscopy, during the follicular phase of the subsequent cycle. Surgery was performed by a third physician in the follicular phase who also reported a Lasmar score, which we considered as the gold standard. The concordance between group classifications (I-III, relating to difficulty of hysteroscopic resection) according to the three methods used to obtain the Lasmar score (ultrasound, classical and surgery) was calculated using Cohen's κ statistic.
RESULTS: Thirty-four women, with a mean age of 43 ± 4.9 years, were enrolled in the study. Thirty-six submucous fibroids were identified by both ultrasound and diagnostic hysteroscopy. The mean diameter of fibroids evaluated was 28 ± 13.2 mm. The concordance between the three methods of classifying patients according to Lasmar score was high: classical vs. surgery, κ = 0.88; ultrasound vs. surgery, κ = 0.93; and classical vs. ultrasound, κ = 0.77.
CONCLUSION: The Lasmar score can be obtained solely by ultrasound examination performed in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, avoiding office hysteroscopy without a loss of diagnostic accuracy."
22461655,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22461655/,"AIM: To assess the prevalence of acquired diverticulum of the appendix (DA), including incipient forms and its possible significance as a marker of local/regional neoplasms.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The pathology database at Hvidovre Hospital was searched for appendix specimens, received between 2001 and 2010, coded for DA or for a space-occupying lesion. Slides were reviewed to determine DA status and the nature of lesions possibly causing DA.
RESULT: Among 4413 appendix specimens, DA were identified in 39 (0.9%, CI 0.6% to 1.2%) cases, 17 (43.6%, 28.0% to 59.2%) of which additionally harboured an appendiceal neoplasm/neoplastic precursor, whereas this figure was 1.2% (CI 0.9% to 1.6%) for non-DA specimens (p<0.0001). Six of the 39 DA specimens comprised incipient DA, three of which coexisted with appendiceal neoplasms. In addition, local/regional non-neoplastic lesions (six cases) and colorectal carcinomas (four cases) coexisted with DA.
CONCLUSION: DA has significance as a putative marker of local/regional neoplasms. Therefore, a DA specimen proved significantly more likely to harbour a neoplastic growth than a non-DA counterpart. Submission for microscopy of the entire DA specimen, whether transmural or only incipient, and a comment in the pathology report on the occasional concurrence of local/regional neoplasms in this setting seem appropriate. The observation of DA may thus provide a valuable contribution in the diagnostic process."
22461715,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22461715/,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of using birth attendants instead of bereaved mothers as perinatal verbal autopsy respondents.
METHODS: Verbal autopsy interviews for early neonatal deaths and stillbirths were conducted separately among mothers (reference standard) and birth attendants in 38 communities in four developing countries. Concordance between maternal and attendant responses was calculated for all questions, for categories of questions and for individual questions. The sensitivity and specificity of individual questions with the birth attendant as respondent were assessed.
FINDINGS: For early neonatal deaths, concordance across all questions was 94%. Concordance was at least 95% for more than half the questions on maternal medical history, birth attendance and neonate characteristics. Concordance on any given question was never less than 80%. Sensitivity and specificity varied across individual questions, more than 80% of which had a sensitivity of at least 80% and a specificity of at least 90%. For stillbirths, concordance across all questions was 93%. Concordance was 95% or greater more than half the time for questions on birth attendance, site of delivery and stillborn characteristics. Sensitivity and specificity varied across individual questions. Over 60% of the questions had a sensitivity of at least 80% and over 80% of them had a specificity of at least 90%. Overall, the causes of death established through verbal autopsy were similar, regardless of respondent.
CONCLUSION: Birth attendants can substitute for bereaved mothers as verbal autopsy respondents. The questions in existing harmonized verbal autopsy questionnaires need further refinement, as their sensitivity and specificity differ widely."
22461900,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22461900/,"OBJECTIVE: The 7th edition of AJCC staging manual implicitly states that only T1 and T2 lesions that lack regional lymph node metastasis but have tumor deposit(s) will be classified in addition as N1c, though it is not consistent in that pN1c is also an option for pT3/T4a tumors in the staging table. Nevertheless, in this TNM classification, how to classify tumor deposits (TDs) in colorectal cancer patients with lymph node metastasis (LNM) and TDs simultaneously is still not clear. The aim of this study is to investigate the possibility of counting TDs as metastatic lymph nodes in TNM classification and to identify its prognostic value for colorectal cancer patients.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In this retrospective study, 513 cases of colorectal cancer with LNM were reviewed. We proposed a novel pN (npN) category in which TDs were counted as metastatic lymph nodes in the TNM classification. Cancer-specific survival according to the npN or pN category was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify significant prognostic factors. Harrell's C statistic was used to test the predictive capacity of the prognostic models. The results revealed that the TD was a significant prognostic factor in colorectal cancer. Univariate and multivariate analyses uniformly indicated that the npN category was significantly correlated with prognosis. The results of Harrell's C statistical analysis demonstrated that the npN category exhibited a superior predictive capacity compared to the pN category of the 7th edition TNM classification. Moreover, we also found no significant prognostic differences in patients with or without TD in the same npN categories.
CONCLUSIONS: The counting of TDs as metastatic lymph nodes in the TNM classification system is potentially superior to the classification in the 7th edition of the TNM staging system to assess prognosis and survival for colorectal cancer patients."
22462331,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22462331/,"AIM: The sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was firstly introduced by Giuliano and co. in 1994 for the treatment of breast cancer; in comparison to the axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), the sentinel lymph node biopsy has shown both a lower morbidity and acceptable distance results. We want to show that this technique is reliable and should be used routinely in selected cases.
MATERIALS OF STUDY: The study on the sentinel lymph node has been carried out, prior informed consent, in 128 patients aged between 27 and 80 years and suffering from non-multicentric infiltrating breast carcinoma, with a diameter not greater than 3 cm, clinically negative axillary, and hospitalized from January 1998 to September 2005 at the Department of Gerontology, Geriatrics and Metabolic Diseases of the Second University of the Study of Naples. For the recruitment of patients subjected to the sentinel lymph node research study, we have respected the inclusion criteria.
RESULTS: Histological examination of the tumor revealed 95 cases of ductal carcinoma, 16 cases of mucinus carcinoma, 13 of lobular carcinoma and 4 of medullary carcinoma. The sentinel lymph node was detected through lymphoscintigraphy in 96.9% of the cases (124 patients), whereas it was not possible to identify it in 4 patients (3.1% of the cases), 2 of which had previously been subject to excision biopsy.
DISCUSSION: The SLNB is characterized by an identification rate of SLN > 90% with a false negative rate less than 5%. In our study we have found an SLN identification rate of 96.9% with false-negative rates of 3.9%. Our data show that in only 6,3% of the patients (4 non- identified and 4 false-negative cases) it was necessary to perform ALND because the SLN resulted positive; however no metastasis were observed in level III lymph nodes.
CONCLUSIONS: Since its inception, the sentinel lymph node technique has gained an increasingly important role in the conservative treatment of the breast carcinoma due to the short duration of the surgery, the decrease of post-operative pain, the risk of lymphedema onset and hospital confinement, the high predictive power and the diagnostic accuracy. We strongly believe that the sentinel lymph node technique is reliable and should be used routinely in selected cases."
22462571,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22462571/,"OBJECT: Pedicle subtraction osteotomy (PSO) is a surgical procedure that is frequently performed on patients with sagittal spinopelvic malalignment. Although it allows for substantial spinopelvic realignment, suboptimal realignment outcomes have been reported in up to 33% of patients. The authors' objective in the present study was to identify differences in radiographic profiles and surgical procedures between patients achieving successful versus failed spinopelvic realignment following PSO.
METHODS: This study is a multicenter retrospective consecutive PSO case series. The authors evaluated 99 cases involving patients who underwent PSO for sagittal spinopelvic malalignment. Because precise cutoffs of acceptable residual postoperative sagittal vertical axis (SVA) values have not been well defined, comparisons were focused between patient groups with a postoperative SVA that could be clearly considered either a success or a failure. Only cases in which the patients had a postoperative SVA of less than 50 mm (successful PSO realignment) or more than 100 mm (failed PSO realignment) were included in the analysis. Radiographic measures and PSO parameters were compared between successful and failed PSO realignments.
RESULTS: Seventy-nine patients met the inclusion criteria. Successful realignment was achieved in 61 patients (77%), while realignment failed in 18 (23%). Patients with failed realignment had larger preoperative SVA (mean 217.9 vs 106.7 mm, p < 0.01), larger pelvic tilt (mean 36.9° vs 30.7°, p < 0.01), larger pelvic incidence (mean 64.2° vs 53.7°, p < 0.01), and greater lumbar lordosis-pelvic incidence mismatch (-47.1° vs -30.9°, p < 0.01) compared with those in whom realignment was successful. Failed and successful realignments were similar regarding the vertebral level of the PSO, the median size of wedge resection 22.0° (interquartile range 16.5°-28.5°), and the numerical changes in pre- and postoperative spinopelvic parameters (p > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with failed PSO realignments had significantly larger preoperative spinopelvic deformity than patients in whom realignment was successful. Despite their apparent need for greater correction, the patients in the failed realignment group only received the same amount of correction as those in the successfully realigned patients. A single-level standard PSO may not achieve optimal outcome in patients with high preoperative spinopelvic sagittal malalignment. Patients with large spinopelvic deformities should receive larger osteotomies or additional corrective procedures beyond PSOs to avoid undercorrection."
22462579,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22462579/,"BACKGROUND: The metabolic syndrome is associated with increased risk for both diabetes and coronary artery disease, which insulin resistance alone does not satisfactorily explain. We propose an additional and complementary underlying mechanism of glucocorticoid resistance.
RESULTS: Using acanthosis nigricans (AN) and skin vasoconstrictor (SVC) response to topically applied beclomethasone dipropionate as markers of insulin and glucocorticoid resistance, respectively, we compared anthropometric, biochemical, pro-inflammatory markers and the SVC response in subjects with AN in two studies: STUDY 1 was used to compare subjects with AN (Grade 4, n = 32), with those without AN (n = 68) while STUDY 2 compared these responses among a cross-section of diabetic patients (n = 109) with varying grades of AN (grade 0, n = 30; grade 1, n = 24; grade 2, n = 18; grade 3, n = 25; grade 4, n = 12).
FINDINGS: In both studies there was an inverse relationship between AN Grade 4 and the SVC response, (P < 0.001). In STUDY 1, AN Grade 4 was associated with age, waist circumference, BMI, fasting blood glucose, plasma lipids and hs-CRP (P < 0.05). SVC was an independent predictor of CRP and those with combined AN and a negative SVC response, CRP levels were highest. In Study 2 when the SVC response in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus with varying degrees of AN was studied, it showed that for any degree of AN, the SVC response is more likely to be negative and was independent of gender and ethnicity.
CONCLUSION: An absent SVC response represents a new biomarker for the metabolic syndrome and the exaggerated inflammatory response, which characterizes the metabolic syndrome, may be an outcome of deficient glucocorticoid action in vascular tissue."
22462658,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22462658/,"BACKGROUND: To maximize their fitness, parents are assumed to allocate their resources optimally between number and size of offspring. Although this fundamental life-history trade-off has been subject to long standing interest, its genetic basis, especially in wild mammals, still remains unresolved. One important reason for this problem is that a large multigenerational pedigree is required to conduct a reliable analysis of this trade-off.
RESULTS: We used the REML-animal model to estimate genetic parameters for litter size and individual birth size for a common Palearctic small mammal, the bank vole (Myodes glareolus). Even though a phenotypic trade-off between offspring number and size was evident, it was not explained by a genetic trade-off, but rather by negative correlations in permanent and temporary environmental effects. In fact, even positive genetic correlations were estimated between direct genetic effects for offspring number and size indicating that genetic variation in these two traits is not necessarily antagonistic in mammals.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results have notable implications for the study of the life-history trade-off between offspring number and size in mammals. The estimated genetic correlations suggest that evolution of offspring number and size in polytocous mammals is not constrained by the trade-off caused by antagonistic selection responses per se, but rather by the opposing correlative selection responses in direct and maternal genetic effects for birth size."

We sought to examine trainees' choices of treatment for psychosis if they had to prescribe it for themselves, their patients, and factors influencing decision-making.
METHODS: Cross-sectional, semi-structured questionnaire-based study.
RESULTS: Of the 726 respondents (response rate = 66%), the majority chose second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) if they had to prescribe it for themselves (n = 530, 93%) or for their patients (n = 546, 94%). The main factor influencing choice was perceived efficacy, 84.8% (n = 475) of trainees stating this was the most important factor for the patient, and 77.8% (n = 404) stating this was the most important factor for their own treatment. Trainees with knowledge of trials questioning use of SGAs (CATIE, CUtLASS, TEOSS) were more likely to choose second-generation antipsychotics than those without knowledge of these trials (χ2 = 3.943; p = 0.047; O.R. = 2.11; 95% C.I. = 1.0-4.48). Regarding psychotherapy, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) was the most popular choice for self (33.1%; n = 240) and patient (30.9%; n = 224). Trainees were significantly more likely to prefer some form of psychotherapy for themselves rather than patients (χ2 = 9.98; p < 0,002; O.R. = 1.54; 95% CIs = 1.18-2.0).
CONCLUSIONS: Trainees are more likely to choose second-generation antipsychotic medication for patients and themselves. Despite being aware of evidence that suggests otherwise, they predominantly base these choices on perceived efficacy."
22463683,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22463683/,"INTRODUCTION: Mental ill-health among children and young adults is a growing public health problem and research into causes involves consideration of family life and gender practice. This study aimed at exploring the association between parents' degree of gender equality in childcare and children's mental ill-health.
METHODS: The population consisted of Swedish parents and their firstborn child in 1988-1989 (N = 118 595 family units) and the statistical method was multiple logistic regression. Gender equality of childcare was indicated by the division of parental leave (1988-1990), and child mental ill-health was indicated by outpatient mental care (2001-2006) and drug prescription (2005-2008), for anxiety and depression.
RESULTS: The overall finding was that boys with gender traditional parents (mother dominance in childcare) have lower risk of depression measured by outpatient mental care than boys with gender-equal parents, while girls with gender traditional and gender untraditional parents (father dominance in childcare) have lower risk of anxiety measured by drug prescription than girls with gender-equal parents.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that unequal parenting regarding early childcare, whether traditional or untraditional, is more beneficial for offspring's mental health than equal parenting. However, further research is required to confirm our findings and to explore the pathways through which increased gender equality may influence child health."
22463782,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22463782/,"BACKGROUND: Candida peritonitis in postoperative patients is an independent predictor of mortality. Empirical early antifungal therapy should be started in these patients, since according to the results of studies in patients with candidemia, this has an impact on the prognosis. The treatment recommended by clinical practice guidelines in patients with haemodynamic instability are candins, but they do not make explicit recommendations for patients with dysfunction of other organs, or high lactate levels.
CASE REPORT: A case of rescue treatment with anidulafungin in a patient with candidemia and Candida glabrata peritonitis postoperative haemodynamically stable, but with an acute renal failure and elevated plasma lactate, is reported. We discuss the antifungal treatment recommendations established by clinical practice guidelines.
CONCLUSIONS: One conclusion based on this case is that the haemodynamic instability as a marker of severe sepsis must be equated with dysfunction of any organ and/or a plasma lactate level ≥ 2.5 mmol/l in order to advocate candins as an antifungal treatment. In addition, it should be emphasised that anidulafungin was effective in a clinically difficult patient with candidemia and Candida peritonitis, even when used as late rescue antifungal treatment."
22464016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22464016/,"BACKGROUND: Tamoxifen is the main recommended adjuvant hormonal treatment for premenopausal women with hormone-responsive early breast cancer. Little data is available on compliance and persistence to tamoxifen intake in younger women.
METHODS: Using the French National Health Insurance System database, we constituted a cohort of 288 women who were diagnosed with breast cancer and received at least one supply of tamoxifen for breast cancer between September 2005 and July 2011. Medical records and mailed questionnaires provided complementary sources of data. Time to treatment discontinuation and associated predictors were studied using techniques for censored data.
RESULTS: Among women who received a prescription of tamoxifen, 6.1% (16) did not fill any prescription. After 2 years of tamoxifen intake, 29.7% (95%confidence interval (CI) 24.1-36.4) had discontinued their treatment; after 3 years this percentage increased to 39.5% (95% CI 32.9-47.0). The risk of treatment discontinuation rose sharply during the 1st year of treatment and remained approximately constant in the second year. After multivariate adjustment, tamoxifen discontinuation increased significantly with low social support (Hazard Ratio (HR) = 2.1; 95%CI 1.2-3.4), and self-reporting of non-compliance behaviour (HR = 2.2; 95% CI 1.3-3.7).
CONCLUSION: The consequences of high treatment discontinuation rates in younger women with long potential life expectancy may be significant. There is an urgent need to acknowledge and tackle compliance issues in the field of oncology, unless we are willing to accept inefficient prescriptions of efficacious drugs."
22464277,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22464277/,"BACKGROUND: Three randomized trials of intra-arterial thrombolysis (IAT) for acute ischemic stroke ≤ 6 hours were conducted without intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV-tPA) treatment of patients in the control groups now known to benefit.
METHODS: The effect of IV-tPA treatment on 130 control subjects in the Prolyse in Acute Cerebral Thromboembolism (PROACT), PROACT II, and Middle Cerebral Artery Embolism Local Fibrinolytic Intervention Trial (MELT) studies was modeled using linearly weighted time-dependent odds ratios (ORs) from pooled IV-tPA trials. In the PROACT trials, the model assumed that 50% (36/73) were treated at 4.5 hours, the median time to arteriography. For MELT, the model assumed treatment at arrival plus 90 minutes based on hospital arrival times obtained from the principal investigator. The OR of 1.31 for all 130 controls (91 presumed treated ≤ 4.5 hours; OR 1.44) was applied to the original control data to derive the adjusted control outcome, and this was compared to the IAT group. Sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Meta-analysis of the original data revealed a statistically significant benefit for IAT (P = .03). After adjustment for the effect of IV-tPA in controls, there was no longer a significant treatment benefit for IAT (P = .26). Loss of significant IAT treatment benefit persisted if either the OR for benefit of IV-tPA or the number of treated controls was more than halved. These 3 randomized trials of IAT for acute ischemic stroke ≤ 6 hours would not likely have shown a benefit if eligible controls had been treated with IV-tPA.
CONCLUSIONS: Whether IAT is superior to IV-tPA in IV-tPA-eligible patients or better than placebo in IV-tPA-ineligible patients remains to be determined."
22464406,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22464406/,"BACKGROUND: Many intrauterine device (IUD) users utilize intravaginal menstrual cups or tampons during menses, but no studies have investigated the impact this practice may have on IUD expulsions.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart survey.
RESULTS: Of the 930 women having IUDs placed and reporting menstrual protection, 10.3% (96) used menstrual cups, 74.2% (690) used tampons, and 43.2% (402) used pads (many women reported using more than one method). In the 743 women with adequate follow-up information, there was a full or partial expulsion (i.e., part of the IUD in the cervical canal) rate of 2.5% (27) during the first 6 weeks after insertion. There was no difference in the women using cups, tampons or pads (confidence intervals overlap).
CONCLUSIONS: From this study, there is no evidence that women who report using menstrual cups or tampons for menstrual protection had higher rates of early IUD expulsion."
22464666,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22464666/,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether general practitioners (GPs) and patients agree on what constitutes the best evidence for the effectiveness of treatments.
METHODS: GPs and members of the public aged 18-83 read five scenarios describing comparisons between hypothetical treatments for common ailments. Each scenario reported that one treatment was the more effective, as determined by randomised controlled trial (RCT), audit of treatment outcomes from many doctors' patients, a single doctor's clinical experience, a friend's experience, or a web-based sales site. Participants rated how confident they would be that the treatment reported to be more effective would work for them.
RESULTS: All participants had least confidence in the web-based sales site, more confidence in a friend's experience and more still in one doctor's experience. For doctor's experience, audit and RCT, amongst the public there were some differences by age but, importantly, only GPs had most confidence in evidence from an RCT.
CONCLUSION: GPs may treat evidence from RCTs as the gold standard while members of the public (their patients) may not afford it that same respect.
PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: GPs engaged in shared decision-making should be alert to possible differences from their patients in the weight given to different types of evidence."
22465003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22465003/,"OBJECTIVE: To identify the clinical features of elderly-onset rheumatoid arthritis (EORA) and their impact on disease outcome.
METHODS: A total of 3169 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients were recruited as part of the Korean Observational Study Network for Arthritis, the nationwide cohort of South Korea. Patients were stratified according to age at disease onset: <40 years (younger age-onset RA, n = 1167), between the ages of 40 and 59 (middle-aged-onset RA, n = 1516), and ≥60 years (EORA, n = 486). To evaluate the significance of differences in clinical features among these 3 groups, we performed analysis of variance (anova) and the χ(2) test. We used multivariable logistic regression analysis to examine the association of onset age with functional disability measured with Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQDI).
RESULTS: EORA patients were associated with high HAQDI (≥1) in bivariable analysis [odds ratio (OR) 1.36, confidence interval (CI) 1.04-1.77]. However, in multivariable analysis, not elderly onset but patients' age, female gender, high disease activity, disease duration over 10 years, and comorbidity with cardiovascular disease were associated with high HAQDI. Only in a predefined subgroup with disease duration <10 years, elderly onset was an independent influencing factor for the functional disability of RA patients (OR 3.04, CI 1.85-5.67: disease duration of <5 years, OR 3.07, CI 1.64-5.74: disease duration of 5 to 10 years).
CONCLUSIONS: Disease onset in older age was associated independently with functional disability of RA patients who have relatively short disease duration."
22465172,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22465172/,"BACKGROUND: Since Cognex, more than 200 Alzheimer's disease (AD) drug candidates have failed. Investigations have identified vulnerabilities of these AD drug developments to methodological errors. (-)-Phenserine has been discussed as possibly failing due to flawed methods and practices in development.
METHODS: We analyzed documentation of (-)-phenserine's development for vulnerabilities to errors and designed interventions for a redevelopment that could provide fair or unbiased assessments of (-)-phenserine target engagement, target relevance for human diseases, and adequate presumptive evidence of efficacy as a therapeutic for one or more diagnoses to justify registration-required clinical trials.
RESULTS: Similar to studies of 40 other AD developments, with (-)-phenserine, we found little evidence of preemptive interventions against potentially invalidating errors, grounds to judge progress in development through stages as not scientifically justifiable, and variance excess and placebo group improvements as capable of accounting for outcomes from various studies in the development. We propose to compare a redevelopment resourced to counter these deficiencies with the original development as historical control to evaluate further our hypothesis that errors in development accounted for the (-)-phenserine failure, specifically, and other AD drug failures, potentially.
CONCLUSIONS: We find support for our earlier proposal that (-)-phenserine did not fail, but the methods of development did fail, to provide conditions where efficacy could be tested. We propose that redevelopment under conditions aimed to correct methodological deficiencies common in AD drug developments will successfully test efficacy for (-)-phenserine and hopefully lead to a disease-modifying addition to the AD therapeutic armamentarium."
22465235,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22465235/,"BACKGROUND: Vitamin D testing is becoming increasingly important with recent research demonstrating a correlation between vitamin D insufficiency and metabolic diseases, immunodeficiencies and other diseases. However, existing 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) assays lack comparability to the candidate reference method, causing difficulties in diagnosis and monitoring of vitamin D deficiency.
METHODS: We looked at the accuracy of 3 automated assays (Roche Diagnostics Elecsys® Total 25OHD assay, Abbott Architect® Total vitamin D assay, Advia Centaur® vitamin D Total assay) and Diasorin® Radioimmunoassay (RIA) compared to a routine laboratory Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
RESULTS: The correlation based on Passing Bablok regression was good with the slopes between 0.95 and 1.31 and the intercepts between -3.24 and 3.68. However, a significant positive bias was observed using the Abbott Architect and the Diasorin RIA. Using published analytical goals of coefficient of variation (CV) <10% and bias <5%, most methods did not meet these criteria. Using measurement of uncertainty of 9%, most methods were able to meet criteria using quality control materials but not patient samples.
CONCLUSION: Inadequacies of these assay performances are contributed by differences in method of extraction of vitamin D from vitamin D binding protein, cross-reactivities to 25OHD(2), 25OHD(3) and other vitamin D metabolites, matrix interferences and a lack of standardization."
22465521,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22465521/,"OBJECTIVE: Current surgical treatment of FIGO stage 1B1 cervical cancer is radical surgery. However, several reports have shown that for small tumours a more conservative approach can be as effective in terms of survival, whilst at the same time reducing the morbidity associated with removing the parametrium. The objective of our study was to report survival and obstetric outcomes following conservative management of small-volume stage 1B1 disease.
METHODS: All patients with FIGO stage 1B1 cancer and estimated tumour volume of less than 500 mm(3) in a loop biopsy specimen were included in the study, irrespective of other histological characteristics. A second loop biopsy was performed to rule out residual disease in 79% of patients.
RESULTS: Sixty two women were identified with a median age of 35 years (range 27-67). Median tumour length was 9.75 mm (7.2-20) and median depth of invasion was 1.55 mm (0.3-5). Thirty five women (56.4%) were treated with loop biopsy, whilst 27 (45.6%) had simple hysterectomy. Fifty seven women (92%) had pelvic lymphadenectomy and one positive node was recorded. After a median follow up of 56 months (16-132) no recurrence was noted. Seven full term pregnancies have been achieved. There were no preterm deliveries or mid-term miscarriages.
CONCLUSION: Cervical loop biopsy or simple hysterectomy combined with negative pelvic lymphadenectomy for small-volume stage 1B1 cervical cancer offers excellent prognosis in terms of survival. Postoperative morbidity is reduced and obstetric outcomes may be improved. Should these results be verified by further prospective studies, radical surgery for these women may be avoided."
22465970,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22465970/,"OBJECTIVES: Several trials have demonstrated that oral delayed-release mesalamine might be administered once daily. We aimed to conduct a meta-analysis to investigate this.
METHODS: A comprehensive and multiple-source literature search was carried out. Only randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) were investigated by comparing a once daily-dosing regime with a divided (twice or thrice daily)-dosing regime of oral delayed-release mesalamine formulations for induction or maintenance of remission in patients with mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis. The quality of RCTs was assessed using the Jadad scores. Meta-analysis of pooled odds ratios was carried out using Review Manager 5.1.
RESULTS: Nine RCTs were finally included. With regard to meta-analyses for induction trials, there were no significant differences for all comparisons between the once daily and the divided groups, including maintenance of just clinical remission (P=0.52) and just endoscopic remission (P=0.23), maintenance of combined clinical and endoscopic remission (P=0.78), and the overall incidence of adverse events (P=0.61). With regard to meta-analyses for maintenance trials, there were also no significant differences for all comparisons between once daily and divided groups, including maintenance of just clinical remission (P=0.73) and just endoscopic remission (P=0.43), maintenance of combined clinical and endoscopic remission (P=0.43), the overall incidence of adverse events (P=0.12) as well as compliance with the prescribed medication (P=0.34).
CONCLUSION: The present work showed that oral delayed-release mesalazine administered as a single or a divided dose demonstrated a good safety profile, which was well tolerated and effective as either maintenance or induction treatment. High clinical and/or endoscopic remission rates can be achieved with once-daily dosing."
22466360,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22466360/,"OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the associations of short stature with coronary heart disease (CHD) risk or overall mortality, which vary with sex and ethnicity/race.
METHODS: Such associations were studied prospectively at a mean 13.5-years' follow-up in a population-based sample of 3394 Turkish adults (mean age 44±11 years) using Cox proportional hazards models. Covariates of height were sought in sex-specific tertiles.
RESULTS: Height averaged 162.7±6.5 cm. Age-adjusted estimated marginal means for serum triglycerides, C-reactive protein and complement C3 in women (but not men) were significantly higher with decreasing height tertiles. In sex- and age-adjusted models, height was associated in men with neither incident CHD, nor death. In women, 1-SD increment (6.5 cm) in height only tended to marginal inverse association with CHD, but predicted significantly all-cause death (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.59-0.98); HR attenuated only marginally after further adjustment for family income bracket, smoking status, alcohol usage, systolic blood pressure, serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL)- and non HDL-cholesterol. A threshold below 160 cm of female height doubled the adjusted risk of death compared to taller women.
CONCLUSION: In contrast to men, short stature in Turkish women tends to be an independent risk marker for CHD, and height below 160 cm is a strong marker of death. Gender-specific early-life influences enhancing pro-inflammatory state may affect death and future CHD."
22466575,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22466575/,"STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional, population-based cohort study.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical relevance of skipped level disc degeneration (SLDD) to that of contiguous, multilevel disc degeneration (CMDD) of the lumbar spine. The study also aimed to identify patterns of SLDD, its classification, prevalence, and clinical relevance.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The association of disc degeneration on magnetic resonance imaging with low back pain (LBP) remains questionable. The occurrence of SLDD of the lumbar spine has recently been noted. To date, patterns of disc degeneration have been overlooked in the association with low back symptoms.
METHODS: A population-based radiographic and clinical study of 3099 Southern Chinese patients. Individuals with multilevel disc degeneration of the lumbar spine on sagittal T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (N = 1457) were stratified to SLDD (n = 301; 20.7%) or CMDD (n = 1156; 79.3%) groups. SLDD was further classified into 5 types by the relative location of nondegenerated normal disc(s) to degenerated disc levels. Subject demographics, presence of LBP, pain intensity, and functional disability were assessed.
RESULTS: In the multivariate analyses, CMDD increased the likelihood of historical LBP (odds ratio [OR]: 1.39; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00-1.93; P = 0.047) and pain severity (OR: 1.83; 95% CI: 1.23-2.73; P = 0.003) in comparison with SLDD. A significant increasing trend of number of levels with disc degeneration, overall disc degeneration severity, and presence of disc bulges/extrusions was noted from SLDD type I (least severe) to SLDD type V (most severe) (P < 0.05). A higher prevalence of LBP and a higher pain intensity were observed in SLDD classification type V. Functional disability scores did not differ between CMDD and SLDD, nor within SLDD classification types (P > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Our large-scale study is the first to describe novel variants of SLDD types and their clinical relevance. More important, LBP and severity of pain were more pronounced in individuals with CMDD rather than those with SLDD. Our study suggests that subjects with a similar degree but different patterns of multilevel disc degeneration do differ with respect to low back symptoms. This finding may provide new evidence with regard to the mechanism of LBP."
22466632,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22466632/,"STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cost-effectiveness analysis.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the relative cost-effectiveness of anterior cervical discectomy with fusion (ACDF) using a porous tantalum implant compared with autograft with plating, for single-level cervical disc disease with radiculopathy.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: ACDF with autograft as an interbody spacer is a generally accepted method to treat degenerated cervical discs with radiculopathy. Concerns about donor site morbidity and the structural characteristics of autograft stimulated investigations of alternative materials. Techniques may differ in their operative risks, complications, outcomes, and resource use.
METHODS: A retrospective review of clinical outcomes and total cost of illness for 5 years postsurgery was performed for 61 consecutive patients enrolled for this study. Twenty-eight patients were treated with single-level ACDF using either a stand-alone, porous tantalum implant, without graft inside the implant, and 33 patients received autograft and plating. A cost-effectiveness analysis comparing the 2 ACDF treatment methods was conducted. This article reports clinical assessments, quality adjusted life years gained, and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio analysis.
RESULTS: Patients in both cohorts reported improved clinical outcomes, including neck disability index, visual analogue scale, Short-Form 36, Odom's clinical assessment, and patient satisfaction at 5 years postindex surgery. The mean cost of illness for the study period, including preoperative through 5 years postoperative assessments, was 6806 per patient treated with tantalum and 10,143 per patient receiving autograft and plate. Quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained were 9.41 and 7.14 for the tantalum and control cohorts, respectively. The cost per QALY for the tantalum group was 723 and 1420 for the control group. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of ACDF with a porous tantalum implant compared with ACDF with autograft and plate was -1473 per patient per year for the duration of this study.
CONCLUSION: This cost-effectiveness analysis reports favorable results for ACDF procedures utilizing a tantalum implant. The data reported suggest that using porous tantalum as a stand-alone device is less costly and more effective than autograft and plate in ACDF procedures."
22466684,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22466684/,"PURPOSE: We aimed to compare laparoscopic hernia repair and open hernia repair in recurrent cases after first open repair according to the length of time taken to perform the procedure.
METHODS: Between November 2009 and December 2011, the medical records of 26 male paediatric patients who were treated with laparoscopic surgery (with Schier's intracorporal ""N"" suture closure) and open surgery (with high ligation technique) in our institution for recurrent inguinal hernia were reviewed for the length of the operative time and post-operative complications retrospectively. Thirteen cases operated with laparoscopic repair were regarded as Group 1 and other 13 cases operated with the open high ligation repair were regarded as Group 2. All recurrent hernia cases had been performed in other hospitals with the open high ligation technique previously.
RESULTS: Thirteen internal inguinal ring closures in Group 1 were performed laparoscopically. In Group 2, 13 cases underwent open high ligation repair. Comparing the laparoscopic and open-repair techniques in the recurrent cases (Group 1 vs. Group 2; 32.36 vs. 61.07 min, respectively) showed that the length of the operation time was much shorter in laparoscopic repair group (Group 1) than open repair group (Group 2). A statistically significant difference was also observed (p = 0.001). No post-operative testicular atrophy or recurrence was seen until present time in all groups.
CONCLUSION: We propose that laparoscopic repair in recurrent childhood inguinal hernia cases, developed after open repair, avoids entering a fibrotic inguinal canal, making the procedure easier and shorter. Laparoscopic herniorrhaphy is a good alternative option in recurrent childhood hernia."
22466693,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22466693/,"OBJECTIVES: The treatment of massive pulmonary embolism (PE) is a matter of debate. We present our institutional experience of patients suffering from massive PE with the aim of comparing the early results, the outcome and quality of life (QoL) between patients primarily assigned to either pulmonary surgical embolectomy (SE) or thrombolytic therapy (TL). A subgroup of patients (TS) with failed responses to TL requiring SE was separately analysed.
METHODS: All consecutive patients (January 2001-December 2007) with computed tomography (CT)-scan-confirmed massive bilateral central or paracentral PE were reviewed. All clinical data were retrieved from our patients' registry and completed by the evaluation of the CT-scan-derived right ventricle/left ventricle ratio (RV/LV ratio). Follow-up focused on clinical outcome and QoL was obtained.
RESULTS: Eighty patients were analysed including 28 SE (35%) and 52 TL (65%), of whom 11 (21%) required TS. Demographics and preoperative characteristics were similar between SE and TL. Analysis of the RV/LV ratio revealed a ratio of 1.66 for SE and 1.44 for TL. The early mortality rate was not significantly different between the two groups (SE: 3.6% versus TL: 13.5%), whereas early mortality was 27% in those patients treated initially with thrombolysis and subsequently requiring SE (TS-group). Severe bleeding complications were lower in the SE-group (3.6% versus 26.5% P = 0.013). Intracerebral bleeding rates and neurological events were not statistically different. After a mean follow-up of 63 ± 21 months, the mortality rate was 17.9% in the SE-group and 23.1% in the TL-group.
CONCLUSIONS: SE is an excellent treatment option in massive PE with comparable early mortality rates and significantly less bleeding complications than TL. Patients having surgery after inefficient thrombolysis have the worst early outcome. The RV/LV CT-scan ratio might serve as a predictor to differentiate patients, who could profit from direct surgical intervention than thrombolytic treatment attempts. Further studies are required to confirm these results."
22466981,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22466981/,"AIM: Randomized studies evaluating the effect of a vein collar at the distal anastomosis of PTFE-grafts show conflicting results. The study of the Joint Vascular Research Group (JVRG) of UK found improved primary patency while the Scandinavian Miller Collar Study (SCAMICOS) found neither any effect on patency nor on limb salvage after bypass to below-knee arteries. However, the Scandinavian patients were a decade older and predominately female compared to the British patients. Can this explain the conflicting result?
METHODS: Primary patency with respect to sex, age and the use of vein collar were re-analysed in 345 patients from SCAMICOS with Kaplan-Meier life-table technique, log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards regression to evaluate any interaction between sex or age and the effect of a vein collar on the primary patency rate.
RESULTS: Females had better patency than males (log-rank test, χ2=9.4, df=1, P=0.002) but age had no influence on patency (log-rank test, χ2=3.3, df=3, P=0.35). However, 47% of the males compared to 23% of the females were smokers (P=0.00002). No interaction effect between sex and vein collar (P-value=0.224) or age and vein collar (P-value=0.527) was established.
CONCLUSION: The difference between the two randomised vein collar studies are unlikely to depend on the disparity in sex and age of the study populations."
22467083,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22467083/,"OBJECTIVES: To describe the distribution of prevalent syndesmophytes and bridges, and the occurrence of new ones in a prevalence cohort of patients with AS.
METHODS: Clinical and radiological data from 132 patients from the Outcome in Ankylosing Spondylitis International Study of which complete sets of radiographs were available at baseline and at 2- and 4-year follow-up were used.
RESULTS: At baseline, 81 (61%) patients, of which 17 (45%) were females and 64 (65%) males (P = 0.03), had prevalent (bridging) syndesmophytes. Both syndesmophytes and bridges were found at all vertebral levels. Syndesmophytes were more frequently seen in the cervical spine compared with the lumbar spine (mean per vertebral level 17.5 vs 11.2%, respectively, P = 0.01). Bridges were more frequently seen in the lumbar spine compared with the cervical spine (mean per vertebral level 16.9% vs 12.1%, P = 0.02). With increasing disease duration more (bridging) syndesmophytes were found, occurring similarly at the lumbar and cervical spines. After 2- and 4-years of follow-up, new (bridging) syndesmophytes developed throughout the entire cervical and lumbar spines.
CONCLUSION: In general, syndesmophytes occur more frequently in the cervical spine and bridges more frequently in the lumbar spine, but neither a specific predilection site nor any particular order for occurrence and development of syndesmophytes could be detected."

SETTING: Thrombophilic mutations were examined in a sample of 100 women with at least one miscarriage. DNA was isolated from venous blood sample. We used methods of microarray, fragmentation analysis, High Resolution Melting and PCR-ARMS with following gel electrophoresis and visualisation. Chi-square test and in cases of low expected frequencies Yates correction were used to compare relative frequencies of individual mutations. The comparison of averages was performed by t-test.
RESULTS: We detected prevalence of factor V and II mutation of 9% and 3%, respectively. Single MTHFR mutation was found in 59% and double heterozygous MTHFR mutation in 23% of cases. No mutation was present in only 6% of the study group. Heterozygous mutations of factor V occurred 1.8 times more frequently in our study group compared to the general Czech women population. Also, the frequency of factor II mutation was 1.5-3 times higher. No carrier of these mutations had overt coagulation disorder, history of thromboembolic disease or that of habitual abortions.
CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of thrombophilic mutations in the group of women with early pregnancy loss is 1.5-3 times higher than in the general population."

However, mutual comparison of real (n=19) and sham (n=11) rTMS, respectively, has shown that the effect of real rTMS was statistically significantly higher compared with placebo stimulation. During stimulation treatment an improvement in working memory performance was also found. No statistically significant difference between the real and placebo sham rTMS, respectively, was established. The rate of neuronal activation did not change at all during rTMS treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: From clinical point of view rTMS seems to be a well-tolerated neurostimulation method for treatment of negative schizophrenia symptoms with favourable of impact on cognitive functions."
22467120,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22467120/,"BACKGROUND: Proximal femoral nailing is a common operation in orthogeriatrics and a highly standardized procedure. For teaching purposes, this operation is often performed by residents and supervised by attending physicians. The objective of this study is to investigate if teaching this operation influences the surgical in-house complication rate.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients who received a proximal femoral Targon PF nail (Aesculap AG, Tuttlingen, Germany) for trochanteric fractures were included in a cohort at our urban academic teaching hospital between 1998 and 2010. To evaluate potential effects of patient age, we separately analyzed several age groups. Complications including wound infection, hematoma, intraoperative malreduction or implant malpositioning causing revision, pain, cut-out and readmission due to nonunion were recorded.
RESULTS: Our collective consists of 1,516 patients (m/f: 410/1,106). The mean age was 78.7 years (range: 19-103 years). The overall complication rate was 7.9 %. In 857 cases operated by attending physicians, the complication rate was 6.9 %. However in the 659 operations performed by residents, we found a higher complication rate of 9.3 %. Further investigating this difference by χ(2) test, we found no significance (p = 0.09). Whilst analyzing the complication rates for the different age groups, we did not find a statistically significant difference except in the age group between 71 and 80 years, for which the odds ratio indicated a 2.6-fold increased complication risk for operations performed by residents (p = 0.01). Further analysis revealed that this increased complication rate was mainly due to increased numbers of cut-out.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that proximal femoral nailing is an operation suitable for teaching purposes. However, patients between 71 and 80 years of age seem to be at an increased risk for cut-out if operated by a resident."

The TABACROHN study aimed at defining the impact of smoking on CD in the largest published series.
METHODS: This multicenter cross-sectional study included 1170 CD patients. Patients were classified as nonsmokers, current smokers, or former smokers according to their present smoking status. Clinical data regarding disease characteristics, treatment, and complications were collected.
RESULTS: Smokers were more frequently under maintenance treatment when compared to nonsmokers. In addition, current smokers presented higher use of biologic drugs compared to nonsmokers. Tobacco exposure and a higher tobacco load were independent predictors of need for maintenance treatment and stenosing phenotype, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: In the era of early and widespread use of immunosuppressants and biologics, tobacco exposure is an independent predictor of need for maintenance treatment, specifically biologic therapy. The wider use of biologics and immunosuppressants could account for the existence of no major differences in disease behavior and complications between nonsmokers and current smokers."
22467247,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22467247/,"OBJECTIVES: To determine if acupuncture stimulation elicits a pupillary response under light adaptation and whether there is any difference in the pupillary response between light and dark adaptation environments during acupuncture stimulation.
METHODS: The participants consisted of 55 healthy individuals who had no known eye diseases or pupil abnormalities. Experiment 1 compared pupillary responses between acupuncture stimulation and no-stimulation groups under light adaptation. Experiment 2 compared pupillary responses to acupuncture between two conditions (dark and light adaptation) with a two-period repeated measurement crossover design. For both experiments the pupil diameter was continuously measured for 3 min before stimulation, during stimulation and for 3 min after stimulation. For all acupuncture stimulation interventions an acupuncture needle was inserted superficially at the TE5 acupuncture point followed by gentle tapping stimulation for 90 s.
RESULTS: In experiment 1 the pupil diameter was significantly decreased during (p<0.01) and after stimulation (p<0.0001) compared with the pupil diameter before stimulation under light adaptation. No significant difference was noted in the serial changes in pupil diameter in the no-stimulation group. In experiment 2 the pupil diameter was significantly decreased 90 s after stimulation (p<0.05) and 150 s after stimulation (p<0.05) under light adaptation conditions. Furthermore, the pupil diameter was significantly decreased 120 s after stimulation (p<0.05) and 150 s after stimulation (p<0.01) under dark adaptation conditions. No significant difference in the serial changes in pupil diameter was noted between the groups.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that pupil constriction occurs following acupuncture stimulation under light adaptation and this response is no different from that seen under dark adaptation."
22467265,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22467265/,"OBJECTIVE: Fear of falling is one of the most common fears among community-dwelling older people and is as serious a health problem as falls themselves. Understanding fear of falling in fallers transitioning to frailty may help us identify effective strategies to reduce it in this already vulnerable group of older people. Our aim was to evaluate the psychological factors associated with fear of falling in a group of fallers transitioning to frailty when compared with robust or non-frail fallers.
METHODS: Cross-sectional design where 301 fallers underwent assessment at the Technology Research for Independent Living Clinic in Dublin (http://www.trilcentre.org/) is seen. Fear of falling was measured using the Modified Falls Efficacy Scale, and frailty was measured using the Biological Syndrome Model. Psychological measures included assessment of anxiety, depression, loneliness, personality factors and cognition.
RESULTS: Frailer fallers had increased fear of falling when compared with robust fallers (p < 0.001). Age, female gender and lower cognitive scores were associated with greater fear of falling in the robust group. For frailer fallers, higher depression score was the only factor associated with fear of falling on multivariate analysis. The odds ratio of having case level depressive disorder (CESD-8 ≥ 4) if you were a frailer faller was significantly higher than if you were robust (OR = 2.6, CI 1.3-5.2, p = 0.006).
CONCLUSION: Fallers at a transitional level of frailty may represent a particularly vulnerable group psychologically who would benefit most from interventional strategies with specific intervention components addressing depressive symptoms."
22467344,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22467344/,"BACKGROUND: Distress during child rearing is known as a risk factor for child maltreatment. In addition, it is known that social capital can be a preventive factor for child maltreatment. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the home-visit program reduces parenting stress and increases the social capital in the community.
METHODS: The home-visit program was implemented when the infants were 1-2 month of age (by public health nurses or midwives) and/or 4 months of age for those mothers who agreed to a home visit by trained community staff. Self-administered questionnaires on parenting stress scale and social capital were sent to all mothers who delivered a baby between August and November 2009 in two cities in the Aichi prefecture, Japan.
RESULTS: Among 936 mothers, 347 mothers (follow-up rate: 37%) completed both questionnaires. Scores on parenting stress scale scores at 4 months were lower than those at 1-2 months among the four groups (no home visit, home visit at 1-2 months, home visit at 4 months and both). The social trust scores at 4 months were higher than those at 1-2 months in every group; however, multivariate regression analysis showed that there were no differences in the reduction of the parenting stress scale scores and increase in social trust between the four groups.
CONCLUSION: The home-visit program conducted once or twice by public health nurses or trained community staff for mothers with infants showed no substantial reduction in maternal stress and no increase in social trust."

22467710,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22467710/,"OBJECTIVE: The social gradient in smoking contributes substantially to the health gap between the rich and poor. Passive smoking by children is associated with increased risk of more severe asthma, respiratory diseases and infections, middle ear disease and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. This study examined trends in the social gradient of children's exposure to secondhand smoke in Australian households between 2001 and 2010.
DESIGN: Series of cross-sectional national household surveys.
RESULTS: Between 2001 and 2010, the proportion of Australian households containing a child aged under 15 years and a smoker declined by 22%. However, there was no change in the most disadvantaged households, with half of these households still containing at least one smoker in 2010. There was a social gradient in outdoor smoking in all survey years but the prevalence of outdoor-only smoking increased in all socioeconomic groups by around 50% between 2001 and 2010. The presence of a child aged 5 years or younger in the household increased the chances that smokers only smoked outdoors.
CONCLUSIONS: Children's exposure to indoor smoking in households that contain a smoker is declining in all socioeconomic groups but the social class differentials in such exposure remain. The proportion of children who live with a smoker declined in all social groups except the most disadvantaged households, with half of these households still containing a smoker in 2010. More needs to be done to reduce secondhand smoke exposure of children in socially disadvantaged households."

22468844,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22468844/,"OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that small- or large-for-gestational-age (SGA or LGA) newborns have anomalous crown-rump length (CRL) growth rates in the first trimester.
METHODS: Prospective observational study. Women in the first trimester presenting to the Early Pregnancy Unit, between November 2006 and December 2010, underwent transvaginal scan. Women with viable singleton pregnancies in the first trimester who had at least two CRL measurements > 5 mm, recorded at least 2 weeks apart, and also had birth weight data available were included in the final analysis. Birth weight percentiles were calculated and adjusted for gestational age and gender. SGA was equivalent to < 10th centile and LGA was equivalent to > 90th centile. Correlation analysis was performed between birthweight percentiles and first-trimester CRL growth-rate coefficients. In addition, we estimated early fetal growth rates (EFGR) by calculating the Δ CRL/Δ time (mm/day) to see if these differed according to the birth-weight percentiles.
RESULTS: A total of 107 women had complete data. The mean maternal characteristics were age 27.5 ± 6 years, weight 87 ± 29 kg and height 163 ± 8 cm. The mean birth weight and gestational age at delivery were 3405 g (SD = 597) and 269 days (SD = 13), respectively. The proportions of SGA and LGA were 7.5% and 18.7%, respectively. There were no significant correlations between birth-weight percentiles and any of the CRL growth rates. There were also no significant differences in the mean CRL velocities when comparing the SGA and LGA newborns birth weights. EFGR for SGA and LGA newborns were 1.34 mm/day (SD = 0.17) and 1.32 mm/day (SD = 0.24), respectively (p > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Newborns who are found to be SGA or LGA at delivery do not appear to have anomalous CRL growth patterns in the first trimester. The EFGR also did not correlate with birth-weight percentiles."
22469191,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22469191/,"BACKGROUND: Most patients are prescribed Helicobacter pylori treatment without culture and antibiotic susceptibility testing, as current guidance recommends that patients with recurrent dyspepsia should be tested for H. pylori using a non-invasive breath or faecal antigen test.
AIMS: To determine the prevalence of H. pylori antibiotic resistance in patients attending endoscopy in England and Wales, and the feasibility of an antibiotic resistance surveillance programme testing.
METHODS: We tested the antibiotic susceptibility of H. pylori isolates from biopsy specimens from 2063 of 7791 (26%) patients attending for endoscopy in Gloucester and Bangor, and 339 biopsy specimens sent to the Helicobacter Reference Unit (HRU) in London. Culture and susceptibility testing was undertaken in line with National and European methods.
RESULTS: Helicobacter pylori were cultured in 6.4% of 2063 patients attending Gloucester and Bangor hospitals. Resistance to amoxicillin, tetracycline and rifampicin/rifabutin was below 3% at all centres. Clarithromycin, metronidazole and quinolone resistance was significantly higher in HRU (68%, 88%, 17%) and Bangor isolates (18%, 43%, 13%) than Gloucester (3%, 22%, 1%). Each previous course of these antibiotics is associated with an increase in the risk of antibiotic resistance to that agent [clarithromycin: RR = 1.5 (P = 0.12); metronidazole RR = 1.6 (P = 0.002); quinolone RR = 1.8 (P = 0.01)].
CONCLUSIONS: Helicobacter pylori infection is now uncommon in dyspeptic patients at endoscopy. A surveillance system is feasible and necessary to inform dyspepsia management guidance. Clinicians should take a thorough antibiotic history before prescribing metronidazole, clarithromycin or levofloxacin for H. pylori."
22469442,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22469442/,"BACKGROUND: Although the relationship between asthma and obesity has been extensively explored, the effect of body mass index (BMI) on the dose-response relationship to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) has received little attention.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the dose-response of inhaled budesonide on outcome measures of asthma between overweight and normal weight patients with persistent asthma.
METHODS: Seventy-two patients with mild to moderate persistent asthma from a post hoc analysis of previously reported trial data were divided into 2 groups: overweight, BMI 25 kg/m(2) or higher; normal weight, BMI less than 25 kg/m(2). Each group received 4 weeks' treatment with inhaled (hydrofluoroalkane) budesonide 200 μg/day then 800 μg/day with ICS washout pretreatment. Outcome measures forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)), fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), methacholine PC20, total daily asthma symptom score, and overnight urinary cortisol/creatinine ratio were performed at baseline and after each dose.
RESULTS: Significantly greater improvements were seen in the normal weight group for both FeNO and symptom responses at 0 to 200 μg and 0 to 800 μg ICS doses (as change from baseline), compared with the overweight group: FeNO 0 to 200 μg, P = .002; 0 to 800 μg, P = .045; symptoms 0 to 200 μg, P = .002; 0 to 800 μg, P = .013. A trend also was seen toward attenuated cortisol suppression in overweight subjects at 0 to 800 μg (P = .06), but no significant difference was seen at either dose in FEV(1) and methacholine PC20 between weight groups.
CONCLUSION: Overweight patients with persistent asthma may have attenuated symptom and FeNO dose responses to inhaled budesonide compared with normal weight patients with asthma, with no differences in FEV(1) or methacholine PC20 between groups. Attenuated cortisol suppression in the overweight group may be the clue to this difference, alluding to reduced peripheral lung deposition or absorption in overweight patients with asthma."

BACKGROUND: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, which is a leading cause of death in this patient population. NASH is a subset of NAFLD that carries a higher risk of progression to cirrhosis and its associated complications.
STUDY: We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients with biopsy-confirmed NAFLD, including NASH and non-NASH fatty liver, within the Gastroenterology and Hepatology clinic at Brooke Army Medical Center. Patients with secondary causes of chronic liver disease were excluded. The patients' records were reviewed for the presence of significant cardiovascular disease, which was defined as a history of stroke, unstable angina, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, or need for revascularization.
RESULTS: Nine hundred thirteen patients were identified and 377 patients met inclusion and exclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. Of these, 219 patients had biopsies showing the presence of at least grade I NASH. The overall prevalence of cardiovascular disease was 6.63%. After controlling for age, sex, body mass index, and the presence of diabetes, there was no significant increase in the prevalence of cardiovascular disease in the NASH cohort over the non-NASH group.
CONCLUSIONS: Cardiovascular disease is common among patients with NAFLD. However, no increased risk of cardiovascular disease was found among those patients with NASH as compared with those with non-NASH fatty liver."

Therefore, we conducted a cross-sectional study to quantify the risk for colorectal neoplasms in patients with gynecological cancers.
METHODOLOGY: A total of 4613 women (including 27, 51 and 92 women with a prior diagnosis of endometrial, ovarian and cervical cancers, respectively) >20 years of age were recruited prospectively from 9 tertiary medical centers in Korea between January 2008 and February 2009. All participants underwent complete colonoscopies for vague abdominal signs or symptoms or for colorectal cancer screening. Several risk factors for colorectal neoplasms and a prior history of gynecological cancer were compared between women with and without colorectal neoplasms.
RESULTS: The risk for colorectal neoplasms was only elevated among women with previous endometrial cancer, but with ovarian or cervical cancer, particularly when diagnosed at <50 years of age (adjusted OR=3.7; 95% CI=1.0-13.3, p=0.016).
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated a higher risk for colorectal neoplasms in women with previous endometrial cancer, particularly when diagnosed at <50 years of age. Greater emphasis on colorectal cancer screening in this population may be necessary."
22469790,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22469790/,"BACKGROUND: Many surgeons prefer immediate diversion in patients with endoscopically obstructed rectal cancer before starting neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare immediate neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy with diversion for endoscopically obstructed rectal cancer.
DESIGN: This study is a retrospective review of patients with rectal adenocarcinoma treated from January 2000 to December 2009. Demographic, tumor, treatment, and outcome data were obtained. Data were analyzed by the use of the Fisher exact probability test and the Student t test.
SETTINGS: This study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital/referral center.
PATIENTS: Included were patients with a rectal adenocarcinoma unable to be traversed endoscopically but without clinical evidence of obstruction before the initiation of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Patients with recurrent tumors or those who did not complete neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy because of compliance were excluded.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes measured were the interval from diagnosis to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy initiation and resection and the incidence of complete obstruction.
RESULTS: Eighty-five patients with endoscopically obstructed rectal cancer were identified; 16 underwent immediate diversion before neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (diverted group) and 69 were treated with immediate neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Five patients undergoing immediate neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy presented with bloating and distension; 2 were treated with dietary modification, and 3 (4.3%) progressed to complete obstruction following completion of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and required diversion. Both groups were similar in age, tumor height, and surgical margin status. Patients undergoing diversion required a significantly greater number of permanent stomas and were associated with a higher rate of radical pelvic surgery. There was a significant delay in the initiation of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (p < 0.05) and proctectomy (p < 0.001) from the time of diagnosis in the diverted group compared with the immediate neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy group. The tumors of patients undergoing diversions were more likely to be unresectable following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.
LIMITATIONS: This study was limited by its retrospective design and possible selection bias.
CONCLUSIONS: Immediate diversion is unnecessary in endoscopically obstructed rectal cancer without clinical signs of obstruction. There appears to be a relationship between immediate diversion and delay in initiation of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and proctectomy. We conclude that immediate neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in patients with endoscopically obstructed rectal cancer is safe and feasible."

OBJECTIVE: The aim was to evaluate age as a predictor of functional outcome and quality of life after overlapping sphincter repair.
DESIGN: This study is a retrospective review of chart review followed by a prospective evaluation by the use of validated questionnaires.
SETTINGS: Patients were assigned to group A (≤ 60 years old) or group B (>60 years).
PATIENTS: Included were patients with obstetric sphincter injuries who underwent overlapping sphincteroplasty between 1996 and 2007.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life Scale, Fecal Incontinence Severity Index, the Cleveland Global Quality of Life scale, and a patient satisfaction questionnaire were used to assess outcome.
RESULTS: Three hundred twenty-one women underwent sphincteroplasty and 197 responded to this study, 146 (74.1%) patients in group A and 51 (25.9%) patients in group B. Median follow-up was 7.7 years (range, 4.7-10.0). The mean overall Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life Scale was 11.0 ± 3.5. Median Fecal Incontinence Severity Index score was 29.8 ± 15.9. Mean Cleveland Global Quality of Life scale was 0.7 ± 0.2. The 2 groups were comparable for BMI (p = 1.0), ethnic background (p = 0.8), smoking (p = 0.8), and follow-up duration (p = 0.9). Intergroup comparison showed no significant difference in the Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life Scale scores (p = 0.5) in all subscales: lifestyle (p = 0.8), coping behavior (p = 0.5), depression and self-perception (p = 0.2), and embarrassment (p = 0.1).

22470041,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22470041/,"BACKGROUND: Risk-factors for mortality in hip fractures encompass nutritional status, nominally body mass index, but not body composition. Given the difficulty of anthropometric assessment in bedridden patients a prospective study with bioimpedance analysis was designed.
METHODS: Elderly patients with hip fracture were consecutively recruited. Biochemical tests, primitive bioimpedance measurements (resistance, reactance and phase angle) and follow-up till one year were targeted.
RESULTS: Patients (N = 69, 81.2 ± 8.1 years old, 72.5% females) stayed in the hospital for 15.5 ± 17.1 days, and 18.8% (13/69) required further hospitalization during the ensuing months. Mortality was 11.6% within 30 days, coinciding with hospital mortality, and an additional 11.6% till one year, thus reaching 23.2%. Anemia, hypoalbuminemia and low transferrin, along with elevated glucose and urea were frequent, suggesting undernutrition with metabolic derangements. Reactance, urea and creatinine were different in patients suffering both early and late demise. Resistance, white blood cell count and osteoporosis were risk factors for early mortality only , and anemia exclusively for late mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Primitive bioimpedance measurements, which had not been hitherto investigated , were prognostically related to early and late mortality. These markers of disease-related malnutrition and especially reactance should be further studied in patients unfit for anthropometric evaluation due to fracture and immobility."
22470193,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22470193/,"INTRODUCTION: Several studies have claimed that the estimation of serum cystatin C could be a better marker of kidney excretory function than serum creatinine. However, its role in the diagnosis of reduced kidney function was not unquestionably confirmed. The aim of this study was to analyze the concentrations of serum cystatin C in neonates with sepsis.
MATERIAL/METHODS: Thirty-two neonates (gestational age from 34 to 40 weeks) admitted to the NICU during the first 14 days of life were enrolled. Serum cystatin C concentrations were estimated by ELISA during three successive days in neonates treated for infection. The study group consisted of 9 newborns with sepsis, 14 with severe sepsis and 9 with septic shock.
RESULTS/DISCUSSION: At the beginning of the observational period the mean serum concentration of cystatin C in the study group was 1.35 mg/L (95% CI 1.20-1.49). Surprisingly, the lowest concentration of cystatin was observed in patients with septic shock (1.23 mg/L; 95%CI 0.92-1.54) within the observation period. Higher concentrations were found in neonates with sepsis (1.47 mg/L; 95%CI 1.04-1.90) and severe sepsis (1.50; 1.12-1.87). There was no correlation between serum cystatin C concentration and serum creatinine or gestational age. A significant correlation was discovered between chronological age and cystatin C (R=-0.439, p=0.01). There was a tendency for cystatin C to decline during the second observational day in patients with sepsis (to 1.53 mg/L; 95%CI: 1.19-1.86) and severe sepsis (to 1.32 mg/L; 95%CI: 1.07-1.57), while a slight insignificant increase in patient with septic shock (to 1.28 mg/L; 95%CI: 0.88-1.68) was revealed. The interrelation between age and cystatin C concentration disappeared in the following days of stay in the NICU. Even in patients who died in the course of septic shock the observed changes in cystatin C levels were small and did not exceed those of serum creatinine.
CONCLUSIONS: Cystatin C is not a useful marker of kidney function in neonates with sepsis."
22471787,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22471787/,"BACKGROUND: Financial incentives appear to be effective in promoting smoking cessation in pregnancy. The mechanisms by which they might operate however, are poorly understood. The present study examines how financial incentives for smoking cessation during pregnancy may work, by exploring pregnant women’s experiences of trying to stop smoking, within and outside of a financial incentives scheme.
METHODS: Thirty-six (n = 36) UK-based pregnant smokers (n = 36), offered standard NHS Stop-Smoking Services, of whom twenty (n = 20) were enrolled in a financial incentives scheme for smoking cessation (n = 20) and sixteen (n = 16) were not, were interviewed about (i) their motivation to stop smoking, and (ii) the factors they perceived as influencing their quitting efforts. Framework Analysis was used to analyse the data.
RESULTS: Women in the two groups reported similar reasons for wanting to stop smoking during pregnancy. However, they described dissimilar experiences of the Stop-Smoking Services, which they perceived to have differentially influenced their quit attempts. Women who were incentivised reported using the services more than women who were not incentivised. In addition, they described the motivating experience of being monitored and receiving feedback on their progress. Non-incentivised women reported problems receiving the appropriate Nicotine Replacement Therapy, which they described as having a detrimental effect on their quitting efforts.
CONCLUSION: Women participating in a financial incentives scheme to stop smoking reported greater engagement with the Stop-Smoking Services, from which they described receiving more help in quitting than women who were not part of the scheme. These results highlight the complexity of financial incentives schemes and the intricacies surrounding the ways in which they operate to affect smoking cessation. These might involve influencing individuals’ motivation and self-regulation, changing engagement with and provision of support services, or a combination of these."
22471791,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22471791/,"BACKGROUND: Patient financial incentives (""incentives"") have been widely used to promote chlamydia screening uptake amongst 15-24 year olds in England, but there is scarce evidence of their effectiveness. The objectives of the study were to describe incentives used to promote chlamydia screening in Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) in England and to evaluate their impact on coverage and positivity rate.
METHODS: PCTs that had used incentives between 1/1/2007 and 30/6/2009 (exposed) were matched by socio-demographic profile and initial screening coverage with PCTs that had not (unexposed). For each PCT, percentage point change in chlamydia screening coverage and positivity for the period before and during the incentive was calculated. Differences in average change of coverage and positivity rate between exposed and unexposed PCTs were compared using linear regression to adjust for matching and potential confounders.
RESULTS: Incentives had a significant effect in increasing average coverage in exposed PCTs (0.43%, CI 0.04%-0.82%). The effect for voucher schemes (2.35%) was larger than for prize draws (0.16%). The difference was greater in females (0.73%) than males (0.14%). The effect on positivity rates was not significant (0.07%, CI -1.53% to 1.67%).
CONCLUSIONS: Vouchers, but not prize draws, led to a small absolute but large relative increase in chlamydia screening coverage. Incentives increased coverage more in females than males but had no impact on reported positivity rates.

The aim of the survey was to determine how medical students classify a range of conditions they might encounter in their professional lives and whether a different name for a condition would influence their decision in the categorisation of the condition as a 'disease' or 'not a disease'.
METHODS: We surveyed 3 concurrent years of medical students to classify 36 candidate conditions into ""disease"" and ""non-disease"". The conditions were given a 'medical' label and a (lay) label and positioned where possible in alternate columns of the survey.
RESULTS: The response rate was 96% (183 of 190 students attending a lecture): 80% of students concurred on 16 conditions as ""disease"" (eg diabetes, tuberculosis), and 4 as ""non-disease"" (eg baldness, menopause, fractured skull and heat stroke). The remaining 16 conditions (with 21-79% agreement) were more contentious (especially obesity, infertility, hay fever, alcoholism, and restless leg syndrome). Three pairs of conditions had both a more, and a less, medical label: the more medical labels (myalgic encephalomyelitis, hypertension, and erectile dysfunction) were more frequently classified as 'disease' than the less medical (chronic fatigue syndrome, high blood pressure, and impotence), respectively, significantly different for the first two pairs.
CONCLUSIONS: Some conditions excluded from the classification of ""disease"" were unexpected (eg fractured skull and heat stroke). Students were mostly concordant on what conditions should be classified as ""disease"". They were more likely to classify synonyms as 'disease' if the label was medical. The findings indicate there is still a problem 30 years on in the concept of 'what is a disease'. Our findings suggest that we should be addressing such concepts to medical students."
22472915,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22472915/,"PURPOSE: Modeling studies that evaluate statin treatment for the prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) use different methods to model the effect of statins. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of using different modeling methods on the optimal decision found in such studies.
METHODS: We used a previously developed and validated Monte Carlo-Markov model based on the Rotterdam study (RISC model). The RISC model simulates coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, cardiovascular death, and death due to other causes. Transition probabilities were based on 5-year risks predicted by Cox regression equations, including (among others) total and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol as covariates. In a cost-effectiveness analysis of implementing the ATP-III guidelines, we evaluated the impact of using 3 different modeling methods of statin effectiveness: 1) through lipid level modification: statins lower total cholesterol and increase HDL cholesterol, which through the covariates in the Cox regression equations leads to a lower incidence of CHD and stroke events; 2) fixed risk reduction of CVD events: statins decrease the odds of CHD and stroke with an associated odds ratio that is assumed to be the same for each individual; 3) risk reduction of CVD events proportional to individual change in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol: the relative risk reduction with statin therapy on the incidence of CHD and stroke was assumed to be proportional to the absolute reduction in LDL cholesterol levels for each individual. The probability that the ATP-III strategy was cost-effective, compared to usual care as observed in the Rotterdam study, was calculated for each of the 3 modeling methods for varying willingness-to-pay thresholds.
RESULTS: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for the ATP-III strategy compared with the reference strategy were €56,642/quality-adjusted life year (QALY), €21,369/QALY, and €22,131/QALY for modeling methods 1, 2, and 3, respectively. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of €50,000/QALY, the probability that the ATP-III strategy was cost-effective was about 40% for modeling method 1 and more than 90% for both methods 2 and 3. Differences in results between the modeling methods were sensitive to both the time horizon modeled and age distribution of the target
CONCLUSIONS: Modeling the effect of statins on CVD through the modification of lipid levels produced different results and associated uncertainty than modeling it directly through a risk reduction of events. This was partly attributable to the modeled effect of cholesterol on the incidence of stroke."
22472962,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22472962/,"BACKGROUND: Animal models and a few human studies have suggested a complex interaction between cancer risk and longevity indicating a trade-off where low cancer risk is associated with accelerating aging phenotypes and, vice versa, that longevity potential comes with the cost of increased cancer risk. This hypothesis predicts that longevity in one twin is associated with increased cancer risk in the cotwin.
METHODS: A total of 4,354 twin pairs born 1900-1918 in Denmark were followed for mortality in the Danish Civil Registration System through 2008 and for cancer incidence in the period 1943-2008 through the Danish Cancer Registry.
RESULTS: The 8,139 twins who provided risk time for cancer occurrence entered the study between ages 24 and 43 (mean 33 years), and each participant was followed up to death, emigration, or at least 90 years of age. The total follow-up time was 353,410 person-years and, 2,524 cancers were diagnosed. A negative association between age at death of a twin and cancer incidence in the cotwin was found in the overall analyses as well as in the subanalysis stratified on sex, zygosity, and random selection of one twin from each twin pair.
CONCLUSIONS: This study did not find evidence of a cancer-longevity trade-off in humans. On the contrary, it suggested that longevity in one twin is associated with lower cancer incidence in the cotwin, indicating familial factors associated with both low cancer occurrence and longevity."
22473067,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22473067/,"OBJECTIVES: A recent multicenter randomized control trial demonstrated similar quality of life at 1 year after open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) compared with nonoperative treatment for stress-positive unstable isolated lateral malleolar fractures. We sought to determine the cost-effectiveness of ORIF compared with nonoperative management of these isolated lateral malleolar fractures.
DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis using decision tree and Markov modeling based on data from a prospective randomized control trial and previously published literature. A single-payer perspective with 1-year and lifetime time horizons was adopted.
SETTING: Clinical trial data from 6 Canadian level I trauma hospitals.
INTERVENTION: Lateral malleolus ORIF versus nonoperative treatment.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).
RESULTS: The base case 1-year ICER of the ORIF treatment was $205,090 per quality-adjusted life year gained, favoring nonoperative treatment. For the lifetime time horizon, ORIF becomes the preferred treatment with an ICER of $16,404 per quality-adjusted life year gained. This conclusion is stable provided ORIF lowers the lifetime incidence of ankle arthrosis by >3% compared with nonoperative treatment. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that 33% of model simulations favored ORIF in the 1-year time horizon and 65% of simulations in the lifetime time horizon.
CONCLUSIONS: From a single-payer governmental perspective, ORIF does not seem to be cost effective in the 1-year time horizon; however, if operative fixation decreases the lifetime incidence of posttraumatic ankle arthrosis by >3%, then ORIF becomes the economically preferred treatment.

Some factors that contribute to better preparedness are past experience, awareness of what to do in a disaster scenario and availability, and access to informational and supportive resources. We examine whether an experience of a natural disaster brings about changes in preparedness and access to resources.
DESIGN: Our study is based on data from 2 cross-sectional random-digit-dialing surveys in 2008 (pre-Ike) and 2009 (post-Ike) with sample sizes of 1001 and 1009, respectively.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults living in one of the 85 zip codes in Houston, Texas.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Self-reported preparedness, evacuation plan, available resources (informational, financial and emotional).
RESULTS: We found no significant changes in preparedness or evacuation plans in residents of Houston prior to and a year after Hurricane Ike. Hispanics and other minority groups reported a significant increase in access to information and all residents reported an increase in perception of availability of financial support, if needed. Perceived availability of tangible (financial) support has been linked to positive physical and mental health effects and can contribute to resiliency and quicker recovery. The unchanged preparedness levels could be attributed to ceiling effects, that is, the already high levels of preparedness reported by Houston residents. Greater access to information reported by Hispanics and other minorities is encouraging and indicative of success in reaching out.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results also indicate a greater need for appropriate targeted strategies to reach out to African Americans in Houston since this group reported poorer access to information. This has implications for planning and preparedness officials and the communication strategies used to reach the community."

The preface for ANA's PHN Scope and Standards encourages using the standards as the basis of PHN job descriptions. This study sought to assess the extent to which PHN job descriptions are aligned with the ANA's PHN Scope and Standards and the Quad Council competencies.
DESIGN: We obtained PHN job descriptions from 3 local health departments in Illinois and 3 in Washington. Statements from the job descriptions were content analyzed, categorizing statements into the 16 ANA PHN Scope and Standards and using Quad Council competencies as additional definitions of each category. To code all job statements related to PHN practice, 2 categories were added which were MPH competencies from the Associations of Schools of Public Health. Interrater reliability was established.
RESULTS: All 18 PHN job descriptions had statements related to Standard 5 Implementation, followed by 94% of the job descriptions having statements related to assessment, planning, coordination of services, health education/health promotion, and collaboration. The least frequently (22%) included standard was outcome identification.
CONCLUSIONS: Attention to human resource management is necessary to align job descriptions with current professional scope and standards for basic and advanced PHN practice. The lack of statements regarding Outcome Identification has serious implications for PHN involvement in quality improvement and health planning."
22473595,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22473595/,"BACKGROUND: Cancer of unknown primary (CUP) is diagnosed at the metastatic stage. We aimed to identify hidden primary cancers in CUP patients by comparison with cancers in family members. We take use of the fact that the cause of death in CUP patients is often coded as the cancer in the organ of fatal metastasis.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-one thousand five hundred and twenty-three CUP patients were identified in the Swedish Family-Cancer Database, and relative risks (RRs) were calculated for cancer in offspring when family members were diagnosed with CUP and died of the cancer diagnosed in offspring.
RESULTS: The RR for lung cancer in offspring was 1.85 when a family member was diagnosed with CUP and died of lung cancer. Significant familial associations were found for seven other cancers. Many familial associations were also significant when offspring CUP patients died of the cancer diagnosed in family members.
CONCLUSIONS: The cause of death after CUP diagnosis frequently matched the cancer found in a family member, suggesting that the CUP had originated in that tissue. The metastasis had probably undergone a phenotypic change, complicating pathological tissue assignment. These novel data suggest that some CUP cases are phenotypically modified primary cancers rather than cancers of unknown primaries."
22473753,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22473753/,"BACKGROUND: Coping with cancer is affected by cultural norms, beliefs, and perceptions. To date, only a few studies have examined how Arab women cope with breast cancer and how the illness affects their lives. We aimed to study how Arab women perceive and ascribe meaning to their illness and its personal, familial, and social implications and to examine their coping strategies within the religious and traditional cultural context.
METHODS: The study was qualitative. Participants were 20 Muslim and Christian Arab women with breast cancer (stages I-III) from northern Israel, aged 20-50 years. Participants were between 1 and 5 years after chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted and later transcribed.
RESULTS: Four main themes emerged: (i) ""Family Comes First"": The Woman and Her Family; (ii) To Expose or not to Expose? That's the Dilemma; (iii) Faith in God as a Source of Coping; and (iv) Constructing New Meanings Following Recovery from Cancer. Findings stressed a duality in participants' cancer coping experience according to the traditional cultural norms of concealment, while simultaneously encountering more open Western attitudes through interactions with healthcare providers and Jewish women receiving treatment alongside them.
CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare professionals should be aware of the unique implications of cancer in the context of the traditional Arab culture intertwined with modernization processes. This context calls for interventions that consider the understandings depicted in the present study."
22474211,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22474211/,"BACKGROUND: Despite the increased prenatal diagnosis of congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT), no reliable renal marker for glomerular filtration rate (GFR) has been validated yet in neonates. Cystatin C (CysC) is specific to the neonate and is proposed as a sensitive marker for this population. The aims of the study were first to define a reference interval in our center of CysC at birth in normal term babies and assess CysC as a marker of GFR in a group of term neonates prenatally diagnosed with CAKUT compared to controls.
METHODS: One hundred normal term neonates (control group) and 33 neonates with kidney malformation (KM) had the CysC levels in their cord blood measured. A reference interval for CysC in controls was calculated using non-parametric methods. CysC from controls was compared first to the whole group of neonates with KM, then with KM group divided in infants (n = 20) with unilateral kidney malformation (UKM) and those (n = 13) with bilateral kidney malformation (BKM). A multivariable analysis was performed to assess the difference in CysC between the groups with adjustment on other factors. The ability of CysC to discriminate neonates with BKM from the controls was assessed by a non-parametric receiver-operated characteristics (ROC) curve.
RESULTS: In the control group, the CysC reference interval was [1.54-2.64] mg/L with a median (M) CysC of 2.02 IQR [1.86-2.23]. In the neonates with KM, M CysC was 1.98 IQR [1.79-2.34]; 1.88 IQR [1.76-2.01] in the UKM group and 2.52 IQR [2.16-2.71] in BKM group. Using a multivariate regression analyses, CysC was significantly increased (P < 0.001) in BKM compared to controls with an increment of CysC of 24.5%, and independent from gender, weight and size. The ROC curve analyses, comparing BKM versus controls with a chosen cut-off for CysC of 2.34, showed a sensitivity of 69% and a specificity of 86%.
CONCLUSIONS: Comparing CysC with a reference interval of CysC validated in our center, we showed a significant increase of CysC in neonates presenting BKM compared to controls and those with UKM."
22474739,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22474739/,"BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: Patient gender can affect not only the clinical manifestations of coronary artery disease (CAD) but also the clinician's interpretation of the symptoms and results of exercise stress tests for management decisions. This may be true also for aortic stenosis (AS), given its many shared features with CAD and similar symptom-based management. The study aim was to evaluate the effect of gender on the assessment of severe asymptomatic AS by exercise stress echocardiography (ESE).
METHODS: A total of 160 patients (89 males, 71 females) with severe asymptomatic AS and good left ventricular function underwent ESE for assessment of their clinical status. Of these patients, 133 (83%) were followed up after echocardiography for a mean of 644 +/- 467 days. The findings and outcome were compared between males and females.
RESULTS: No gender-related differences were identified for mean age, baseline and peak exercise heart rates and blood pressures, aortic valve area, and prevalence of CAD. Female patients had a lower exercise capacity (shorter exercise time, lower exercise load), but there were no significant between-group differences in the exercise-related parameters defining AS. In total, 38 women (24%) and 45 men (28%) were treated by aortic valve replacement (p = 0.2) within a similar time range from echocardiography (p = 0.6).
CONCLUSION: Asymptomatic women with severe AS have similar rates of abnormal ESE as men, despite limitations in exercise capacity among women compared to men."
22475354,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22475354/,"BACKGROUND: The causes of cardiovascular collapse (CC) during hemorrhagic shock (HS) are unknown. We hypothesized that vascular tone loss characterizes CC, and that arterial pulse pressure/stroke volume index ratio or vascular tone index (VTI) would identify CC.
METHODS: Fourteen Yorkshire-Durock pigs were bled to 30 mmHg mean arterial pressure and held there by repetitive bleeding until rendered unable to compensate (CC) or for 90 min (NoCC). They were then resuscitated in equal parts to shed volume and observed for 2 h. CC was defined as a MAP < 30 mmHg for 10 min or <20 mmHg for 10 s. Study variables were recorded at baseline (B0), 30, 60, 90 min after bleeding and at resuscitation (R0), 30, and 60 min afterward.
RESULTS: Swine were bled to 32% ± 9% of total blood volume. Epinephrine (Epi) and VTI were low and did not change in NoCC after bleeding compared with CC swine, in which both increased (0.97 ± 0.22 to 2.57 ± 1.42 mcg/dL, and 173 ± 181 to 939 ± 474 mmHg/mL, respectively), despite no differences in bled volume. Lactate increase rate (LIR) increased with hemorrhage and was higher at R0 for CC, but did not vary in NoCC. VTI identified CC from NoCC and survivors from non-survivors before CC. A large increase in LIR was coincident with VTI decrement before CC occurred.
CONCLUSIONS: Vasodilatation immediately prior to CC in severe HS occurs at the same time as an increase in LIR, suggesting loss of tone as the mechanism causing CC, and energy failure as its probable cause."
22475738,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22475738/,"INTRODUCTION: Diagnosis of Brugada syndrome (BS) currently requires documentation of a characteristic repolarization pattern (type 1 Brugada ECG). Mutations in the SCN5A gene, which codes for sodium channel Na(v) 1.5, are found in 38% of familial cases of BS. Sodium current dysfunction negatively affects the cardiac fast response action potential, particularly in atrial and ventricular myocytes and in the fast-conducting Purkinje system.
OBJECTIVES: To detect carriers of SCN5A mutations without using the characteristic repolarization pattern (type 1 Brugada ECG).
METHODS: Of a total of 141 members of three different families including 55 carriers of two nonsense SCN5A mutations causing BS, all those aged over 16 (113 individuals, 42 carriers) were studied. The PR interval (PR) and QT dispersion (QTd) between leads V1 and V3 were measured on conventional ECG. Using signal-averaged ECG the total duration of the filtered QRS complex (fQRS), the root-mean-square (RMS40) and the low-amplitude signal (LAS) were measured. The following procedures were developed to detect carriers/To detect carriers the following procedures were developed: (1) a screening test (ScreenTest) with PS (PR+fQRS) > or = 250 (250ms is 80% of the theoretical maximum in healthy individuals); and (2) a diagnostic test (DiagTest) for the simultaneous fulfillment of four conditions: PS > or = 250 and QTd > or = 10 and LAS > 26 and RMS40 < or = 29 (the latter two cut-offs are approximately 70% of the theoretical maximum in healthy carriers).
RESULTS: Significant differences in PR, QTd, QRSf, RMS40 and LAS were found between carriers and non-carriers. The SCN5A gene was associated with all these variables, the strongest association being with PR. Both tests were applied to 63 family members (38 carriers). The ScreenTest was positive in 38 of 38 carriers, with eight false positives in 27 non-carriers (sensitivity [SE] = 100% and specificity [SP] = 66.67%). From ROC curve analysis a cut-off of PS = 252.5 shows SE = 100% and SP = 76% and a cut-off of PS = 260 shows SE=94.7% and SP = 84%. The DiagTest was positive in 36 of 38 carriers, with three false positives: SE = 94.74% and SP = 88.89%. From ROC curve analysis a multivariate logistic model identifies a cut-off with SE = 92% and SP = 92%. In the same group the SE and SP of the characteristic spontaneous repolarization pattern (type 1 Brugada ECG) to detect carriers were 52.4% and 97.2%, respectively, and the difference between the SE of the DiagTest and of the typical repolarization pattern is statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: The ScreenTest and DiagTest are more effective tools than the characteristic repolarization pattern to discriminate between carriers and non-carriers of these two nonsense SCN5A mutations. We suggest their use in first-degree relatives of Brugada patients when the results of genetic testing are not available, in a score of disease probability in individuals with idiopathic Brugada ECG, and in patients with arrhythmias or other Brugada-related symptoms presenting type 2 or type 3 Brugada ECG."
22475762,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22475762/,"BACKGROUND: The incidence of difficult intubations in morbidly obese patients has been reported to be 12-20%; however, no well-established predictors of a difficult intubation exist for this patient population. Our objective was to evaluate the factors associated with a difficult intubation in morbidly obese patients undergoing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass at an integrated multispecialty health system with a 325-bed community teaching hospital serving 19 counties.
METHODS: The anesthetic records of patients undergoing LRYGB from 2001 to 2010 were reviewed. Difficult intubations were defined as direct laryngoscopy graded ≥1 on a 0-2 difficulty scale and unplanned fiberoptic intubations. Statistical analysis included chi-square, univariate, and multivariate logistic regression.
RESULTS: A total of 915 consecutive patients underwent LRYGB during the study period. Of these, 3 patients were excluded because of incomplete data. Of the 912 included patients, 25 (2.7%) underwent planned fiberoptic intubation, 830 (91%) had an uneventful intubation, and 57 (6.3%) had a difficult intubation. Difficult intubations were more common in men than in women (11% versus 6%, P = .027). Difficult intubations were not associated with an increasing preoperative body mass index (P = .073), the presence of obstructive sleep apnea (P = .784), or the presence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (P = .335). Multivariate predictors of a difficult intubation were Mallampati class 4 (odds ratio [OR] 2.76, P = .035), abnormal thyromental distance (OR 4.39, P = .001), restricted jaw mobility (OR 3.26, P = .018), and a history of a difficult intubation (OR 4.17, P = .002).
CONCLUSIONS: An increased Mallampati class, abnormal thyromental distance, restricted jaw mobility, and a history of difficult intubations were independent predictors of a difficult intubation. An increasing body mass index did not predict for a difficult intubation."
22475813,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22475813/,"OBJECTIVE: Disinvestment has been defined as the explicit process of cutting funding, either totally or partially, from health technologies deemed of low-value. Studies of geographic variation in medical practice have been suggested to be useful in guiding decisions on disinvestment, as they may identify unwarranted variations in procedure-rates at the population level. This study aimed to determine the utility of these studies.
METHODS: We performed an ecologic study of variations in standardized rates in four «low-value» interventions: proctologic surgery, arthroplasty revision, incisional hernia repair and tonsillectomy. Variation across 199 healthcare areas within the Spanish national health system between 2002 and 2007 was studied by using the extremal quotient (EQ), the empirical Bayes statistic (EB) and the standardized utilization ratio (SUR).
RESULTS: A total of 168,363 proctologic interventions, 41,066 arthroplasty revisions, 222,427 incisional hernia repairs, and 72,724 tonsillectomies were studied. The EQ ranged from a 3-fold variation in proctologic surgery to a 6.5-fold variation in tonsillectomy. The EB figures varied from moderate to high systematic variation: 0.12 in hernia repair and proctology, 0.20 in arthroplasty revision, and 0.30 in tonsillectomy. Twenty-five percent of the healthcare areas showed SUR figures above 1.24 in proctologic interventions, 1.25 in arthroplasty revision, 1.32 in hernia repair and 1.35 in tonsillectomy.
CONCLUSIONS: The interventions studied showed moderate to high systematic variation, supporting the usefulness of variation studies in guiding disinvestment policies. Nevertheless, caution should be exercised when evaluating interventions with an uncertain risk-benefit ratio."
22475894,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22475894/,"PURPOSE: Effective management of patients affected by retroperitoneal fibrosis (RPF) is an important issue because of lack of relevant parameters to objectively assess the degree of inflammation. We evaluated added value of contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CE-CT) combined with fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) as a one-stop diagnostic procedure for the assessment and follow-up of patients with RPF.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: (18)F-FDG PET and CE-CT findings were reviewed in 10 patients suffering from RPF. Maximum standard uptake values (on native and contrast-enhanced [ESUV(max)] CT) were calculated. Dimensions of periaortitis were measured on CT scans. Observed clinical changes between baseline PET scan (T0) and at 6 months follow-up (T6) were analyzed regarding differences of initial values for clinic and paraclinic parameters.
RESULTS: Patients still suffering from pain 6 months after baseline PET scan had initially higher FDG uptake (ESUV(max): 5.7 ± 0.9 vs. 2.4 ± 0.9, P < 0.01). Unlike biologic and CT parameters, FDG uptake was the most relevant parameter to measure severity of inflammation (ESUV(max) threshold: 4.3; Se = Sp = 1.0). CE-CT exclusively allowed better delineation and more accurate assessment of FDG uptake of periaortitis and its extension to adjacent structures.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results clearly show the usefulness of PET/CT for better evaluation and management of patients with fibroblast proliferation disease. Accurate determination of inflammation level is significantly improved when PET/CT and CE-CT are performed in the same study and used for better delineation of areas of residual inflammation."

METHODS: From 2004 to 2008, patients (N=325) hospitalized with schizophrenia or schizoaffective or bipolar disorder enrolled in a medication management program before discharge or at their first clinic appointment. Medication management coordinators supplemented existing clinic practices by identifying recently hospitalized patients, providing inpatient and outpatient prescribing clinicians with patients' complete medication history, meeting with patients for six months postdischarge to assess clinical status and provide medication education, and advocating guideline-concordant prescribing. Recently discharged patients (N=345) assigned to a different outpatient clinic within the same agency served as the comparison group. Intent-to-treat, repeated-measures analyses for mixed models compared the groups' number of hospital admissions, hospital days, and medication appointments kept and use of nurse or case manager contact hours and emergency or crisis services during the 12 months before enrollment, the six-month intervention, and the six-month follow-up period.
RESULTS: After discharge, individuals enrolled in medication management were more likely than comparison patients to attend outpatient appointments, and they had more medication visits and nurse or case manager treatment hours than the comparison group. Use of hospital and crisis or emergency services by all patients decreased. Almost one-third of patients never attended an outpatient appointment after hospital discharge.
CONCLUSIONS: Although this program succeeded in improving continuity of care, additional interventions may be required to reduce rehospitalization and crisis care."

METHODS: A prospective, case-control study was performed from October 2010 to May 2011, in outpatients without significant gastroduodenal disease. The presence or absence of IM was diagnosed by gastric biopsies (case or control, respectively). H. Pylori infection, age, sex, smoking, alcohol drinking, family history of gastric cancer and bile reflux were evaluated. Odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% CIs were estimated by logistic regression.
RESULTS: A total of 440 patients (88 cases and 352 controls) were studied, with a mean age ± SD of 44.3 ± 15.7 years; 58.2% were women. Prevalence of HP infection was 51.6% in the population and 46.6% in patients with IM. The mean age was significantly higher in cases (56.5 years vs. 39, p = 0.0005), whereas no differences in other variables studied. In bivariate analysis, only age ≥ 50 years was a risk factor (OR = 4.47, 95% CI 2.66-7.57), whereas in multivariate analysis the risk factors were age ≥ 50 years (OR = 4.67, 95% CI 2.79-7.81), bile reflux (OR = 3.66, 95% CI 1.71-7.83) and history of alcohol drinking (OR = 2.31, 95% CI 1.33-4.03). HP infection showed an OR less < 1 (OR = 0.85, 95% CI 0.51-1.41).
CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors associated with the presence of IM in outpatients without significant gastroduodenal disease were age ≥ 50 years, bile reflux and a history of alcohol drinking in the population studied. H. Pylori infection was not associated as risk factor for IM."

METHODS: Raters reviewed the records of applicants who completed an initial psychiatric interview and compared those who had psychotic symptoms with all other study-eligible participants and with those who ultimately were enrolled in the study.
RESULTS: Of 223 consecutively evaluated individuals who applied for study entry, 38 (17%) were found ineligible because of psychotic symptoms. These individuals were more likely to be male and to have suffered child abuse, and they had taken a greater number of lifetime medications than study-eligible applicants. Most individuals with psychotic symptoms met DSM-IV criteria for PTSD.
CONCLUSIONS: A trauma-informed framework might be a helpful part of a comprehensive treatment plan for some individuals with psychotic symptoms, possibly leading to greater treatment engagement and more positive outcomes."

METHODS: We studied 3,181 men and 3,359 women, all middle-aged and working at least 30 h per week, recruited from the general population of Malmö, Sweden, in 1992. The participation rate was 41 %. Baseline data include sociodemographics, the Job Content Questionnaire, lifestyle, and health-related variables. Disability pension information was obtained through record linkage from the National Health Insurance Register.
RESULTS: Nearly 20 % of the women and 15 % of the men were granted a disability pension during the follow-up period. The highest quartile of psychological job demands and the lowest quartile of decision latitude were associated with disability pensions when controlling for age, socioeconomic position, and health risk behaviours. In the final model, with adjustment also for health indicators and stress from outside the workplace, the hazard ratios for high strain jobs (i.e. high psychological demands in combination with low decision latitude) were 1.5 in men (95 % CI, 1.04-2.0) and 1.7 in women (95 % CI, 1.3-2.2). Stratifying for health at baseline showed that high strain tended to affect healthy but not unhealthy men, while this pattern was reversed in women.
CONCLUSIONS: High psychological demands, low decision latitude, and job strain were all confirmed as independent risk factors for subsequent disability pensions. In order to increase chances of individuals remaining in the work force, interventions against these adverse psychosocial factors appear worthwhile."
22476896,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22476896/,"BACKGROUND: Implantation of an antibiotic bone cement spacer is used to treat infection of a TKA. Dynamic spacers fashioned with cement-on-cement articulating surfaces potentially facilitate patient mobility and reduce bone loss as compared with their static counterparts, while consisting of a biomaterial not traditionally used for load-bearing articulations. However, their direct impact on patient mobility and wear damage while implanted remains poorly understood.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We characterized patient activity, surface damage, and porous structure of dynamic cement-on-cement spacers.
METHODS: We collected 22 dynamic and 14 static knee antibiotic cement spacers at revision surgeries at times ranging from 0.5 to 13 months from implantation. For these patients, we obtained demographic data and UCLA activity levels. We characterized surface damage using the Hood damage scoring method and used micro-CT analysis to observe the internal structure, cracking, and porosity of the cement.
RESULTS: The average UCLA score was higher for patients with dynamic spacers than for patients with static spacers, with no differences in BMI or age. Burnishing was the only prevalent damage mode on all the bearing surfaces. Micro-CT analysis revealed the internal structure of the spacers was porous and highly inhomogeneous, including heterogeneous dispersion of radiopaque material and cavity defects. The average porosity was 8% (range, 1%-29%) and more than ½ of the spacers had pores greater than 1 mm in diameter.
CONCLUSIONS: Our observations suggest dynamic, cement-on-cement spacers allow for increased patient activity without catastrophic failure. Despite the antibiotic loading and internal structural inhomogeneity, burnishing was the only prevalent damage mode that could be consistently classified with no evidence of fracture or delamination. The porous structure of the spacers varied highly across the surfaces without influencing the material failure."
22477731,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22477731/,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the safety and efficacy of stroke thrombolysis in a local hospital.
DESIGN: Historical cohort study.
SETTING: A tertiary hospital in Hong Kong.
PATIENTS: The outcome of acute ischaemic stroke patients treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator between October 2008 and May 2011 was compared to those admitted during the same period who were thrombolysis-eligible, but treated conservatively due to unavailability of the thrombolysis service after-hours.
INTERVENTIONS: Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was functional independence (modified Rankin Scale score of 2 or below) at 3 months. Safety outcomes were symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage and 3-month mortality. Secondary outcomes were hospital length of stay, direct home discharge, and nursing home discharge.
RESULTS: A total of 48 thrombolysis and 63 non-thrombolysis patients were identified. Fifty-two percent of the thrombolysis group achieved functional independence compared to 24% of non-thrombolysis group (P=0.003), without significant increase in mortality (15% vs 13%, P=0.51) or symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (4% vs 2%, P=0.58). Twenty-nine percent of the thrombolysis group patients were discharged home directly, versus 6% of non-thrombolysis group (P<0.001). Mean length of stay was shorter for the thrombolysis group (25 vs 35 days; P=0.034). A similar percentage from each group was discharged to nursing homes.
CONCLUSION: Implementation of the stroke thrombolysis service in Hong Kong appeared safe and efficacious. Patients who received thrombolysis had better outcomes compared to non-thrombolysis cohort. Further studies are needed to investigate the economics of stroke thrombolysis in Hong Kong, which may help to improve funding for provision of this service."
11850748,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11850748/,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the relation between adiposity and risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in normal weight (NW) individuals.
METHODS: Cross-sectional study using the sample of white people, aged from 17 to 60 y from the Québec Family Study and the Heritage Family Study. NW subjects with a body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 and 25 kg/m(2) (181 males and 265 females) and overweight (OW) subjects with a BMI between 25 and 30 kg/m(2) (133 males and 114 females) were retained for this study. NW subjects were divided into quintiles of each adiposity variable, then the quintiles and the OW group were evaluated for the presence of CVD risk factors. Using logistic regression analysis, the odds ratio (OR) for the prevalence of risk factors for each quintile of each adiposity variable and the OW group was estimated relative to the first quintile in NW subjects. Mean values of adiposity variables were compared between the subjects with and without risk factors. In these analyses, age and study cohort effects were taken into account.
MEASUREMENTS: Percentage body fat (%fat) and fat mass (FM) measured by underwater weighing were available as adiposity variables. Risk factors included systolic and diastolic blood pressure, LDL and HDL cholesterol, triglycerides and fasting glucose.
RESULTS: Wide ranges of values were observed for adiposity variables. HDL cholesterol, triglycerides and fasting glucose in NW males and HDL cholesterol in NW females were significantly correlated with all adiposity variables. For males, higher quintiles of adiposity variables in the NW group and the OW group tended to have higher ORs compared to the first quintiles for the risk factor variables. The fifth quintiles of all adiposity variables had the highest ORs (3.15 for %fat and 3.77 for FM) and they were significantly different from the first quintiles. OW males had ORs similar to those of the fifth quintiles for the risk factor variables. On the other hand, for females, the relatively linear associations were less clear in the NW group. In NW males, the subjects with at least one risk factor had significantly higher %fat and FM than the subjects without risk factors. In NW females, no significant difference was observed for these adiposity variables between the subjects with and without risk factors.
CONCLUSION: NW males with elevated adiposity had higher prevalence of risk factors than NW males with less adiposity and the prevalence in the former was rather similar to that seen in OW males. On the other hand, measures of adiposity added little additional information to the BMI classification of NW on CVD risk factors in females."
11851072,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11851072/,"OBJECTIVES: With the discussion about measures to reduce over-capacities in the health services in mind, we examined the influence of medical supply structures and services on hospital utilisation directly before death.
METHODS: Based on the specification of the place of dying from the death certificates, we determined the proportions of deaths in hospitals in an ecological study. We analysed deaths of persons above age 65 in each of the 106 mobility regions of Switzerland in the years 1979 to 1980.
RESULTS: The proportion of deaths occurring in hospitals varied between 27% and 81%. Despite missing data regarding stationary and ambulatory care services, more than half of the variance could be explained by means of a multivariate regression analysis. Our results imply an inverse relation between the proportion of deaths in the hospital and the number of consultations provided by primary care physicians, as well as the number of nursing home beds. Further, we observe a direct relation to the number of hospital beds in a region. All indicators are calculated per inhabitant.
CONCLUSIONS: In health care supply planning, such systematic associations should be taken into account. We recommend to analyse regularly interregional differences in supply and outcome of medical performances with the best available data."
11851615,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11851615/,"OBJECTIVE: To review experience with open surgery for paediatric urolithiasis during a 10-year period.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The hospital records of patients up to 13 years old and treated between 1990 and 2000 for stones were reviewed; there were 310 patients (98 girls and 212 boys, aged 9 months to 13 years, mean 6.8 years).
RESULTS: The commonest symptoms were renal-ureteric colic (26.7%), gross haematuria (19%), urinary retention (16.7%), and abdominal and/or flank pain (13.2%). Because of poverty and the resultant inability to pay medical fees, 19 children presented very late with pyonephrosis (resembling peritonitis in nine) and obstructive renal atrophy in 23. In 18 other patients the delay was caused by the disappearance of pain. Delayed presentation was the most important factor in developing complications from the stone. The stones were in the calyces in 15 patients, the pelvis in 113, the ureter in 56, the bladder in 71, the urethra in 17 and in a combination of sites in 38. The mean (range, median) stone size was 27 (9-75, 22) mm; 80 (25.8%) were complete staghorn stones. Indications for open surgery were a complex stone burden (62%), ESWL failure (14.5%), need for nephrectomy (1.9%), anatomical abnormalities (2.2%), and unavailability of minimally invasive alternatives (19%). All of the nephrectomized patients underwent unilateral stone removal and contralateral nephrectomy. For parents, the cost and reliability of the result were more important than other considerations, e.g. having a large or small incision. The overall stone-free rate at discharge was 95.4% (100% for single stones). In five cases (1.6%) a repeat open procedure was needed. The mean (range, median) hospital stay was 4 (1-13, 3) days.
CONCLUSIONS: Arguments against open surgery for urolithiasis in adults should not be extrapolated to children, in whom open surgery is safe and effective. In Iran and many 'developing' countries, open surgery is less expensive, more effective, more dependable, and more easily available than minimally invasive alternatives. At least in such countries it deserves to be among the first-line therapies for paediatric urolithiasis, and urologists in less-developed countries should not decline to offer open surgery because it is almost obsolete in developed countries. Delayed presentation (through poverty and/or unawareness) contributes significantly to the morbidity of urolithiasis."
11851769,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11851769/,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to investigate the value of new nocturnal penile tumescence recording parameters, such as tumescence activity unit and rigidity activity unit values, total erection number and erection times, in differentiating between psychogenic erectile dysfunction and organic erectile dysfunction. We also aimed to determine the role of these parameters in differentiating arterial erectile dysfunction from veno-occlusive dysfunction.
METHODS: Eighty-seven consecutive patients were allocated into three groups as psychogenic, arterial and venous erectile dysfunction after investigations. Nocturnal penile tumescence recording parameters between psychogenic and vascular erectile dysfunction and arterial and veno-occlusive dysfunction were compared. Mann-Whitney U-test, Pearson's chi2 test and correlation coefficient tests were used for statistical analysis.
RESULTS: Depending on intracavernous injection, penile Doppler ultrasonography and cavernosometry tests, 37 patients (43%) had psychogenic impotence while 50 (57%) had organic pathologies. Of the 50 patients diagnosed with vascular impotence, 29 (48%) had arterial failure and 21 (42%) had veno-occlusive dysfunction. Nocturnal penile tumescence recording revealed psychogenic erectile dysfunction in 34 patients (39%) and vascular erectile dysfunction in 53 patients (61%). Nocturnal penile tumescence recording has been regarded as the gold standard and, in our series, it showed 90.6% sensitivity and 88.2% specificity in differentiating the cause of erectile dysfunction. Values of rigidity activity unit and tumescence activity unit were significantly higher in patients with psychogenic impotence (P < 0.001), when compared with vascular impotence. In patients with a vascular cause, no difference was found between arterial failure and veno-occlusive dysfunction with regard to tip tumescence activity unit, base tumescence activity unit, tip rigidity activity unit, base rigidity activity unit and erection time (P > 0.001). However, patients with arterial failure had less erection than patients with veno-occlusive dysfunction (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: New recording parameters of nocturnal penile tumescence can differentiate organic and psychogenic erectile dysfunction more precisely. However, these recording parameters cannot distinguish subgroups with a vascular cause of erectile dysfunction."
11852020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11852020/,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Before including troponin I detection in the daily practice of our hospital we performed a prospective study to determine its real usefulness and to establish the best cut-off point.
METHODS: We studied 82 consecutive patients admitted with unstable angina to a community hospital. Troponin I was determined (> 10 h after chest pain). Patients were referred to a tertiary hospital for catheterization/revascularization if clinical events developed.
RESULTS: Twenty-five patients (31%) suffered events during admission: recurrent angina in 23 cases (28%); heart failure in 5 (6%); exitus in 3 (4%); myocardial infarction in 1 (1%). The cut-off point for troponin I that best predicted events was 0.1 ng/ml. Patients with troponin I > 0.1 (34 patients, 42%) experienced more events [47 vs. 19%; OR = 3.8 (1.4-10.4); p = 0.01] and had higher rates of recurrent angina (42 vs. 19%), heart failure (12 vs. 2%) and exitus (9 vs 0%). Patients with ECG changes and troponin I > 0.1 showed a significantly higher percentage of events (63%) than those with ECG changes alone (23%) or troponin I > 0.1 alone (15%) or those without ECG changes and troponin I < 0.1 (17%) (p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Troponin I elevation is useful for predicting in-hospital risk for unstable angina patients admitted to a community hospital. A low cut-off value (0.1 ng/ml) predicts events. The association of ECG changes and high troponin I identifies a population at very high risk; however, the absence of both variables in patients with a diagnosis of unstable angina does not preclude the development of events."
11852023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11852023/,"INTRODUCTION: [corrected] Perioperative cardiovascular complications are an important cause of post-surgical morbility and mortality in patients undergoing major vascular surgery. Dobutamine Stress Echo is considered one of the methods of choice in the detection of coronary artery disease in this subgroup of patients.
OBJECTIVES: . Our aim was to analyze if dipyridamole stress echocardiography could be used as an alternative to Dobutamine Stress Echo in the perioperative evaluation of patients in need of major vascular surgery.
PATIENTS AND METHOD: The result of consecutives dypiridamole and dobutamine stress exams prior to vascular surgery were reviewed. We analyzed if those patients with a positive stress echo presented a higher number of cardiac events during and after surgery than those with negative stress echo. The negative and positive predictive values were calculated for both techniques.
RESULTS: 133 stress exams were analysed: 39 with dobutamine and 94 with dipyridamole. Of the 39 dobutamine studies 2 were positive, 29 negatives and 8 non conclusive. Of the 94 dypiridamole studies 13 were positive and 81 negatives. None of the patients with a positive dobutamine echo underwent surgery. The negative predictive value for dobutamine echo was 96.5%, quite similar to that of dypiridamole stress echo (97.5%).
CONCLUSION: Dipyridamole stress echocardiography is a valid alternative to dobutamine echocardiography in the pre-surgical evaluation of patients undergoing major vascular surgery."
11852330,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11852330/,"PURPOSE: Pudendal nerve terminal motor latency testing is useful as a diagnostic tool in fecal incontinence. It has also been used as a predictive factor in sphincteroplasty repairs. The technique is seldom taught and mastered in colorectal training programs. The purpose of this study was to assess a learning curve for teaching this procedure.
METHODS: The student was a formally trained colorectal surgeon with no pudendal nerve terminal motor latency experience; the instructor has performed more than 3,000 pudendal nerve terminal motor latency studies. Fifty consecutive patients had manometry and pudendal nerve terminal motor latency testing. Both the student and instructor performed pudendal nerve terminal motor latency in a sequential fashion. Variables collected included pudendal nerve terminal motor latency, completion of test, time to complete test, and accuracy of the test. Variables were analyzed with paired t-test and chi-squared analysis.
RESULTS: The study group included 41 female and 9 male patients. The average age of the patients was 53 years. Bowel complaints included constipation in 16 and incontinence in 34 patients. Data were analyzed in their entirety and at ten-patient intervals. The student tended to record longer latencies (P < 0.001). This led to false-positive rates of 23 and 21 percent, respectively, for left and right pudendal nerve terminal motor latency. On average, the time to complete the procedure was three times longer for the student than for the instructor (P < 0.001). At ten-patient intervals, the pudendal nerve terminal motor latency difference between the two groups disappeared at the 41-to-50-patient mark.
CONCLUSION: Given the proper learning environment, pudendal nerve terminal motor latency testing can be mastered in a relatively short period. On the basis of this study, our estimation is 40 patients are required for a student to master this technique. The novice examiner can expect false-positive results early in the learning curve, and these should be validated accordingly."
11852334,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11852334/,"PURPOSE: There is significant concern in the current literature over the safety of laparoscopic techniques in removal of the entire colon and rectum. The purpose of this study was to examine the results of a one-stage laparoscopic-assisted restorative proctocolectomy in patients with mucosal ulcerative colitis and familial adenomatous polyposis in a single institution experience.
METHODS: All patients who underwent laparoscopic-assisted one-stage restorative proctocolectomy (29 mucosal ulcerative colitis; 3 familial adenomatous polyposis) over a 24-month period were followed up prospectively for short-term and long-term complications and functional outcome.
RESULTS: There were 32 patients (17 males), with a median age of 32 years (range, 16-29 years). There were no conversions to open surgery. There were two intraoperative complications, an inconsequential rectal perforation during mobilization and one staple line misfire. There were 11 postoperative complications: 3 obstruction/ileus, 2 pouchitis, 2 wound infections, 2 strictures, 1 pelvic abscess, and 1 pouch leak (at the top of the ""J""). Three patients required reoperation (1 temporary ileostomy, 1 lysis of adhesions, and 1 transpouch drainage). The median number of bowel movements was seven per day (range, 2-15).
CONCLUSION: A one-stage laparoscopic-assisted restorative proctocolectomy can be performed effectively and safely. Given that techniques in laparoscopic large-bowel surgery are still evolving rapidly, the role of this operation in the surgical treatment of patients with mucosal ulcerative colitis and familial adenomatous polyposis is likely to expand in the near future."
11852748,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11852748/,"PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to compare self-reported knowledge about A1C testing with information from the medical record.
METHODS: A telephone survey was conducted among patients with diabetes in a rural fee-for-service practice and a community health center. Self-reported information regarding A1C testing, the last A1C value, and perceived blood glucose control was compared with the most current A1C value documented in the medical record.
RESULTS: Seventy five percent of survey respondents reported having 1 or more A1C tests in the past year, which generally agreed with information from their medical records. However, only 24% of those who reported having a test remembered the actual value, and the self-reported values correlated weakly with the last A1C on the medical record. Among those with a documented A1C value, half described their blood glucose as very well controlled. The last A1C value, however, was < 7.0% in only half of those respondents.
CONCLUSIONS: Persons with diabetes were aware of their previous A1C testing but did not interpret the values accurately in relation to their own glycemic control. If clinicians expect patient knowledge and understanding of glycemic control measures to improve outcomes of care, patient education will need to emphasize the meaning of these values."
11854335,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11854335/,"BACKGROUND: Research on the aetiology of sudden cardiac death among young men in Russia strongly suggests an association with binge drinking. However, the possibility remains that such deaths are misclassified as being attributable to cardiovascular disease when they are really caused by acute alcohol poisoning.
OBJECTIVE: To describe postmortem levels of blood alcohol in Russian men dying from various causes and so determine whether deaths from alcohol poisoning are being misclassified as cardiovascular deaths.
SETTING: Ishevsk, capital of the Udmurt Republic, situated in the Ural region of the Russian Federation.
METHODS: The study was part of a larger one on adult mortality. The study sample was 309 deaths among men aged 20-55 dying between August 1998 and March 1999 from other than neoplasms, infectious diseases or unspecified causes and on whom necropsy records could be obtained. Information on cause of death was extracted from death certificates and data on postmortem blood alcohol concentration (BAC) from forensic records. Blood alcohol concentrations were adjusted where necessary to allow for delay in necropsy.
RESULTS: Medium or greater levels of intoxication occurred in a quarter of those recorded as dying from cardiovascular disease but in over half of those dying from external causes. BAC levels consistent with at least strong intoxication were seen in 13.5% of deaths from cardiovascular disease and 27.1% from external causes. No cardiovascular deaths had BAC at levels usually thought to be fatal while this level was seen in 26% of deaths from accidental poisoning.
CONCLUSION: Evidence of recent consumption of alcohol is common among Russian men dying under the age of 55, with severe intoxication common where death is from external causes. However, the high death rates from cardiovascular disease in Russia cannot be explained by misclassification of deaths attributable to acute alcohol poisoning. This study thus resolves one of the outstanding controversies in the story of alcohol and cardiovascular disease in the former Soviet Union."
11854636,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11854636/,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the insulin response to a 3-hour oral glucose tolerance test and to compare the insulin levels in the gestational diabetes mellitus and single abnormal test value groups with a nondiabetic control group.
STUDY DESIGN: One hundred ten Turkish women with uncomplicated pregnancy participated in this prospective controlled study between 24 to 28 weeks of gestation. A 100-g 3-hour oral glucose tolerance test was given, and glucose and insulin plasma levels were assayed. The subjects were classified according to established criteria. Early-phase insulin secretion was assessed by the insulinogenic index. Total insulin secretion was assessed by mean insulin level during the oral glucose tolerance test; insulin resistance was assessed by fasting insulin concentration and by the use of the homeostasis model. Data were analyzed by the Student t test and 1-way analysis of variance, with posthoc Bonferroni correction.
RESULTS: The fasting insulin levels of patients with normal oral glucose tolerance test results were significantly lower than those of patients with gestational diabetes mellitus and a single value abnormality (P <.001 and P <.005, respectively). The insulinogenic index as a marker of early-phase insulin secretion was significantly lower in gestational diabetes mellitus, compared with that of patients with normal oral glucose tolerance test results (P <.05). The worsening of glycemic profile from normal oral glucose tolerance test results to gestational diabetes mellitus was associated with an increase in the homeostasis model; no significant difference was found between gestational diabetes mellitus and a single value abnormality group in terms of both the homeostasis model and the insulinogenic index. Values for total insulin secretion were highest in gestational diabetes mellitus, followed by the single value abnormality group, both significantly differing from the values of patients with normal oral glucose tolerance test results (P <.001 and P <.005, respectively).
CONCLUSION: In this prospective study of Turkish subjects, we found a striking similarity in terms of patient characteristics between the gestational diabetes mellitus group and the single value abnormality group. Additionally, when we used fasting insulin level and insulin resistance as 2 separate criteria of analysis, patients with single value abnormality were indistinguishable from patients with gestational diabetes mellitus; both groups were significantly different from the normal oral glucose tolerance test group. Our findings suggest that a single abnormal test value on an oral glucose tolerance test should be regarded as a pathologic finding and that the patient with a single abnormal test value may be treated similarly to the patient with gestational diabetes mellitus."
11854772,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11854772/,"OBJECTIVE: Judgments about an individual's pain can be profoundly important to sufferers. Relatively few studies have examined variables that may affect observers' judgments of the pain of others. The present article reports two studies investigating the relationship between different kinds of exposure to pain problems and observers' ratings of the pain intensity of patients.
DESIGN: In the first study, 82 observers were classified into groups with positive and negative family histories of chronic pain. They viewed a videotape showing the facial expressions of shoulder pain patients undergoing physiotherapy assessments and rated the pain experienced by the subjects. In the second study, the data from observers having no experience with pain problems were compared with data collected from therapists having considerable experience with pain problems.
RESULTS: Observers with a positive family history of chronic pain attributed greater pain to the patients than those with a negative family history of chronic pain. Professionals' pain judgments were lower than those of control subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: Together, the findings imply that one's experiences with the different problems of pain patients may affect pain judgments. Alternative interpretations of the findings are considered."
11854776,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11854776/,"BACKGROUND: Persistent pain is grossly undertreated in older adult sufferers, despite its high prevalence in this age group. Because of its multidimensional impacts, including depression, sleep disruption and physical disability, patients with persistent pain often benefit from interdisciplinary pain clinic treatment. This treatment is expensive, however, and may not be required by all patients. The Multiaxial Assessment of Pain (MAP) has demonstrated value in predicting response to treatment in younger adults with persistent pain.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the feasibility of a MAP taxonomy for community-dwelling adults age 65 years or older. PARTICIPANTS AND PROCEDURES: One hundred eight subjects with persistent pain (mean age 73.8 years, SD=8.4 years) were interviewed and data collected on demographics, pain intensity, depressive symptoms, sleep disruption, pain interference with performance of basic and instrumental activities of daily living, frequency of engagement in advanced activities of daily living, cognitive function and comorbidity. A subset of these subjects underwent physical capacities testing, including maximal isometric lift strength, dynamic lifting endurance, timed chair rise and balance.
RESULTS: Analyses derived three primary clusters of patients. Cluster 1 (24%) reported less intense pain, less depression and sleep disruption, and higher activity levels. Cluster 3 (30%) suffered from more pain and were more functionally disabled. Cluster 2 (46%) had characteristics of cluster 1 and cluster 3, but with some characteristics that were clearly unique.
CONCLUSIONS: While these results are preliminary and require further validation, they indicate that older adults are heterogeneous in their response to persistent pain. Future studies should be performed to examine whether the MAP taxonomy is applicable to older adults regardless of medical diagnosis. Ultimately, this information may have meaning with regard to both treatment prescribing, and the design and interpretation of intervention studies."
11854870,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11854870/,"OBJECTIVE: To study adult patients in the immediate postoperative period after cardiac surgery and determine whether cardiac output (CO) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) are generally within normal limits and whether clinical assessment of CO provides an adequate approximation to guide treatment.
DESIGN: Prospective study.
SETTING: Overnight intensive recovery unit, St Thomas' Hospital, London.
PARTICIPANTS: Fifty patients who had undergone cardiac surgery within the previous 5 hours and whose COs were not being measured.
INTERVENTIONS: The physician (if present) or nurse managing the patient was asked to make a clinical estimate (as low, normal, or high) of CO and of SVR. CO was measured by lithium dilution. The clinically estimated values were compared with the measured values, after adjusting for patient size.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In 29 of 50 (58%) patients, cardiac index (CI) (20 of 50 [40%] patients) or systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) (22 of 50 [44%] patients) was outside normal limits (CI, 2.7 (plus minus 30%) L/min/m(2); SVRI, 2,500 (plus minus 30%) dyne center dot sec center dot cm(minus sign 5)/m(2)). When CI was outside the normal range, the clinical estimate was usually wrong (13 of 20 [65%]); when SVRI was outside the normal range, the clinical estimate was also usually wrong (16 of 22 [73%]).
CONCLUSIONS: In the early postoperative period after cardiac surgery, clinical assessment of the circulatory state is frequently misleading, and there should be a low threshold for measuring CO."
11855156,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11855156/,"BACKGROUND: The requirement for subsequent cholecystectomy in patients with gallbladder in situ after endoscopic removal of stones from the common bile duct (CBD) is controversial. The aims of this study were to assess the requirement for subsequent cholecystectomy for gallbladder-related symptoms, and to identify the patients who develop symptoms after the endoscopic removal of CBD stones.
METHODS: Of 241 patients with gallbladder in situ following endoscopic removal of stones from the CBD, 146 patients (78 men and 68 women; mean age 69 +/- 13 years, range 20-93) with a follow-up time of more than three months without elective cholecystectomy were enrolled in the study. Fifty-nine patients had gallbladder stones (single stones in 27 and multiple stones in 32) and 87 patients had gallbladder in situ without stones. The time from entry to the occurrences of death or cholecystectomy was evaluated retrospectively. Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate the risk factors associated with these events.
RESULTS: The mean duration of follow-up was 24.1 +/- 18.0 months (range 3-70 months). During follow-up, seven patients (4.8%) underwent cholecystectomy, on average 18.4 months after CBD stone removal, as the result of acute cholecystitis in four cases, biliary pain in two cases and acute pancreatitis in one case. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed in four patients and open cholecystectomy in three patients. Post-operative morbidity occurred in two patients, with improvement after conservative management. Nine patients (6.2%) died as the result of unrelated biliary disease. Age, sex, presence of gallbladder stones, multiplicity of gallbladder stones and underlying disease did not correlate with subsequent cholecystectomy by Cox regression analysis.
CONCLUSION: Elective cholecystectomy is not warranted in patients with bile duct stones when the common duct can be cleared of stones by endoscopic sphincterotomy. We could not find any clinical predictors of further symptoms or complications arising from the retained gallbladder."

AIM: To evaluate the effect of ondansetron on gastric half-emptying time (T1/2) of a solid meal, gastric myoelectrical activity and hormone levels in 14 healthy volunteers.
METHODS: In a placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover study, we investigated the effects of ondansetron (8 mg intravenously) on the gastric emptying of solids (by scintigraphy), gastric myoelectrical activity (by electrogastrography) and the post-prandial release of cholecystokinin, gastrin, human pancreatic polypeptide, gastric inhibitory polypeptide, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, motilin, substance P and galanin.
RESULTS: The average T1/2 values were 86 min and 85.5 min without lag time (P=0.082) and 92 min and 93 min with lag time (P=0.158) for the placebo and ondansetron treatments, respectively. The average T1/2 of female volunteers was significantly longer than that of male volunteers. The dominant gastric electrical frequency and hormone plasma concentrations were not altered by ondansetron.
CONCLUSIONS: Ondansetron did not affect the gastric emptying of solids, the dominant gastric electrical frequency or the plasma concentrations of the analysed gastrointestinal peptides."
11856683,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11856683/,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to analyze compartmental involvement and patterns of spread of soft-tissue inflammation in pedal infection.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed 115 contrast-enhanced 1.5-T MR examinations of the foot in 41 women and 74 men with a mean age of 58.4 years who had undergone bone biopsy or surgery for suspected osteomyelitis. Presence of inflammation (contrast enhancement, fat signal intensity loss on T1-weighted images, and high signal intensity on T2-weighted images) was noted by two musculoskeletal radiologists in the following foot compartments: toes, medial, central, lateral, interosseous, dorsal, hindfoot, malleoli, and lower leg. Proximal and distal extension of soft-tissue inflammation was analyzed. The compartment closest to the ulcer that showed MR signs of direct contiguous infection was designated the primarily infected compartment.
RESULTS: Spread of inflammation across fascial planes into neighboring compartments originated from the following primary compartments: medial (3/10, 30%), central (7/16, 44%), and lateral (16/20, 80%). Spread from the hindfoot and malleoli into adjacent compartments was seen in only 7% of such cases (2/24). Inflammation from toe infections spread in 34% of cases to forefoot compartments (15/44). Inflammation from forefoot or toe infections spread in 4.5% of cases to the midfoot and in 2% of cases to the hindfoot; ascension into the calf was rare (1% of cases). Spread of inflammation into neighboring compartments was not correlated with the presence of diabetes (p = 0.81) or with osteomyelitis (p = 0.34).
CONCLUSION: Soft-tissue inflammation of the forefoot tends to spread into neighboring compartments, with little respect for fascial planes. Hindfoot inflammation tends to stay confined. Spread from the foot to the lower leg is rare."

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study on adults from Western India.
SETTING: Rural, semi urban, urban higher/middle/lower socioeconomic regions (HSE/MSE/LSE) having diverse dietary habits and environmental conditions.
SUBJECTS: A total of 214 men and 108 women (20-50 y), apparently healthy and non-anemic.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Food intake by food frequency questionnaire, weight, height, age, smoking, environmental score, education, income, plasma retinol and plasma ascorbic acid.
RESULTS: Mean plasma retinol in women (24.84+/-5.1 microg/dl) and men (24.75+/-4.53 microg/dl) were not significantly different and 21% had plasma retinol below 20 microg/dl. Mean plasma ascorbic acid in women (0.35+/-0.12 mg/dl) and men (0.30+/-0.12 mg/dl) was similar with 75% having plasma ascorbic acid below 0.4 mg/dl. Vitamin A intake (as retinol equivalent) and plasma retinol showed a significant dose response (P<0.05) but not vitamin C intake and plasma ascorbic acid. Plasma retinol showed significant correlation with income (rho=0.24), education (rho=0.27), and environment (rho=0.21; rho=0.0001). Similar correlations with plasma ascorbic acid were 0.29, 031, -0.23 respectively (P=0.0001). Logistic regression showed education, environment, green leafy vegetables (GLV) and milk intake as predictors of plasma retinol deficiency, while non-sweet fruit intake, education and passive smoking for plasma ascorbic acid deficiency (P<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Subnormal status of retinol and vitamin C emphasizes the need to increase consumption of fruit, GLV and milk products, and also better education and environment. Avoiding passive smoking demands attention in order to improve levels of these vitamins.

11858126,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11858126/,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect that a training intervention for traditional birth attendants (TBAs) in Guatemala had on the detection of obstetric complications, the referral of patients with complications to the formal health care system, and, ultimately, those patients' utilization of essential obstetric care services.
METHODS: Using a quasi-experimental design, a surveillance system of births was implemented to collect population-based information from 3,518 women between 1990 and 1993. All women were interviewed postpartum by physicians. There were three key independent variables in our study: 1) geographical area (intervention community and non-intervention community), 2) time in relation to the training intervention (before or after), and 3) presence or absence of a TBA at the time of the complication. The key dependent variables for women interviewed were 1) development of an obstetric complication, 2) detection of the problem by the TBA, 3) referral to a health facility, 4) compliance with referral, and 5) use of services.
RESULTS: The incidence of postpartum complications decreased after the intervention, controlling for intervention community. On the other hand, after the intervention TBAs were less likely to recognize most maternal complications, and referral rates did not increase significantly. The likelihood of using health care services increased six-fold among women who were not attended by TBAs, and no increase was observed among those who were attended by TBAs.
CONCLUSION: Training TBAs may have had a positive effect on the rate, detection, and referral of postpartum complications. However, the evidence is less convincing for overall increases in the detection of complications, in referral to the formal health care system, and in the utilization of essential obstetric services among women attended by TBAs."
11859274,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11859274/,"BACKGROUND: Few studies have evaluated the effect of aerobic physical training on insulin sensitivity in subjects with type 2 diabetes treated with oral hypoglycemic agents. Most studies that involved nonobese subjects showed enhanced insulin sensitivity whereas studies involving obese subjects with type 2 diabetes are inconsistent because of concomitant fat loss.
MATERIAL/METHODS: Thirteen men with type 2 diabetes (6 nonobese and 7 obese) treated with oral hypoglycemic agents carried out a 12-week ergocycle program at 60% VO2 peak, one hour thrice a week. Diet and medications were maintained throughout the study. Insulin sensitivity was assessed with the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp technique.
RESULTS: VO2 peak (ml/kg/min) increased with exercise training. There were no significant changes in fat mass, percent body fat, fasting plasma glucose and insulin levels, glycated hemoglobin levels, or insulin sensitivity. However, when the subjects were separated into two groups, they showed different insulin sensitivity adaptation to training. In fact, nonobese subjects with type 2 diabetes showed an increase in insulin sensitivity, whereas no change was observed in the obese subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that moderate aerobic exercise training of 3 months duration enhanced insulin sensitivity only in nonobese men with type 2 diabetes. Obese men with type 2 diabetes showed no benefit. Thus, adiposity per se may be a determining factor in the exercise-induced metabolic benefit of exercise training in subjects with type 2 diabetes."
11859276,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11859276/,"BACKGROUND: Schistosoma mansoni (SM) is a significant cause of liver disease in many countries. Chronic hepatitis C (HCV) is a worldwide health problem. The association of SM and chronic HCV is not uncommon, especially in areas where both diseases occur. The possible synergistic relationship between them is controversial. Also, the degree of necroinflammatory injury and the stage of fibrosis in patients with mixed schistosomiasis and chronic HCV remains unclear.
MATERIAL/METHODS: 185 individuals were studied: 25 with pure SM, 100 with pure HCV, and 60 mixed HCV and SM (HCV+S), selected from 222 biopsied patients with chronic liver disease treated at the liver unit of the Internal Medicine Department, Mansoura University (July 1999-May 2000). They were subjected to rectal snip and serological test for schistosomiasis, liver functions, HBV, HCV serological markers, serum qualitative PCR, and liver biopsy. Masson trichrome stain was performed to assess fibrosis. Immunohistochemical staining was performed for HBsAg and HBcAg. The Modified Knodell score was applied to assess the biopsy.
RESULTS: Five of the 25 pure SM and 2 of the HCV+S group revealed schistosomal granuloma. 30% of the pure HCV and 33% of the HCV+S patients were found to be cirrhotic. No statistically significant difference was identified between the groups as regards necroinflammatory injury or Knodell score, or the stage of fibrosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Schistosomal hepatic infection does not lead to more severe or progressive disease in patients with chronic hepatitis C."
11859279,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11859279/,"BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence that cytokines play a pathogenic role in both heart failure and atherosclerosis. The aim of our study was to assess serum levels of selected cytokines and soluble forms of receptors in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), and the relation between these concentrations and left ventricular (LV) systolic function.
MATERIAL/METHODS: We measured serum levels of TNFalpha, sTNFR 1 and 2, IL-2, and IL-10 in 100 patients with CAD: 70 patients with LV regional wall motion disturbances (group A); and 30 patients with normal LV function (group B). The control group (group C) consisted of 20 healthy volunteers.
RESULTS: Mean serum TNFalpha and IL-10 concentrations were significantly higher in groups A (18.3 +/- 3.5; 55.4 +/- 118.5 pg/ml) and B (17.9 +/- 4.9; 45.3 +/- 76.8 pg/ml) than in controls (8.3 +/- 1.4, p<0.001; 14.3 +/- 28.5, p<0.05; respectively). Moreover, in group A serum levels of sTNFR 1 were higher (1367.4 +/- 531.1 pg/ml) than in group C (1093.9 +/- 456.9 pg/ml; p<0.05). No differences were found in the study groups between serum sTNFR 2 and IL-2 levels. In group A, both the LV ejection fraction and motion score index correlated with TNFalpha (r=-0.277; r=0.282; p<0.05), and sTNFR 1 levels (r=-0.258; r=0.280; p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The serum concentrations of TNFalpha and IL-10 are increased in patients with CAD. Additionally, patients with impaired LV contractility have higher sTNFR 1 concentrations. Serum cytokine activation may play a role in the development of heart failure in patients with CAD."

EXEGESIS: A 42-year-old patient was admitted to our medical center because of lower limb purpura. Henoch-Schoenlein purpura diagnosis was confirmed on histological findings (kidney biopsy) and concomitantly parvovirus B19 infection was proved by serological test (IgM+). Association of Henoch-Schoenlein purpura and parvovirus B19 infection has already been described. However, none of the reported studies demonstrated clearly the link between these two diseases. With regard to this observation, we wonder about the systematic use of the parvovirus B19 serological test in patients presenting first Henoch-Schoenlein purpura. Indeed, parvovirus B19-induced vasculitis is habitually controlled with intravenous immunoglobulins.
CONCLUSION: A prospective study should explore the link between Henoch-Schoenlein purpura and primary parvovirus B19 infection. Moreover, we should evaluate intravenous immunoglobulins' efficacy in Henoch-Schoenlein purpura associated with active parvovirus B19 infection in order to improve the prognosis of this disease."
11861234,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11861234/,"BACKGROUND: Despite national guidelines for asthma treatment, many children have troublesome symptoms.
AIM: To assess the extent to which the use of inappropriate inhaler devices contributes to this problem.
METHODS: Of 14 813 questionnaires distributed to schoolchildren, 6996 (47%) were returned identifying 1444 children using asthma inhalers. Inhalers were categorised as age appropriate or inappropriate according to national guidelines and were compared with those used by 75 patients attending a hospital clinic.
RESULTS: A total of 35% of ""schools"" and 4% of ""clinic"" children reported using an inappropriate inhaler device. Most were using metered dose inhalers alone. Twenty four per cent of ""schools"" children < or = 5 years old did not use a spacer. Both children and parents overestimated the child's ability to use their inhaler.
CONCLUSIONS: Large numbers of children are given inhalers they cannot use. To improve asthma care we must ensure that prescriptions reflect the age and ability of the child. Recent recommendations by the Department of Health in England and Wales stress the importance of seamless care between primary and secondary services. As the management of childhood asthma is guided primarily by secondary care providers, it is therefore imperative that general paediatricians know the difficulties and issues which are occurring in the community. This will enable them to lead and support necessary change."
11861438,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11861438/,"BACKGROUND: Current clinical guidelines require that five indices (total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and the total/HDL cholesterol ratio) be measured or calculated to assess the lipid-related risk of vascular disease. All five are also targets of therapy and therefore all must be measured initially and at follow-up. Considerable evidence indicates that apolipoprotein B (apo B) is a better index of reaching or not reaching treatment targets than total or LDL cholesterol.
METHODS: The objective of this study was to examine whether measurement of a single marker (apo B) led to the same categorization of risk as the traditional five indices (lipid profile). If both apo B and lipid profile indicated that the patient was either within or outside their respective treatment targets, the indices were considered concordant. If not, the indices were considered discordant. Concordance/discordance was examined in 215 patients at their first and last clinic visit.
RESULTS: Concordance was high in both higher (88% at the first and 92% at the last clinic visit) and lower (76% at the first and 78% at the last clinic visit) risk groups at both the initial and final visits. Discordance was virtually restricted to the group with hypertriglyceridemia with normal concentrations of apo B, a group in which little independent evidence points to any substantially increased risk of vascular disease.
CONCLUSIONS: These data raise the possibility that at least for high risk patients treated with statins, follow-up could be simplified and expenses reduced if only apo B were measured. They also raise the possibility that outcome might be improved if the therapeutic algorithm were simplified."
11862362,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11862362/,"RATIONALE: Chronic, regular recreational use of ecstasy (MDMA) is associated with psychopathology, elevated behavioural impulsivity and persistent impairment of memory performance.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to investigate which of these sequelae persist after at least 6 months of abstinence from ecstasy.
METHODS: Four groups of participants were compared: 18 current regular recreational ecstasy users, 15 ex-regular ecstasy users who had abstained from using the drug for an average of 2 years, 16 polydrug users who had never taken ecstasy and 15 drug-naive controls.
RESULTS: There were no significant group differences in age, education level, or pre-morbid intelligence and, generally, the use of illicit drugs other than ecstasy was not significantly different among the three drug-using groups. Both current and ex-ecstasy users exhibited elevated psychopathology and behavioural impulsivity compared with polydrug users and drug-naive controls, but current ecstasy users exhibited a broader range of psychopathology than ex-users. Both groups of ecstasy users also exhibited impaired working memory and verbal recall performance compared with drug-naive controls, but only ex-users exhibited impaired verbal recall relative to polydrug users. Regression analysis indicated that psychopathology was primarily predicted by the extent of previous consumption of cannabis rather than ecstasy, whereas the majority of the cognitive deficits were only predicted by the extent of previous ecstasy use.
CONCLUSIONS: Selective impairments of neuropsychological performance associated with regular ecstasy use are not reversed by prolonged abstinence. This is consistent with evidence that ecstasy has potent and selective neurotoxic effects on brain serotonergic systems in humans."

DESIGN: prospective study of 21 patients with AAA. 2D-PWM was defined as change in cross-sectional area.
RESULTS: the median diastolic area was 28 cm(2) (intraquartile range, IQR, 22-31 cm(2)) and the median (IQR) 2D-PWM was 0.25 (0.10-0.40) cm(2). Assuming that the AAA is circular in cross-section this represents a median (IQR) diameter increase of 0.3 (0.1-0.4) mm. However, local wall displacements up to 2 mm were present in varying directions, without significant change in surface area.
CONCLUSION: AAA PWM is negligible and may not therefore be a potential tool to assess efficacy of endovascular aneurysm exclusion."
11863474,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11863474/,"BACKGROUND: Fractures are a manifestation of osteoporosis, but therapeutic interventions to reduce the risk of recurrent fractures are not widespread.
OBJECTIVE: To identify predictors of osteoporosis treatment in postmenopausal women following distal forearm fracture.
METHODS: This population-based retrospective cohort study included all postmenopausal women, 45 years or older, residing in Olmsted County, Minnesota, who sustained a distal forearm fracture due to minimal trauma (a fall from standing height or under) in 1993 to 1997. Complete medical records were reviewed for each subject and Cox proportional hazards regression was used to evaluate the relationship of baseline demographic and clinical characteristics to therapeutic interventions for osteoporosis within 12 months following the fracture.
RESULTS: A total of 343 women with a mean age of 70.5 years had a minimal trauma distal forearm fracture. Within 12 months, 83% had seen a nonorthopedic physician. Of these, 17% had a pharmacologic osteoporosis intervention and the 12-month actuarially estimated cumulative incidence of any intervention was 18% (95% confidence interval [CI], 14%-22%). In a multivariate analysis, treatment was more likely to be offered to those with a prior diagnosis of osteoporosis (relative risk [RR], 2.08; 95% CI, 1.21-3.58), previous distal forearm fracture (RR, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.30-4.34), or history of cigarette smoking (RR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.11-3.12).
CONCLUSIONS: Effective osteoporosis interventions are underutilized among postmenopausal women who experience an osteoporotic fracture. Further work is needed to overcome barriers to optimal osteoporosis management in these women who are at high risk for future complications of osteoporosis."
11864676,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11864676/,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the relationship between Q-tip measurement of urethral hypermobility and visual assessment of the urethrovesical junction as assessed by points Aa and Ba of the pelvic organ prolapse quantification (POP-Q) system.
METHODS: A total of 274 patients with pelvic organ prolapse or urinary incontinence had preoperative Q-tip test straining angles and POP-Q staging measurements. By the Q-tip test, urethral hypermobility was defined as a straining angle of 30 degrees or greater relative to the horizontal. As defined in the POP-Q system, point Aa is located in the midline of the anterior vaginal wall 3 cm from the external urethral meatus and represents the urethrovesical junction. Point Ba represents the most dependent position of the anterior vaginal wall. The correlation between point Aa of the POP-Q system and the Q-tip test was assessed using the Spearman correlation coefficient. Similar assessments were made for point Ba.
RESULTS: Mean age of the 274 subjects was 58.5 +/- 11.8 years; mean parity was 3.1 +/- 1.6. A total of 104 patients reported prior surgery for prolapse or incontinence. Mean Q-tip straining angle was 61 +/- 20 degrees; 258 (94%) had urethral hypermobility. Values of point Aa ranged from -3 cm to +3 cm, with median 0 cm. The correlation coefficient between the Q-tip straining angle and point Aa was r = 0.47 (P <.001). Urethral hypermobility was observed in 95% of patients with stage II prolapse at point Aa and in 100% of patients with stages III and IV prolapse at point Aa. The correlation coefficient between the Q-tip straining angle and point Ba was r = 0.32 (P <.001).
CONCLUSION: Although the correlation between the Q-tip straining angle and point Aa of the POP-Q was moderately strong, one value cannot be predicted from the other. The Q-tip test may be unnecessary in patients with stages II, III, and IV prolapse at point Aa as virtually all such patients demonstrate urethral hypermobility."
11865010,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11865010/,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Lymphocytic colitis is a clinicopathological entity characterised by protracted watery diarrhoea and an increased number of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) in the surface epithelium of the colonic mucosa. This report describes two patients with symptoms similar to those of lymphocytic colitis and an increased number of IELs, but within the cryptal epithelium.
METHODS: The numbers of IELs were assessed in colorectal biopsies from the two patients. Sections were stained immunohistochemically for CD3, CD8, CD20, and TIA1.
RESULTS: The colorectal biopsies had an abnormally high number of IELs in the epithelium of the crypts but not in the surface epithelium. The IELs in the crypts were CD3+++, CD8+, TIA1+, and CD20-.
CONCLUSIONS: The histological diagnosis in these two patients was cryptal lymphocytic coloproctitis. Patients with similar symptoms and an increased number of IELs in the surface epithelium are now filed at this department as having surface lymphocytic coloproctitis. Immunohistochemistry showed that the cryptal IELs were cytotoxic suppressor T cells. Interestingly, a case of cryptal lymphocytic colitis was recently recorded in a non-human primate dying after years of protracted chronic diarrhoea. It is possible that antigens present in the lumen of the crypts elicit a lymphocytic reaction within the cryptal cells."
11865545,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11865545/,"UNLABELLED: The aim of our study was to determine the prevalence of asthma in the Auvergne region.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two thousand and nine pupils from primary (five-six years old) and secondary (14-15 years old) schools were given a questionnaire when attending their compulsory medical examination and asked to return it completed.
RESULTS: The response rate was 82%. The prevalence of asthma was 5.6%. There was no difference neither between the two age groups nor between sexes. In contrast, there was a significant difference in prevalence according to whether the child lived in a town (7.3%) or in the countryside (4.6%) (p = 0.01). In the department of the Puy-de-Dôme, this difference was even more distinct, with a prevalence of 10% in urban areas and 4.0% in the countryside (p = 0.001). Twelve percent of the children had experienced wheezing over the previous 12 months. The prevalence of bronchitis was higher in rural areas (17.3%) than in towns (11.8%) but not to a significant degree. Passive smoking significantly increased this risk (18.9% and 14%, p = 0.003).
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of asthma in the Auvergne region is low in both age groups compared to other regions in France and to Europe. The difference of prevalence between town and countryside may evidence of the influence of environmental factors."

All patients underwent exercise testing according to the Bruce protocol. The criterion for a positive exercise ST-segment response was > or = 1 mm of horizontal or down sloping depression 80 msec after J-point. The indications for cardiac catheterization in each patient were determined at the discretion of the attending physician. Clinically important coronary artery disease was defined as > 50 per cent narrowing of the diameter of at least one major vessel or > or = 50 per cent of the left main coronary artery.
RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of EET for detection of CAD were for the entire group, in women and men respectively: 93%, 91%, 94% and 21%, 16%, 27%.
CONCLUSION: 1. Indications for EET should be based on prior probability of coronary artery disease. 2. Application of higher than conventional ST depression criteria (> or = 2 mm) lowers sensitivity but increases specificity of EET. 3. Variables determining false positive results are as follows: age, sex (female), low probability of CAD, ST-segment depression in leads: II, III, aVF and mitral valve prolapse. 4. Variables determining false negative results are as follows: high probability of CAD, sex (male) and one vessel disease."

PURPOSE: This study was undertaken to document the impact of answer changing on exam performance on a computer-based course examination in a second-year medical school course.
METHODS: This study analyzed data from a 2 hour, 80-item computer delivered multiple-choice exam administered to 190 students (166 second-year medical students and 24 physician's assistant students).
RESULTS: There was a small but significant net improvement in overall score when answers were changed: one student's score increased by 7 points, 93 increased by 1 to 4 points, and 38 decreased by 1 to 3 points. On average, lower-performing students benefited slightly less than higher-performing students. Students spent more time on questions for which they changed the answers and were more likely to change items that were more difficult.

11866261,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11866261/,"OBJECTIVES: Barrett's esophagus (BE) is associated with esophageal reflux. The development stage of BE is not well described. Epidemiological evidence indicates that the columnar epithelium in BE is acquired and reaches its full length rapidly. We tested the hypothesis that BE might result from direct replacement of erosions in reflux esophagitis (RE).
METHODS: At endoscopy, we compared the length and distribution of esophageal erosions in 50 patients with RE with the length and distribution of columnar epithelium in 50 patients with BE.
RESULTS: The median length of erosions in RE was 2 cm, less than the median length of columnar epithelium in BE, 5 cm (p < 0.001). Erosions in RE were usually multiple and scattered, involving the entire circumference of the esophagus in only 10% of cases, but circumferential involvement by columnar epithelium was found in 68% of BE cases (p < 0.001). Circumferential involvement, 3 cm or longer, was found in 0% of cases of RE versus 56% of BE cases (p < 0.001). Two patients without RE or BE had large areas of epithelial loss of uncertain etiology.
CONCLUSIONS: The length and distribution of erosions in RE differ greatly from the length and distribution of columnar epithelium in BE. It is unlikely that BE arises directly from areas of esophagitis. We suggest that BE may develop after loss of a long segment of squamous epithelium, with columnar replacement in the presence of continuing acid reflux."

METHODS: This retrospective case-control study based on data of patients who underwent an ischemic stroke while being hospitalized not because of stroke and a control group of patients admitted during the same period who were matched for age and sex to the study patients. Common vascular risk factors, e.g. fever, leukocytosis, blood pressure, hemoglobin, cardiac arrhythmia and dehydration, were compared between the study and control groups.
RESULTS: Of 2,247 consecutive patients with ischemic stroke, the stroke had occurred during hospitalization not related to any surgical procedure in 80 (3.5%). Six parameters were found as being significant independent risk factors for in-hospital stroke: fever and leukocytosis during hospitalization, elevated diastolic and unstable blood pressure, dehydration and past history of myocardial infarction.
CONCLUSION: Careful monitoring of temperature, blood count, blood pressure, and clinical and laboratory signs of dehydration is needed to prevent in-hospital stroke."
11868014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11868014/,"BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the role of endoscopy in the postoperative management of pediatric patients who undergo fundoplication for GERD.
METHODS: Medical records of 109 otherwise healthy children who underwent operation for GERD from 1979 to 1996 were reviewed. Patients with respiratory symptoms or esophageal stenosis were excluded. All patients underwent endoscopic surveillance with endoscopy being performed in the early (within 1 year) and late (between 1 and 2 years) postoperative periods. Specifically evaluated were the appearance of the wrap and evidence of esophagitis. The risk of a recurrence of esophagitis based on wrap appearance and the presence of clinical symptoms in patients with endoscopic evidence of esophagitis were also evaluated.
RESULTS: At early endoscopy 3 patients with an intact wrap and 8 with a defective wrap had esophagitis (not significant). At late endoscopy, 5 patients with an intact wrap and 17 with a defective wrap had esophagitis (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: An intact wrap does not prevent recurrence of GERD. Such an occurrence is even more likely when endoscopy demonstrates a defective wrap. For all patients who have undergone fundoplication, endoscopic evaluation at 1 to 2 years is recommended to detect esophagitis in the absence of symptoms so treatment can be initiated before symptoms occur."
11868055,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11868055/,"BACKGROUND: Slow upsloping ST-segment depression during stress is thought to represent an ischemic response to exercise treadmill testing (ETT).
AIM: We used modern single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging protocols to determine the incidence of ischemia in patients with slow upsloping ST depression during exercise and whether this response signifies more or less severe coronary artery disease (CAD) and risk in comparison with rapid upsloping ST depression and particularly with horizontal or downsloping ST depression.
METHODS: We enrolled 33 patients (group 1) with rapid upsloping ST depression (>1 mm extending <0.08 seconds beyond J point), 32 patients (group 2) with slow upsloping depression (>1.5 mm extending >0.08 seconds beyond J point), and 35 patients (group 3) with horizontal or downsloping depression (>1 mm at 0.08 seconds beyond J point). Summed stress score (SSS), summed difference score (SDS), stress extent percent (SE%) and reversible extent percent (RE%) of perfusion abnormalities, lung-heart ratio (LHR), and transient ischemic dilatation (TID) were calculated.
RESULTS: The mean SSS, SDS, SE%, RE%, and LHR were similar between groups 1 and 2 but significantly higher in group 3. Incidence of ischemia was similar in groups 1 and 2 (39% and 25%) but significantly higher in group 3 (77%, P <.001). Evidence of TID was seen in none of the patients in groups 1, in 3% of patients in group 2, and in 23% of patients in group 3.
CONCLUSIONS: Slow upsloping ST depression does not signify more severe ischemia, more extensive CAD, or more stress-induced backward left ventricular failure. Thus, it would be reasonable to consider patients with slow upsloping ST depression during exercise as having a very low likelihood of CAD, similar to patients with rapid upsloping ST depression."
11868056,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11868056/,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Patients with ST-segment depression myocardial infarction (MI) have a similar long-term outcome compared with those who have ST-segment elevation. It remains unclear whether an aggressive treatment approach with very early (<6 hours) angiography and revascularization improves outcome over an early conservative approach. We compared the short-term outcome of patients who received very early (<6 hours) angiography with patients who received early conservative therapy for ST-segment depression MI.
METHODS: Patients seen within 12 hours with ST-segment depression on the initial electrocardiogram (ECG) were identified from the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction 2 (NRMI) database, which collected information from 1994 to 1998. Those who received very early (<6 hours) angiography were compared with those who received early conservative therapy. The short-term outcomes, including major bleeding episodes, cerebral vascular events, recurrent ischemia and angina, MI, and death, were compared on the basis of the initial therapy received.
RESULTS: Patients treated with very early angiography (2402) were younger, more likely to be males, smokers, and have less of a cardiac history (angina, MI, congestive heart failure, aortocoronary bypass surgery) and less likely to have diabetes mellitus than those who received early conservative therapy (17,735). Hospital outcome in the very early angiography group was similar to the early conservative therapy group in terms of cerebral vascular events (0.8% vs 1.0%, P =.27), major bleeding events (2.8% vs 2.4%, P =.25), and recurrent MI (2.1% vs 2.3%, P =.57) but was associated with lower recurrent ischemia or angina (11.4% vs 16.7%, P <.001) and improved survival (death, 4.9% vs 7.3%, P <.001). Multivariate analysis suggested that patients receiving very early angiography had lower mortality compared with those receiving early conservative therapy (odds ratio [OR] = 0.76; 95% CI 0.60-0.95). However, comparing patients matched on propensity score (1405) showed mortality was similar in both treatment groups (5.6% vs 5.4%, P =.87), with no significant inhospital mortality benefit of very early angiography (OR = 0.89; 95% CI 0.71-1.13).
CONCLUSIONS: The apparent mortality benefit of very early angiography in patients with ST-segment depression MI is a reflection of bias by confounding. Controlling for baseline differences using propensity score methods in this observational study indicated no inhospital mortality benefit of a very early aggressive approach compared with a conservative approach."
11868798,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11868798/,"OBJECTIVE: Nephrotoxicity is the major adverse effect of amphotericin B (AmB), often limiting administration of full dosage. Selective distal tubular epithelial toxicity seems to be responsible for the profound potassium wasting that is a major clinical side effect of treatment with AmB. Potassium depletion also potentiates the tubular toxicity of AmB. This study was designed to assess the ability of spironolactone to reduce potassium requirements and to prevent hypokalemia in neutropenic patients on AmB treatment.
METHODS: In this study 26 patients with various hematological disorders were randomized to receive either intravenous AmB alone or AmB and oral spironolactone 100 mg twice daily when developing a proven or suspected fungal infection.
RESULTS: Patients receiving concomitant AmB and spironolactone had significantly higher plasma potassium levels than those receiving AmB alone (P = 0.0027). Those patients receiving AmB and spironolactone required significantly less potassium supplementation to maintain their plasma potassium within the normal range (P = 0.022). Moreover, urinary potassium losses were significantly less in patients receiving AmB and spironolactone than those receiving AmB alone (P = 0.040).
CONCLUSION: This study showed that spironolactone can reduce potassium requirements and prevent hypokalemia by reducing urinary potassium loss in neutropenic patients on AmB treatment."
11869395,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11869395/,"OBJECTIVE: To compare perinatal outcomes for all births, and the morbidity and mortality patterns of babies admitted to neonatal intensive care, for non-Indigenous, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (TSI) people in a major remote urban centre.
METHODS: A prospective cohort study of all births and consecutive admissions to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit/Special Baby Care Unit (NICU/SCBU) at Kirwan Hospital for Women (KWH), Townsville (a tertiary referral hospital) was conducted from January 1998 to June 1999.
RESULTS: There were 2575 births, with 2392 (93%) booked into KWH for delivery. The Aboriginal group differed from the non-Indigenous group only in the prevalence of low-birthweight births. The TSI group had significantly higher perinatal mortality rates, preterm and low-birthweight births than the non-Indigenous group. Seven hundred and fifty-eight babies were admitted to NICU/SCBU: 586 (77%) non-Indigenous, 129 (17%) Aboriginal, 43 (6%) TSI. There were significantly more preterm, lower birthweight and longer stay length Aboriginal and TSI babies. Being Indigenous was not associated with neonatal death. Gestation of less than 28 weeks, congenital anomalies, and high-grade cerebral haemorrhage, but not ethnicity, were independent risk factors for neonatal death. Maternal risk factors, including poor antenatal care attendance, were more prevalent amongst Indigenous women.
CONCLUSION: Neonatal outcomes for Aboriginal infants were better than expected from national and State reports. Outcomes for Torres Strait Islander infants were worse than expected. Ethnicity was not a risk factor for neonatal death. These findings suggest that outcomes may be further improved by programmes to increase access for Indigenous women to antenatal care services."
11869761,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11869761/,"BACKGROUND: Using our routine documentation system we evaluated the hypothesis that antidepressants may be less effective in the acute treatment of bipolar I depressed patients compared to unipolar depressed patients.
METHOD: Based on the data from 2032 consecutively admitted inpatients with unipolar or bipolar I depression we compared the efficacy of antidepressants in both groups. The outcome was assessed by the Global assessment scale (GAS), the duration of hospitalisation and the Apathic-, Depressive- and Manic Syndrome subscales of the Association for Methodology and Documentation in Psychiatry system.
RESULTS: Cohorts were comparable in treatment regimens and severity of depression at admission. At discharge, there were no statistically significant differences between bipolar I and unipolar depression for the outcome criteria Depressive Syndrome scale, GAS score and days in hospital. Bipolar patients showed a slightly decreased score of the Apathic Syndrome scale at discharge, also reflected by a slightly elevated score of the Manic Syndrome scale.
LIMITATIONS: This study did not check for differences in side effects such as switching or cycling commonly attributed to the use of tricyclic antidepressants in bipolar patients. Naturalistic data were obtained prospectively, analysis, however, was done retrospectively, thus limiting, but not completely excluding a possible selection bias.
CONCLUSION: Evaluating different outcome criteria, our naturalistic data of a large cohort seem to reject the hypothesis that antidepressants may be less effective in the acute treatment of bipolar I compared to unipolar depressed patients."
11869772,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11869772/,"BACKGROUND: This report examines clinical indicators for bipolarity in a cohort of patients suffering from Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD).
METHODS: The study was conducted in the Cornell-Westchester Hospital, famed for its expertise in BPD. To avoid biasing our sample, we excluded all BPD patients who were active patients in our anxiety and mood disorders program. Through the use of both open clinical interviews and standardized diagnostic interviews (SCID), borderline patients were examined for evidence of bipolarity by five indicators: history of spontaneous mania, history of spontaneous hypomania, bipolar temperaments, pharmacologic response typical of bipolar disorder, and a positive bipolar family history.
RESULTS: Depending on the level of bipolar disorder from the most rigorous (mania) to the most 'soft' (bipolar family history), between 13 and 81% of borderline patients showed signs of bipolarity. Based on what the emerging literature supports as rigorously defined bipolar spectrum (bipolar I and II), we submit that at least 44% of BPD belong to this spectrum; adding hypomanic switches during antidepressant pharmacotherapy, the rate of bipolarity in BPD reaches 69%. As expected from this formulation, most responded negatively to antidepressants (e.g. hostility and agitation) and positively to mood stabilizers.
LIMITATIONS: Small sample size and retrospective gathering of data on treatment response.
CONCLUSION: Patients with BPD more often than not exhibit clinically ascertainable evidence for bipolarity and may benefit from known treatments for Bipolar Spectrum Disorders. Large scale, systematic treatment studies with mood stabilizers are indicated."
11869780,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11869780/,"BACKGROUND: Epidemiological and clinical studies have reported the frequent co-occurrence of social phobia (SP) and alcohol use disorders. Patients with SP often use alcohol to cope with the social situations they fear, and to lessen anticipatory anxiety, behavioral inhibition, and phobic avoidance. We investigated whether the presence of lifetime comorbidity with alcohol abuse was associated with significant differences as regards demographic and clinical features, family history and pattern of comorbidity in a large clinical sample of SP outpatients.
METHOD: The sample comprised 153 outpatients who met DSM-III-R diagnostic criteria for SP. Demographic, family history and course characteristics were investigated by a semi-structured interview. Social phobic symptoms and the severity of the illness have been assessed by the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) and the Liebowitz Social Phobic Disorders Rating Scale, Severity (LSPDRS). Patients completed the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL 90).
RESULTS: Thirty-four patients (22.2%) had a past or current history of alcohol abuse for at least 1 year. There were no significant differences between these patients and those without a history of alcohol abuse, as regards demographic features and lifetime comorbidity with major depression and other anxiety disorders. Bipolar disorder type II was found almost exclusively among patients with alcohol abuse, as well as family history for bipolar disorders.
LIMITATIONS: Retrospective study.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate a strong relationship between bipolar II disorder and alcohol abuse comorbidity in patients with SP. The socializing and disinhibiting effect that many social phobics report might be mediated by mood elation induced by alcohol. The presence of bipolar diathesis in patients presenting with social anxiety might explain their increased susceptibility to alcohol, as they might undertake alcohol abuse as an attempt to overcome social difficulties."
11869783,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11869783/,"BACKGROUND: Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) often coexists with major depressive disorder (MDD). Serotonergic antidepressant medications have emerged as the treatment of choice for both OCD and MDD. In the usual course of events, both the patient's OCD and depressive symptoms improve in parallel following initiation of serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) treatment for OCD. However, such is not always the case. We report here on a series of ten patients whose OCD but not depression improved following a trial of SRI therapy.
METHOD: Ten patients with OCD and comorbid MDD who experienced a worsening or exacerbation of depressive symptoms while being maintained on an adequate dose of SRI therapy were treated using a combination of SRIs and agents with effects on noradrenergic reuptake. Response to treatment was based on clinician-ratings of severity and improvement of OCD and MDD (CGI-S and CGI-I).
RESULTS: Following augmentation, nine of the ten patients had a significant improvement/resolution of their MDD, with little further change in the severity of their OCD.
LIMITATIONS: Inferences from the results of this study are limited by the lack of a control group, the small sample size, and the use of nonstandardized ratings as measures of symptom severity.
CONCLUSIONS: These results are of practical significance to clinicians insofar as they suggest a possible guideline to clinicians treating depression in OCD with SSRIs without success."
11869785,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11869785/,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of EEG abnormalities indicative of mild cerebrovascular dysfunction in patients with late-onset depression and to correlate these abnormalities with clinical features.
METHODS: The subjects, aged > or = 50 years, were 51 outpatients with major depression diagnosed according to DSM-IV criteria. They were living in the community and prospectively selected at their initial consultation for mostly mild-moderate depression. We also included 32 normal age-matched controls. We examined basic rhythms and temporal slow waves on EEG and determined the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) as a scale for the severity of psychiatric symptoms.
RESULTS: Temporal slow waves were more common in depressed patients (47%) than in normal controls (22%). Depressed patients with temporal slow waves had significantly lower frequency of family history of mood disorders (P<0.05). There was no difference in the total score of HAMD between patients with and without temporal slow waves, however, each score of HAMD in patients with temporal slow waves showed a significantly lower score for ""feeling of guilt"" (P<0.01) and a significantly higher score for ""general somatic symptoms"" (P<0.01) and ""hypochondriasis"" (P<0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Our EEG study suggested that temporal slow waves, which were probably associated with subtle cerebrovascular lesions, might reflect vulnerability to late-onset depression. In addition, depressed patients with temporal slow waves could be classified as a subgroup of heterogeneous late-onset depression based on the clinical findings. These results must be interpreted within the limitations of the sample selection procedure."
11870000,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11870000/,"OBJECTIVE: The text of the DSM-IV states that a diagnosis of conduct disorder should be made only if symptoms are caused by an internal psychological dysfunction and not if symptoms are a reaction to a negative environment. However, the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria are purely behavioral and ignore this exclusion. This study empirically evaluated which approach--the text's negative-environment exclusion or the purely behavioral criteria--is more consistent with clinicians' intuitive judgments about whether a disorder is present, whether professional help is needed, and whether the problem is likely to continue.
METHOD: Clinically experienced psychology and social work graduate students were presented with three variations of vignettes describing youths whose behavior satisfied the DSM-IV criteria for conduct disorder. The three variations presented symptoms only, symptoms caused by internal dysfunction, and symptoms caused by reactions to a negative environment. The clinicians rated their level of agreement that the youth described in the vignette had a disorder, needed professional mental health help, and had a problem that was likely to continue into adulthood.
RESULTS: Youths with symptoms caused by internal dysfunction were judged to have a disorder, and those with a reaction to a negative environment not to have a disorder. The difference was not explained by the clinicians' judgments of the youths' need for professional help or the expected duration of symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: The clinicians' judgments supported the validity of the DSM-IV's textual claim that a diagnosis of conduct disorder is valid only when symptoms are due to an internal dysfunction."
11870009,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11870009/,"OBJECTIVE: Patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia display cognitive impairments and abnormal sensitivity to stress. However, little is known about the relationship between these two endophenotypes.
METHOD: Neuropsychological tests were administered to 42 patients with schizophrenia or other psychosis to assess cognitive functioning, and the experience sampling method (a structured diary technique assessing current context and mood in daily life) was used to assess 1) appraised subjective stress related to daily events and activities and 2) emotional reaction to these daily life stressors.
RESULTS: Multilevel random regression analyses showed that in some instances, cognitive functioning did not alter emotional reaction to stress. In other instances, an inverse relationship was found, indicating that a better performance on neuropsychological tests was related to greater emotional reaction to stress.
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that emotional reaction to stress in the daily lives of patients with schizophrenia may not be a consequence of cognitive impairments and that the two mechanisms may act through different pathways. Such pathways may be related to the extremes of clinical outcome that have been observed in schizophrenia: an episodic, reactive, good outcome and a more chronic form characterized by high levels of negative symptoms and cognitive impairments."
11870014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11870014/,"OBJECTIVE: The methods used to evaluate the efficacy of antidepressants differ from treatment for depression in routine clinical practice. The rigorous inclusion/exclusion criteria used to select subjects for participation in efficacy studies potentially limit the generalizability of these trials' results. It is unknown how much impact these criteria have on the representativeness of subjects in efficacy trials. This study estimated the proportion of depressed patients treated in routine clinical practice who would meet standard inclusion/exclusion criteria for an efficacy trial.
METHOD: A total of 803 individuals, aged 16--65 years, who were seen at intake at an outpatient practice underwent a thorough diagnostic evaluation, including the administration of semistructured diagnostic interviews; 346 patients had current major depression. Common inclusion/exclusion criteria used in efficacy studies of antidepressants were applied to the depressed patients to determine how many would have qualified for an efficacy trial.
RESULTS: Approximately one-sixth of the 346 depressed patients would have been excluded from an efficacy trial because they had a bipolar or psychotic subtype of depression. The presence of a comorbid anxiety or substance use disorder, insufficient severity of depressive symptoms, or current suicidal ideation would have excluded 86.0% (N=252) of the remaining 293 outpatients with nonpsychotic unipolar major depressive disorder from an antidepressant efficacy trial.
CONCLUSIONS: Subjects treated in antidepressant trials represent a minority of patients treated for major depression in routine clinical practice. These results show that antidepressant efficacy trials tend to evaluate a subset of depressed individuals with a specific clinical profile."

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We undertook a retrospective review of 50 cases of SD treated at a tertiary university hospital. Twenty-five patients (group 1) were treated with betahistine hydrochloride, prednisone, and daily stellate ganglion block. A second group (group 2) of 25 patients received the same basic treatment with the addition of HBO therapy.
RESULTS: The mean hearing gain was 20.0 dB in group 1 and 37.9 dB in group 2 (P < 0.05). In group 2 patients, the mean gains were 51.4 and 23.3 dB for those younger and older than 50 years (P < 0.05) and 48.9 and 14.5 dB for those younger and older than 60 years (P < 0.001), respectively. In patients older than 60 years, the mean gains were 14.5 and 14.4 dB in group 2 and group 1, respectively (P > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The addition of HBO therapy to the conventional treatment significantly improves the outcome of SD, especially in patients younger than 50 years. Additional HBO therapy provides limited benefit in patients older than 50 years and no benefit in patients older than 60 years."
11871589,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11871589/,"BACKGROUND: Electronic implementation of questionnaires has many advantages, but there may be concerns that it alters versions that were validated on paper.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether electronic implementation alters responses to the SF-36 and asthma quality of life questionnaire (AQLQ), compared to paper implementation.
METHODS: Patients with asthma presenting to a pneumologist were asked for consent to participate. Each patient completed both forms of each questionnaire. The order of presentation was alternated sequentially, with the first patient completing the electronic version first. Each patient waited at least 2 hours between completions to minimize recollection of answers. For both the SF-36 and AQLQ, intraclass correlations coefficients were calculated to compare patients' scores, for each scale and overall, on the electronic and paper versions.
RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients (mean age: 48 years, 50 females) of 311 contacted were enrolled. Overall intraclass correlation coefficients for the SF-36 and AQLQ were excellent (0.965 and 0.991 respectively). For paper versions, eight questions (AQLQ) and 24 (SF-36) were left blank and nine questions (SF-36) were answered incorrectly by patients selecting more than one answer. Electronic data for one patient could not be retrieved.
CONCLUSION: Collecting SF-36 and AQLQ data electronically can decrease the number of spoiled responses without altering the results. Successful implementation depends on proper instruction of the respondent in the handling of the electronic instrument."
11871920,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11871920/,"BACKGROUND: Studies show that subspecialists can provide better quality care than primary care physicians when working within their subspecialty for patients with some medical conditions. However, many subspecialists care for patients outside of their chosen subspecialty. The present study compared the quality of care provided by subspecialists practicing outside of their specialty, general internists, and subspecialists practicing within their specialty.
METHODS: The severity-adjusted mortality rate and the severity-adjusted length of stay were used as indexes of quality of care. Data from 5112 hospital admissions (301 different physicians) for community-acquired pneumonia, acute myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, or upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage at 6 hospitals in the greater Cleveland, Ohio, area were used in this study. The data were severity adjusted with the CHOICE Severity of Illness System.
RESULTS: Subspecialists working outside of their subspecialty cared for 25% of hospitalized patients. When comparing patients cared for by subspecialists practicing outside of their subspecialty, severity-adjusted lengths of stay were longer for patients with congestive heart failure (23% longer; 95% confidence interval [CI], 15%-32%), upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage (22% longer; 95% CI, 7%-39%), and community-acquired pneumonia (14% longer; 95% CI, 5%-24%) than for patients cared for by subspecialists practicing within their subspecialty. Patients also had a slightly higher hospital mortality rate when cared for by subspecialists practicing outside of their specialty than by subspecialists practicing within their subspecialty (mortality rate odds ratio, 1.46; P =.047). In addition, patients cared for by subspecialists practicing outside of their subspecialty had longer lengths of stay, and prolongations of stay were observed for patients with congestive heart failure (16% longer; 95% CI, 8%-26%), upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage (15% longer; 95% CI, 2%-30%), and community-acquired pneumonia (18% longer; 95% CI, 9%-28%) than patients cared for by general internists.
CONCLUSIONS: Subspecialists commonly care for patients outside of their subspecialty, despite the fact that their patients may have longer lengths of stay than those cared for by subspecialists practicing within their specialty or by general internists. In addition, such patients may have slightly higher mortality rates than those cared for by subspecialists practicing within their subspecialty."

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Forty-eight volunteers (24 men and 24 women) consented to have heterosexual intercourse with their regular partner, and to provide samples of urine for testing before and from the first void on the morning after intercourse. After appropriate instruction, volunteers tested their own urine for the presence of blood using standard dipsticks. Any volunteer with haematuria either before or after intercourse was offered a standard haematuria assessment. The results were analysed using the chi-squared test.
RESULTS: None of the volunteers tested positively for haematuria immediately before sexual intercourse; six of the 24 women (25%), but no men, became positive after intercourse (P < 0.01). Only one of the six women accepted the offer of a haematuria evaluation and no pathology was identified.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that up to a quarter of women develop microscopic haematuria as a direct result of sexual intercourse. A history of recent sexual intercourse should therefore be considered when assessing the clinical significance of microscopic haematuria in women."
11872888,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11872888/,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Transcranial Doppler may be used to detect spontaneous cerebral emboli (SCE), but this information will only identify at-risk patients if these individuals are consistently identified over time. We investigated the consistency of SCE production in patients with symptomatic carotid disease.
METHODS: Transcranial Doppler signals from the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery in 25 patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis of >70% were recorded over 1 hour for blind analysis by a panel of trained observers. This was repeated at the same time of day, weekly, for 6 weeks.
RESULTS: The number of patients with SCE increased with each week of monitoring until 13 (52%) were positive. The range of the cumulative number of SCE was 1 to 6. Ten (40%) patients were positive for SCE during only 1 monitoring session, and 2 (8%) were positive for SCE during 2 sessions. SCE-positive patients tended to have more recent symptoms. The correlation coefficients between time elapsed since last cerebral symptom and SCE were weak and not significant.
CONCLUSIONS: Most, if not all, patients with severe carotid disease will eventually produce SCE. However, the production of an SCE is random, and it is likely that many hours of monitoring are required to determine whether a patient with symptomatic carotid disease is SCE positive. SCE are unlikely to identify at-risk patients but may indicate periods of transiently increased risk in individual patients."

Also, to describe the proportion of individuals within the cohort dying with AIDS and the CD4 lymphocyte count before death.
DESIGN: A prospective, longitudinal, population-based cohort.
METHODS: Since 1990, 107 HIV-prevalent cases, 168 incident cases and 235 HIV-seronegative controls have been recruited into a cohort in rural Uganda. Participants are recruited from the general population and they are reviewed routinely every 3 months and at other times when ill.
RESULTS: The median time from seroconversion to death was 9.8 years. Age over 40 years at seroconversion was associated with more rapid progression (P < 0.001, log rank test). For the first 4 years of the study, HIV contributed little to the death rates in the HIV incident cases, but after 5 years, the contribution of HIV became greater and was particularly marked in the oldest age group. Survival rates in the cohort were similar to those in the general population. The median time from seroconversion to AIDS was 9.4 years and from AIDS to death was 9.2 months. Of those infected with HIV-1, 80% died with AIDS and 20% had a CD4 count < 10 x 106 cells/l.
CONCLUSIONS: Survival with HIV-1 infection is similar in Africa to industrialized countries before the use of antiretroviral therapy; when they do die, many of those in Africa are severely immunosuppressed and most have clinical features of AIDS."
11873044,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11873044/,"BACKGROUND: Volatile anesthetics precondition against myocardial infarction, but it is unknown whether this beneficial action is threshold- or dose-dependent. The authors tested the hypothesis that isoflurane decreases myocardial infarct size in a dose-dependent fashion in vivo.
METHODS: Barbiturate-anesthetized dogs (n = 40) were instrumented for measurement of systemic hemodynamics including aortic and left ventricular pressures and rate of increase of left ventricular pressure. Dogs were subjected to a 60-min left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion followed by 3 h of reperfusion and were randomly assigned to receive either 0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, or 1.25 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) isoflurane in separate groups. Isoflurane was administered for 30 min and discontinued 30 min before left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion.
RESULTS: Infarct size (triphenyltetrazolium staining) was 29 +/- 2% of the area at risk in control experiments (0.0 MAC). Isoflurane produced significant (P < 0.05) reductions of infarct size (17 +/- 3, 13 +/- 1, 14 +/- 2, and 11 +/- 1% of the area at risk during 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.25 MAC, respectively). Infarct size was inversely related to coronary collateral blood flow (radioactive microspheres) in control experiments and during low (0.25 or 0.5 MAC) but not higher concentrations of isoflurane. Isoflurane shifted the linear regression relation between infarct size and collateral perfusion downward (indicating cardioprotection) in a dose-dependent fashion.
CONCLUSIONS: Concentrations of isoflurane as low as 0.25 MAC are sufficient to precondition myocardium against infarction. High concentrations of isoflurane may have greater efficacy to protect myocardium during conditions of low coronary collateral blood flow."

Cases were compared with five biopsies of age-matched patients showing none of the above-mentioned clinical data. All the biopsies were formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded and stained with hematoxilin-eosin, Masson trichrome and reticulin stain.
RESULTS: The biopsies of the six treated patients showed variable-in-size stellate-shaped spots of glandular loss replaced by dense connective tissue with few inflammatory cells. The fibrous tissue showed a central area of scarring and radially oriented spikes extending to adjacent interglandular tissue, more evident with the Masson trichrome stain. Density of inflammatory cells in the lamina propria was variable. H. Pylori organisms were consistently absent. On the reticulin stain the atrophic areas showed coarser and compacted reticulin. Stellate scars were not present in the five controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Small foci with fibrous scars may be found in children with long standing HpCG, perhaps as an early sequel of it. We hypothesize that if the chronic gastritis-gastric atrophy process is a continuum, these stellate scars may be representing the very beginning of the multifocal atrophic gastritis usually seen in adult patients."
11873712,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11873712/,"METHOD: We performed a literature search using Medline and Psycinfo databases and Google Internet search engine.
RESULTS: We identified 6 clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). All stress the need for antipsychotic therapy and psychosocial interventions. Differences lie in types of antipsychotics recommended, duration of antipsychotic trial, management of extrapyramidal symptoms, and types of psychosocial interventions. Areas poorly addressed by all guidelines include definition of the stable phase of schizophrenia, management of adverse effects with atypical agents, management of clozapine nonresponders, and management of personality issues.
CONCLUSION: Published CPGs are helpful in the management of the stable phase of schizophrenia, although no single CPG series appears to address all treatment needs faced by practising clinicians."
11874311,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11874311/,"BACKGROUND: Although curricular reforms have attempted to address sources of stress in medical residency, no recent studies have examined the financial or emotional situations of current medicine residents.
OBJECTIVE: To question medicine residents about financial status, educational debt, moonlighting, and psychological issues.
DESIGN: Survey distributed in a nonrandomized fashion to medicine residents.
SETTING: All 415 U.S. medicine residency programs.
RESULTS: According to the questionnaire responses submitted by the 4128 (18%) participating residents, a substantial number of residents had financial and emotional distress that could have interfered with training. The reported educational debt was at least $50 000 for 1657 (42%) of the respondents and at least $100 000 for 737 (19%). The monthly disposable income was $100 or less for 1620 (43%) of the residents, and 637 residents (16%) could not afford safe housing. Among respondents in their 2nd through 5th year of postgraduate training, 2187 (52%) had insufficient funds to purchase books and equipment, and 678 (29%) could not afford the required fees for the American Board of Internal Medicine certifying examination; 2659 (33%) worked as moonlighters, and this percentage increased progressively with increasing educational debt. Four or five depressive symptoms during residency were reported by 1461 (35%) residents. Eight hundred ninety-nine residents (23%) thought they had become less humanistic over the course of their residency training; 2347 (61%) reported becoming more cynical. Female residents were more likely than male residents to report increased cynicism and multiple depressive symptoms. Increased cynicism and depressive symptoms were associated with increasing educational debt.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite recent curricular reforms, an alarming number of current medicine residents report depressive symptoms, increasing cynicism, and decreasing humanism, which were associated with increasing educational debt and a need to moonlight for financial survival. Ongoing curricular reform, legislative relief from early loan repayment, and salary increases may be necessary to address these problems."
11875352,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11875352/,"OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated whether information about computed dynamic posturography given to subjects instructed to feign vestibular impairment (malingerers) improved their attempts to display test patterns consistent with vestibular weakness.
STUDY DESIGN: The study design was prospective, with blinded scoring of tests.
SETTING: The study was conducted at a university hospital.
PATIENTS: Sixty volunteer subjects, 20 to 59 years old, were randomly assigned to one of two equal groups: naïve subjects and subjects informed about computed dynamic posturography.
INTERVENTIONS: Computed dynamic posturography was performed twice. First, subjects were instructed to feign a vestibular weakness. Second, subjects were instructed to perform the test normally. One group was given additional information about computed dynamic posturography before the first test (informed faking).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The computed dynamic posturography test summaries were scored as normal, aphysiologic, or vestibular by two methods: the scoring method published by Cevette et al. in 1995 and blinded clinical scoring. The computed dynamic posturography test summaries of patients referred for vestibular disorders were included with the test summaries collected from subjects during scoring. These additional tests of possible ""true"" vestibular disorder allowed evaluation of scoring accuracy.
RESULTS: The scoring method of Cevette et al. classified about one-third of the test results of feigned vestibular weakness as either normal (16.7%) or vestibular weakness (18.3%). The remaining two thirds of the test results of feigned vestibular weakness were classified as aphysiologic (65.0%). Blinded clinical scoring gave similar figures. Additional information about computed dynamic posturography did not increase the number of feigned test results scored as a vestibular weakness.
CONCLUSION: When additional information about computed dynamic posturography was provided, the subjects did not improve their ability to feign vestibular weakness. This investigation supports the use of scoring computed dynamic posturography results by the formulae of Cevette et al. in separating aphysiologic behavior from vestibular impairment."
11876055,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11876055/,"PURPOSE: Diogenes syndrome is characterised by self-neglect and domestic squalor which leads to unhealthy living conditions. It seems that no single model satisfactorily explains the development of Diogenes syndrome.
METHODS: We report four cases of Diogenes syndrome discovered during a short-stay geriatric hospitalization. We were able to analyse them as regards social, physical, psychiatric and cognitive aspects.
RESULTS: The results showed absence of socioeconomic precariousness, psychiatric and physical pathologies which generate handicaps. A dementia characterised by a frontal dysfunction was constantly found.
CONCLUSION: Diogenes syndrome seems to be a particular behavioural demonstration of a frontal lobe dementia. It does not correspond to a lucid life choice, which must encourage a medico-social assumption."
11876083,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11876083/,"OBJECTIVES: Topiramate, a fairly new anticonvulsant, is increasingly being used as a mood stabilizer in bipolar and schizoaffective disorders. One common side effect is a reduced appetite that often results in weight loss. This finding raises the interesting question of whether both mood and body weight can be stabilized in patients who have gained weight while being treated with neuroleptics for one of the disorders mentioned above.
METHODS: We studied the body weight, subjective sense of well-being, and psychopathology in two adolescent patients who were being treated with topiramate (alone or in combination with a neuroleptic drug). Both patients had reduced appetite, while body weight either remained stable or was reduced.
RESULTS: The patients reported both improved control of food intake and mood stabilization.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that adolescents with affective disturbance who have gained weight on neuroleptic drugs may benefit from topiramate in terms of mood stabilization and body weight control."
11876433,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11876433/,"INTRODUCTION: This study attempts to account for variation in the number of prescription medications concurrently consumed in geriatric populations.
METHODS: Data were selected from The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, III, 1988-1994 (NHANES III), Adult Household Questionnaire, a complex, multistage, clustered sampling of civilian, non-institutionalized populations, which included a volunteer sample of 5,249 individuals aged 65 and older who participated in NHANES III survey, representing four broad geographic regions and twelve states.
RESULTS: Age, income, and educational level accounted for nine percent of the variation in the number of prescription medications concurrently taken (p < 0.0001); though non-significant, there were gender differences regarding polypharmacy; in addition, there were significant differences with respect to educational levels by region and age by region (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Educational level accounted for the most variation in polypharmacy. Women, on average, consumed more prescription medications than men. Older, more educated women may be most likely to engage in polypharmaceutical consumption, suggesting a greater likelihood of an adverse drug event."
11876687,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11876687/,"BACKGROUND: It has been demonstrated that adjuvant chemotherapy in TNM stage III and palliative chemotherapy are effective treatments for colon cancer.
AIM: To determine changes over a 10-year period in the practice of adjuvant and palliative chemotherapy for colon cancer in a well-defined French population.
METHODS: Some 4093 patients with colon adenocarcinoma diagnosed between 1989 and 1998 were studied. To estimate the independent effect of the studied variables, a non-conditional logistical regression was performed.
RESULTS: The proportion of patients with stage II disease treated with adjuvant chemotherapy increased from 2.3% (1989-90) to 20.5% (1997-98). The corresponding figures for stage III patients were 7.1% and 54.9%. This increase was particularly marked in younger patients, with 47.3% of stage II and 86.1% of stage III patients under the age of 65 years being treated in the 1997-98 period, compared with 4.9% and 24.4% of those over 75 years for the same period (P < 0.0001). The use of palliative chemotherapy increased over time from 13.6% (1989-90) to 38.9% (1997-98). Again, this increase was more dramatic in the younger age group.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of adjuvant chemotherapy has increased for stage II disease despite the absence of proven effectiveness. Both adjuvant and palliative chemotherapy are still under-prescribed in patients over the age of 75 years."
11877351,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11877351/,"BACKGROUND: It has been established that hyperhomocyst(e)inemia (HHCy) is an independent and graded risk factor for atherosclerosis, although the molecular link to the atherosclerotic process remains obscure.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Screening human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with complementary DNA microarray for the gene expression modified by homocysteine (Hcy) revealed that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) was upregulated. This effect was confirmed using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Actinomycin D studies revealed that Hcy stabilized HMGCR mRNA (tau(1/2), 9.5 +/- 1.0 versus 5.0 +/- 0.2 hours). Expression of immunodetectable HMGCR in both HUVECs and renal microvascular endothelial cells was increased in Hcy-treated cells in association with the increased abundance of caveolin. Application of a cell-permeable superoxide dismutase mimetic, Mn-TBAP, reversed the Hcy-induced expression of HMGCR. Additional biochemical analysis of the abundance of total cellular cholesterol showed that 0, 20, 50, and 100 micromol/L Hcy resulted in 22.2 +/- 7.3%, 39.5 +/- 1.2%, and 50.4 +/- 6.8% increase, respectively. Gas chromatography mass spectrometry analysis of extracted cholesterol from Hcy-treated HUVECs and from the culture medium showed 17.8 +/- 5.2% and 24.0 +/- 14.5% increases, respectively. Application of simvastatin to Hcy-treated cells reduced cellular cholesterol and prevented Hcy-induced suppression of NO production by HUVECs in a dose-dependent manner.
CONCLUSIONS: Using a cDNA microarray, the data disclosed an unexpected link between Hcy and cholesterol dysregulation based on the finding of increased abundance of HMGCR mRNA and protein in endothelial cells, demonstrated the possible role of Hcy-induced oxidative stress in this response, and revealed the improvement of endothelial NO production in Hcy-treated HUVECs by statins. Collectively, these findings may provide a solid explanation for the observed proatherogenic effect of HHcy."
11877640,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11877640/,"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Laparoscopic Appendectomy (LA) is a safe procedure in adults resulting in shorter hospitalization and sooner return to activity. The relative merits of LA and open appendectomy (OA) are evaluated in this first prospective and randomized study in children.
METHODS: A total of 129 children with appendicitis were included. Forty-three boys and 45 girls, age 1 to 16 years, were enrolled. Randomization was determined by sealed assignment card. OA utilized a 3- to 4-cm right lower quadrant, muscle-splitting incision. Wounds were closed without drains. Antibiotics, when used, consisted of gentamycin, clindamycin, and ampicillin. LA was performed by experienced surgeons utilizing a 3-trocar technique with reusable instruments. Twenty-one children (24%) were perforated. Patients were discharged as soon as they were taking a diet and afebrile. Statistical comparisons were by Fisher's Exact and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests.
RESULTS: There were no differences in postoperative analgesia, resumption of oral intake, length of hospitalization, return to normal activities, or morbidity. Laparoscopic appendectomy was associated with longer operating times and increased cost.
CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic appendectomy in children is not associated with the same advantages reported in adults. LA is a more expensive alternative and offers no advantages related to pain relief, length of stay, return to normal activities, or morbidity."
11878651,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11878651/,"BACKGROUND: The importance of molecular shape and electrostatic potential in determining the activities of 11 structurally-diverse i.v. general anaesthetics was investigated using computational chemistry techniques.
METHODS: The free plasma anaesthetic concentrations that abolished the response to noxious stimulation were obtained from the literature. The similarities in the molecular shapes and electrostatic potentials of the agents to eltanolone (the most potent anaesthetic agent in the group) were calculated using Carbo indices, and correlated with in vivo potency.
RESULTS: The best model obtained was based on the similarities of the anaesthetics to two eltanolone conformers (r2=0.820). This model correctly predicted the potencies of the R- and S-enantiomers of ketamine, but identified alphaxalone as an outlier. Exclusion of alphaxalone substantially improved the activity correlation (r2=0.972). A bench mark model based on octanol/water partition coefficients (r2=0.647) failed to predict the potency order of the ketamine enantiomers.
CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that a single activity model can be formulated for chiral and non-chiral i.v. anaesthetic agents using molecular similarity indices."
11879114,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11879114/,"CONTEXT: Depressive disorders are highly prevalent in the general population, but recognition and accurate diagnosis are made difficult by the lack of a simple confirmatory test.
OBJECTIVE: To review the accuracy and precision of depression questionnaires and the clinical examination for diagnosing clinical depression.
DATA SOURCES: We searched the English-language literature from 1970 through July 2000 using MEDLINE, a specialized registry of depression trials, and bibliographies of selected articles.
STUDY SELECTION: Case-finding studies were included if they used depression questionnaires with easy to average literacy requirements, evaluated at least 100 primary care patients, and compared questionnaire results with accepted diagnostic criteria for major depression. Eleven questionnaires, ranging in length from 1 to 30 questions, were assessed in 28 published studies. Reliability studies for the clinical examination required criterion-based diagnoses made by at least 2 clinicians who interviewed the patient or reviewed a taped examination. Fourteen studies evaluated interrater reliability.
DATA EXTRACTION: Pairs of authors independently reviewed articles. For case-finding studies, quality assessment addressed sample size and whether patients were selected consecutively or randomly, the criterion standard was administered and interpreted independently of and blind to the results of the case-finding instrument, and the proportion of persons receiving the criterion standard assessment was less than or more than 50% of those approached for criterion standard assessment. For reliability studies, quality assessment addressed whether key patient characteristics were described, the interviewers collected clinical history independently, and diagnoses were made blinded to other clinicians' evaluations.
DATA SYNTHESIS: In case-finding studies, average questionnaire administration times ranged from less than 1 minute to 5 minutes. The median likelihood ratio positive for major depression was 3.3 (range, 2.3-12.2) and the median likelihood ratio negative was 0.19 (range, 0.14-0.35). No significant differences between questionnaires were found. For mental health care professionals using a semistructured interview, agreement was substantial to almost perfect for major depression (kappa = 0.64-0.93). Nonstandardized interviews yielded somewhat lower agreement (kappa = 0.55-0.74). A single study showed that primary care clinicians using a semistructured interview have high agreement with mental health care professionals (kappa = 0.71).
CONCLUSIONS: Multiple, practical questionnaires with reasonable performance characteristics are available to help clinicians identify and diagnose patients with major depression. Diagnostic confirmation by mental health care professionals using a clinical interview or by primary care physicians using a semistructured interview can be made with high reliability."
11879341,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11879341/,"PURPOSE: Genetic factors are the only identified cause of idiopathic generalized epilepsies (IGEs), but the majority of cases do not have affected first-degree relatives. Here we investigate whether subjects with sporadic and familial IGE differ in terms of antecedent events and clinical and EEG features. Differences would support the hypothesis of a different etiology for sporadic cases, which has implications for choice of subjects for genetic association studies.
METHODS: We analyzed 98 patients with IGE, diagnosed on clinical and EEG criteria. All patients and, if possible, one relative were interviewed, with special emphasis on potential antecedent events and family history. Patients with first-degree relatives affected with epileptic seizures were regarded as ""familial,"" and the other patients were regarded as ""sporadic.""
RESULTS: Of the 98 IGE patients, 32 (33%) patients were familial. The risk for seizures was 13.2% for siblings, and 7.7% for parents. The distribution of the IGE subsyndromes, the presence of antecedent events, and other electroclinical features did not differ between familial and sporadic IGE groups.
CONCLUSIONS: No differences were found between familial and sporadic IGE patients. This does not the support the hypothesis that sporadic and familial IGE cases have separate etiologies."
11879385,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11879385/,"PURPOSE: Autonomic seizures in temporal lobe epilepsies associated with ""cold shivers and goose bumps"" as a principal ictal sign or aura have only rarely been studied.
METHODS: Sixteen patients with autonomic auras [cold shivers or cold sweats (n=11), goose bumps (n=4), one patient showed both ictal signs] were analyzed.
RESULTS: Lesions were detected in 12 patients. The etiology was heterogeneous [cryptogenic, arteriovenous (AV)-malformation cyst, trauma, hippocampal sclerosis]. Eight patients underwent epilepsy surgery. The localization and lateralization of the focal epileptic activity in the temporal lobes was determined either by magnetic resonance imaging lesions, EEG, ictal signs, or single-photon emission computed tomography imaging.
CONCLUSIONS: The patients with temporal lobe epilepsies associated with ""cold shivers and/or goose bumps"" showed a left hemispheric predominance of the focal abnormality in the temporal lobe."
11879514,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11879514/,"CONTEXT: The family medicine clerkship at the University of Calgary is a 4-week mandatory rotation in the final year of a 3-year programme. Students are given the opportunity to experience rural practice by training at 1 of several rural practices.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether exposure to a rural educational experience changes students' likelihood of doing a rural locum or rural practice and whether student background and gender are related to these practice plans.
METHOD: Clinical clerks from the Classes of 1996-2000, who trained at rural sites, responded to questionnaire items both before and after the rural educational experience. Responses to the questionnaire items and discipline of postgraduate training served as dependent variables. Student background and gender were independent variables.
RESULTS: As a result of the rural educational experience all students were more likely to do a rural locum. Compared to their urban-raised peers, students from rural backgrounds reported a significantly greater likelihood of doing a rural locum and practising in a rural community, irrespective of gender or participating in a rural educational experience. There was no relationship between background and career choice.
CONCLUSION: A rural educational experience at the undergraduate level increases the stated likelihood of students participating in rural locums and helps to solidify existing rural affiliations. Students with rural backgrounds have a more favourable attitude toward rural practice. This pre-post study provides further support for the preferential admission to medical school of students with rural backgrounds to help alleviate the rural physician shortage."

METHODS: Two hundred men undergoing vasectomy were randomized to receive either a standard vasectomy or vasectomy plus irrigation of each vas deferens with sterile water. The interval between vasectomy and the production of two azoospermic semen samples was recorded.
RESULTS: Overall, 37 patients were excluded for failing to follow the postvasectomy protocol for semen analysis, leaving 87 in the control group and 76 who received vasal irrigation. No statistically significant differences existed between the two groups with regard to the mean time to clearance (26.4 weeks, control group versus 28.6 weeks, flush group), proportion clear at 16 weeks (29% versus 21%), or proportion with lingering sperm at 40 weeks (22% versus 26%).
CONCLUSIONS: Irrigation of the vas deferens with sterile water does not accelerate the clearance of spermatozoa after vasectomy. Men wishing to undergo vasectomy must be counseled about the possibility of lingering sperm."
11880794,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11880794/,"BACKGROUND: Withdrawals of health plans from Medicare have affected more than 1.6 million beneficiaries. Some plans claim that providing higher quality care raises costs, lowers profits, and spurs withdrawal because plans cannot sustain high quality care under current payment levels.
OBJECTIVE: To assess whether higher performance by Medicare health plans on quality indicators was associated with withdrawal.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SUBJECTS: Taking each county where a contract was active as a unit of analysis, Medicare managed care plans active in 2310 contract-county combinations in 1997 were studied and followed for 3 years.
MEASURES: Independent variables were scores on six indicators from the Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS) for each contract, collapsed into two summary measures: clinical and ambulatory care access. Separate Cox proportional hazards regressions were used for each indicator, and each summary measure, to assess the association of HEDIS performance with our outcome measure, time-to-withdrawal from Medicare. Multiple potential confounders were adjusted for.
RESULTS: Of 2310 managed care contract-county combinations, 877 (38%) withdrew. The proportion of contract-counties with high scores on the summary clinical quality measure that withdrew was one-fifth that for low scorers (4.2% vs. 20.5%). For summary ambulatory care access performance, the corresponding ratio was two-fifths (12.8% vs. 32.0%). Lower payments were associated with higher withdrawal risk, but also higher clinical and ambulatory care access quality performance. In separate multivariable analyses controlling for confounders, both high clinical performance (HR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.08-0.42) and high ambulatory care access performance (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.27-1.07) were independently associated with lower withdrawal risk.
CONCLUSIONS: Health plans continuing to provide care to Medicare beneficiaries have higher average performance on HEDIS clinical and ambulatory care access measures than plans that withdrew."
11880839,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11880839/,"STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of cases in which a single solid rod was used for the anterior correction of thoracolumbar and lumbar idiopathic scoliosis in adults.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and outcomes in these patients.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Anterior spinal fusion with instrumentation has been found to be kyphogenic in the treatment of scoliosis. Recent reports have shown an extremely high rate of pseudarthrosis and implant failure even in adolescents who have undergone anterior spinal fusion with a single flexible or rigid rod.
METHODS: Fifteen consecutive adult patients with (average age, 37.5 years) had undergone anterior spinal fusion with a rigid rod were included in this study. One was lost to follow-up, leaving 14 patients with a complete radiographic follow-up of 44 months and clinical follow-up of 61 months. Patients were sent the Modified Scoliosis Research Society (SRS) Outcomes Instrument, charts were reviewed, and preoperative, postoperative, and final follow-up films of the entire spine were evaluated by independent reviewers uninvolved in the care of the patients.
RESULTS: The average preoperative major curve was 50 degrees, which improved to 16 degrees at follow-up (a 66% correction). The average correction of the upper compensatory curve and lower fractional curve were 40% and 61%, respectively. The thoracolumbar sagittal plane alignment was maintained or improved in all patients (i.e., this surgery did not induce kyphosis in any patient). On average 0.9 levels were ""saved"" compared with levels chosen by the authors for posterior surgery. All patients achieved a solid fusion. Follow-up Modified SRS questionnaires revealed a satisfaction score 4.5 out of a possible score of 5, a pain score of 4.1 out of 5, a self-image score of 4.1 out of 5, a function score of 4.1 out of 5, and a mental health score of 4.0 out of 5, with an overall score of 82%. All patients but one were satisfied or extremely satisfied with the results of surgery. There was no incidence of implant breakage.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of anterior spinal fusion using a single solid rod in adults with idiopathic scoliosis in this series are excellent, with 100% fusion rate, no development of kyphosis, and no incidence of hardware failure."
11880860,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11880860/,"OBJECTIVES: We reported earlier that vasopressin (AVP) peptide expression is significantly decreased in the postmortem hypothalamus of glucocorticoid (GC) treated patients, while such a decrease was not observed in AVP prohormone (proAVP) expression. This indicated a GC-induced suppression of AVP synthesis at the posttranslational level. Here, we investigated in detail whether this decreased levels of AVP expression in GC treated patients might be due to the down regulation of the prohormone convertases PC-1 and PC-2, and the molecular chaperone 7B2, as was reported previously in some AVP-related disorders.
MATERIALS & METHODS: An immunocytochemical study was performed on post-mortem hypothalami of GC exposed patients and controls, in which quantification of proAVP, AVP, neurophysin (NP) and oxytocin (OXT) expression were done along with the quantification of PC1, PC2 and 7B2 expression in the paraventricular nucleus, by using a computerized image analysis system.
RESULTS: Expression of processed AVP in GC exposed patients was significantly decreased (p=0.021), while the amount of proAVP expression was unchanged. Despite the strong correlation between AVP and NP (the other cleavage product of proAVP) expression in the GC group (r=0.917, p=0.004), the mean NP immunoreactivity did not show a significant decrease in this group. Also the OXT expression was similar in both groups. Although in most of the GC treated patients, the expression intensities of PC1 and PC2 were decreased parallel to the decrease in AVP, the mean expression levels of neither of PC1 and PC2, nor of 7B2 were statistically different between the groups (p=0.20-0.80).
CONCLUSION: We conclude that the suppression of AVP expression by GCs is not mediated solely by the down regulation of PC1, PC2 or 7B2. Other mechanisms, which may contribute to the GC-induced posttranslational suppression of AVP, are discussed."

METHODS: Caloric intake and nutritional complications were recorded for ten days period in patients receiving gastric (n = 21) and jejunal (n = 22) feeding.
RESULTS: Caloric requirements were reached on the 3rd day of nutrition in 86% of jejunal and 28% of gastric feeding patients (p 0.001). In jejunal group, delivered calorie/goal calorie ratio was found 15-20% higher than the gastric group. Serum albumin, triglyceride, cholesterol levels and nitrogen balance did not show significant differences between groups. Vomiting (p 0.01) and colouring of tracheal aspirates (p 0.05) were more frequent in gastric group, however positive tracheal culture frequency did not differ between the groups.

11882222,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11882222/,"BACKGROUND: Because of the lack of controlled studies, there is no consensus of opinion about the practice of routine haemostasis tests before neuraxial blockade in children. The purpose of this study was to compare the influence of two different strategies of coagulation evaluation on the incidence of diagnosed coagulopathies leading to a modification of the preoperative or anaesthetic management in children who were scheduled for caudal, epidural or intrathecal block.
METHODS: For a 24-month period (period 1, retrospective study, n=751), haemostasis screening was undertaken only after family and personal history and physical examination in all patients. For the following 24 months (period 2, prospective study, n=958), a standardized questionnaire was used. In addition, routine tests (prothrombin, partial thromboplastin time, platelet count) were performed in children who where not yet walking. In older children, coagulation tests were undertaken as in period 1.
RESULTS: Overall, 26 significant abnormalities were diagnosed. Coagulation tests were performed in 16.2% (period 1) and 78.2% (period 2) of the children, who were not yet walking. Routine tests did not improve the diagnosis of haemostasis abnormalities justifying a modification of the preoperative and anaesthetic management (2.2% from 406 children in period 1 vs 4.1% from 266 children in period 2). The predictive positive value of routine tests (period 2) was 19%, vs 45% for specific tests (period 1) (P < 0.001). In older children, the use of a standardized form increased the number of haemostasis screenings without improvement of diagnosis leading to modified preoperative management (0.3% from 315 children in period 1 vs 0.5% from 628 children in period 2).
CONCLUSIONS: When routine testing is performed in nonwalking children, the screening number increases without leading to a higher number of anaesthetic management changes, suggesting that routine testing does not seem to provide much extra information in the absence of a positive history."

The aim of this study was to determine if AAP guidelines are adhered to in pediatric primary care.
STUDY DESIGN: In all, 1032 electronic charts of children 4 to 17 years old presenting for well-child visits to 17 pediatricians between January 1 and December 31, 2010, were manually reviewed. Abstracted data included demographic variables and documentation of snoring as well as other sleep-related complaints.
RESULTS: The mean age was 8.5 ± 3.9 years (mean ± standard deviation), 49.9% were male, and 79.7% were Hispanic; 24.4% (n = 252) were screened for snoring. Of the children screened for sleep-related issues, 34.1% (n = 86) snored, but the majority of them (61.6%, n = 53) received no further evaluation. In the present sample, 0.5% (n = 5) had a diagnosis of OSA.
CONCLUSIONS: The low prevalence of OSA may be explained by the relatively low frequency of sleep-related problem screening by pediatricians and thus the inordinately low adherence to the AAP guidelines. Modification and transition to electronic medical records as well as expanded efforts to educate health care providers and caregivers may improve detection and timely treatment of children at risk for SDB."
23204013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23204013/,"BACKGROUND: Dutch policy makers needed a knowledge base for prioritising control of different indoor air pollutants. Several burden of disease (BoD) estimates were available, but it was not known if they could be applied to The Netherlands.
OBJECTIVES: To quantify the BoD related to indoor air in The Netherlands, and to compare the outcomes with a previous study (EnVIE), which used a different BoD methodology.
RESULTS: The largest BoD was attributable to environmental tobacco smoke. The next most important indoor air pollutants were radon and thoron from soils and building materials, followed by dampness and carbon monoxide (CO). Formaldehyde exposure did not contribute to the total BoD, according to our estimates. The EnVIE estimate was three times higher, and the most important indoor air pollutants by BoD were combustion products from outdoor sources, bioaerosols due to dampness and by outdoor sources, volatile organic compounds, radon from soils, pathogens and CO. The differences in estimates were primarily caused by the different selection or definition of substances in indoor air, rather than the differing BoD methodology.
CONCLUSIONS: Indoor air exposure is associated with a considerable BoD in The Netherlands; approximately 1500 healthy life years per 1 million inhabitants are lost due to 1 year of exposure. The results from the different BoD studies examined here are difficult to compare--even the relative order of most important pollutants depends on choices and assumptions in the assessment. A careful evaluation of BoD estimates is required before they can be used in policy making."
23204049,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23204049/,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Previous studies have suggested that family members with intracranial aneurysms (IAs) often harbor IAs in similar anatomic locations. IA location is important because of its association with rupture. We tested the hypothesis that anatomic susceptibility to IA location exists using a family-based IA study.
METHODS: We identified all affected probands and first-degree relatives (FDRs) with a definite or probable phenotype in each family. We stratified each IA of the probands by major arterial territory and calculated each family's proband-FDR territory concordance and overall contribution to the concordance analysis. We then matched each family unit to an unrelated family unit selected randomly with replacement and performed 1001 simulations. The median concordance proportions, odds ratios (ORs), and P values from the 1001 logistic regression analyses were used to represent the final results of the analysis.
RESULTS: There were 323 family units available for analysis, including 323 probands and 448 FDRs, with a total of 1176 IAs. IA territorial concordance was higher in the internal carotid artery (55.4% versus 45.6%; OR, 1.54 [1.04-2.27]; P=0.032), middle cerebral artery (45.8% versus 30.5%; OR, 1.99 [1.22-3.22]; P=0.006), and vertebrobasilar system (26.6% versus 11.3%; OR, 2.90 [1.05-8.24], P=0.04) distributions in the true family compared with the comparison family. Concordance was also higher when any location was considered (53.0% versus 40.7%; OR, 1.82 [1.34-2.46]; P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In a highly enriched sample with familial predisposition to IA development, we found that IA territorial concordance was higher when probands were compared with their own affected FDRs than with comparison FDRs, which suggests that anatomic vulnerability to IA formation exists. Future studies of IA genetics should consider stratifying cases by IA location."
23204197,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23204197/,"BACKGROUND: This study examined the predictive ability of educational background and demographic variables, available at the admission stage, to identify applicants who will graduate in 4 years from podiatric medical school.
METHODS: A logistic regression model was used to identify two predictors of 4-year graduation: age at matriculation and total Medical College Admission Test score. The model was cross-validated using a second independent sample from the same population. Cross-validation gives greater confidence that the results could be more generally applied.
RESULTS: Total Medical College Admission Test score was the strongest predictor of 4-year graduation, with age at matriculation being a statistically significant but weaker predictor.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the model's capacity to predict 4-year graduation better than random assignment, a sufficient amount of error in prediction remained, suggesting that important predictors are missing from the model. Furthermore, the high rate of false-positives makes it inappropriate to use age and Medical College Admission Test score as admission screens in an attempt to eliminate attrition by not accepting at-risk students."
23204200,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23204200/,"BACKGROUND: This study examined the success of an admission screen in identifying applicants who will fail Part I or Part II of the Podiatric Boards on the first attempt.
METHODS: A logistic regression model was used to predict failure on the Podiatric Boards.
RESULTS: The biology Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) score predicted failure on Part I and Part II. Adding undergraduate grade point average and the other MCAT subscores did not significantly improve the prediction. Although a screen based on the biology MCAT score can identify nearly 90% of those who fail, there are six false-positives for every true-positive.
CONCLUSIONS: First-time Board failure can be predicted, but Board failure must be primarily addressed by interventions after matriculation rather than by an admission screen."
23204202,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23204202/,"BACKGROUND: Most medical school admission committees use cognitive and noncognitive measures to inform their final admission decisions. We evaluated using admission data to predict academic success for podiatric medical students using first-semester grade point average (GPA) and cumulative GPA at graduation as outcome measures.
METHODS: In this study, we used linear multiple regression to examine the predictive power of an admission screen. A cross-validation technique was used to assess how the results of the regression model would generalize to an independent data set.
RESULTS: Undergraduate GPA and Medical College Admission Test score accounted for only 22% of the variance in cumulative GPA at graduation. Undergraduate GPA, Medical College Admission Test score, and a time trend variable accounted for only 24% of the variance in first-semester GPA.
CONCLUSIONS: Seventy-five percent of the individual variation in cumulative GPA at graduation and first-semester GPA remains unaccounted for by admission screens that rely on only cognitive measures, such as undergraduate GPA and Medical College Admission Test score. A reevaluation of admission screens is warranted, and medical educators should consider broadening the criteria used to select the podiatric physicians of the future."
23204211,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23204211/,"AIMS: Previous studies have demonstrated poor sensitivity of guideline weight monitoring in predicting clinical deterioration of heart failure (HF). This study aimed to evaluate patterns of remotely transmitted daily weights in a high-risk HF population and also to compare guideline weight monitoring and an individualized weight monitoring algorithm.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Consenting, consecutive, high-risk patients were provided with a mobile phone-based remote weight telemonitoring device. We aimed to evaluate population vs. individual weight variability, weight patterns pre- and post-events of clinical deterioration of HF, and to compare guideline weight thresholds with the HeartPhone algorithm in terms of sensitivity and specificity for such events. Of 87 patients recruited and followed for an average of 23.9 ± 12 weeks, 19 patients experienced 28 evaluable episodes of clinical deterioration of HF. Following a post-discharge decline, the population average weight remained stable for the follow-up period, yet the 7-day moving average of individual patients exceeded 2 kg in three-quarters of patients. Significant increases in weight were observed up to 4 days before HF events. The HeartPhone algorithm was significantly more sensitive (82%) in predicting HF events than guideline weight thresholds of 2 kg over 2-3 days (21%) and a 'rule of thumb' threshold of 1.36 kg over 1 day (46%).
CONCLUSIONS: An individualized approach to weight monitoring in HF with the HeartPhone algorithm improved prediction of HF deterioration. Further evaluation of HeartPhone with and without other biomarkers of HF deterioration is warranted."
23204213,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23204213/,"BACKGROUND: Vegetable consumption varies highly across households, based on household structure and socio-economic status, but little is known about the share of fresh vs. processed (e.g. frozen or canned) vegetables. Our aim was to compare the social and economic determinants of fresh and processed vegetable consumption.
METHODS: We reviewed detailed data on vegetable purchases for at-home consumption of 2600 French households during 2007. We took into account a wide range of processed vegetables (excluding potatoes) and made a distinction between fresh vegetables, processed vegetables and baby food containing vegetables. We conducted regression analyses to predict consumption of fresh and processed vegetables in kilograms per year and unit values in euros per kilogram.
RESULTS: About 60% of the vegetables bought by the sample households were fresh. Fresh vegetable consumption increased with the respondent's income, age and educational level, and with the number of adults but not with the presence of children aged <6 years. The quantity of processed vegetables purchased increased with the household size but was not dependent on age, education or household income, although the richest households spent more per kilogram on processed vegetables. Households with a child aged <6 years also purchased 10 kg of baby foods containing vegetables.
CONCLUSION: We found socio-economic inequalities in the quantities of fresh vegetables, in the spending on fresh and processed vegetables but not in the quantities of processed vegetables. This suggests that monitoring the price and nutritional quality of processed vegetables and providing this information to consumers could help them identify nutritious, affordable and convenient foods."
23204241,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23204241/,"PURPOSE: To assess how different diagnostic decision aids perform in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and harm.
METHODS: Four diagnostic decision aids were compared, as applied to a simulated patient population: a findings-based algorithm following a linear or branched pathway, a serial threshold-based strategy, and a parallel threshold-based strategy. Headache in immune-compromised HIV patients in a developing country was used as an example. Diagnoses included cryptococcal meningitis, cerebral toxoplasmosis, tuberculous meningitis, bacterial meningitis, and malaria. Data were derived from literature and expert opinion. Diagnostic strategies' validity was assessed in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and harm related to mortality and morbidity. Sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo simulation were performed.
RESULTS: The parallel threshold-based approach led to a sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 65%. Sensitivities of the serial threshold-based approach and the branched and linear algorithms were 47%, 47%, and 74%, respectively, and the specificities were 85%, 95%, and 96%. The parallel threshold-based approach resulted in the least harm, with the serial threshold-based approach, the branched algorithm, and the linear algorithm being associated with 1.56-, 1.44-, and 1.17-times higher harm, respectively. Findings were corroborated by sensitivity and Monte Carlo analyses.
CONCLUSION: A threshold-based diagnostic approach is designed to find the optimal trade-off that minimizes expected harm, enhancing sensitivity and lowering specificity when appropriate, as in the given example of a symptom pointing to several life-threatening diseases. Findings-based algorithms, in contrast, solely consider clinical observations. A parallel workup, as opposed to a serial workup, additionally allows for all potential diseases to be reviewed, further reducing false negatives. The parallel threshold-based approach might, however, not be as good in other disease settings."
23204495,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23204495/,"UNLABELLED: There is evidence in some solid tumors that textural features of tumoral uptake in (18)F-FDG PET images are associated with response to chemoradiotherapy and survival. We have investigated whether a similar relationship exists in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
METHODS: Fifty-three patients (mean age, 65.8 y; 31 men, 22 women) with NSCLC treated with chemoradiotherapy underwent pretreatment (18)F-FDG PET/CT scans. Response was assessed by CT Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) at 12 wk. Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and local PFS (LPFS) were recorded. Primary tumor texture was measured by the parameters coarseness, contrast, busyness, and complexity. The following parameters were also derived from the PET data: primary tumor standardized uptake values (SUVs) (mean SUV, maximum SUV, and peak SUV), metabolic tumor volume, and total lesion glycolysis.
RESULTS: Compared with nonresponders, RECIST responders showed lower coarseness (mean, 0.012 vs. 0.027; P = 0.004) and higher contrast (mean, 0.11 vs. 0.044; P = 0.002) and busyness (mean, 0.76 vs. 0.37; P = 0.027). Neither complexity nor any of the SUV parameters predicted RECIST response. By Kaplan-Meier analysis, OS, PFS, and LPFS were lower in patients with high primary tumor coarseness (median, 21.1 mo vs. not reached, P = 0.003; 12.6 vs. 25.8 mo, P = 0.002; and 12.9 vs. 20.5 mo, P = 0.016, respectively). Tumor coarseness was an independent predictor of OS on multivariable analysis. Contrast and busyness did not show significant associations with OS (P = 0.075 and 0.059, respectively), but PFS and LPFS were longer in patients with high levels of each (for contrast: median of 20.5 vs. 12.6 mo, P = 0.015, and median not reached vs. 24 mo, P = 0.02; and for busyness: median of 20.5 vs. 12.6 mo, P = 0.01, and median not reached vs. 24 mo, P = 0.006). Neither complexity nor any of the SUV parameters showed significant associations with the survival parameters.
CONCLUSION: In NSCLC, baseline (18)F-FDG PET scan uptake showing abnormal texture as measured by coarseness, contrast, and busyness is associated with nonresponse to chemoradiotherapy by RECIST and with poorer prognosis. Measurement of tumor metabolic heterogeneity with these parameters may provide indices that can be used to stratify patients in clinical trials for lung cancer chemoradiotherapy."
23204561,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23204561/,"AIMS: Urethral caruncle is a benign, polypoid urethral mass that occurs almost exclusively in postmenopausal women. Despite that these lesions are routinely managed with topical medications or excision, their pathogenesis is not well understood. We investigated the possibilities of autoimmune, viral and inflammatory myofibroblastic proliferations as possible aetiologies.
METHODS: In 38 patients with urethral caruncle, we utilised immunohistochemistry for immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgG4 to assess for a potential autoimmune aetiology. Immunohistochemistry was performed in nine patients for Epstein-Barr virus, BK virus, human herpesvirus 8, human papillomavirus, adenovirus and anaplastic lymphoma kinase.
RESULTS: Four patients (11%) showed infiltrates of ≥50 IgG4-positive plasma cells per high power field, of which all showed an IgG4 to IgG ratio greater than 40%. A statistically significant difference (p<0.01) was detected in the mean number of IgG4-positive cells (14.73 per high power field) compared with control benign urethral specimens (mean, 1.19). One patient with increased counts below this threshold had rheumatoid arthritis; none had documented autoimmune pancreatitis or other known manifestations of systemic IgG4-related sclerosing disease. All lesions showed negative reactions for the viral and inflammatory myofibroblastic markers.
CONCLUSIONS: Urethral caruncle is a benign inflammatory and fibrous polypoid urethral mass of unclear aetiology. It appears unrelated to viral infection and lacks the abnormal expression of anaplastic lymphoma kinase protein, as seen in inflammatory myofibroblastic tumours. Increased numbers of IgG4-positive plasma cells in a subset of lesions raise the possibility that some cases may be related to the autoimmune phenomena of IgG4-associated disease."

AIM: To improve clinical outcomes, facilitate planned care and promote quality improvement within participating practices in Auckland.
METHODS: Implementation of the Collaborative followed the improvement model / Institute for Healthcare Improvement methodology. Three topic areas were selected: system redesign, cardio-vascular disease/diabetes, and self-management support. An expert advisory group and the Improvement Foundation Australia helped guide project development and implementation. Primary Health Organisation facilitators were trained in the methodology and 15 practice teams participated in the three learning workshops and action periods over 12 months. An independent evaluation study using both quantitative and qualitative methods was conducted.
RESULTS: Improvements were recorded in cardiovascular disease risk assessment, practice-level systems of care, self-management systems and follow-up and coordination for patients. Qualitative research found improvements in coordination and teamwork, knowledge of practice populations and understanding of managing long-term conditions.
CONCLUSION: The Collaborative process delivered some real improvements in the systems of care for people with long-term conditions and a change in culture among participating practices. The findings suggest that by strengthening facilitation processes, improving access to comprehensive population audit tools and lengthening the time frame, the process has the potential to make significant improvements in practice. Other organisations should consider this approach when investigating quality improvement programmes."
23205527,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23205527/,"OBJECTIVES: To compare the proportion of trauma craniotomies performed within 4 hours of presentation to emergency departments (ED) with and without on-site neurosurgery.
DESIGN: A retrospective cohort analysis of data collected prospectively between January 2005 and April 2010 from patients with traumatic brain injury who were admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) following traumatic brain injury.
METHODS: Times for admission to ED, PICU and theatre were obtained through analysis of prospectively collected data management systems. Emergency department admission to neurosurgical theatre lag time was calculated using Microsoft Excel. Statistical analysis was performed using R (version 2.11.0). Subjects. Fifty-seven cases were identified. Twenty patients were admitted directly from ED to an on-site neurosurgical unit. The remaining 37 were transferred from regional EDs.
RESULTS: Thirty-one craniotomies were performed. Thirteen in-patients admitted directly to hospital with neurosurgery on site. Eighteen in patients admitted at the local hospital and then transferred to the neurosurgical unit. Thirteen of Thirty-one (42%) craniotomies were performed within 4 hours. In the on-site group 10 of 13 (77%) craniotomies were performed within 4 hours compared to 3 of 18 (17%) in those transferred from regional ED (p = 0.001232) (Fisher exact test). Eleven patients were transferred directly from ED to neurosurgical theatre for emergency craniotomies. Within this subgroup, seven patients came from the cohort of admissions to a hospital with on-site neurosurgery. The remaining four patients were transferred from regional ED. There were eight extradural haematomas, one subdural haematoma and two intraparenchymal haemorrhages. The mean time from ED presentation to theatre was 1.68 hours and 5.46 hours for the on-site and regional transfer groups, respectively. There were no mortalities.
CONCLUSIONS: Forty-two per cent of trauma craniotomies are performed within 4 hours. However, presentation to an ED with on-site neurosurgical services significantly facilitates time critical surgery in children following a traumatic brain injury."
23206212,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23206212/,"BACKGROUND: In 2006, pharmacies began offering select generic prescription drugs at discount prices (e.g., $4 for a 30-day supply) through nonmembership and membership programs. As part of the contract in membership generic drug discount programs, the member agrees to forgo submission of the claim to the insurance company. Claims not submitted for insurance adjudication may result in incomplete pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) and health plan data, which could negatively influence adherence reporting and clinical programs. To address potentially missing claims data, the Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services (CMS) encourages Medicare Part D sponsors to incentivize network pharmacies to submit claims directly to the plan for drugs dispensed outside of a member's Part D benefit, unless a member refuses. The extent of PBM and health plan claims capture loss due to generic drug discount programs is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To identify changes in levothyroxine utilizers' prescription claims capture rate following the advent of generic drug discount membership and nonmembership programs.
METHODS: This retrospective concurrent cohort study used claims data from 3.5 million commercially insured members enrolled in health plans located in the central and southern United States with Prime Therapeutics pharmacy benefit coverage. Members were required to be 18 years or older and younger than 60 years as of January 1, 2006, and continuously enrolled from January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2010. Members utilizing generic levothyroxine for at least 120 days during January 1, 2006, through June 30, 2006 (baseline period) from the same pharmacy group with supply on July 1, 2006, were placed into 1 of 3 pharmacy groups: (1) nonmembership (Walmart, Sam's Club, Target, Kroger, City Market, and King Soopers pharmacies), (2) membership (Walgreens, CVS, Albertsons, and Savon pharmacies), or (3) the reference group of all other pharmacies. The index date was defined as July 1, 2006. The levothyroxine claim providing supply on July 1, 2006, was the index claim. Members with a Kmart pharmacy index claim were excluded, since the Kmart membership drug discount program began prior to July 1, 2006. Levothyroxine claims capture nonpersistency, defined as the occurrence of a claim supply end date prior to a 180-day gap, was the primary outcome variable and was assessed from July 1, 2006, through June 30, 2010 (follow-up period). The odds of levothyroxine claims capture nonpersistency by pharmacy group were assessed using a logistic regression analysis adjusted for the following covariates: age, gender, median income in the ZIP code of residence (binomial for ≤ $50,000 vs. greater than $50,000), switch to a brand levothyroxine product during the follow-up period, index levothyroxine claim supply of 90 days or more, and index levothyroxine claim member cost share per 30-day supply in tertiles (≤ $5.00, $5.01-$7.99, ≥ $8.00).
RESULTS: Of 2,632,855 eligible members aged 18 years or older, 13,427 met all study eligibility criteria. The baseline pharmacy groups were membership with 3,595 (26.8%), nonmembership with 1,919 (14.3%), and all other pharmacies with 7,913 (58.9%) members. The rates of levothyroxine claims capture persistency throughout the 4-year follow-up period were 85.4% for nonmembership (P = 0.593 vs. all other pharmacies), 77.7% for the membership group (P  less than  0.001 vs. all other pharmacies), and 85.9% for all other pharmacies. The Kaplan-Meier comparison of claims capture persistency found nearly identical claims capture loss for the nonmembership compared with all other pharmacies group, and when compared in a multivariate logistic regression model, there was no difference in the odds of levothyroxine claims capture over 4 years follow-up (OR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.88-1.16, P = 0.900). The membership generic drug discount programs (Walgreens, CVS, Alberstons, and Savon pharmacies) had a statistically significant 61% higher odds (OR = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.45-1.79, P  less than  0.001) of levothyroxine claims capture nonpersistency. The onset of the difference between the membership group and the all other pharmacies group was temporally associated with the launch of the membership programs. In comparison to index levothyroxine member cost of ≤ $5.00 per 30-day supply, higher cost shares were associated with higher levothyroxine claims capture nonpersistency ($5.01 to $7.99 OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.19-1.52 and ≥ $8.00 OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.40-1.82).
CONCLUSIONS: Among levothyroxine utilizers in 2006 (prior to the advent of drug discount programs), those with claims from a pharmacy that subsequently implemented a nonmembership generic drug discount program did not appear to have a different rate of levothyroxine claims capture than members from the reference group when followed through June 2010. Utilizers with claims from a pharmacy that subsequently implemented a membership program had a significantly lower levothyroxine claims capture rate. Increasing index levothyroxine member cost was associated with higher levothyroxine claims capture loss. Because the analysis could not directly measure claims capture loss associated with members who switched to a new pharmacy group without presenting their insurance information (e.g., membership discount programs), further research is needed to confirm these findings."
23206316,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23206316/,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the inclusion of deep breathing exercises in physiotherapy-directed early mobilisation confers any additional benefit in reducing postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) when patients are treated once daily after elective open upper abdominal surgery. This study also compared postoperative outcomes following early and delayed mobilisation.
DESIGN: Cluster randomised controlled trial.
SETTING: Single-centre study in a teaching hospital.
PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-six high-risk patients undergoing elective open upper abdominal surgery.
INTERVENTION: Three groups: early mobilisation (Group A), early mobilisation plus breathing exercises (Group B), and delayed mobilisation (mobilised from third postoperative day) plus breathing exercises (Group C).
MAIN OUTCOMES: PPCs and postoperative outcomes [number of days until discharge from physiotherapy, physiotherapy input and length of stay (LOS)].
RESULTS: There was no significant difference in PPCs between Groups A and B. The LOS for Group A {mean 10.7 [standard deviation (SD) 5.0] days} was significantly shorter than the LOS for Groups B [mean 16.7 (SD 9.7) days] and C [mean 15.2 (SD 9.8) days; P=0.036]. The greatest difference was between Groups A and B (mean difference -5.93, 95% confidence interval -10.22 to -1.65; P=0.008). Group C had fewer smokers (26%) and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (0%) compared with Group B (53% and 14%, respectively). This may have led to fewer PPCs in Group C, but the difference was not significant. Despite Group C having fewer PPCs and less physiotherapy input, the number of days until discharge from physiotherapy and LOS were similar to Group B.
CONCLUSIONS: The addition of deep breathing exercises to physiotherapy-directed early mobilisation did not further reduce PPCs compared with mobility alone. PPCs can be reduced with once-daily physiotherapy if the patients are mobilised to a moderate level of exertion. Delayed mobilisation tended to increase physiotherapy input and the number of days until discharge from physiotherapy compared with early mobilisation."
23206376,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23206376/,"BACKGROUND: Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) began as a male organization, but about one third is now female. Studies have found that women participate at least as much as men and benefit equally from AA, but it is unclear whether women benefit from AA in the same or different ways as men. This study tested whether gender moderated the mechanisms through which AA aids recovery.
METHODS: A cohort study of alcohol dependent adults (N=1726; 24% female; Project MATCH) was assessed on AA attendance during treatment; with mediators at 9 months; outcomes (Percent Days Abstinent [PDA] and Drinks per Drinking Day [DDD]) at 15 months. Multiple mediator models tested whether purported mechanisms (i.e., self-efficacy, depression, social networks, spirituality/religiosity) explained AA's effects differently for men and women controlling for baseline values, mediators, treatment, and other confounders.
RESULTS: For PDA, the proportion of AA's effect accounted for by the mediators was similar for men (53%) and women (49%). Both men and women were found to benefit from changes in social factors but these mechanisms were more important among men. For DDD, the mediators accounted for 70% of the effect of AA for men and 41% for women. Again, men benefitted mostly from social changes. Independent of AA's effects, negative affect self-efficacy was shown to have a strong relationship to outcome for women but not men.
CONCLUSIONS: The recovery benefits derived from AA differ in nature and magnitude between men and women and may reflect differing needs based on recovery challenges related to gender-based social roles and drinking contexts."
23206378,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23206378/,"BACKGROUND: Cross-sectional surveys of older people commonly find associations between higher levels of depressive symptoms and poorer cognitive performance, but the direction of effect is unclear. We examined whether there was a bidirectional relationship between depressive symptoms and general cognitive ability in non-demented older people, and explored the role of physical health, smoking, exercise, social class and education as potential confounders of this association and as possible determinants of the rate of change of cognitive decline and depressive symptoms.
METHOD: The English Longitudinal Study of Ageing consists of people aged 50 years and over. Cognitive function and self-reported depressive symptoms were measured in 2002-2003, 2004-2005, 2006-2007 and 2008-2009. We fitted linear piecewise models with fixed knot positions to allow different slopes for different age groups. Analyses are based on 8611 people.
RESULTS: Mean cognitive function declined with age; there was no trend in the trajectory of depressive symptoms. Better cognitive function was associated with less depression up to the age of 80 years. Greater depression was associated with a slightly faster rate of cognitive decline but only in people aged 60-80 years. There were no consistent associations across age groups between sex, smoking, education, social class, exercise or number of chronic physical illnesses and the rate of change of cognitive decline or depressive symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: In this longitudinal study of older people, there was no consistent evidence that being more depressed led to an acceleration in cognitive decline and no support for the hypothesis that there might be reciprocal dynamic influences between cognitive ability and depressive symptoms."

METHODS: All boys less than 10 years of age whose first evaluation for UTI included RBUS and VCUG were retrospectively studied over a 10-year period. Those with a disorder of the urinary tract known before imaging were excluded. RBUS and VCUG results were analyzed.
RESULTS: Of the 77 who met the inclusion criteria, 58 (77%) were <1 year old. 45 (58%) boys had normal RBUS and VCUG. In 16 (21%) both studies were abnormal: 15 had vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and one had posterior urethral valves. The remaining 16 (21%) had one abnormal study: 10 had pelvicaliectasis on RBUS without VUR; 6 had normal RBUS with VUR. No urethral abnormality was diagnosed on VCUG when RBUS was normal. Of the six who had VUR and normal RBUS, the one who required surgical intervention had recurrent febrile UTI.
CONCLUSIONS: If a well-performed RBUS is normal in a boy with first UTI, the likelihood of a significant finding in VCUG is low. A VCUG is likewise of no apparent screening benefit for obstructive uropathy. With the uncertainties surrounding the benefit of chemoprophylaxis, omitting a VCUG when a RBUS is normal in boys with a first UTI avoids the morbidity without missing important pathologies or altering evolving management protocols."
23207075,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23207075/,"BACKGROUND: Right ventricular (RV) function plays a pivotal role in advanced heart failure patients, especially for screening those who may benefit from left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation. We introduce RV contraction pressure index (RVCPI) as a new echo-Doppler parameter of RV function. The accuracy of RVCPI in detecting RV failure was compared with the criterion standard, the RV stroke work index (RVSWI) obtained through right heart catheterization in advanced heart failure patients referred for heart transplantation or LVAD implantation.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Right heart catheterization and echo-Doppler were simultaneously performed in 94 consecutive patients referred to our center for advanced heart failure (ejection fraction (EF) 24 ± 8.8%, 40% NYHA functional class IV). RV stroke volume and invasive pulmonary pressures were used to obtain RVSWI. Simplified RVCPI (sRVCPI) was derived as TAPSE × (RV - right atrial pressure gradient). Close positive correlation between sRVCPI and RVSWI was found (r = 0.68; P < .001). With logistic regression, we found that increased sRVCPI showed an independent reduced risk (odds ratio 0.98, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.97-0.99; P = .016) for patients to present a depressed RVSWI (<0.25 mm Hg/L·m(2)). Simplified RVCPI showed high diagnostic accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.94, 95% CI 0.89-0.99) and good sensitivity and specificity (92% and 85%, respectively) to predict depressed RVSWI with the use of a cutoff value of <400 mm·mm Hg.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with advanced heart failure, the new simple bedside sRVCPI closely correlated with RVSWI, providing an independent, noninvasive, and easy tool for the evaluation of RV function."
23207243,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23207243/,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the prognostic impact of liver metastases (LM) in patients with colorectal peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) who underwent complete cytoreductive surgery and resection of LM, followed by intraperitoneal chemotherapy.
BACKGROUND: Synchronous surgical treatment of PC and LM with curative intent remains controversial.
METHODS: From a prospective database, all patients with PC and synchronous LM who had undergone cytoreductive surgery and LM resection followed by intraperitoneal chemotherapy were matched with patients with PC alone according to the following criteria: age, peritoneal cancer index (PCI), site and lymph node involvement (pN) of primary cancer, and postoperative chemotherapy.
RESULTS: From 1993 to 2009, 37 patients with PC and LM were matched with 61 patients with PC alone. After a mean follow-up of 36 months, 3-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival rates were significantly lower in patients with PC and LM, respectively, 40% and 66% (P = 0.04) and 6% and 27% (P = 0.001). A PCI of 12 or more [odds ratio (OR): 4.6], a pN+ status (OR: 3.3), no adjuvant chemotherapy (OR: 3.0), and presence of LM (OR: 2.0) were identified as independent factors for poor OS. Three groups were singled out: (1) patients with a low PCI (<12) and no LM (median OS: 76 months); (2) patients with a low PCI (<12) and 1 or 2 LM (median OS: 40 months); and (3) patients with a high PCI (≥12) or patients with 3 LMs or more (median OS: 27 months).
CONCLUSIONS: This case-control study seems to confirm that prolonged survival can be achieved in highly selected patients operated on for limited PC and fewer than 3 LM."
23207498,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23207498/,"PURPOSE: Ipsilateral central compartment node dissection has been proposed to reduce the morbidity of prophylactic bilateral central compartment node dissection in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), but it carries the risk of contralateral metastases being overlooked in approximately 25 % of patients. We aimed to verify if frozen section examination (FSE) can identify patients who could benefit from bilateral central compartment node dissection.
METHODS: All the consenting patients with clinically unifocal PTC, without any preoperative evidence of lymph node involvement, observed between September 2010 and September 2011 underwent total thyroidectomy plus bilateral central compartment node dissection. Ipsilateral central compartment nodes were sent for FSE.
RESULTS: Forty-eight patients were included. Mean number of removed nodes was 13.2 ± 6.8. Final histology showed lymph node metastases in 21 patients: ipsilateral in 15, bilateral in 6. FSE accurately predicted lymph node status in 43 patients (27 node negative, 16 node positive). Five node metastases were not detected at FSE: three were micrometastases (≤ 2 mm). Sensitivity, specificity and overall accuracy of FSE in definition of N status status were 80.7, 100, and 90 %, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: FSE is accurate in predicting node metastases in clinically unifocal node negative PTC and can be useful in determining the extension of central compartment node dissection. False-negative results are reported mainly in case of micrometastases, which usually have limited clinical implications."
23207528,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23207528/,"BACKGROUND: The optimal time to assess patient satisfaction with bronchoscopy has not been established. This study aimed to compare patient comfort scores recorded immediately after bronchoscopy with those obtained at follow-up, 7 to 14 days later.
METHODS: A total of 240 patients undergoing bronchoscopy were recruited. Immediately after the procedure, patients scored the discomfort they had experienced from 0 (no discomfort) to 4 (severe discomfort). In addition, nursing staff recorded measures of comfort and sedation. At follow-up, patients again scored the discomfort they had experienced during the bronchoscopy.
RESULTS: Complete data were analyzed on 180 patients (75%). The majority of patients tolerated the procedure well, although a significant minority experienced at least moderate discomfort (28.9%). No significant difference was found between the immediate and the follow-up comfort scores (Wilcoxon P=0.79). The comfort score recorded by the nurses was related to both immediate (Spearman 0.22, P<0.01) and follow-up scores (Spearman 0.28, P<0.01) of the patients. A number of variables that may influence patient comfort during bronchoscopy were assessed; only age was found to influence the comfort score. A large number of younger patients (age less than 60) reported a higher immediate discomfort score (χ2=7.69, P<0.05) despite the fact that older patients received lower doses of midazolam (P<0.05). However, the type of samples taken or patient position during the procedure did not influence the comfort score.
CONCLUSIONS: The comfort score assessed immediately after the procedure is similar to that recorded at a later date, and it relates to the score assessed by the nursing staff. Younger patients reported higher immediate discomfort."
23207589,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23207589/,"UNLABELLED: OBJECTVIE: Intraoperative neuromonitoring of thoracic-level pedicle screw implantation for detecting breaches in the pedicle cortex has adopted methods originally developed in the early 1990s for stainless steel (SS) alloy screws used at lumbosacral levels. In our recent attempts to monitor thoracic-level pedicle screw placement, we were surprised to find that these widely used stimulation parameters were largely ineffectual when stimulating directly through titanium alloy (Ti-alloy) pedicle screws. The objectives of this study, then, were twofold: (1) to report the number of episodes in which intraoperative neuromonitoring of thoracic screw position failed to detect a medially directed breach (or malplacement) in a previously described and limited sample set; and (2) to compare the frequency-specific impedance of a sample of Ti-alloy pedicle screws to comparably sized screws made of SS alloys. We predicted that Ti-alloy screws would demonstrate impairment in conduction properties that could help explain the difficulties we, and others, have recently experienced with neuromonitoring of thoracic pedicle screw placement.
METHODS: Based on threshold values for train-of-four stimulation of spinal motor pathways, we quantified the incidence of medial breaches of thoracic-level pedicles in a small cohort of subjects. We also evaluated the conductive properties of Ti-alloy pedicle screws and compared these with SS screws. Eleven pedicle screws were examined using energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy to identify their alloys, after which DC resistance and AC impedance for each screw was measured. Furthermore, a subset of five screws was used to investigate the current delivery under dynamic testing conditions.
RESULTS: Postoperative computed tomography of 6 subjects revealed 10 instances of significant medial screw malpositioning, out of a total of 88 screws placed. In each of these 10 instances, direct stimulation of thoracic pedicle screws at intensities considered in the literature to be clinically significant (i.e., ≤11 mA) failed to predict these medial pedicle breaches, yet each breach was reliably identified with low-intensity stimulation applied via a ball-tipped probe. For in vitro studies, most screws made of titanium alloys had higher resistance and impedance at tested frequencies compared with their SS counterparts. Moreover, there was widespread variability in conduction properties between Ti-alloy screws, whereas SS screws behaved in a more homogeneous manner.
CONCLUSIONS: When compared with screws made of SS, most Ti-alloy pedicle screws behaved more like semiconductors, showing conduction properties that were highly frequency dependent. These properties likely contributed to the difficulties we encountered in interpreting thoracic screw placements based on stimulus-evoked electromyography from direct screw stimulation."
23207623,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23207623/,"BACKGROUND: Salivary gland tumors (SGTs) are known for their specific heterogeneity and ambiguous outcome for the affected patients. The LKB1 and SMAD4 genes are pivotal components of important signaling pathways, including AMPK and TGF-β. To our knowledge, no study has reported an association between the expression levels of these genes in SGTs. The expression levels of LKB1 and SMAD4 were evaluated to clarify their possible crosstalk in SGTs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 50 fresh tissue specimens were obtained from patients with SGTs, including pleomorphic adenoma (PA), Warthin's tumor (WT), intermediate grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC), salivary duct carcinoma (SDC), and carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma (CexPA), as well as 8 normal samples. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed for all samples with specific primers.
RESULTS: Data were analyzed using statistical methods. PA, WT, MEC, and SDC showed a significant decrease in LKB1 levels, but the gene was up-regulated in CexPA. SMAD4 was overexpressed in all samples.
CONCLUSION: The results suggest a possible link between downregulation of LKB1 and overexpression of SMAD4 in SGTs. LKB1 depletion leads to upregulation of SMAD4, promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition in tumor cells. Therefore, LKB1 and SMAD4 could be key players in inducing tumor heterogeneity in SGTs."
23207963,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23207963/,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Rumination about negative material (e.g., depression symptoms, current problems) contributes to the course and maintenance of depression. More recently, studies have shown that it is not rumination per se, but rather the mode of processing (i.e., abstract/analytical versus concrete/experiential) adopted during rumination that is critical in determining whether rumination has adaptive or maladaptive outcomes. To date, only one study has examined the affective impact of adopting a particular processing mode with positive material; specifically, when recalling a happy memory. The current study extends this line of investigation by examining whether adopting an abstract or concrete processing mode during a positive experience (i.e., a success task) has consequences for subsequent affect.
METHODS: High and low dysphoric participants (N = 136) were randomly allocated to abstract, concrete or no training conditions prior to a success experience. Affect was measured before and after success.
RESULTS: We found that neither processing mode condition nor dysphoria status had consequences for the affective impact of success.
LIMITATIONS: Our findings are based on an analogue sample. Further research is required to enable generalisation to depression.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides some initial indication in a non-clinical sample that processing mode does not have the same differential affective impact when combined with a positive experience (e.g., success) as when combined with a negative experience (e.g., failure)."
23208005,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23208005/,"INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: Key differences between interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) subtypes (with and without Hunner's ulcer) have been noted. We hypothesized that pain characteristics in women grouped by IC/BPS subtype would differ.
METHODS: A survey was mailed to 749 women to assess IC/BPS pain and other characteristics. Cystoscopy/hydrodistention reports were reviewed for presence/absence of Hunner's ulcer. The McGill Pain Questionnaire Short Form© (MPQ-SF), Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), and Interstitial Cystitis Symptom and Problem Indices (ICSI-PI) assessed symptoms. Data were analyzed with Pearson's chi-square, Fisher's exact, t tests, and Wilcoxon rank tests.
RESULTS: Of the 214 women that returned a survey (36 ulcerative and 178 non-ulcerative IC/BPS), similar proportions in each group reported that certain foods, exercise, and/or stress triggered symptoms. Fewer ulcerative patients reported pain with vaginal penetration than non-ulcerative (5/33, 15.2 % vs 76/160, 47.5 %; p = 0.0006). On the BPI, the ulcerative and non-ulcerative groups reported similar numbers of painful areas (mean 4.1 ± 6.1 and 4.1 ± 3.8; p = 0.33), and lower abdominal/pelvic pain was reported most (13/35, 37 % vs 79/172, 46 %; p = 0.34) followed by lower back pain (12/35, 34 % vs 69/172, 40 %; p = 0.52). Even though ICSI-PI, MPQ-SF, and BPI scores/responses did not differ, on the MPQ-SF the three words most frequently used by ulcerative patients to describe their pain were sharp, stabbing, and hot burning, and in non-ulcerative were aching, cramping, and tender.
CONCLUSIONS: These measures did not reveal any significant differences in pain between subtypes. More research is needed in larger samples to determine whether differences exist."
23208273,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23208273/,"OBJECTIVES: The adenoma detection rate (ADR) in screening colonoscopy is higher than original cost-effectiveness models estimated. Future colorectal cancer (CRC) risk is decreased once the ADR is 20%, but it is unclear how much additional protection is provided with higher ADRs. We modeled the impact of a high ADR on future CRC risk and surveillance colonoscopy burden.
METHODS: We created three hypothetical scenarios for 100,000 average-risk individuals undergoing screening colonoscopy at age 50: (i) 20% ADR with 30% future CRC risk reduction; (ii) 50% ADR with 30% future CRC risk reduction; and (iii) 50% ADR with 50% future CRC risk reduction. After colonoscopy, patients could have high-risk or low-risk adenomas, or no adenomas.
RESULTS: When the ADR increases from 20% to 50% but no additional CRC cases are prevented, future CRC risk for each group is still reduced, because lower-risk patients migrate into apparently higher-risk groups (the Will Rogers phenomenon). Future risk is further reduced if a 50% ADR leads to greater protection from CRC. However, despite the reductions in group-specific and overall future CRC risk, 34,635 additional surveillance colonoscopies are performed before the cohort is 60 years old when the ADR is 50% compared with 20%.
CONCLUSIONS: If current surveillance practices continue along with high ADRs, screening colonoscopy may not remain cost-effective."

METHODS: Medical, surgical, gynaecological and radiation oncologists, and their patients for whom adjuvant breast cancer therapy was indicated, were eligible. Doctors were randomised to participate in a workshop with standardised teaching material and role playing. Patients were recruited in the experimental and control groups before and after the workshop.
RESULTS: In ANZ centres, 21 eligible doctors recruited a total of 304 assessable patients. In SGA centres, 41 doctors recruited 390 patients. The training was well accepted. There was no overall effect on patient decisional conflict (primary endpoint) 2 weeks after the consultation. Overall, patients were satisfied with their treatment decision, their consultation and their doctors' consultation skills. Considerable variation was observed in patient outcomes between SGA and ANZ centres; the effect sizes of the intervention were marginal (<0.2).
CONCLUSIONS: Shared decision making remains a challenge. A sustained training effect may require more intensive training tailored to the local setting. Cross-cultural differences need attention in conducting trials on communication interventions."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty-six patients diagnosed as acute SAH in the emergency department were included in this study. Twenty healthy adults were included in the study to serve as controls. Twelve-lead ECG was performed on all patients on admission. H-FABP levels of patients were determined in serum samples taken on admission.
RESULTS: Serum H-FABP levels of patients were found to be significantly higher than those of controls (p < 0.05). There was no significant correlation between serum H-FABP levels and ECG changes. There was a moderate positive correlation between H-FABP serum levels and the grade according to the Hunt and Hess classification (r=0.43, p < 0.05). There was a weak positive correlation between H-FABP serum levels and the grade according to the Fisher radiological classification (r=0.38, p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Serum H-FABP levels are increased in patients with SAH. Grades according to the Hunt and Hess and Fisher grading scales were shown to increase in conjunction with an increase in H-FABP levels."
23210536,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23210536/,"OBJECTIVE: To assess rates of neonaticide after the implementation of a preventative 'anonymous delivery' law in mid-2001 in Austria. Women are allowed to access antenatal care and give birth in a hospital anonymously, without showing any ID and free of charge.
DESIGN: Retrospective study.
SETTING: A complete census of police-reported neonaticides was obtained from the police statistics of Austria, Sweden and Finland.
POPULATION: All neonaticides reported to the police, 1991-2009.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Neonaticide rates before (1991-2001) and after (2002-2009) the introduction of anonymous delivery legislation per 100 000 births.
METHODS: The Mann-Whitney U-test for two independent samples was used to compare neonaticide rates in the period before the new law was introduced with the rates observed after the implementation of the new law for each country.
RESULTS: On average the rate of police-reported neonaticides was 7.2 per 100 000 births (SD 3.5, median 7.1) in Austria prior to the new law being passed, and 3.1 per 100 000 births (SD 2.1, median 2.6) after the law was passed. A significant decrease in neonaticide was observed in Austria after the implementation of anonymous delivery (Mann-Whitney U-test P = 0.017). Whereas the Finnish and Swedish rates were lower than the Austrian rates before and after the implementation of the Austrian law, they remained unchanged over the study period.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate a significant decrease in the number of police-reported neonaticides in Austria after the implementation of anonymous delivery. Even though underlying factors associated with neonaticide are complex, the findings could indicate an effect of anonymous delivery in the prevention of this crime."
23211042,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23211042/,"INTRODUCTION: Chronic periodontitis (CP) is characterized with inflammation of the gingival tissues, which causes endothelial dysfunction in different organs.
AIM: In this study, we investigated the association of CP with the erectile dysfunction (ED).
METHODS: The study group included 80 male patients with ED and 82 male patients without ED (control), aged between 30 and 40 years. The International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaire was used to assess male sexual function, particularly the presence or absence of ED.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The patients in the study and control groups were statistically compared according to their plaque index (PI), bleeding on probing (BoP), probing depth (PD), and clinical attachment level (CAL).
RESULTS: In the non-ED and the ED groups, the mean age was 35.7 ± 4.8 and 34.9 ± 4.9 years, respectively. Patients' characteristics including body mass index, household income, and education status were similar in both groups (P > 0.05). Nineteen patients (23%) had severe CP in the non-ED group; 42 patients (53%) had severe CP in the ED group. Logistic regression analysis showed a significantly high association between ED and the severity of CP (odds ratio: 3.29, 95% confidence interval: 1.36-9.55, P < 0.01). The mean values of PI, BoP, and the percentages of sites with PD >4 mm and sites with CAL >4 mm were significantly higher in the ED group than in the control group (P < 0.05). The mean values of PD and CAL were not significantly different in the two groups (P > 0.05). The decayed, missing, filled teeth scores were also significantly higher in the ED group than in the non-ED group (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Our results have suggested that CP had a high association with ED in young adults at 30-40 years. We think that it will be of benefit to consider periodontal disease as a causative clinical condition of ED in such patients."
23211058,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23211058/,"BACKGROUND: Geriatric stroke patients are generally frail, have an advanced age and co-morbidity. It is yet unclear whether specific groups of patients might benefit differently from structured multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs. Therefore, the aims of our study are 1) to determine relevant patient characteristics to distinguish groups of patients based on their admission scores in skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), and (2) to study the course of these particular patient-groups in relation to their discharge destination.
METHODS: This is a longitudinal, multicenter, observational study. We collected data on patient characteristics, balance, walking ability, arm function, co-morbidity, activities of daily living (ADL), neuropsychiatric symptoms, and depressive complaints of 127 geriatric stroke patients admitted to skilled nursing facilities with specific units for geriatric rehabilitation after stroke.
RESULTS: Cluster analyses revealed two groups: cluster 1 included patients in poor condition upon admission (n = 52), and cluster 2 included patients in fair/good condition upon admission (n = 75). Patients in both groups improved in balance, walking abilities, and arm function. Patients in cluster 1 also improved in ADL. Depressive complaints decreased significantly in patients in cluster 1 who were discharged to an independent- or assisted-living situation. Compared to 80% of the patients in cluster 2, a lower proportion (46%) of the patients in cluster 1 were discharged to an independent- or assisted-living situation.
CONCLUSION: Stroke patients referred for rehabilitation to SNFs could be clustered on the basis of their condition upon admission. Although patients in poor condition on admission were more likely to be referred to a facility for long-term care, this was certainly not the case in all patients. Almost half of them could be discharged to an independent or assisted living situation, which implied that also in patients in poor condition on admission, discharge to an independent or assisted living situation was an attainable goal. It is important to put substantial effort into the rehabilitation of patients in poor condition at admission."
23211211,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23211211/,"OBJECT: The authors evaluated the potential role of environmental risk factors, including exposure to diagnostic or therapeutic radiation and to wireless phones that emit nonionizing radiation, in the etiology of vestibular schwannoma (VS).
METHODS: A total of 343 patients with VSs who underwent Gamma Knife surgery performed between 1997 and 2007 were age and sex matched to 343 control patients from the outpatient degenerative spinal disorders service at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. The authors obtained information on previous exposure to medical radiation, use of wireless phone technologies, and other environmental factors thought to be associated with the development of a VS. Conditional multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: After adjusting for race, education, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, occupational exposure to noise, use of cell phones, and family history of cancer, the authors identified only a single factor that was associated with a higher risk of VS: individuals exposed to dental x-rays once a year (aOR = 2.27, 95% CI = 1.01-5.09) or once every 2-5 years (aOR = 2.65, 95% CI = 1.20-5.85), compared with those exposed less than once every 5 years. Of interest, a history of exposure to radiation related to head or head-and-neck computed tomography was associated with a reduced risk of VS (aOR = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.30-0.90). No relationship was found between the use of cell phones or cordless phones and VS.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with acoustic neuromas reported significantly more exposure to dental x-rays than a matched cohort control group. Reducing the frequency of dental x-ray examinations may decrease the potential risk of VS."
23211228,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23211228/,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: There has been much interest in exercise interventions as a primary behavioral prevention strategy against cognitive decline. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a multicomponent exercise program on physical and dual-task performances in community-dwelling older adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI).
METHODS: Fifty older adults (23 women) with aMCI (mean age, 76 years) were randomized to an intervention (n=25) or a control group (n=25). The intervention group received a multicomponent exercise program for 90 minutes/day, 2 days/week, or 40 times over six months. The multicomponent exercises included aerobic exercise, muscle strength training and postural balance retraining, which was conducted under multi-task conditions to stimulate attention and memory. Participants in the control group attended two health promotion education classes within six months. Physical and dual-task performances were measured before randomization and after six months. Dual-task performances using reaction times with balance and cognitive demands were measured.
RESULTS: The improvement effects on dual-task performances with both balance and cognitive demands were not statistically significant: reaction time with balance demand F1,45=3.3, p=0.07, and cognitive demand F1,45=2.6, p=0.12. However, there was a significant group-by-time interaction on maximal walking speed, which decreased significantly in the control group (F1,45=5.9, p=0.02).
CONCLUSION: This six-month multicomponent exercise program improved maximal walking speed in older adults with aMCI; however, it did not improve dual-task performances assessed by reaction times."
23211262,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23211262/,"BACKGROUND: The consequences of multimorbidity include polypharmacy and repeated referrals for specialised care, which may increase the risk of adverse drug events (ADEs).
AIM: The objective of this study was to analyse the influence of multimorbidity, polypharmacy, and multiple referrals on the frequency of ADEs, as an indicator of therapeutic safety, in the context of a national healthcare system.
DESIGN AND SETTING: This was a multicentre, retrospective, observational study of 79 089 adult patients treated during 2008 in primary care centres.
METHOD: The explanatory patient variables sex, age, level of multimorbidity, polypharmacy, number of primary care physician visits, and number of different specialties attended were analysed. The response variable was the occurrence of ADEs. Logistic regression models were used to identify associations among the analysed variables.
RESULTS: The prevalence of individuals with at least one ADE was 0.88%. Multivariate analysis identified the following variables as risk factors for the occurrence of ADE in descending order of effect size: multimorbidity level (odds ratio [OR]Veryhigh/Low = 45.26; ORHigh/Low = 17.58; ORModerate/Low = 4.25), polypharmacy (OR = 1.34), female sex (OR = 1.31), number of different specialties (OR = 1.20), and number of primary care physician visits (OR = 1.01). Age, however, did not show statistical significance (OR = 1.00; 95% confidence interval = 0.996 to 1.005).
CONCLUSION: The results of this study demonstrate that multimorbidity is strongly related to the occurrence of ADEs, insofar as it requires the intervention of multiple specialties and the prescription of multiple medications. Further research should shed light on the causal pathway between multimorbidity and increased risk of adverse events."
23211346,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23211346/,"BACKGROUND: Diabetes is associated with an increased risk of several other chronic diseases. In contrast, a previous study found an inverse relation between diabetes and migraine, whereas another large population-based study showed that the prevalence of migraine among patients with diabetes varied strongly depending on age. We aimed to investigate how the prevalence of medically treated migraine in patients with diabetes varied depending on diabetic drug treatment, sex, and age in the complete Norwegian population.
METHODS: Data on all persons in Norway being prescribed medication for diabetes (n =124,649) or migraine (n = 81,225) in 2006 were obtained from the National Register of Prescriptions and analyzed in a cross-sectional design.
RESULTS: Persons using diabetic drugs had an overall reduced prevalence of medically treated migraine when compared with the nondiabetic population (odds ratio [OR] = 0.72 [95% confidence interval = 0.68-0.75]). The OR was strongly associated with age. Although young persons receiving oral diabetic medication had, in fact, an increased prevalence of medically treated migraine, the prevalence declined with increasing age to about the same reduced prevalence (OR = 0.4-0.6) for all types of diabetes treatment in patients 60 to 69 years of age. The prevalence was equally decreased between men and women.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest a markedly reduced prevalence of migraine among older patients with diabetes, when compared with the general population. One may speculate that the seemingly protective effect of diabetes on migraine could be a result of neuropathy."
23211375,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23211375/,"BACKGROUND: Psychotic patients are at increased risk of thromboembolism that cannot be ascribed to physical restraint or medication. Patients with chronic schizophrenia or long-term depressive illness do not display ischemic brain injuries on magnetic resonance imaging, as expected in patients with thrombotic tendency, but atrophy of specific brain regions, which indicates abnormal neuronal plasticity.
HYPOTHESES: We postulate that a relationship between psychosis pathophysiology and thrombotic tendency may comprise proteins that participate not only in the anticoagulation-fibrinolysis mechanism, but also in neuronal plasticity.
CASE DESCRIPTION: Five psychotic patients with thrombotic episodes on chronic warfarin therapy attained remission of psychotic symptoms and are free of psychotropic medication from 2 to 11years. All patients have at least one thrombophilia related to inhibition of plasminogen activators, including prothrombin G20.210A polymorphism, hyperhomocysteinemia, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome and protein C deficiency.
DISCUSSION: Plasminogen activators participate in blood clot dissolution and tissue repair, such as remodeling of hippocampus after stress, trauma, stroke or seizures. A significant prevalence of both thromboembolism and psychotic events can be seen in circumstances characterized by physiological or pathological inhibition of plasminogen activators, such as puerperium, confinement, polycystic ovary syndrome, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome and chronic inflammatory disorders.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that normalization of plasminogen activator levels in the brain may induce long-term remission of psychotic symptoms. Randomized controlled studies may help clarify the role of anticoagulation in the treatment of psychosis."
23211709,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23211709/,"BACKGROUND: Bankart repair with multiple anchor holes concentrated in the anterior-inferior glenoid may contribute to glenoid weakening and potentially may induce glenoid failure.
PURPOSE: To compare the biomechanical strength of a Bankart repair construct that used 3 single-loaded suture anchors versus a repair construct that used 2 double-loaded suture anchors.
STUDY DESIGN: Comparative laboratory study.
METHODS: A standard Bankart lesion was created in 18 human cadaveric shoulders (9 matched pairs). Within each matched pair, 1 repair construct used 3 single-loaded anchors, whereas the other used 2 double-loaded suture anchors. Measured outcomes (load, stiffness, and energy absorbed) were recorded at failure and at 2 mm of labral displacement. Constructs were loaded to failure with a materials testing device that had differential variable reluctance transducers for displacement measurements.
RESULTS: The double-loaded anchor construct had a significantly higher ultimate tensile load (944 ± 231 vs 784 ± 287 N; P = .03). For the other measures (load at 2 mm of displacement, energy absorbed at failure and at 2 mm of displacement and stiffness), there were no significant differences between tested constructs.
CONCLUSION: A Bankart repair construct that used 2 double-loaded anchors was either superior to or equal to a repair construct that used 3 single-loaded anchors in all measured outcomes.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Using 2 double-loaded suture anchors for a Bankart repair may limit anchor holes in the glenoid and reduce the risk of postsurgical glenoid fracture while providing a stable repair construct."
23212529,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23212529/,"BACKGROUND: Prosthetic mesh infection is one of the most challenging complications after hernia repair. We evaluate the efficacy of soaking mesh in antibiotics to prevent prosthetic infection in an animal model of clean-contaminated ventral hernia repair (VHR).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Rats underwent an acute VHR with one of four synthetic meshes (composite multifilament polyester (Parietex PCO), multifilament polyester (Parietex TET), composite monofilament polypropylene (Ventralight), or monofilament polypropylene (SoftMesh)). Prior to implantation, mesh was soaked in saline or 10 mg/ml of vancomycin for 15 min. Following implantation, meshes were contaminated with 10(4) CFU of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteria. Thirty days after implantation, mesh samples were cultured and evaluated under scanning electron microscope for biofilm formation.
RESULTS: Presoaking meshes significantly improves bacterial clearance in composite meshes and multifilament polyester mesh. MRSA clearance was as follows for all meshes (saline-soaked vs. vanco-soaked): Parietex PCO (0 vs. 56 %, p = 0.006), Parietex TET (0 vs. 50 %, p = 0.01), Ventralight (20 vs. 78 %, p = 0.012), and SoftMesh (70 vs. 80 %, p = 0.6). MRSA biofilm formation was consistent with bacterial growth.
CONCLUSION: Presoaking multifilament and composite mesh in vancomycin solution reduces MRSA bacterial growth. Its implementation may reduce the risk of mesh infection in clean-contaminated cases, although further investigation with human trials should be performed."
23212560,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23212560/,"BACKGROUND: Rituximab (RTX) is a promising strategy for treating steroid-dependent idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (SDNS). RTX induces profound B-cell depletion, suggesting hypogammaglobulinemia as a potential side effect after long-term treatment.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels in 12 pediatric patients on RTX with a B-cell depletion of a minimum of 3 months and compared the results to 16 patients on orally administered immunosuppressive drugs, such as mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and/or cyclosporine A (CyA). All patients were in stable remission of SDNS at the time of IgG analysis.
RESULTS: IgG levels in the RTX group before RTX introduction were 6.2 ± 1.0 g/L and were not significantly different from the MMF/CyA group (8.2 ± 2.5 g/L). In the MMF/CyA group, five patients had at least one episode of hypogammaglobulinemia. In two of them, this episode was prolonged (>3 months), and only one required IgG supplementation. In the RTX group, eight patients had decreased IgG levels before RTX infusion. After RTX, hypogammaglobulinemia persisted in seven among those eight patients. No decreased IgG plasma levels were noted in patients with normal baseline IgG levels before RTX treatment.
CONCLUSION: RTX does not seem to directly induce decreased IgG levels in patients with SDNS, but it seems to prolong a preexisting low IgG levels."
23212664,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23212664/,"PURPOSE: The most widely accepted classification for endometriosis is the Revised American Society for Reproductive Medicine (rASRM) system, but this does not take deeply infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) into account. The Enzian classification enables clinicians to classify DIE. Due to complexity and partial overlap with rASRM, it was revised for a second time in February 2011. Using both the systems to classify lesions would be inappropriate, as they refer to different locations. The aim of this study was to analyze whether the revised Enzian classification is easier to use and avoids duplicate classifications.
METHODS: Retrospective study of 460 women admitted for endometriosis.
RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-seven of 460 patients (41 %) had histologically confirmed DIE based on the revised Enzian classification. Further classification of these 187 patients using Enzian revealed 270 retroperitoneal lesions, as some patients had several DIE-type lesions simultaneously: 66 in compartment A (rectovaginal septum, vagina), 112 in compartment B (sacrouterine ligaments, pelvic wall), 58 in compartment C (bowel), 15 with adenomyosis uteri, 7 with bladder involvement, 8 with intrinsic involvement of the ureter, and 4 with bowel involvement. All 270 lesions were classified using Enzian alone and not with the rASRM score. There were no duplicate classifications (rASRM and Enzian).
CONCLUSIONS: The revised Enzian classification is an excellent complement to the rASRM score for morphological description of DIE."

Our aim was to analyze the prognostic value of histologic type in overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) after PE and correlate it to clinical and pathologic variables.
METHODS: We reviewed a series of 77 individuals who underwent PE for cervical or vaginal cancer from January 1980 to December 2010.
RESULTS: Mean age was 54.5 years. Fifty-three patients (68.9 %) had cervical and 24 (31.1 %) vaginal cancer. Fifty-six (72.7 %) were squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and 21 (27.3 %) ACs. We performed 42 (54.5 %) total, 18 anterior, 8 posterior, and 9 lateral extended PE. Median tumor size was 5 cm. Surgical margins were negative in 91.7 % of cases. Median operative time, length of hospital stay, and blood transfusion volume were, respectively, 420 (range 180-720) mins, 13.5 (range 4-79) days, and 900 (range 300-3900) ml. Median follow-up was 13.7 (range 1.09-114.3) months. SCC statistically correlated with presence of perineural invasion (p = 0.004). Five-year OS and DSS were, respectively, 24.4 and 37.1 %. SCC (p = 0.003) and grade 3 (p = 0.001) negatively affected OS in univariate analysis. SCC (p = 0.006), grade 3 (p = 0.003), perineural invasion (p = 0.03), lymph node metastasis (p = 0.02), and positive margins (p = 0.04) negatively affected DSS in univariate analysis. SCC and grade 3 retained the higher risk of death (OS and DSS) in multivariate analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: AC histology in cervical and vaginal cancer is associated with better outcome after PE compared to SCC."
23213114,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23213114/,"BACKGROUND: People living in areas of multiple deprivation are more likely to smoke and less likely to quit smoking. This study examines the effect on smoking and intention to quit smoking for those who have experienced housing improvements (HI) in deprived areas of Glasgow, UK, and investigates whether such effects can be explained by improved mental health.
METHODS: Quasi-experimental, 2-year longitudinal study, comparing residents' smoking and intention to quit smoking for HI group (n=545) with non-HI group (n=517), adjusting for baseline (2006) sociodemographic factors and smoking status. SF-12 mental health scores were used to assess mental health, along with self-reported experience of, and General Practitioner (GP) consultations for, anxiety and depression in the last 12 months.
RESULTS: There was no relationship between smoking and HI, adjusting for baseline rates (OR=0.97, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.67, p=0.918). We found an association between intention to quit and HI, which remained significant after adjusting for sociodemographics and previous intention to quit (OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.12 to 4.16, p=0.022). We found no consistent evidence that this association was attenuated by improvement in our three mental health measures.
CONCLUSIONS: Providing residents in disadvantaged areas with better housing may prompt them to consider quitting smoking. However, few people actually quit, indicating that residential improvements or changes to the physical environment may not be sufficient drivers of personal behavioural change. It would make sense to link health services to housing regeneration projects to support changes in health behaviours at a time when environmental change appears to make behavioural change more likely."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data of 86 employees who were exposed to mobbing > 1 years (chronic distress syndrome) and data of 30 employees who were exposed to act of violence as acute traumatic crisis situation (evaluation in first week after acute stress situation and post control observation 6 months later). TOOLS FOR ASSESSMENT WERE CLINICAL EXAMINATION AND QUESTIONNAIRES: Occupational stress questionnaire (OSQ short version), self-constructed Questionnaire about symptoms and signs of Adrenal exhaustion; self-constructed mobbing questionnaire; and Maslach--Burnout Inventory.
RESULTS: The patients expressed their traumatic experiences during exposure to stress more than 1 year (long-term exposure) which were compared with acute stress experiences (mostly high level of stress intensity.
CONCLUSION: when workers constant expose to repeat mobbing behavior or have perception of extended distress reaction after act of violence at workplace they are suffering of Syndrome burnout and clinical picture of adrenal fatigue."
23215801,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23215801/,"OBJECTIVES: This study examined whether an employee's age moderates the relationships between job stressors (i.e. job insecurity, workload, work-family conflict) and self-rated well-being (i.e. work-family enrichment, life satisfaction, job satisfaction, vigor at work).
METHOD: Analysis of covariance and moderated hierarchical regression analysis were used to examine the cross-sectional Finnish data collected among service sector employees (N = 1037), nurses (N = 1719), and academic employees (N = 945).
RESULTS: In a situation of high job insecurity, the younger nurses reported higher work-family enrichment, job satisfaction, and vigor compared to their older colleagues. A similar result was also found among the service sector workers in relation to vigor at work. Thus, young age buffered against negative outcomes related to job insecurity. Moreover, older age buffered against the negative effect of high workload on job satisfaction among the service sector and against high work-family conflict on life satisfaction among the academic employees.
CONCLUSION: More attention should be paid to the ability of younger employees to manage problems related to work-family imbalance and high workload, and to older employees' ability to cope with job insecurity. The findings of this study recommend different stress management interventions for older and younger employees."
23215960,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23215960/,"OBJECTIVE: The frequency and the degree of recovery of anterior pituitary hormone deficits in patients with macroprolactinoma responsive to cabergoline are not clear. Our aim was to evaluate pituitary function in these patients with particular reference to an assessment of the possible restoration of pituitary deficits.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The records of all subjects prospectively presenting to our Department with macroprolactinomas treated with cabergoline over a 2-year period were reviewed. Pituitary function was assessed at diagnosis and, if abnormal, for three consecutive years for the GH, FSH/LH and ACTH axes, and at 3 years for the TSH axis.
RESULTS: Twelve patients were included. Severe GH deficiency was found in 83% at diagnosis and did not resolve in any patient at last assessment. Gonadotrophin deficiency was found in 90% at diagnosis and in 50% at last evaluation (showing reversal in 44% of deficient patients, all achieved within 1 year). ACTH deficiency was found in 17% at diagnosis and it did not reverse in any patient at last assessment. TSH deficiency was found in 36% at diagnosis and in 27% at last assessment (reversal in 25% of deficient patients).
CONCLUSIONS: In our study, in a group of patients with macroprolactinoma systematically assessed at intervals, pituitary dysfunction in response to cabergoline was found to be mostly irreversible, except for the gonadotroph axis which showed restoration in a subset of subjects following achievement of normoprolactinaemia. It would appear that the reversibility of pituitary axes may be less common than previously thought."
23216002,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23216002/,"BACKGROUND: Asthma is a significant public health problem in Venezuela affecting the predominantly urban and poor majority of the population. Information regarding home and the social environment, key elements in asthma, is found to be deficient in these deprived socioeconomic sectors. This study was carried out to depict a life with asthma in this context which has been served over the years by a National Asthma Control Program.
METHODS: A survey of families residing in a socioeconomically deprived community of Caracas was carried out with the assumption that this community reflects the image of a life with asthma emanating from our deprived urban areas. Home physical settings were inspected for the following items: moldy walls, floors, ceilings, windows, sewage, garbage disposal, running water, plumbing, electricity, telephone, construction debris, furniture, bathrooms, food storage, and home appliances. In addition, we also gathered information regarding smoking habits, fumes exposure, pets and/or animals, and sighting of roaches and/or rodents. The presence of people with asthma was observed and their status of control was assessed through the asthma control test (ACT). Comparisons were made between families with asthmatics and those without asthmatics.
RESULTS: Randomly, 242 of 750 families (32.26%) were surveyed, with ""head of family"" providing information (75.6%) on most occasions. No significant association was found with respect to the previously explored items in those families with or without the presence of asthmatics. Medically diagnosed asthma was found in 14.91%, with ACT scores of <19 points in two-thirds of these adults and asthmatic children. Asthmatics reported symptoms occurring mostly during the night and an almost exclusive use of rescue medications. Families provided most treatments and children preferred to use the oral route for control medications. Significant work and school absenteeism were detected in more than 50% of these asthmatics.
CONCLUSIONS: No physical home environmental/risk factors turned out to be significantly associated with families reporting the presence of asthmatics. The high impact of asthma found in this Caracas slum underscores the realities of Venezuela's impoverished urban majority. To properly address this important challenge, our National Asthma Control Program needs to be reassessed."
23216230,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23216230/,"BACKGROUND: Monitoring of patients' vital sign values (VSVs) during hemotherapy may have an important role in the recognition and mitigation of transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO). Knowledge regarding VSVs and other patient characteristics in bedside-reported TACO or fluid challenge-suspected transfusion reactions (TACO/FC-STRs) is limited.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational cohort study of cases of uncomplicated red blood cell (RBC) transfusions (UCTs) and reported suspected transfusion reaction (STR) cases investigated by our hospital's transfusion medicine service (TMS) from January 1, 2005, to February 29, 2008, using data obtained from TMS consult reports and quality improvement databases examining VSVs and patient characteristics in TACO/FC-STRs.
RESULTS: The frequency of TACO/FC-STRs was 0.19% per all RBC units transfused (1:530 units transfused). Both clinically and statistically (p≤0.05) significant changes were encountered in all VSVs in patients experiencing TACO/FC-STRs either at the 15-minute time interval or at the end-of-transfusion time points. Measured and derived VSVs related to the patients' blood pressure in the peritransfusion period were consistently increased. Approximately two-thirds of TACO/FC-STR patients also exhibited inflammatory related signs and symptoms at STR bedside presentation. Differences (all p≤0.050) between UCT and TACO/FC-STR cohorts were seen for patient mean weights (80 kg vs. 72 kg), mean minutes to transfusion completion (121 min vs. 83 min), and mean storage age of suspected sentinel RBC unit (22.5 days vs. 25.2 days).
CONCLUSION: Trend monitoring of peritransfusion VSVs, especially blood pressures, may aid in the bedside recognition of TACO/FC-STRs. A subset of these patients may also present with febrile and/or inflammatory signs and symptoms."

STUDY SETTING: Medicare dialysis population.
STUDY DESIGN: Data from the U.S. Renal Data System (USRDS) were used to identify 3,884 freestanding dialysis facilities and 37,942 Medicare patients incident to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in 2006. The role of injectable medications was evaluated during a 2-year follow-up period by mediational analyses using mixed-effect regression models.
DATA COLLECTION: USRDS data were matched with Dialysis Facility Report data from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and census data.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: There was a strong association found between organizational status and use of injectable drugs. Large for-profit chains used significantly higher injectable medications compared with nonprofit chains and independent facilities. However, the relationship between facility organizational status and patient mortality was not found to be mediated through the higher use of injectable drugs.
CONCLUSIONS: Large for-profit chain facilities administered higher IV epoetin, iron, and vitamin D dosages, but this did not result in improved survival. Given the associated costs and lack of a survival benefit, the overuse of injectable medications among the U.S. dialysis patients will likely end under the recent bundling of injectable medications without jeopardizing patient outcomes."
23216721,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23216721/,"OBJECTIVES: To describe the trends in emergency admissions over 10 years in terms of volume, age-specific rates, hospital length of stay (LOS) and clinical reasons.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of population-based linked Department of Health ED and hospital admission data for metropolitan Melbourne 1999/2000 to 2008/2009 was conducted. Outcome measures included: hospital admission numbers (total, single day/overnight, ≥2 days LOS); admission rates per 1000 person-years (total, single day/overnight, ≥2 days LOS); hospital LOS.
RESULTS: The volume of patients admitted to hospital through EDs rose by 56% over the 10 years to June 2009. The number of same day/overnight admissions rose by 60%, equating to a 6.1% average annual increase beyond that accounted for by demographic change (95% CI 5.7-6.5%). The volume of patients admitted for ≥2 days also increased; however, the admission rate per 1000 persons for these longer-stay patients declined over the decade by 9% (95% CI 5-12%). The most frequent discharge diagnoses were injury or poisoning, and disorders of the circulatory, respiratory or digestive systems. The numbers and mortality rate for ED admissions declined over the decade.
CONCLUSION: Emergency hospital admissions have risen over the last decade even after adjustment for population changes. There was a disproportionate rise in same day/overnight admissions, with overrepresentation of the elderly. This is possibly related to changes in ED models of care, including introduction of short-stay units, improved diagnostic and therapeutic capability, and risk-averse management to optimise safe discharge, within the context of time-based performance targets."
23216776,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23216776/,"BACKGROUND: By 2033, the number of people aged 85 years and over in the UK is projected to double, accounting for 5% of the total population. It is important to understand the surgical outcome after a pancreatic resection in the elderly to assist decision making.
METHODS: Over a 9-year period (from January 2000 to August 2009), 428 consecutive patients who underwent a pancreatic resection were reviewed. Data were collected on mortality, complications, length of stay and survival. Patients were divided into two groups (younger than 70 and older than 70 years old) and outcomes were analysed.
RESULTS: In all, 119 (27.8%) patients were ≥ 70 years and 309 (72.2%) patients were < 70 years. The median length of stay for the older and younger group was 15 days (range 3-91) and 14 days (range 3-144), respectively. The overall mortality was 3.4% in the older group and 2.6% in the younger group (P = 0.75). The older cohort had a cumulative median survival of 57.3 months (range 0-119), compared with 78.7 months (range 0-126) in the younger cohort (P < 0.0001). In patients undergoing a pancreatic resection for ductal adenocarcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma there was a significant difference in survival with P-values of 0.043 and 0.003, respectively. For ampullary adenocarcinoma, the older group had a median survival of 47.1 months compared with 68.3 months (P = 0.194).
CONCLUSION: Results from this study suggest that while elderly patients can safely undergo a pancreatic resection and that age alone should not preclude a pancreatic resection, there is still significant morbidity and mortality in the octogenarian subgroup with poor long-term survival with the need for quality-of-life assessment."
23216778,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23216778/,"OBJECTIVES: Gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) is a rare disease that is often diagnosed incidentally in its early stages. Simple cholecystectomy is considered the standard treatment for stage I GBC. This study was conducted in a large cohort of patients with stage I GBC to test the hypothesis that the extent of surgery affects survival.
METHODS: The National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database was queried to identify patients in whom microscopically confirmed, localized (stage I) GBC was diagnosed between 1988 and 2008. Surgical treatment was categorized as cholecystectomy alone, cholecystectomy with lymph node dissection (C + LN) or radical cholecystectomy (RC). Age, gender, race, ethnicity, T1 sub-stage [T1a, T1b, T1NOS (T1 not otherwise specified)], radiation treatment, extent of surgery, cause of death and survival were assessed by log-rank and Cox's regression analyses.
RESULTS: Of 2788 patients with localized GBC, 1115 (40.0%) had pathologically confirmed T1a, T1b or T1NOS cancer. At a median follow-up of 22 months, 288 (25.8%) had died of GBC. Five-year survival rates associated with cholecystectomy, C + LN and RC were 50%, 70% and 79%, respectively (P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that surgical treatment and younger age were predictive of improved disease-specific survival (P < 0.001), whereas radiation therapy portended worse survival (P = 0.013).
CONCLUSIONS: In the largest series of patients with stage I GBC to be reported, survival was significantly impacted by the extent of surgery (LN dissection and RC). Cholecystectomy alone is inadequate in stage I GBC and its use as standard treatment should be reconsidered."
23216782,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23216782/,"BACKGROUND: According to international guidelines [European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD)], portal hypertension (PHTN) is considered a contraindication for liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and patients should be referred for other treatments. However, this statement remains controversial. The aim of this study was to elucidate surgical outcomes of minor hepatectomies in patients with PHTN (defined by the presence of esophageal varices or a platelet count of <100,000 in association with splenomegaly) and well-compensated liver disease.
METHODS: Between 1997 and 2012, a total of 223 cirrhotic patients [stage A according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) classification] were eligible for this analysis and were divided into two groups according to the presence (n = 63) or absence (n = 160) of PHTN. The demographic data were comparable in the two patient groups.
RESULTS: Operative mortality was not different (only one patient died in the PHTN group). However, patients with PHTN had higher liver-related morbidity (29% versus 14%; P = 0.009), without differences in hospital stay (8.8 versus 9.8 days, respectively). The PHTN group showed a worse survival rate only if biochemical signs of liver decompensation existed. Multivariate analysis identified albumin levels as an independent predictive factor for survival.
CONCLUSIONS: PHTN should not be considered an absolute contraindication to a hepatectomy in cirrhotic patients. Patients with PHTN have short- and long-term results similar to patients with normal portal pressure. A limited hepatic resection for early-stage tumours is an option for Child-Pugh class A5 patients with PHTN."
23216813,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23216813/,"BACKGROUND: Temperature strongly affects microbial growth, and many microorganisms have to deal with temperature fluctuations in their natural environment. To understand regulation strategies that underlie microbial temperature responses and adaptation, we studied glycolytic pathway kinetics in Saccharomyces cerevisiae during temperature changes.
RESULTS: Saccharomyces cerevisiae was grown under different temperature regimes and glucose availability conditions. These included glucose-excess batch cultures at different temperatures and glucose-limited chemostat cultures, subjected to fast linear temperature shifts and circadian sinoidal temperature cycles. An observed temperature-independent relation between intracellular levels of glycolytic metabolites and residual glucose concentration for all experimental conditions revealed that it is the substrate availability rather than temperature that determines intracellular metabolite profiles. This observation corresponded with predictions generated in silico with a kinetic model of yeast glycolysis, when the catalytic capacities of all glycolytic enzymes were set to share the same normalized temperature dependency.
CONCLUSIONS: From an evolutionary perspective, such similar temperature dependencies allow cells to adapt more rapidly to temperature changes, because they result in minimal perturbations of intracellular metabolite levels, thus circumventing the need for extensive modification of enzyme levels."
23217188,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23217188/,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about the long-term success of non-drug therapies for treating dementia, especially whether the effects are sustained after therapy ends. Here, we examined the effects of a one-year multimodal therapy 10 months after patients completed the therapy.
METHODS: This randomised, controlled, single-blind, longitudinal trial involved 61 patients (catamnesis: n = 52) with primary degenerative dementia in five nursing homes in Bavaria, Germany. The highly standardised intervention, MAKS, consisted of motor stimulation, practice of activities of daily living (ADLs), and cognitive stimulation. Each group of 10 patients was treated for 2 h, 6 days a week for 12 months. Control patients received standard nursing home care. At baseline, at the end of therapy (month 12), and 10 months thereafter (month 22), cognitive functioning was assessed using the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale, and the ability to perform ADLs was assessed using the Erlangen Test of Activities of Daily Living.
RESULTS: During the therapy phase, the MAKS patients maintained their cognitive function and ability to carry out ADLs. After the end of therapy, both the control and the MAKS groups deteriorated in both their cognitive function (control, p = 0.02; MAKS, p < 0.001) and their ability to carry out ADLs (control, p < 0.001; MAKS, p = 0.001). However, in a confound-adjusted multiple regression model, the ability of the MAKS group to perform ADLs remained significantly higher than that of the control group even 10 months after the end of therapy (H0: βMAKS + βMAKS month 22 = 0; χ2 = 3.8568, p = 0.0496). Cohen's d for the difference between the two groups in ADLs and cognitive abilities 10 months after the end of therapy was 0.40 and 0.22, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: A multimodal non-drug therapy of dementia resulted in stabilisation of the ability to perform ADLs, even beyond the end of therapy. To prevent functional decline for as long as possible, therapy should be performed continuously until the benefit for the patient ends. Follow-up studies on larger numbers of patients are needed to definitively confirm these results.

STUDY DESIGN: We retrospectively analyzed contrast-enhanced CT images of 90 patients with odontogenic jaw cysts or cystic-appearing tumors. The lesion size and CT values were measured and the short axis to long axis (S/L) ratio, contrast enhancement (CE) ratio, and standard deviation ratio were calculated.
RESULTS: The lesion size and the S/L ratio of keratocystic odontogenic tumors were significantly different from those of radicular cysts and follicular cysts. There were no significant differences in the CE ratio among the lesions.
CONCLUSIONS: Multidetector CT provided diagnostic information about the size of odontogenic cysts and cystic-appearing tumors of the jaws that was related to the lesion type, but showed no relation between CE ratio and the type of these lesions."

RESULTS: Borderline patients were significantly more often exposed to adverse intrauterine conditions, such as prenatal tobacco exposure (p=0.004), medical complications (p=0.008), prenatal maternal traumatic stress (p=0.015), familial conflicts (p=0.004), low social support (p=0.004) and partnership problems during pregnancy (p=0.014). Logistic regression analyses revealed that the reported prenatal risk factors accounted for 25.7% of the variance in BPD. Prenatal tobacco exposure [odds ratio (OR) 3.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.49-7.65, p=0.004] and medical complications (OR 2.87, 95% CI 1.29-6.38, p=0.010) emerged as important predictors. After controlling for childhood adversity and parental socio-economic status (SES), prenatal risk factors predicted relevant borderline subdomains, such as impulsivity, affective instability, identity disturbance, dissociation and severity of borderline symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence of an association between prenatal adversity and the diagnosis of BPD. Our findings suggest that prenatal adversity may constitute a potential risk factor in the pathogenesis of BPD."
23217883,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23217883/,"PURPOSE: We have previously reported the use of EC-CPR for the treatment of hypothermic cardiac arrest with an overall survival of 50%. As we have continued this protocol for an additional 5 years, we sought to update this information.
METHODS: We reviewed all of the activations for hypothermic cardiac arrest from 2005 to 2011. Results are presented as means with minimum and maximum values. The 95% confidence interval for the point estimate of survival was calculated using a binomial distribution.
RESULTS: Nine children were placed on EC-CPR for hypothermic cardiac arrest. Two patients survived to discharge and were neurologically normal. The other seven patients were adequately supported with veno-arterial EC-CPR but met brain death criteria after rewarming prompting withdrawal of support. Four of these went on to multiple organ donation. The overall survival in the series was 22% with a 95% confidence interval from 4% to 58%.
CONCLUSION: Cold water drowning and avalanche suffocations cause dramatic hypothermic cardiac arrests in previously robust children. A protocolized rapid response with EC-CPR can save some of these children despite prolonged periods of cardiac arrest prior to initiation of bypass. The overall survival rate is likely less than our prior more optimistic report suggested."
23217943,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23217943/,"BACKGROUND: Diffusion halo profiles of different commercially available type-A botulinum toxins (BTX-A) have been studied.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and compare the largest diameter of diffusion halos of 5 different doses of 5 different commercially available BTX-A.
METHODS: Twenty-five adult female volunteers were included. Products with 100 units (100 UI) and the product with 500 units (500 UI) were reconstituted in a ratio of 1:2.5. Products were applied in five different concentrations (1 U/2.5 U, 2 U/5 U, 3 U/7.5 U, 4 U/10 U, and 5 U/12.5 U). After 30 days, a starch-iodine test was conducted to obtain the largest diameter of each halo.
RESULTS: For all BTX-As, the higher the number of units used, the larger the diameter of the diffusion halo p<0.05). Statistically significant differences (p<0.05) were observed between the North American and Chinese BTX-As for the three lowest doses, between the Korean and German BTX-As for all doses, between the French and Chinese BTX-As for the four highest doses, between the French and German BTX-As for all doses, between the Chinese and German BTX-As for the four highest doses, and between the North American and German BTX-As for all doses (p<0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Differences were observed between all brands of BTX-As and between the different doses of each brand."
23218120,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23218120/,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: International guidelines are quite vague regarding the optimal doses of amino acid to administer to cancer patients and standard practice appears not to be supported by specific investigations. The purpose of this study is to determine from the literature whether there are some correlates among amino acid infusions and nutritional-metabolic or clinical outcomes.
METHODS: Through the help of PubMed (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and the use of a personal database we analysed papers reporting details of infused amino acid and metabolic-nutritional or clinical effects.
RESULTS: Five short-term metabolic studies using isotopes showed that infusion of about 2 g amino acid/kg/day (including high doses of branched chain amino acid) positively affects protein metabolism of severely malnourished cancer patients. In eight studies in less malnourished patients receiving longer periods of parenteral nutrition, to allow the administration of oncologic therapy or to compensate for a decline in oral alimentation, the intravenous addition of 1.5 g amino acid/kg/day to the oral diet achieved positive results. These findings are concordant with recent metabolic results achieved in cancer patients receiving amino acid orally.
CONCLUSION: We think that a higher quantity of parenteral amino acids than that usually administered might be useful to cancer patients and further studies on this issue are warranted."
23218198,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23218198/,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about the outcomes of adults with syncope seen in Canadian Emergency Departments (EDs).
OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine the frequency, timing, and type of serious adverse outcomes occurring in these patients, and the proportion that occur outside the hospital.
METHODS: We conducted a health records review of syncope patients presenting to a tertiary care ED over an 18-month period. We included all patients older than 16 years of age who fulfilled the syncope definition (sudden transient loss of consciousness with spontaneous complete recovery), and excluded those with altered mental status, alcohol or illicit drug use, seizure, or trauma. We assessed for outcomes in the ED and after ED disposition. We also evaluated follow-up arrangements for patients discharged from the ED.
RESULTS: Of the total 87,508 patient visits, 505 (0.6%) were due to syncope. The mean age was 58.5 years (range 16-101 years), 70.1% arrived by ambulance, and 12.3% were admitted to the hospital. Five patients died: 2 in the ED, 1 as an inpatient, and 2 after discharge. Overall, there were 49 (9.7%) serious outcomes, with dysrhythmias being the most common (4.6%); 22 (4.4%) occurred in the ED, 15 (3.0%) in the hospital, and 12 (2.4%) outside the hospital. Eight serious outcomes occurred in patients discharged from the ED without any planned follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Although syncope represented < 1% of all patient visits, morbidity was substantial, particularly in patients discharged from the ED. Future research should help clinicians identify syncope patients at high risk for serious outcomes."
23218481,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23218481/,"OBJECTIVE: Proton-pump inhibitors, such as omeprazole, are widely used in the prevention and treatment of gastroesophageal diseases. However, an association between proton-pump inhibitors and the increased risk of bone fractures has been observed, especially in patients treated for extended periods. Conversely, 2-oxoglutarate, a precursor of hydroxyproline, the most abundant amino acid in bone collagen, counteracts the bone loss. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the influence of omeprazole on bone and investigate whether dietary 2-oxoglutarate supplementation could prevent the effects of omeprazole.
METHODS: Eighteen male Sprague-Dawley rats were used. Rats received omeprazole in the diet and 2-oxoglutarate in the drinking water. Body and organ weights and serum concentrations of cholecystokinin and gastrin were measured. The femurs, tibias, and calvarias were collected. Histomorphometric analysis of bone and cartilage tissues was conducted. Bone densitometric and peripheral quantitative computed tomographic analyses of the femur and tibia were performed.
RESULTS: Omeprazole decreased the femur and tibia weights, the mechanical properties of the femur, the volumetric bone density and content, the trabecular and cortical bone mineral content, the total, trabecular, and cortical bone areas, the mean cortical thickness, and the periosteal circumference of the femur. Omeprazole had a minor effect on the examined bone morphology and exerted negligible effects on the cartilage. 2-Oxoglutarate lowered the gastrin concentration.
CONCLUSIONS: Omeprazole treatment exerts its effects mostly on bone mineralization and cancellous bone, adversely affecting bone properties. This adverse effect of omeprazole was not markedly abolished by 2-oxoglutaric acid, which acted as an anti-hypergastrinemic agent."
23218754,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23218754/,"OBJECTIVE: Varicoceles occur in 15% of adult and adolescent males and are generally considered to be an extratesticular phenomenon. However, an intratesticular component has been reported in up to 2% of adult and 2% of adolescent varicoceles. We sought to determine the incidence of intratesticular varicoceles (ITV) in adolescents in our practice, its significance, associated findings and response to treatment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 684 adolescent males who were diagnosed with varicoceles and had at least one Doppler ultrasound (DUS) prior to any surgery to identify those with an intratesticular component. Testicular volumes, maximum vein diameter (MVD) and peak retrograde flow (PRF) were determined by DUS and recorded.
RESULTS: A total of 6 (0.9%) patients were found to have an intratesticular component with a mean PRF of 43.7 cm/s, mean MVD of 3.3 mm and mean asymmetry of 20%. Mean PRF, MVD, and asymmetry of those without an intratesticular component who underwent surgery was 44.8 cm/s, 2.9 mm, and 21.8%, respectively (PNS for all parameters). Four of the 6 patients had 2 or more DUS, and all 4 had worsening testicular asymmetry and PRF over time. Five patients underwent laparoscopic varicocelectomy and all five had catch-up testicular growth. One patient refused surgical repair and has had subsequent worsening testicular asymmetry and softening of the testicle.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that adolescents who present with an intratesticular varicocele in association with testicular asymmetry will develop worse asymmetry over time. Therefore, adolescents with intratesticular varicoceles and initial asymmetry should be scheduled for surgery rather than followed."
23218844,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23218844/,"OBJECTIVE: There are no studies investigating the efficacy of short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy in primary fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). We conducted a randomized controlled trial evaluating an adapted form of individual short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy (ASTPP) versus primary care management (TAU). The study focused on FMS patients with psychiatric comorbidity.
METHODS: Forty-six female patients with FMS and an International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision diagnosis of a comorbid depression or anxiety disorder were recruited in a hospital setting. Participants were randomized to receive either ASTPP (25 sessions, 1 session/week) or TAU (4 consultations/6 months). Outcome measures included the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Pain Disability Index, the Symptom Checklist 27 and the health-related quality of life. Primary endpoints of the outcome assessment were the FIQ total score and the HADS depression scale at 12-month follow-up.
RESULTS: Both treatments were effective in reducing the FIQ total score (ES=0.56 and ES=0.75, respectively). Intent-to-treat analyses failed to provide evidence suggesting a marked superiority of individual psychodynamic psychotherapy as compared to TAU.
CONCLUSIONS: A high-standard routine treatment focusing on the improvement of health behavior and including antidepressant and analgesic medication is equally effective as a short-term individual psychodynamic psychotherapy in improving fibromyalgia-related symptoms."
23219180,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23219180/,"OBJECTIVE: While Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) is highly associated with localised aggressive periodontitis (LAP) many Aa-carriers do not develop LAP. This study was designed to determine whether specific salivary factors could distinguish between subjects who have Aa initially and remain healthy (H/AA) as compared to those who develop LAP (LAP/AA).
DESIGN: H/AA subjects and healthy controls with no Aa (H) were enrolled in a longitudinal cohort study to investigate initiation of bone loss (LAP) over 3 years. After detection of LAP, stored saliva from 10 H, 10 H/AA, and 10 LAP/AA subjects was thawed, processed, and tested for (1) lactoferrin (Lf) concentration and iron levels; (2) agglutination of Aa; (3) killing of Gram-positive bacteria.
RESULTS: LAP/AA saliva levels of Lf iron were low prior to and after bone loss (3.6+1.7ngFe/μg) (LAP/AA vs. H and H/AA p≤0.01). Saliva from H/AA subjects caused Aa to agglutinate significantly more than H or LAP/AA saliva (p≤0.01). LAP/AA saliva killed Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis and Lactobacillus in vitro by >83%. Saliva from H individuals killed these bacteria by <3.3% (LAP/AA vs. H; p≤0.01). H/AA killing was intermediate.
CONCLUSION: LAP/AA saliva showed: low levels of Lf iron, minimal Aa agglutinating activity, and high killing activity against Gram-positive bacteria. Aa-positive healthy saliva (H/AA) showed: higher levels of Lf iron, maximal Aa agglutinating activity, and moderate killing of Gram-positive bacteria. A salivary activity profile can distinguish between subjects who are Aa-positive and remain healthy from those who develop LAP."
23219210,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23219210/,"INTRODUCTION: The pancreatic fistula is the most feared complication after a duodenopancreatectomy, and is the most common independent factor of post-surgical mortality. Peng et al. recently published a pancreaticojejunal anastomosis technique (binding anastomosis) which showed 0% pancreatic fistulas. The objective of this study is to evaluate and validate this new anastomosis technique compared with the conventional pancreaticoduodenectomy with end-to-side duct-to-mucosa anastomosis.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: A prospective, non-randomised study was conducted to evaluate and validate this new anastomosis technique compared with the conventional pancreaticojejunal terminolateral duct to mucosa anastomosis. The study included 63 patients who were subjected to a duodenopancreatectomy due to having a pancreatic or periampullary neoplasm. A binding pancreaticojejunostomy according to the technique described by Peng et al. was performed on 30 patients (Group A), and a pancreaticoduodenectomy with end-to-side duct-to-mucosa anastomosis (conventional technique) was performed on 33 patients (Group B).
RESULTS: When the results of the 2 techniques were compared, 2/30 (6%) of patients had a pancreatic fistula with the Peng technique, and 4/33 (12%) with the conventional technique, but this was not statistically significant (P=.674). Nor were there any significant differences between the 2 groups on comparing, morbidity, hospital stay and mortality.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study show that the anastomosis method described by Peng is safe, but is not associated with a lower frequency of pancreatic fistula, general morbidity, or mortality. This leads to the uncertainty of whether it really has any advantages over other techniques."
23219404,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23219404/,"OBJECTIVE: Transverse cerebral venous sinus stenosis (TSS) is common among patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension. TSS likely also exists among individuals with normal intracranial pressure (ICP) but the prevalence is unclear. The goal of this study was to identify patients with incidental TSS and normal ICP and describe their characteristics.
METHODS: Among 240 adult patients who underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with magnetic resonance venography (MRV) with contrast at our institution between September 2009 and September 2011, 44 had isolated TSS without further substantial imaging abnormality. Medical records were reviewed for symptoms of increased ICP, papilledema, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) constituents and opening pressure (OP), and reason for brain imaging. Of these, 37 were excluded for confirmed or possible idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Of the remainder, 5 had CSF-OP≤25 cmH2O without papilledema, and 2 did not have measured ICP, but had no papilledema or symptoms of increased ICP. Imaging was re-interpreted to assess for signs suggestive of elevated ICP and to characterize the TSS further.
RESULTS: All patients were women (mean age: 41, mean BMI: 37.1). CSF contents were normal, but OPs were at the upper limit of normal (22-25 cmH2O). Indications for MRI/MRV included query pituitary abnormality (1), migraine (4), and anomalous-appearing optic nerves (2). All had bilateral TSS. Six had short TSS and an empty sella; 1 had long TSS and no empty sella; 1 had flattening of the posterior sclera; 2 had prominence of peri-optic nerve CSF.
CONCLUSION: Asymptomatic bilateral TSS exists in patients with ICP≤25 cmH2O, but is likely uncommon. CSF-OP was at the upper limit of normal in our patients, who also had other radiologic signs suggestive (but not specific) of chronically-raised ICP. Findings of bilateral TSS on imaging should prompt funduscopic examination for papilledema."
23219634,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23219634/,"BACKGROUND: Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder that is often preceded by excessive physical activity. As such, exercise is not often prescribed in the clinical management of individuals with anorexia nervosa.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of supervised exercise training in patients with anorexia nervosa.
DATA SOURCES: Five databases were searched from their inception to Week 14 of 2011 using the subject headings 'anorexia' and 'exercise' to identify relevant studies.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: PRISMA guidelines were followed. Studies that investigated the effects of inclusion of supervised exercise training in clinical management with usual management in patients diagnosed with anorexia nervosa were included in this review. Case reports were excluded.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two reviewers independently extracted data using a standardised assessment form. Quality assessment was rated for the controlled trials and single-group studies using the PEDro scale and Downs and Black scale, respectively. Fixed or random effect approaches were used to determine effect size, depending on the heterogeneity of the studies.
RESULTS: Pooled randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised studies showed no significant effect of supervised exercise training on selected anthropometric measurements, while the single-group studies showed significant improvement in weight and body fat. Although Short Form-36 revealed no training effect, distorted feelings about food and exercise were reduced. Cardiovascular fitness also improved with no decrease in weight.
LIMITATIONS: Heterogeneity of exercise training programmes, small sample size (n≤20) for 67% of the trials, and inability to exclude publication bias.
CONCLUSIONS: Inclusion of supervised exercise training in the comprehensive management of patients with anorexia nervosa appears to be safe, as no detrimental effect was observed in anthropometry. Strength and cardiovascular fitness were also shown to improve."

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred and two members of the general Dutch population, with and without chronic low back pain.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sociodemographics and the translated version of the illness perception questionnaire-revised, adapted for back pain.
RESULTS: Of the sample, 115 (29%) individuals had chronic low back pain (>6 months) and 287 (71%) did not have chronic low back pain. Many of the participants with chronic low back pain believed that one 'wrong' movement can potentially lead to more severe problems, and that X-rays or computer tomography scans can determine the cause of the pain. Many of the participants with chronic low back pain did not perceive a relationship between psychosocial factors and low back pain.
CONCLUSIONS: Illness perceptions differed between individuals with and without chronic low back pain. In the subacute phase, healthcare professionals could assess illness perceptions and, if necessary, incorporate them into the management of patients with low back pain."
23220100,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23220100/,"BACKGROUND: We analyzed renal cell carcinoma (RCC) brain metastasis (BM) risk factors and compared BM occurrence in metastatic RCC (mRCC) treated with or without anti-angiogenic agents (AA).
METHODS: Data from all consecutive metastatic RCC patients (patients) treated in a french cancer center between 1995 and 2008 were reviewed. Patients had histologically confirmed advanced RCC without synchronous BM at the time of metastasis diagnosis. AA were sorafenib, sunitinib and bevacizumab. We also included patients treated with mTor inhibitors, temsirolimus and everolimus, as they also demonstrated anti-angiogenic activities. Characteristics of the two groups treated with or without AA were compared with a Fisher exact test. Impact of AA on overall survival (OS) and cumulative rate of brain metastasis (CRBM) was explored by Kaplan-Meier method.
RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-nine patients with advanced RCC were identified, 51 treated with AA and 148 without AA. The median follow-up duration was 40 months. BM occurred in 35 patients. Characteristics between AA treated and non-AA treated groups were unbalanced and favoring better prognostic factors in AA treated group. Median OS was 24 months. AA treatment was not associated with a lower CRBM (HR = 0.58 [0.26-1.30], P = 0.187). Median survival free of BM was 11.8 months, CI95% (4.95-18.65) in the group without AA treatment and 28.9 months in the AA group, CI95% (18.64-39.16). Alkaline phosphatase (AP) was an independent prognostic factor for BM (P = 0.05). In multivariate Cox model, after adjustment to AP, AA did not improve the CRBM (aHR = 0.53 [0.22-1.32]).
CONCLUSION: In this retrospective study, AA did not decrease significantly the CRBM. Elevated AP was a predictive factor for BM in mRCC."
23220563,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23220563/,"OBJECTIVE: Optimal surgical outcome has been proved to be one of the most powerful survival determinants in the management of ovarian cancer patients. Actually, for ovarian cancer patients there is no general consensus on the preoperatively establishment of cytoreducibility.
METHODS: Between January 2011 and June 2012 patients affected by suspicious advanced ovarian cancer, referred to the Department of Gynecology of Campus Biomedico of Rome were enrolled in the study. All patients had serum CA125 and HE4 measured preoperatively. After a complete laparoscopy to assess the possibility of optimal debulking surgery defined as no visible residual tumor after cytoreduction (RT=0), patients were submitted to primary cytoreductive surgery (Group A) or addressed to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (Group B).
RESULTS: After diagnostic open laparoscopy, 36 patients underwent optimal primary cytoreductive surgery (Group A) and 21 patients were addressed to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (Group B). In our population, based on ROC curve, the HE4 value of 262pmol/L is the best cut-off to identify patients candidates to optimal cytoreduction with a sensitivity of 86.1% and a specificity of 89.5% (PPV=93.9% and NPV=77%). In addition, CA125 has a sensitivity of 58.3% and a specificity of 84% at cut-off of 414 UI/mL (AUC is 0.68, 95% C.I.=0.620 to 0.861).
CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that preoperative HE4 is a better predictor for optimal cytoreduction compared to CA125. The best combination in predicting cytoreduction is HE4≤262 pmol/L and ascites <500mL with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 89.5% (PPV=94% and NPV=100%)."
23220597,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23220597/,"PURPOSE: There is a continuing need to improve the prediction of hip fractures to identify those at highest risk, enabling cost-effective use of preventative therapies.
METHODS: The aim of this work was to validate an innovative imaging biomarker for hip fracture by modelling the shape and texture of the proximal femur assessed from dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans. Scans used were acquired at baseline from elderly patients participating in a prospective, placebo-controlled fracture prevention study of the bisphosphonate, clodronate. 182 subjects who subsequently suffered a hip fracture were age, weight and height matched with two controls who did not suffer a fracture during a median 4-year follow-up period. Logistic regression was used to test if variables were good predictors of fracture and adjust for bone mineral density (BMD).
RESULTS: Shape mode 2, reflecting variability in neck-shaft angle, neck width and the size of both trochanters (0.81 (OR), 0.68-0.97 (CI), 0.024 (P)), and appearance mode 6, recording grey-level contrast (1.33, 1.11-1.59, 0.002), were significant predictors of hip fracture and remained so after adjustment for BMD (shape mode 2 (0.77, 0.64-0.93, 0.006), appearance mode 6 (1.32, 1.10-1.59, 0.003)). Receiver Operating Curve analysis showed the combination of shape mode 2, appearance mode 6 and BMD was 3% better than any single predictor.
CONCLUSION: Variables derived from shape and appearance models gave a prediction of fracture comparable to BMD and in combination with BMD gave an improvement in the prediction of hip fracture that could predict an additional 2000 hip fracture cases per year in the UK, potentially saving more than £20 million per year and 10,000 cases in the US."
23220627,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23220627/,"BACKGROUND: Lower educated people have a higher prevalence of metabolic risk factors (MRF), that is, high waist circumference (WC), high systolic blood pressure, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, high triglycerides and high fasting glucose levels. Behavioural and psychosocial factors cannot fully explain this educational gradient. We aim to examine the possible role of genetic factors by estimating the extent to which education and MRF share a genetic basis and the extent to which the heritability of MRF varies across educational levels.
METHODS: We examined 388 twin pairs, aged 18-34 years, from the Belgian East Flanders Prospective Twin Survey. Using structural equation modelling, a Cholesky bivariate model was applied to assess the shared genetic basis between education and MRF. The heritability of MRF across education levels was estimated using a non-linear multivariate Gaussian regression.
RESULTS: Fifteen percent (P < 0.01) of the negative relation between education and WC was because of genes shared between these two traits. Furthermore, the heritability of WC was lower in the lowest educated group (65%) compared with the highest educated group (78%, P = 0.04). The lower heritabilities among the lower educated twins for the other MRF were not significant. The heritability of glucose was higher in the lowest education (80%) group compared with the high education group (67%, P = 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that genetic factors partly explain educational differences in WC. Furthermore, the lower heritability estimates in WC in the lower educated young adults suggest opportunities for environmental interventions to prevent the development of full-blown metabolic syndrome in middle and older age."

METHODS AND RESULTS: Catheters were placed according to the standard fashion for an electrophysiologic study of supraventricular arrhythmia, namely, high right atrium, HB, coronary sinus, and right ventricle. The ATs with their earliest activation recorded in the HB catheter and that were terminated by rapid injection of ATP (4.3 ± 2.5mg), formed the study group (n=12). After catheter ablation of these ATs, the distances between the successful ablation site and the HB area were measured. Only one successful site was near the HB and the other sites were at the noncoronary sinus of Valsalva (n=6), tricuspid annulus (n=3), right atrial septum (n=1), and left atrial septum (n=1). The average distance between the HB catheter and successful site was 10.4 ± 8.8mm. In 5 of the 12 cases (the 3 tricuspid and 2 septal foci), the distances were greater than 10mm.
CONCLUSIONS: When ablating ATP-sensitive AT with the earliest activation recorded in the HB catheter, it is important to perform detailed mapping not only around the HB."
23220798,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23220798/,"BACKGROUND: This study compared older men and women with cardiovascular (CV) risk factors in terms of the effects of a 6-month exercise intervention on high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels, blood pressure (BP) and other risk factors.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixty older (age 61-79) overweight men and 71 such women with 2 or more risk factors (ie, systolic BP 130-179 mmHg, non-fasting blood glucose 110-139 mg/dl, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 120-219 mg/dl) participated in a 6-month exercise intervention. The exercise program consisted of moderate-intensity bicycle exercise for ∼40 min, performed on average 2.5 times per week. Systolic and diastolic BP reductions were found to be greater in women than in men (SBP, -10.6 vs. -5.5 mmHg; DBP, -6.2 vs. -3.3 mmHg; both P<0.05). Decreases in body mass index were larger in women than in men (P<0.05). There was no significant gender difference in the changes in blood glucose and lipid profiles and hsCRP levels. After adjustment for confounders (exercise frequency, weight loss, age, and baseline values), there were still significant gender differences in the SBP and DBP reductions. hsCRP reduction were similar in both genders even after adjusting for weight loss.
CONCLUSIONS: There could be gender differences in the beneficial effects of exercise training on the potent CV risk factors of BP and body weight, but not on hsCRP."
23220855,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23220855/,"BACKGROUND: Paracetamol formulations provide effective analgesia after surgery [Duggan ST, Scott LJ. Intravenous paracetamol (acetominophen). Drugs 2009; 69: 101-13; Toms L, McQuay HJ, Derry S, Moore RA. Single dose oral paracetamol (acetaminophen) for postoperative pain in adults. Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2008: CD004602]. I.V. paracetamol is superior to oral for pain rescue (Jarde O, Boccard E. Parenteral versus oral route increases paracetamol efficacy. Clin Drug Invest 1997; 14: 474-81). By randomized, double-blinded trial, we aimed to determine whether preoperative oral paracetamol provides inferior postoperative analgesia to preoperative i.v. paracetamol.
METHODS: One hundred and thirty participants received either oral paracetamol and i.v. placebo (Group OP), or oral placebo and i.v. paracetamol (Perfalgan™) (Group IP). Oral preparations were given at least 45 min before surgery; i.v. preparations after induction of anaesthesia. Pain was assessed by a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS) 1 h from the end of surgery. Rescue analgesia was given on request.
RESULTS: A total of 128 patients completed the study. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics or intraoperative variables between the groups. The study was designed to reveal whether OP is inferior to IP, with an inferiority margin of 20%. The number of patients reporting satisfactory analgesia at 1 h with VAS ≤ 30 mm were 15 (OP) and 17 (IP), respectively. The secondary outcome measure of the mean (standard deviation) VAS (mm) for the whole of each group was 52 (22) for OP and 47 (22) for IP. Analysis of confidence intervals indicates that oral paracetamol is not inferior to i.v. paracetamol. The median survival (90% CI) to rescue analgesia request was 54.3 (51.2-57.4) min in Group OP and 57.3 (55.4-59.2) min in Group IP; there was no significant difference in this measure.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study of lower third molar extraction, oral paracetamol is not inferior to i.v. for postoperative analgesia. ISRCTN Registration http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN77607163."
23221274,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23221274/,"OBJECTIVE: Glandular cell abnormality (GCA) in Pap smears is uncommon. Detection is important as the possibility of underlying high-grade lesions is greater in this entity than in atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance. This study was undertaken with an aim to correlate GCA cases with histology, scrutinize its mimics and identify cytologic features to segregate significant lesions from benign.
STUDY DESIGN: A total of 22,618 conventional Pap smears were retrospectively analyzed. In all, 74 GCA cases were identified, correlated with histology and reevaluated using parameters based on architectural pattern, cellular features and background.
RESULTS: This study revealed 15 false positives. On review, 11 cases [1 adenocarcinoma, 5 atypical glandular cells (AGC), not otherwise specified, 5 AGC, favor neoplasia (FN)] were recategorized as reactive. Of 9 cases reported as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia on histology, cytodiagnosis in 5 was revised from AGC-FN to high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion involving glands. Initial overall cytohistology concordance was 79.7%. Reevaluation of the smears, based on stringent cytomorphological criteria, enhanced overall agreement to 94.59%.
CONCLUSIONS: A diagnosis of AGC has considerable clinical implications. Dissociated atypical cells, nuclear membrane, architecture and chromatin pattern are the key distinguishing features between neoplastic and benign lesions."

STUDY DESIGN: Specimens were collected by mobile units provided by Barretos Cancer Hospital. This report evaluates the manual screening arm of the RODEO study. Of 12,048 women seen between May and December 2010, 6,001 were examined using LBC and 6,047 using CPT.
RESULTS: Comparative (LBC vs. CPT) outcomes were: all abnormal tests, 2.1 versus 1.0%; ASC-US (atypical squamous cells of unknown significance), 0.7 versus 0.1%; ASC-H (atypical squamous cells with possible high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions) and AGC (atypical glandular cells), 0.4 versus 0.3%; LSIL (low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions), 0.7 versus 0.3%; HSIL (high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions), 0.4 versus 0.2%, and unsatisfactory, 0.03 versus 0.08%. The LBC arm detected significantly more lesions (ASC-US+) than CPT (p < 0.001); however, when we divided the diagnoses into two groups, ASC-H- (negative/ASC-US/LSIL) and ASC-H+ (ASC-H/AGC/HSIL), the difference was not statistically important (p = 0.213).
CONCLUSIONS: With inherent difficulties in patient recruitment and patient compliance with cancer screening, best test performance including human papillomavirus test capability are vitally necessary in Brazil's struggle to reduce cervical cancer."
23221373,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23221373/,"AIMS: The present study examined the differences between physicians working in public and private health care in strenuous working environments (presence of occupational hazards, physical violence, and presenteeism) and health behaviours (alcohol consumption, body mass index, and physical activity). In addition, we examined whether gender or age moderated these potential differences.
METHODS: Cross-sectional survey data were compiled on 1422 female and 948 male randomly selected physicians aged 25-65 years from The Finnish Health Care Professionals Study. Logistic regression and linear regression analyses were used with adjustment for gender, age, specialisation status, working time, managerial position, and on-call duty.
RESULTS: Occupational hazards, physical violence, and presenteeism were more commonly reported by physicians working in the public sector than by their counterparts in the private sector. Among physicians aged 50 years or younger, those who worked in the public sector consumed more alcohol than those who worked in the private sector, whereas in those aged 50 or more the reverse was true. In addition, working in the private sector was most strongly associated with lower levels of physical violence in those who were older than 50 years, and with lower levels of presenteeism among those aged 40-50 years.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study found evidence for the public sector being a more strenuous work environment for physicians than the private sector. Our results suggest that public healthcare organisations should pay more attention to the working conditions of their employees."
23221377,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23221377/,"BACKGROUND: The lack of consensus amongst experts delineate how important it is for patients diagnosed with prostate cancer (PCa) to make an informed decision on available treatment options through an objective discussion of the risks and benefits. One of important benefits could be seen as patient's quality of life (QoL) after treatment. We aimed to assess QoL differences in prostate cancer patients by stage and treatment for a population-based sample.
METHODS: The cross-sectional PCa patient population-based national level study for a prostate cancer patient population was performed. QoL was investigated with EORTC QLQ-C30. The analysis includes descriptive statistics and evaluation of differences in functional and symptom scales by stage and treatment group by predictors in the model.
RESULTS: Response rate was 79.1% (N=514). The highest QoL scores were observed in localised PCa, active surveillance treatment group. The lowest scores were observed in advanced stages, chemotherapy treatment group. Between cancer stages, statistically significant differences were observed only in scales of emotional functioning (p<0.001) and social functioning (p<0.001). Between treatment groups, statistically significant differences were observed in scales of physical functioning (p<0.001), role functioning (p<0.001), emotional functioning (p<0.001), and social functioning (p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlighted statistically significant differences in QoL between cancer stages and treatment. Understanding how the QoL changes in relation with the selected treatment option can be important to the urologist and individual patient to have realistic expectations as well as to optimise treatment decisions for the prostate cancer patient when exist several alternatives."
23221424,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23221424/,"AIM: To examine the correlation between T3 and resting energy expenditure (REE) in adolescent patients with eating disorders (ED) to assess whether T3 can be used to predict metabolic rate suppression and recovery.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed on patients with ED (Anorexia Nervosa [AN], Bulimia Nervosa [BN], and Eating Disorder NOS [EDNOS]), aged 11-22 years, who had T3 and REE measured within 1 month (N=38 AN, 32 BN/EDNOS). REE was measured by indirect calorimetry (IC) and represented as the percentage of expected REE (%EREE) predicted by the Harris-Benedict equation. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to examine the relationship between T3 and %EREE and how each correlates with anthropometric data, laboratory values, and diagnosis.
RESULTS: T3 was significantly correlated with %EREE in the AN group but not in the total population or BN/EDNOS group. In the total study population, T3 alone correlated significantly with weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), BMI percentile, %Ideal Body Weight (%IBW), %Maximum Weight Lost (%MWL), LH, and estradiol. In the AN group, T3 and %EREE both correlated with BMI, BMI percentile, LH, and estradiol; however, only T3 correlated with %IBW and %MWL. In the BN/EDNOS group, T3 correlated with BMI, BMI percentile, %IBW, and estradiol while %EREE correlated with none.
CONCLUSION: In patients with AN, T3 correlated significantly with markers of malnutrition and %EREE and may serve as a surrogate measure when IC is unavailable. Following T3 during treatment of AN may assist clinicians in assessing metabolic suppression and recovery and help guide caloric prescriptions and goal weights."
23221449,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23221449/,"UNLABELLED: The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality has defined pressure ulcers (PUs) an important patient safety indicator (#3). Despite the existence of evidence-based guidelines for PU prevention and treatment from the United States Department of Health and Human Services, the sustained success in reducing the development of PUs is elusive in many acute care hospitals.
PURPOSE: The specific aim of the study was to determine whether the implementation of an early standardized process for mobility could reduce or eliminate the development of PUs in a surgical intensive care unit.
METHODS: Patient data were collected pre- and postimplementation of the early mobility protocol.
RESULTS: The mobility compliance for patients postimplementation was 71.30% (SD = 12.73), with a range of 25% to 100%. A χ² test for independence (with Yates continuity correction) indicated a significant association between unit-acquired PUs and the pre- and postimplementation mobility groups (χ²(1,1051) = 6.86, P = .009). Specifically, patients in the intervention group had significantly more unit-acquired PUs than the control group. No significant differences were identified between the 2 groups.
IMPLICATIONS/CONCLUSIONS: Despite implementation of the early mobility protocol, we did not see an improvement in the PU rate overall or with time as protocol compliance improved."
23221602,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23221602/,"OBJECTIVE: This study examined the prognostic significance of copper-transporting P-type adenosine triphosphatase (ATP7B) expression in patients with ovarian carcinoma treated with platinum-taxane combination chemotherapy.
METHODS: Expression of ATP7B in ovarian carcinoma was assessed by immunohistochemistry and clinical data collected by retrospective review of medical charts.
RESULTS: Overexpression of ATP7B was identified in 25 (29.1%) of 86 ovarian carcinomas. The frequency of ATP7B expression in clear cell carcinomas was significantly higher than that in serous high-grade carcinomas (P < 0.05). We observed no statistically significant correlations between high ATP7B protein expression and either disease-free survival (P = 0.722) or overall survival (P = 0.389).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first to demonstrate a lack of statistically significant differences between ATP7B positive and negative cases with respect to prognosis of patients with ovarian carcinoma treated with a platinum-taxane combination regimen. However, that ATP7B expression in clear cell carcinomas was significantly higher than that in serous carcinomas may partially explain the difference in chemotherapeutic response and prognosis between patients with these 2 types of carcinomas."
23221737,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23221737/,"OBJECTIVE: To assess whether psychiatrists in the community operate to a sub-typing model of mood disorders when choosing psychotropic medications.
METHOD: Patients assessed through the Black Dog Institute depression clinic provided information on their previously prescribed and current medications, on how effective they found them and whether they had to be ceased due to side-effects. The prevalence of each medication trialled was analysed according to diagnosis (bipolar I, bipolar II, unipolar melancholic depression or unipolar non-melancholic depression).
RESULTS: Analyses indicate that psychiatrists prescribe medications differentially in line with diagnosis. This effect was found in both previously prescribed and currently prescribed medications, and was most distinct for mood stabiliser and antipsychotic medications. Several medications, in contrast, appeared to have been trialled by the majority of patients, regardless of diagnosis. Analyses of effectiveness and cessation due to side-effects were compromised by small sub-sample sizes.
CONCLUSIONS: Psychiatrists in the community appear to operate to a sub-typing model of mood disorders, preferentially prescribing many medications according to mood disorder sub-type."
23221948,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23221948/,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Pretherapeutic determination of tumor grade and genotype in grade II and III oligodendroglial tumors is clinically important but is still challenging. Tumor grade and 1p/19q status are currently the 2 most important factors in therapeutic decision making for patients with these tumors. Histopathology and cMRI studies are still limited in some cases. In the present study, we were interested in determining whether the combination of PWI, DWI, and MR spectroscopy could help distinguish oligodendroglial tumors according to their histopathologic grade and genotype.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 50 adult patients with grade II and III oligodendrogliomas and oligoastrocytomas who had DWI, PWI, and MR spectroscopy at short and long TE data and known 1p/19q status. Univariate analyses and multivariate random forest models were performed to determine which criteria could differentiate between grades and genotypes.
RESULTS: ADC, rCBV, rCBF, and rK2 were significantly different between grade II and III oligodendroglial tumors. DWI, PWI, and MR spectroscopy showed no significant difference between tumors with and without 1p/19q loss. Separation between tumor grades and genotypes with cMRI alone showed 31% and 48% misclassification rates, respectively. Multimodal MR imaging helps to determine tumor grade and 1p/19q genotype more accurately (misclassification rates of 17% and 40%, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Although multimodal investigation of oligodendroglial tumors has a lower contribution to 1p/19q genotyping compared with cMRI alone, it greatly improves the accuracy of grading of these neoplasms. Use of multimodal MR imaging could thus provide valuable information that may assist clinicians in patient preoperative management and treatment decision making."
23221974,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23221974/,"BACKGROUND: Major depression is associated with evidence for metabolic and redox imbalance and also with reports of lower serum levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). However, the relationship between these factors has not been well studied.
METHODS: We studied the contribution of physiological risk factors to cardiometabolic health in 200 adult male and female black Africans, aged between 36 and 52 years, presenting with (n = 89) and without (n = 111) symptoms of depression. Specifically the association between serum BDNF and markers of basal metabolic and redox status in depressed versus nondepressed individuals were analyzed.
RESULTS: BDNF and markers of redox and metabolic status were not associated with the symptoms of depression. Waist circumference, a metabolic risk factor, was positively associated with BDNF and accounts for 49% of the variance in BDNF in depressed men. Reduced and oxidized glutathione were positively and negatively correlated with BDNF in depressed women, respectively, with glutathione redox status accounting for 36-42% of the variance in BDNF.
CONCLUSION: Selected metabolic and redox factors explained gender-specific variances in serum BDNF levels in depressed African men and women. Our findings suggest that changes in redox and metabolic status may represent counterregulation by BDNF or alternatively that BDNF may mediate undesirable redox and metabolic changes that are associated with the development of a mood disorder."
23222275,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23222275/,"BACKGROUND: A multimodality approach for locally recurrent colorectal cancer in the pelvis provides a significant survival advantage when negative margins are achieved. However, outcomes of surgical resection in patients who have locally re-recurrent disease in the pelvis are not well studied. Our aim was to assess the safety, feasibility of a negative margin resection, and survival outcomes in patients with pelvic locally re-recurrent colorectal cancer.
DESIGN: A retrospective review identified 406 patients who underwent surgery for locally recurrent colorectal cancer between 1997 and 2007. Patients who had locally re-recurrent disease in the pelvis who underwent curative-intent resection were identified.
RESULTS: Forty-seven patients (31 male) were identified. Median age was 57 years (range, 30-84 years). Median time to re-recurrence was 2.4 years (range, 0.5-5.6 years). Margin status following re-resection was R0 60%, R1 32%, and R2 8%. Nonbowel organs were resected en bloc in 81%, including 7 sacral resections. Intraoperative radiation was given to 77%. Morbidity occurred in 42%, with 6% requiring reoperation for complications. Thirty-day mortality was nil. Overall survival at 2 and 5 years was 83% and 33%. Disease-free survival at 2 and 5 years was 55% and 27%. Five-year survival for patients who had R0 and R1 resections was 37% and 42%, whereas no patients having an R2 resection survived beyond 2 years (p = 0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: In highly selected patients with re-recurrent colorectal cancer in the pelvis, we found that surgery could be performed safely and that a curative (R0) resection was possible in more than 50%. Two- and 5-year survival rates are comparable to results seen when surgery is done for first-time recurrences."
23222277,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23222277/,"BACKGROUND: There is no consensus in the literature as to whether all patients who undergo anterior resection of the rectum with total mesorectal excision should have a defunctioning stoma or only those at high risk of anastomotic dehiscence.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the results of placing a removable Silastic band around the ileum during the abdominal phase to exteriorize it and create a loop ileostomy postoperatively without the need for laparotomy in case of an anastomotic complication. This approach is known as ""ghost ileostomy.""
INTERVENTIONS: A vascular loop was passed around the terminal ileum through a window adjacent to the ileal wall. The loop was then exteriorized, through the abdominal wall, without tension, and secured to the skin on a rod. Two 24F Silastic drains were placed next to the anastomosis (anteriorly and posteriorly).
PATIENTS: From May 1997 to May 2011, 168 patients underwent anterior resection of the rectum with total mesorectal excision plus ghost ileostomy.
RESULTS: Symptomatic anastomotic dehiscence was observed in 20 of 168 patients (11.96%) and developed on postoperative days 4 to 12 (median, postoperative day 7). In 13 of 20 cases, an ileostomy was fashioned with the patient under local anesthesia, and there was no need for relaparotomy. In 5 of 20 cases, the complication resolved with conservative management. In 2 of 20 cases, the patient's clinical condition rapidly deteriorated, generalized peritonitis developed, and surgical reintervention with abdominal toilette and colostomy was required.
CONCLUSIONS: Ghost ileostomy allows selective loop ileostomy formation after low anterior resection of the rectum without the need for laparotomy in most cases. However, the technique should be reserved for instances in which the risk of leak is relatively low, such as anastomoses performed in the absence of neoadjuvant therapy. The role of routine ghost ileostomy following higher-risk anastomoses remains to be determined."
23222545,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23222545/,"INTRODUCTION: Basic invasive procedural skills are traditionally taught during clerkships. Using simulation to teach invasive skills provides students the opportunity to practice in a structured environment without risking patient safety. We surveyed incoming interns at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital to assess the prevalence of simulation training for invasive and semi-invasive procedural skills during medical school.
METHODS: From 2008 to 2010, we surveyed 357 incoming interns at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital. The questionnaire asked incoming interns if they received formal instruction or procedural training with or without a simulation component for 34 procedures during medical school. Interns indicated their number of attempts and successes for each procedure in clinical care.
RESULTS: All 357 incoming interns completed the survey. Experience in 28 procedures is reported in this article. For all but three basic procedures, more than 75% of interns received formal didactic instruction. Only 3 advanced procedures were formally taught to most interns. The prevalence of simulation training for the basic and advanced procedures was 46% and 23%, respectively. For the basic procedures, the average number of attempts and successes was 6.5 (range, 0-13.9) and 6.2 (range, 0-13.4), respectively. For the advanced procedures, the average number of attempts and successes was 1.5 (range, 0-4.8) and 1.3 (range, 0-4.7), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Although most medical students receive formal instruction in basic procedures, fewer receive formal instruction in advanced procedures. The use of simulation to complement this training occurs less often. Simulation training should be increased in undergraduate medical education and integrated into graduate medical education."
23222948,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23222948/,"BACKGROUND: In developing countries undergoing rapid economic development, the number of dual burden households (i.e. co-existing overweight/obesity and stunting) is increasing. While intestinal parasites are prevalent in these countries, their contribution to dual burden households has so far been neglected. We studied the association between intestinal parasite infection and belonging to a dual burden household in a rural community of Venezuela.
METHODS: We examined 225 individuals. A dual burden household was defined as a household with at least one overweight/obese adult (BMI > 25) and at least one stunted child (height -for-age z score <-2). Intestinal parasite (Giardia lamblia and geohelminth) infection was determined by faecal smears.
RESULTS: In this community, 47.3% of the individuals were infected with intestinal parasites. Among adults, 65.2% were overweight/obese and 13.8% of the children were stunted. More than one in four households (26.8%) were dual burden households. Being infected with G. lamblia & geohelminths was significantly associated with being in a dual burden household (OR = 4.75, 95% CI: 1.01-22.20, n = 188), indicating a triple burden of disease in this community in Venezuela.
CONCLUSION: While the relationship between intestinal parasite infection and stunting has been well established, these results indicate a need to further explore the association of intestinal parasite infection with dual burden households."
23222961,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23222961/,"OBJECTIVE: This study was performed to investigate the vascular structures of the cochlea that are potentially vulnerable to mechanical trauma during cochlear implant surgery.
BACKGROUND: Despite improvements in surgical technique and electrode design, residual hearing is lost in a significant percentage of cochlear implant patients. Although a variety of factors may contribute, it is widely believed that mechanical trauma plays an important role. This study focused on the vasculature of scala tympani and its potential susceptibility to injury during implant surgery.
METHODS: Anatomic study of normal human temporal bones prepared by either conventional cross sectioning or by microdissection for examination by light or scanning electron microscopy.
RESULTS: Blood vessels located at or near the perilymphatic surface of scala tympani are predominately of the venous type, and they are situated so as to be at risk for trauma during implantation. Those vessels include veins on the lateral wall and floor of scala tympani, the modiolar wall and the undersurface of the osseous lamina and basilar membrane.
CONCLUSION: Injury or occlusion of blood vessels associated with scala tympani may adversely affect inner ear function, potentially contributing to hearing loss following cochlear implantation."
23223220,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23223220/,"BACKGROUND: The evaluation of the peritoneal transport characteristics is mandatory in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. This is usually performed in routine clinical practice with a peritoneal equilibration test (PET) using conventional dialysates, with low pH and high glucose degradation product (GDP) concentrations. An increasing proportion of patients are now treated with biocompatible dialysates, i.e. with physiological pH and lower GDP concentrations. This questions the appropriateness to perform a PET with conventional solutions in those patients. The aim of our study is to compare the results of the PET using biocompatible and conventional dialysates, respectively.
METHODS: Nineteen stable PD patients (13 males, 6 females; mean age: 67.95±2.36 years, mean body surface area: 1.83±0.04 m2, dialysis vintage: 2.95±0.19 years) were included, among which 10 were usually treated with biocompatible and 9 with conventional solutions. Two PETs were performed, within a 2-week interval, in each patient. PET sequence (conventional solution first or biocompatible solution first) was randomized in order to avoid 'time bias'. Small (urea, creatinine and glucose), middle (beta-2-microglobulin) and large molecules' (albumin and alpha-2-macroglobulin) dialysate/plasma (D/P) concentration ratios and clearances were measured during each PET. Ultrafiltration (UF) and sodium filtration were also recorded. Results of both tests were compared by the Wilcoxon paired test.
RESULTS: No statistical difference was found between both dialysates for small molecule transport rates or for sodium filtration and UF. However, a few patients were not similarly classified for small-solute transport characteristics within the PET categories. Beta-2-microglobulin and albumin D/P ratios at different time points of the PET were significantly higher with the biocompatible, when compared with the conventional, solutions: 0.10±0.03 versus 0.08±0.02 (P<0.01) and 0.008±0.003 versus 0.007±0.003 (P=0.01), respectively. A similar difference was also observed for beta-2-microglobulin that was higher with biocompatible dialysates (1.04±0.32 versus 0.93±0.32 mL/min, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Peritoneal transport of water and small solutes is independent of the type of dialysate which is used. This is not the case for the transport of beta-2-microglobulin and albumin that is higher under biocompatible dialysates. Vascular tonus modification could potentially explain such differences. The PET should therefore always be carried out with the same dialysate to make longitudinal comparisons possible."

METHODS: Solitary M2 occlusions were identified from the Prolyse in Acute Cerebral Thromboembolism-II database. Primary endpoints were successful angiographic reperfusion (TICI 2-3) at 120 minutes and functional independence (mRS 0-2) at 90 days.
RESULTS: Forty-four patients with solitary M2 occlusions, 30 in the treatment arm and 14 in the control arm, were identified. Successful reperfusion (TICI 2-3) was achieved in 53.6% and 16.7% of patients in the treatment and control arms, respectively (P=0.04). A favorable clinical outcome (mRS 0-2) was observed in 53.3% and 28.6%, respectively (P=0.19). Baseline characteristics were similar between the 2 groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Intra-arterial thrombolysis may lead to a 3-fold increase in the rate of early reperfusion of solitary M2 occlusions and could potentially double the chance of a favorable functional outcome at 90 days.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Non-contrast abdominopelvic MRI was performed at the radiology department in 16 suspected body packers that were brought to our hospital, and 13 of them were diagnosed with body packing. We evaluated the presence, location, and shapes of packets as well as signal characteristics on T1- and T2-weighted images.
RESULTS: We came across two types of packets: those containing solid substances (10 cases) and those filled with liquid cocaine (3 cases). Both types were accurately diagnosed with the help of MRI. Only 1 suspected body packer received a false positive diagnosis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cohort study included full-mouth periapical radiographs of 161 subjects, including 66 current smokers, 28 former smokers and 67 [corrected] individuals who had never smoked. The periapical region of all teeth was radiographically evaluated using the Periapical Index (PAI) score. Generalised linear mixed-effects models using the logit link were performed.
RESULTS: The frequency of apical periodontitis differed based on gender and smoking status. Current male cigarette smokers with <10 or ≥10 pack years showed frequencies of apical periodontitis of 7.9 % and 7.5 %, [corrceted] respectively, compared to 4.1 % [corrected] in individuals who had never smoked. The corresponding data for female smokers were 5.8 % and 7.4 % [corrected] in smokers with <10 or ≥10 pack years, respectively, versus 5.2 % in individuals who had never smoked. The factors ""prevalent coronal restoration"" (p < 0.001), ""prevalent root canal treatment"" (p < 0.001) and ""quality of root canal filling"" (p < 0.001) were significant predictors for apical periodontitis. After adjustment for quality of root canal filling cigarette smoking was not associated with apical periodontitis in current female and male smokers with <10 or ≥10 pack years (p > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Smoking status did not predict apical periodontitis in females and males in this sample group.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: With respect to quality of root canal filling, tobacco use may not be a significant predictor for apical periodontitis."

In light of the current discussion on the role of ablative therapy, the aim of this study is to compare patients who undergo hepatic resection to those treated with radiofrequency ablation.
METHODS: The procedures have been conducted in two institutes following the same methodologies. Ninety-six patients with Child-Pugh class A cirrhosis, single or multinodular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and a diameter less than or equal to 3 cm, have been included in this retrospective study: 52 patients have been treated by surgical resection and 44 by radiofrequency ablation. Patient characteristics, survival and disease-free survival have all been analysed.
RESULTS: Disease-free survival was longer in the resection group in comparison to the radiofrequency group with a median disease-free time of 48 versus 34 months, respectively (P = 0.04, hazard ratio = 1.5, 95 % confidence interval = 0.9-2.5). In the resection group, median survival was 54 months with a survival rate at 1, 3 and 5 years of 100, 98 and 46.2 %. In the radiofrequency group, median survival was 40 months with 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rate of 95.5, 68.2 and 36.4 %.
CONCLUSION: The current study shows that for small HCC in the presence of compensated cirrhosis, surgical resection gives better results than radiofrequency, both in terms of overall survival, as well as disease-free survival. Further evidence is required to clarify the role of ablative therapy as a curative treatment and whether it can replace surgery."
23224577,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23224577/,"BACKGROUND: Elective temporary clipping (ETC) is increasingly used in surgery for aneurysms. This study was to assess whether the impact of ETC on intraoperative aneurysmal rupture (IAR) translates into neurological outcome.
METHODS: Patients who underwent surgery for ruptured anterior circulation aneurysms were prospectively studied for various factors related to ETC, IAR and neurological outcome at 3 months. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using SPSS20.
RESULTS: Of the total 273 ruptured aneurysm surgeries studied, IAR was observed in only six out of 132 aneurysms (4.5 %) who had ETC, compared with 78 out of 141 (55.3 %) without ETC (p < 0.001). Aneurysms complicated by IAR had significantly longer clipping time (8.3 min) compared with those without IAR (1.9 min) (p < 0.001). IAR had significant association with unfavorable outcome (38 % vs. 24 %) (p = 0.02). Patients with ETC had significantly shorter clipping time (2.9 min) compared with those without ETC (4.8 min) (p = 0.02). Unfavorable outcome was noted in 30 out of 132 with ETC (23 %), compared with 48 out of 141 without ETC (34 %) (p = 0.04). This beneficial effect was nonsignificantly greater in younger and good clinical grade patients. While episodes of ETC within clipping time of 20 min did not show significant difference in outcome, repeated rescue clipping (45 % unfavorable outcome, p = 0.048) and total clipping time of at least 20 min (75 % unfavorable outcome, p = 0.008) had significant impact on outcome. In multivariate analysis, the use of ETC (p = 0.027) and total temporary clipping less than 20 min (p = 0.049) were noted to result in significantly better outcome, independent of other factors.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of ETC decreased the occurrence of IAR and the total clipping time, thereby leading to significantly better outcome, independent of other factors. While repeated elective clipping within total clipping time of 20 min did not influence outcome, repeated rescue clipping and total clipping time of at least 20 min had significant impact on outcome."
23224699,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23224699/,"PURPOSE: To determine whether maternal serum placental growth factor (PlGF) is more effective as a biomarker in predicting the occurrence of early onset preeclampsia in first trimester or early second trimester of pregnancy.
METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted on women with singleton pregnancies, screened from the antenatal clinic. Serum PlGF estimation was done at 11-14 weeks of gestation on 1,244 women and at 22-24 weeks of gestation on 1,206 women from the initial study population. A cut-off value of <228 pg/ml for serum PlGF at 11-14 weeks of gestation and <144 pg/ml for serum PlGF at 22-24 weeks of gestation were determined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis for identifying pregnant women at risk of developing early onset preeclampsia (<32 weeks of gestation). Univariate logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the association between serum PlGF < 228 pg/ml at 11-14 weeks of gestation and <144 pg/ml at 22-24 weeks of gestation with the occurrence of early onset preeclampsia and odds ratio (OR) was computed. P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant in this study.
RESULTS: Maternal serum PlGF <144 pg/ml at 22-24 weeks of gestation had a stronger association (OR 18.83; 95 % CI 12.08-22.24; p = 0.000) than serum PlGF <228 pg/ml at 11-14 weeks of gestation (OR 2.76; 95 % CI 1.29-3.94; p = 0.007) with the occurrence of early onset preeclampsia. The sensitivity and specificity of serum PlGF <144 pg/ml at 22-24 weeks of gestation (84 and 78, respectively) were much higher than those of serum PlGF <228 pg/ml at 11-14 weeks of gestation (58 and 66, respectively) in predicting early onset preeclampsia.
CONCLUSION: Maternal serum PlGF may be more effective as a biomarker in early second trimester than in first trimester of pregnancy, in predicting the occurrence of early onset preeclampsia."
23224921,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23224921/,"BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in the presence of the left bundle branch block (LBBB) is difficult. In our study we compared commonly used ECG criteria with left ventricular mass index (LVMI) calculated during cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) to verify their clinical value or the need to recalibrate.
METHODS: CMRI and ECG data of 36 patients were included in this study. Based on the ECG measures we used in our study selected ECG criteria for LVH detection in cases with LBBB: QRS duration, amplitude of S waves in V1, V2, V3; R waves in aVL, V5, V6 and combinations of amplitudes. LVH was defined as LVMI (CMRI) exceeding reference values.
RESULTS: LVH was diagnosed in 17 (47%) patients (6 women and 11 men). Following ECG parameters correlated the most prominently with LVMI - RV5: r = 0.5 (p = 0.002), RV6: r = 0.61 (p = 0.0001), SV1+RV5, 6: r = 0.64 (p = 0.001), RaVL+SV3: r = 0.5 (p = 0.002), SV2+RV5, 6: r = 0.71 (p = 0.0001), SV2, 3+RV5, 6: r = 0.75 (p = 0.0001). Based on the results of ROC analysis we proposed new cut points for LVH parameters. The highest diagnostic accuracy achieved S2+SV3 〉 6 mV, SV2,V3+RV5,V6 〉 4 mV, RaVL+SV3 〉 3.5 mV (86-89%).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with LBBB the ECG parameters based on the amplitude of S wave in V2 or V3 and R wave in the leads aVL, V5, V6 have the highest clinical value in the prediction of the LVH determined by CMRI. It was necessary to recalibrate these parameters and it is needed to verify them in larger number of LBBB patients."
23225109,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23225109/,"INTRODUCTION: Established systems for grading postoperative complications do not change the assigned grade when multiple interventions or readmissions are required to manage a complication. Studies using these systems may misrepresent outcomes for the surgical procedures being evaluated. We define a quality outcome for distal pancreatectomy (DP) and use this metric to compare laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy (LDP) to open distal pancreatectomy (ODP).
METHODS: Records for patients undergoing DP between January 2006 and December 2009 were reviewed. Clavien-Dindo grade IIIb, IV, and V complications were classified as severe adverse--poor quality--postoperative outcomes (SAPOs). II and IIIa complications requiring either significantly prolonged overall lengths of stay including readmissions within 90 days or more than one invasive intervention were also classified as SAPOs.
RESULTS: By Clavien-Dindo system alone, 91 % of DP patients had either no complication or a low/moderate grade (I, II, IIIa) complication. Using our reclassification, however, 25 % had a SAPO. Patients undergoing LDP demonstrated a Clavien-Dindo complication profile identical to that for SDP but demonstrated significantly shorter overall lengths of stay, were less likely to require perioperative transfusion, and less likely to have a SAPO.
CONCLUSIONS: Established systems undergrade the severity of some complications following DP. Using a procedure-specific metric for quality, we demonstrate that LDP affords a higher quality postoperative outcome than ODP."
23225122,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23225122/,"OBJECTIVE: The effects of valproate on male reproductive hormones have been studied in epileptic patients and animals, but the results are inconsistent because reproductive hormone abnormalities may be independent of the use of valproate and may be due to epilepsy itself. The aim of this study was to determine if there is an association between valproate and reproductive abnormalities in men with bipolar disorder or if the association is unique to men with epilepsy.
MATERIALS AND METHOD: The study included 39 male patients aged 18-50 years with a DSM-IV diagnosis of bipolar disorder (21 on lithium monotherapy and 18 on valproate monotherapy or valproate in combination with lithium therapy) and 15 male epilepsy patients on valproate monotherapy that were evaluated in terms of reproductive hormones.
RESULTS: Duration of illness, duration of lithium and valproate therapy, daily dose and serum concentrations of lithium and valproate, duration of marriage, spouse's gravidity, the serum estradiol, luteinizing hormone, sex hormone-binding globulin, and free testosterone levels, and the free testosterone:luteinizing hormone ratio were not significantly different between the groups. Serum prolactin and follicle-stimulating hormone levels were significantly higher in the epilepsy patients than in the bipolar disorder patients on lithium monotherapy.
CONCLUSION: The findings show that valproate did not have a negative effect on male reproductive hormones in the bipolar patients. The elevated prolactin and follicle-stimulating hormone levels observed in the epilepsy group should be attributed to epilepsy. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study to compare reproductive hormones in bipolar disorder and epilepsy patients on valproate therapy."
23225209,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23225209/,"PURPOSE: Before elective operations, particularly orthopaedic surgery, national guidelines in Germany recommend testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus through a needlestick or cutting injury. Such testing is expensive. The number of new and unknown diagnoses of viral infections that can be detected by routine screening has not yet been evaluated.
METHODS: The aim of our department of orthopaedic surgery is to screen every adult patient listed for an operation for HBV, HCV and HIV. We retrospectively analysed the number of operations in this single centre from 2001 to 2010, correlated this number with the total number of screens and calculated the number of newly diagnosed infections. An additional cost:benefit ratio was calculated.
RESULTS: A total of 20,869 operations were performed by the department between 2001 and 2010. After exclusion of all interventions in children and all patients who had multiple operations, 15,482 patients remained. Test results were found for 10,011 of these patients during this period (screening rate 65 %). Of those screened, in only four cases (0.4 ‰) was a previously unknown infection detected.
CONCLUSIONS: Two-thirds of the patients included in our study actually underwent screening; this rate was lower than expected. The incidence of newly detected infections was low, putting the benefit of a routine preoperative screening for HBV, HCV and HIV into question. From an economic point of view the low detection rate is a strong argument in favour of omitting routine preoperative screening. Screening only those patients with risk factors may be as safe as screening every patient and would help reduce costs."
23225252,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23225252/,"OBJECTIVE: All pregnant women in Denmark are offered risk assessment for Down syndrome. The aim of this study was to investigate whether women and partners make an informed choice about first trimester risk assessment, and their satisfaction with the choice.
METHODS: A survey using multiple measure of informed choice at 12 weeks and decision regret scale at 30 weeks, among pregnant women and partners, planning to deliver at Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet.
RESULTS: Five hundred thirty-one women (99.6%) out of 534 women chose to have risk assessment. Most women and men had high degree of knowledge (82% and 81%) and positive attitudes regarding risk assessment (97% and 98%), leading to 79% and 80% making an informed choice. Education predicted knowledge for women (odds ratio 3.42; 95% confidence interval 1.63-7.18) and partners (odds ratio 2.97; 95% confidence interval 1.37-6.45), country of origin predicted knowledge, attitude and informed choice among women. Three hundred thirty-two women (99%) and all partners were satisfied with having chosen risk assessment.
CONCLUSIONS: Although 80% of pregnant women and partners make an informed choice about undergoing first trimester risk assessment for Down syndrome, as many as 20% do not. At 30 weeks nearly all women and partners were satisfied to have had a risk assessment performed."
23225281,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23225281/,"UNLABELLED: The prevalence of secondary contributors to osteoporosis in our population of SE Asian patients is high. Though various low thresholds Z score values have been proposed as suggestive of a high likelihood of secondary osteoporosis, they appear to have only limited discriminatory value in identifying a secondary cause.
INTRODUCTION: Many patients with osteoporosis have significant secondary contributors towards their bone loss. The sensitivity and diagnostic utility of using Z score thresholds to screen for secondary osteoporosis have not yet been convincingly demonstrated nor has there been any previous attempt to estimate the prevalence of secondary osteoporosis in South East Asia. We aimed to study the prevalence of commonly recognized contributors and to determine the discriminatory ability of Z score thresholds in screening for them in Singaporean men and post-menopausal women with osteoporosis.
METHOD: Three hundred thirty-two consecutive patients seen at the osteoporosis clinic of the largest hospital in Singapore were evaluated. The frequencies of the different contributors were determined and sensitivities, specificities, and positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) of pre-specified Z score cut-off values calculated.
RESULTS: Vitamin D deficiency was present in 18.5% of the patients, hyperthyroidism in 10.11%, primary hyperparathyroidism in 1%, secondary hyperparathyroidism in 6%, hypercalciuria in 21.63%, glucocorticoid use in 8.43%, and hypogonadism in 9.4% of males. A Z score value of <-1 had a sensitivity of 71.7 % and NPV of 66.2 % in identifying the presence of a secondary contributor in post-menopausal women. The sensitivity and NPV of a similar threshold in men was 59.1 and 40 %, respectively. ROC curves used to investigate various Z score diagnostic thresholds for sensitivity and specificity showed that they provided poor predictive value for the presence of secondary osteoporosis.
CONCLUSION: Secondary contributors are common in our patients with osteoporosis. Z score diagnostic thresholds have only limited value in discriminating between primary and secondary osteoporosis."
23225531,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23225531/,"BACKGROUND: Type 1 diabetes is a serious disease which, in spite of intensive treatment, causes serious complications and increased mortality. The incidence is increasing, but the aetiology is unknown. As part of modern lifestyle, increased hygiene has been suspected as one contributing cause but so far there is no evidence. Several large epidemiological studies, mainly restricted to children with increased genetic risk for type 1 diabetes, have so far given no clue.
METHODS: All Babies in Southeast Sweden is unique in its design as it has followed an unselected group of children from birth 1997-1999 and onwards with regular follow-ups. This report is based on questionnaires from initially 16 051 children of whom 80 have later on developed type 1 diabetes. The parents answered questionnaires at the birth of their child and then after 1, 2-3, 5-6 and 8 years. A number of parameters possibly related to hygiene were analysed with several statistical methods, both with univariate and in regression models.
RESULTS: Our study cannot identify any crucial environmental factor. This indicates that hygiene-related parameters traditionally regarded as part of 'modern life style' do not play any important role for the aetiology of type 1 diabetes.
CONCLUSIONS: There is no reason to recommend a change of that part of our lifestyle. We find weak associations to previous gastrointestinal infections, which gives a hint that development of type 1 diabetes may be related to problems in the gut and maybe one should look closer into the microbes living in the gut."

METHODS: The GLOBE study sent postal questionnaires to individuals in The Netherlands in 1991 resulting in 18 973 respondents (response 70%). Questions were asked on education, health and health-related behaviours. Participants were linked for cancer diagnosis (1991-2008), comorbidity and survival (up to 2010) with the population-based Eindhoven Cancer Registry; 1127 tumours were included in the analyses.
RESULTS: 5-year crude survival was best in highly educated patients as compared with low educated patients for all cancers combined: 49% versus 32% in male subjects (log rank: p<0.0001), 65% versus 49% in female subjects (p=0.0001). Compared with highly educated, low educated prostate cancer patients had an increased risk of death (HR 2.9 (95% CI 1.7 to 5.1), adjusted for age, stage and year). No or inconsistent associations between educational level and risk of death were seen in multivariable analyses for breast, colon and non-small cell lung cancer. Although survival in prostate cancer patients was affected by comorbidities (HR2_vs_0_comorbidities: 2.6 (1.5 to 4.4)), physical activity (HRno/little_vs__moderate_physical__activity: 2.0 (1.2 to 3.4)) and smoking (HRcurrent_vs_never_smokers: 2.6 (1.0-6.8)), these did not contribute to educational inequalities in prostate cancer survival (HRlow_vs_high_education: 3.1 (1.6 to 5.8) with adjustment for comorbidity and lifestyle).
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with low educated, highly educated prostate cancer patients had better survival. Although presence of comorbidities, physical activity levels and smoking status affected survival from prostate cancer, these did not contribute to educational inequalities in survival. The role of other factors for inequalities in cancer survival needs to be explored."
23225809,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23225809/,"PURPOSE: Circumferential resection margin (CRM) involvement is a well-known predictor for poor prognosis in rectal cancer. However, the significance is controversial in some studies. Accordingly, this study attempted to examine the prognostic impact of CRM involvement in stage III rectal cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between January 1990 and December 2007, a total of 449 patients who underwent curative resection followed by complete adjuvant chemoradiotherapy for stage III rectal cancer located within 12 cm from the anal verge were selected. Patients were divided into a CRM-positive group (n=79, 17.6%) and a CRM-negative group (n=370, 82.4%).
RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 56.6 months, recurrent disease was seen in 53.2 and 43.5% of the CRM-positive and CRM-negative group, respectively. CRM involvement was an independent prognostic factor for 5-year systemic recurrence-free survival (HR: 1.5, CI: 1.0-2.2, p=0.017). However, no significant difference was observed for local recurrence rate between the two groups (13.0 and 13.5%, respectively, p=0.677).
CONCLUSION: In this study, local recurrence rate did not differ according to CRM involvement status in stage III rectal cancer patients, although CRM involvement was shown to be an independent poor prognostic factor. Accordingly, validation of the results of this study by further large prospective randomized trials is warranted."
23227160,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23227160/,"INTRODUCTION: Previous reviews have demonstrated that patient outcomes following orthopaedic surgery are strongly influenced by the presence of Workers' Compensation. However, the variability in the reviews' methodology may have inflated the estimated strength of this association. The main objective of this meta-analysis is to evaluate the influence of Workers' Compensation on the outcomes of orthopaedic surgical procedures.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of the literature published in this area from 1992-2012, with no language restrictions. The following databases were used MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), CINAHL, Google Scholar, LILACS and Pubmed. We also hand-searched the reference sections of all selected papers. We included all prospective studies evaluating the effect of compensation status on outcomes in adult patients who had undergone surgery due to orthopaedic conditions or diseases. Outcomes of interest included disease specific, region specific and/or overall quality of life scales/questionnaires and surgeons' personal judgment of the results. We used an assessment tool to appraise the quality of all included studies. We used Review Manager to create forest plots to summarize study data and funnel plots for the assessment of publication bias.
RESULTS: Twenty studies met our eligibility criteria. The overall risk ratio for experiencing an unsatisfactory result after orthopaedic surgery for patients with compensation compared to non-compensated patients is 2.08 (95% CI 1.54-2.82). A similar association was shown for continuous data extracted from the studies using assessment scales or questionnaires (Standard Mean Difference = -0.70 95% CI -0.97- -0.43).
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients who undergo orthopaedic surgical procedures, those receiving Workers' Compensation experience a two-fold greater risk of a negative outcome. Our findings show a considerably lower estimate of risk compared to previous reviews that include retrospective data. Further research is warranted to determine the etiological explanation for the influence of compensation status on patient outcomes. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42012002121."
23227230,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23227230/,"BACKGROUND: Each follow-up during the course of tuberculosis treatment currently requires two sputum examinations. However, the incremental yield of the second sputum sample during follow-up of different types of tuberculosis patients has never been determined precisely.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the incremental yield of the second sputum sample in the follow-up of tuberculosis patients under the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP) in Chhattisgarh, India.
METHODOLOGY: A record review of tuberculosis (TB) patients registered in 2009 using a structured proforma from two sources, Tuberculosis and Laboratory Register, was undertaken in the six districts of Chhattisgarh, India.
RESULTS: In smear positive cases, of 10,048 follow-up examinations, 45 (0.5%) were found to be smear positive only on the second sputum when the result of the first sample was negative. In smear negative pulmonary and extra pulmonary TB patients, of 6,206 follow-up smear examinations, 11(0.2%) were found to be smear positive.
CONCLUSIONS: The incremental yield of a second smear examination was very low, indicating that examination of one sputum sample is enough during follow-up among TB patients. There is insufficient yield to support sputum smear microscopy for monitoring smear negative pulmonary TB and extra pulmonary TB patients. These results indicate that the follow-up smear microscopy can be substantially simplified with favourable resource implications."

DESIGN: Cross-section survey.
SETTING: Sydney, Australia.
PARTICIPANTS: 269 regular illicit psychostimulant users.
MEASUREMENTS: Structured interview assessing demographics, drug use and treatment history, psychostimulant dependence and self-reported symptoms consistent with adult ADHD.
FINDINGS: Almost half (45%) screened positive for adult ADHD (ADHD+). Symptoms of inattention (90%) were more prevalent than symptoms of hyperactivity/impulsivity (57%). Of those who screened positive for adult ADHD, only 17% had received a prior diagnosis of ADHD. The ADHD+ group differed from other participants in several respects: an earlier initiation of substance use and injecting drug use; more extensive polydrug use; a higher frequency of recent stimulant use and injecting drug use; a greater likelihood of stimulant dependence; and a greater likelihood of having received treatment for drug dependence. After controlling for other factors, screening positive for ADHD was associated independently with fewer years of education, earlier initiation of regular tobacco use and more extensive life-time polydrug use.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should be aware of the potential for patients of drug and alcohol treatment services to have undiagnosed and/or untreated ADHD that may impact on their compliance with, and retention in, treatment."
23227962,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23227962/,"BACKGROUND: Day care attendance is a major risk factor for respiratory and gastrointestinal illnesses in preschool children. In this study, we describe the results of a hygiene intervention cohort trial at day care centres (DCCs) on the rates of febrile, respiratory, and gastrointestinal illnesses in preschool children.
METHODS: Thirty DCCs in 2 communities were included. The number of illness episodes was registered for each child every 6 months, as well as potential risk factors. The hygiene intervention was introduced in half of the DCCs and the results analysed using a multivariate mixed effects hierarchical Poisson regression model.
RESULTS: The study lasted 2.5 y, of which the hygiene intervention lasted 1.5 y. Two thousand three hundred and forty-nine children participated, delivering 2832 person-y. Adjusted incidence rate ratios of the illnesses at the intervention and non-intervention DCCs were not significantly different for any of the illnesses. The intervention was not more effective in children less than 3 y of age than in older children and no significant effects were seen with time. Compliance with the hygiene protocol was good as measured by the use of hygiene products and by a survey among the staff at the DCCs.
CONCLUSIONS: The most likely explanation for the lack of effects of the intervention is that the baseline standard of hygiene at the DCCs was probably too high for the intervention to demonstrate significant results, but recall bias cannot be excluded. Even though hygiene is important for minimizing the spread of microbes at DCCs, other risk factors need to be studied."

The impact of anemia on hospital readmission after CABG, a potential measure of delayed complications, has not been addressed.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a single-center retrospective study of 2102 patients who had CABG in Ontario to determine whether anemia at hospital discharge was associated with increased 30-day hospital readmissions, readmission secondary to cardiac disease, and 30-day mortality using administrative data.
RESULTS: Of the 2102 patients, 224 patients (11%) were readmitted within 30 days of hospital discharge. Infection was the leading cause of readmissions (24%), followed by heart failure (13%), pulmonary disease (7%), and hemorrhagic disease (7%). Overall, 2.6% of patients were readmitted because of cardiac disease. Of patients discharged, 48% were discharged with a hemoglobin (Hb) level between 8 and 10 g/dL and 42% between 10 and 12 g/dL. Predischarge Hb concentration was not a significant independent predictor of 30-day readmission to the hospital due to all causes, readmission to the hospital due to cardiac causes, or 30-day mortality. A higher comorbidity score, adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 2.1 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-3.6), leg and sternal wound infections OR of 1.9 (95% CI, 1.2-3.0), and postoperative renal failure OR of 1.4 (95% CI, 1.2-2.0) were associated with increased 30-day readmission rates.
CONCLUSIONS: The predischarge Hb concentration after CABG was not associated with 30-day readmissions."
23228196,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23228196/,"BACKGROUND: The present study was aimed at investigating the selection of landmarks by individuals with intellectual disability (ID). The hypothesis was that they would be less efficient than individuals without IDs in the selection of landmarks when learning a new route.
METHODS: The experiment took place in a natural setting with a group of participants with ID and a group of control participants matched by chronological age. The participants were first guided along a route situated in an unfamiliar district. Then, they had to guide the experimenter along the route while pointing to all the objects and features they found useful for wayfinding.
RESULTS: The designated objects were categorised as a function of their landmarks properties. There were significant differences between the two groups for non-permanent landmarks, distant landmarks and non-unique landmarks. The two groups selected landmarks near intersections in the same proportions. However, the individuals with ID selected more non-unique landmarks and less textual signage than the control group at these decision points.
CONCLUSION: Individuals with ID seem to be less efficient than individuals without disability in landmark selection. This may limit their wayfinding abilities in their day-to-day travelling. This may also account for their difficulties in obtaining the kind of spatial knowledge which relates to the configural structure of their environment."
23228340,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23228340/,"BACKGROUND: Prior studies have suggested that major depressive disorder (MDD) with pre-adult onset represents a distinct subtype with greater symptom severity and higher rates of suicidal ideation. Whether these patients have poorer response to various types of antidepressant treatment than those with adult-onset MDD is unclear. Method A total of 665 psychiatric and primary care out-patients (aged 18-75 years) with non-psychotic chronic or recurrent MDD participated in a single-blind, randomized trial that compared the efficacy of escitalopram plus placebo, bupropion sustained-release plus escitalopram, or venlafaxine extended-release plus mirtazapine. We compared participants who self-reported MDD onset (before age 18) to those with a later onset (adult onset) with respect to baseline characteristics and treatment/outcome variables at 12 and 28 weeks.
RESULTS: Early-onset chronic/recurrent MDD was associated with a distinct set of sociodemographic (female, younger age) and clinical correlates (longer duration of illness, greater number of prior episodes, greater likelihood of atypical features, higher rates of suicidality and psychiatric co-morbidity, fewer medical problems, poorer quality of life, greater history of child abuse/neglect). However, results from unadjusted and adjusted analyses showed no significant differences in response, remission, tolerability of medications, quality of life, or retention at 12 or 28 weeks.
CONCLUSIONS: Although early-onset chronic/recurrent MDD is associated with a more severe clinical picture, it does not seem to be useful for predicting differential treatment response to antidepressant medication. Clinicians should remain alert to an increased risk of suicidality in this population."
23228376,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23228376/,"OBJECTIVE: To ascertain whether disagreement between patients and general practitioners (GP) on the patient's health status varies according to their respective perceived social distance (PSD).
METHODS: The analysis used the Intermede project's quantitative data collected from 585 patients and 27 doctors via mirrored questionnaires. GPs and patients ranked their own perceived social position (PSP) in society, and their patients' and their GP respectively. PSD was calculated as the PSP's subtraction from the patients' and GPs' assessments.
RESULTS: Disagreement between GPs and patients regarding the patient's health status was associated with PSD by the GP whereas it was not associated with PSD by the patient. In the multilevel analysis, disagreement whereby GPs overestimate patient's health status increased within PSD by the GP: OR:2.9 (95%CI = 1.0-8.6, p = 0.055) for low PSD, OR:3.4 (95%CI = 1.1-10.2, p < 0.05) for moderate PSD and OR:3.8 (95%CI = 1.1-13.1, p < 0.05) for high PSD (reference: no distance).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients perceived with a lower social position by their GP and who consider themselves to have poor health are less likely to be identified in the primary care system.
PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Physicians need to be conscious that their own perception influences the quality of the interaction with their patients, potentially resulting in unequal health care trajectories."
23228377,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23228377/,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess unfulfilled information needs of native-Dutch and Turkish-Dutch general practitioner (GP) patients in the Netherlands. In addition, the relation between perceived and recorded information provision by GPs is studied.
METHODS: Unfulfilled information needs of native-Dutch (N=117) and Turkish-Dutch patients (N=74) were assessed through pre- and post-consultation questionnaires. Audiotapes of GP consultations were made to code GPs' information provision.
RESULTS: Turkish-Dutch patients experience more unfulfilled information needs than native-Dutch patients, in particular those who identify equally with Dutch and Turkish culture. Overall, perceived information provision is hardly related to recorded information provision.
CONCLUSION: GPs insufficiently provide Turkish-Dutch patients and, to a lesser extent, native-Dutch patients as well, the information they need.
PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: GPs should be trained in giving adequate, tailored information to patients with various ethnic and cultural backgrounds."
23228625,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23228625/,"OBJECTIVE: To study if step goals (eg, walking 10,000 steps a day) approximate meeting the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational cohort.
SETTING: Community.
PARTICIPANTS: People with or at high risk of knee OA (N=1788).
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Objective physical activity data were collected over 7 consecutive days from people with or at high risk of knee OA participating in the Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study. Using activity monitor data, we determined the proportion that (1) walked ≥10,000 steps per day, (2) met the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines, and (3) achieved both recommendations.
RESULTS: Of the subjects studied (mean age ± SD, 67±8y; mean body mass index ± SD, 31±6kg/m(2); 60% women), 16.7% of men and 12.6% of women walked ≥10,000 steps per day, while 6% of men and 5% of women met the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans. Of those walking ≥10,000 steps per day, 16.7% and 26.7% of men and women, respectively, also met the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines.
CONCLUSIONS: Among this sample of older adults with or at high risk of knee OA, walking ≥10,000 steps a day did not translate into meeting public health guidelines. These findings highlight the disparity between the number of steps believed to be needed per day and the recommended time-intensity guidelines to achieve positive health benefits."
23228974,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23228974/,"OBJECTIVE: High neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been associated with post-operative AF development in patients who underwent cardiac surgery. In this study, effectiveness of NLR for prediction of recurrence after electrical cardioversion (CV) in non-valvular AF was investigated.
METHODS: A total of 149 patients who underwent a successful CV were included in this prospective cohort study. Baseline complete blood cell count, routine biochemical tests, high sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and echocardiographic measurements were examined. After CV, patients were monitored over six months for recurrence. Baseline characteristics of recurrence group were compared with sinus rhythm group by using Student`s t -test. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine predictors of recurrence.
RESULTS: Recurrence occurred in a total of 46 patients (30.9%). Median AF duration [16 (IQR:14.25) vs. 12 (IQR:11) months, p=0.01], baseline hs-CRP [9.80 (IQR: 8.50) mg/dL vs. 4.28 (IQR: 5.65) mg/dL, p=0.002] and left atrium (LA) diameter (4.5±0.4 cm, 4.3±0.5 cm, p=0.023) were significantly higher in the recurrence group than sinus rhythm group. Median NLR was comparable in recurrence and sinus groups [2.38 (IQR: 2.09) vs. 2.23, (IQR: 1.23) p=0.96, respectively]. There was a weak correlation between NLR and hs-CRP (r=0.22, p=0.05) and age (r=0.24, p=0.02). In multiple logistic regression analysis, hs-CRP [OR: 1.34 (1.09-1.65 95% CI) p=0.006], LA diameter [OR: 11.92 (1.84-77.07 95% CI) p=0.01], spontaneous echo contrast positivity, [OR: 5.40 (1.04-12.02 95% CI) p=0.045] and systolic blood pressure [OR: 1.05 (1.01-1.10 95% CI) p=0.03] were independent predictors of AF recurrence.
CONCLUSION: NLR failed to predict AF recurrence after a successful electrical CV, but hs-CRP remained an inflammatory marker of AF recurrence."
23229424,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23229424/,"BACKGROUND: The literature comparing limited incision and standard incision THAs is confusing regarding whether limited incision THA improves short-term recovery without compromising long-term durability and survival. Further, previously published meta-analyses cannot conclude that limited incision THA is better. With new data, we seek to discover if the answers now exist.
PURPOSE: We used meta-analysis to compare surgical and hospitalization data, clinical outcomes, and complication rates, and thus (1) confirm whether limited incision THA is at least comparable to standard incision THA; and (2) determine whether limited incision THA is an improvement over standard incision THA.
METHODS: The PubMed database was searched using the terms ""minimally"", ""invasive"", and ""total hip"". Inclusion was limited to studies directly comparing limited incision with standard incision THA and reporting effect sizes.
RESULTS: We identified 418 articles. Of these 11 provided background information and 30 provided data (3548 THAs) for the systematic review. Limited incision THA was better than standard incision THA in four measures: length of hospitalization (6 versus 7 days), VAS pain at discharge (2 versus 4), blood loss (421 mL versus 494 mL), and the Harris hip score at 3 months postoperation (90 versus 84). There were no outcomes for which standard incision was better. There was no major difference in the rate of complications.
CONCLUSIONS: Short-term recovery favors limited incision over standard incision THA. The lack of consistent reporting for surgical outcomes, clinical outcomes, and complications continues to create difficulties when comparing limited and standard incision THAs."
23229426,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23229426/,"BACKGROUND: Mechanical autotransfusion systems for washed shed blood (WSB) were introduced to reduce the need for postoperative allogenic blood transfusions (ABTs). Although some authors have postulated decreased requirements for ABT by using autologous retransfusion devices, other trials, mostly evaluating retransfusion devices for unwashed shed blood (USB), verified a small or no benefit in reducing the need for postoperative ABT. Because of these contradictory findings it is still unclear whether autologous retransfusion systems for WSB can reduce transfusion requirements.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We therefore asked whether one such autologous transfusion system for WSB can reduce the requirements for postoperative ABT.
METHODS: In a prospective, randomized, controlled study, we enrolled 151 patients undergoing TKA. In Group A (n=76 patients), the autotransfusion system was used for a total of 6 hours (intraoperatively and postoperatively) and the WSB was retransfused after processing. In Control Group B (n=75 patients), a regular drain without suction was used. We used signs of anemia and/or a hemoglobin value less than 8 g/dL as indications for transfusion. If necessary, we administered one or two units of allogenic blood.
RESULTS: Twenty-three patients (33%) in Group A, who received an average of 283 mL (range, 160-406 mL) of salvaged blood, needed a mean of 2.1 units of allogenic blood, compared with 23 patients (33%) in Control Group B who needed a mean of 2.1 units of allogenic blood.
CONCLUSIONS: We found the use of an autotransfusion system did not reduce the rate of postoperative ABTs.

23229458,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23229458/,"BACKGROUND: Pelvic ring injuries with associated hemorrhage from the presacral venous plexus are major contributors to morbidity and mortality in trauma patients. The Pelvic C-Clamp is an often discussed, yet seldom used device for both skeletal and hemodynamic stabilization. In a recent study we have addressed this issue and have stressed the importance of regular training sessions with the device. This study is aimed as an extended follow up with a special focus on how trained skills are retained over time.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 32 participants with various levels of training were taught to use the clamp. Thirty-six hours later, a hands-on session was performed where the time needed for placement and accuracy of placement were evaluated on a model in individual and team settings. 12 months later a re-evaluation was performed.
RESULTS: Evaluation showed that during the first session, 57/64 pins (89.15 %) were placed inside the safe area. The team training results showed reduced times for assembly and more exact pin placement. In the re-evaluation 1 year later, 75 % of all pins were safely placed and the time needed for assembly was significantly longer.
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of 57 pins were placed in the safe area within 6 min after one single training session. This reproduces the Australian data and supports the theory that adequately educated and skilled physicians should be able to handle the device properly. The data from the re-evaluation suggest that repeating the training session with the device improves performance."
23229558,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23229558/,"BACKGROUND: Anastomotic stricture or stenosis is a well-described complication of intestinal anastomosis. The incidence of stricture after colorectal anastomosis ranges from 0 to 30 %. The aim of this study was to identify possible factors related to postoperative colorectal anastomotic stricture and to indicate reoperative surgery outcomes.
METHODS: After institutional review board approval, medical records were reviewed for patients who underwent surgery for colorectal anastomotic stricture at Cleveland Clinic Florida between January 2001 and December 2010. The main outcome measures were demographics, indications for initial surgery, body mass index, comorbidities, previous treatment, level of anastomosis, history of radiotherapy, and operative data for the reoperative surgery.
RESULTS: Nineteen patients (15 males) were eligible for the study. Nine patients had a diagnosis of cancer, 7 of whom received radiotherapy. The initial surgeries were low anterior resection (n = 9; 47.4 %), high anterior resection (n = 9; 47.4 %), and sigmoidectomy (n = 1; 5.2 %). Six patients (31.6 %) had anastomotic leak after initial surgery. The majority of the patients (n = 17; 89.5 %) had an intact splenic flexure, inferior mesenteric artery, and inferior mesenteric vein. In all patients, full mobilization of the splenic flexure and high ligation of the mesenteric vessels was performed. Seven patients (36 %) developed postoperative complications. Over a mean follow-up of 24.3 months, there was no recurrence of anastomotic stricture.
CONCLUSIONS: An intact splenic flexure and mesenteric vessels were the most prevalent in patients who underwent reoperation at our institution. Full mobilization of the splenic flexure, high ligation of the mesenteric vessels, anastomotic stricture resection, and re-anastomosis can be successfully performed with satisfactory outcomes."
23229786,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23229786/,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between overeating (without loss of control) and binge eating (overeating with loss of control) and adverse outcomes.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
SETTING: Adolescents and young adults living throughout the United States.
PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen thousand eight hundred eighty-two males and females participating in the Growing Up Today Study who were 9 to 15 years old at enrollment in 1996.
MAIN EXPOSURE: Overeating and binge eating assessed via questionnaire every 12 to 24 months between 1996 and 2005.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Risk of becoming overweight or obese, starting to binge drink frequently, starting to use marijuana, starting to use other drugs, and developing high levels of depressive symptoms. Generalized estimating equations were used to estimate associations. All models controlled for age and sex; additional covariates varied by outcome.
RESULTS: Among this large cohort of adolescents and young adults, binge eating was more common among females than males. In fully adjusted models, binge eating, but not overeating, was associated with incident overweight/obesity (odds ratio, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.11-2.69) and the onset of high depressive symptoms (odds ratio, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.40-3.45). Neither overeating nor binge eating was associated with starting to binge drink frequently, while both overeating and binge eating predicted starting to use marijuana and other drugs.
CONCLUSIONS: Although any overeating, with or without loss of control, predicted the onset of marijuana and other drug use, we found that binge eating is uniquely predictive of incident overweight/obesity and the onset of high depressive symptoms. These findings suggest that loss of control is an important indicator of severity of overeating episodes."
23229839,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23229839/,"PURPOSE: Graves' disease can induce alterations of the psychosocial well-being that negatively influence the overall well-being of patients. Among the current treatments, surgery has limited indications, and its impact on the health-related quality of life has not been well clarified. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of surgery on the quality of life.
METHODS: Fifty-seven patients who underwent total thyroidectomy for Graves' disease in our surgical unit between April 2002 and December 2009 were administered a questionnaire concerning four issues: organic alterations and clinical manifestations, neurovegetative system disturbances, impairment of daily activities, psychosocial problems. Patients were retrospectively questioned after thyroidectomy about the presence of these symptoms in both the pre and postoperative periods.
RESULTS: There was a significant improvement after surgery in all four areas. Organic manifestations and psychosocial problems had higher average improvements, as did some aspects of the neurovegetative system and difficulties in undertaking daily activities. There were no reports of a worsening of symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgery resolved the hyperthyroidism in 100 % of cases, and was associated with a quality of life improvement of about 70 % in the patients. Surgery can therefore provide an immediate and effective resolution of Graves' disease, with benefits in health-related quality of life."
23229875,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23229875/,"BACKGROUND: Polypharmacy-taking five or medications per day-is common in lung cancer patients. This patient group is prescribed medication to control acute symptoms associated with cancer and also to prevent or treat other long-term conditions. These medications increase the pill burden for the patient and also the probability of developing a drug-related toxicity.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of inappropriate medication in patients taking erlotinib for the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer.
METHOD: This was a multicentre study across three sites in the North of England. Medication histories for patients receiving erlotinib were retrospectively extracted from medical notes and assessed by the clinical team (a consultant pharmacist, nurse specialist and clinical oncologist) to determine if the medication was appropriate or inappropriate. The clinical team considered the following factors when deciding if the medication was appropriate or inappropriate: remaining life expectancy of the patient, time until benefit of the treatment, goals of care and treatment targets.
RESULTS: Among the 20 patients assessed, 19 (95 %) according to the clinical team were taking medications that were inappropriate. The mean number of medications the patients were taking was 8 (range 1-16) and the most common class of medication used were drugs affecting the Central Nervous System. In addition, there were 11 patients (55 %) who were taking erlotinib in combination with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-a clinically significant drug interaction that impairs the absorption of erlotinib.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients taking erlotinib for the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer take many inappropriate medications for the treatment or prevention of long-term conditions. These patients should have their medications reviewed in the context of their original therapeutic goals."
23229908,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23229908/,"OBJECTIVE: Physicians are mandated to offer treatment choices to patients, yet not all patients may want the responsibility that entails. We evaluated predisposing factors for, and long-term consequences of, too much and not enough perceived decision-making responsibility among breast cancer patients.
DESIGN: Longitudinal assessment, with measurements collected just after surgical treatment (baseline) and 6-month follow-up.
PARTICIPANTS: Women with early-stage breast cancer treated surgically at eight NYC hospitals, recruited for a randomized controlled trial of patient assistance to improve receipt of adjuvant treatment.
MEASUREMENTS: Using logistic regression, we explored multivariable-adjusted associations between perceived treatment decision-making responsibility and a) baseline knowledge of treatment benefit and b) 6-month decision regret.
RESULTS: Of 368 women aged 28-89 years, 72 % reported a ""reasonable amount"", 21 % ""too much"", and 7 % ""not enough"" responsibility for treatment decision-making at baseline. Health literacy problems were most common among those with ""not enough"" (68 %) and ""too much"" responsibility (62 %). Only 29 % of women had knowledge of treatment benefits; 40 % experienced 6-month decision regret. In multivariable analysis, women reporting ""too much"" vs. ""reasonable amount"" of responsibility had less treatment knowledge ([OR] = 0.44, [95 % CI] = 0.20-0.99; model c = 0.7343;p < 0.01) and more decision regret ([OR] = 2.,91 [95 % CI] = 1.40-6.06; model c = 0.7937;p < 0.001). Findings were similar for women reporting ""not enough"" responsibility, though not statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: Too much perceived responsibility for breast cancer treatment decisions was associated with poor baseline treatment knowledge and 6-month decision regret. Health literacy problems were common, suggesting that health care professionals find alternative ways to communicate with low health literacy patients, enabling them to assume the desired amount of decision-making responsibility, thereby reducing decision regret."
23229913,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23229913/,"PURPOSE: The objective of this review is to summarize the evidence demonstrating that the sentinel lymph node (SLN) procedure is not only associated with significantly less morbidity compared to the axillary dissection, but may also result in better staging and improved patient outcomes.
METHODS: A search of MedLine and PubMed articles using the terms ""sentinel lymph node biopsy"", ""breast cancer"", ""staging"", ""morbidity"", ""survival"", and ""outcomes"" was conducted.
RESULTS: Breast cancer staging includes axillary evaluation as an integral component. Over the past two decades, sentinel lymph node biopsy has evolved as a technique that has an improved morbidity over traditional axillary dissection. The sentinel node(s) undergo a more intensive pathologic examination than traditional axillary contents. In the node-negative group of patients, this may have led to stage migration and potentially improved disease-free and overall survival.
CONCLUSION: The SLN procedure is not only associated with significantly less morbidity compared to the axillary lymph node dissection, it may also result in more accurate staging, better axillary tumor control and improved survival."
23230240,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23230240/,"BACKGROUND: Several studies, but not all, of primarily middle-aged or younger adults have suggested that the common MTHFR C677T variant is a genetic risk factor for migraine with aura (MA). Here, we consider whether this variant is associated with MA risk in an older non-clinical population (AGES-Reykjavik cohort).
METHODS: Participants are a sub-sample ( N  = 1976) of subjects from the Reykjavik Study (RS; mean age 50) and its continuation, AGES-RS (mean age 76). We estimated the relative odds of MA in TT versus CC carriers using multinomial logistic regression. As both MA and the TT genotype may be linked with modestly reduced longevity, we performed a simple simulation to illustrate the effect that selective survival may have had on our observed gene-disease association.
RESULTS: TT versus CC carriers were at marginally reduced odds of MA (ORTT 0.55 (0.3-1.0), P  = 0.07), significantly for women (ORTT 0.45 (0.2-0.9), P  = 0.03). Assuming the 'true' (e.g. mid-life) effect of the TT genotype is ORTT 1.26, from a recent meta-analysis, our simulation suggested that if 25-year mortality had been (hypothetically) 13% higher in MA subjects with the TT versus CC genotype, the measured effect of the TT genotype on MA would have been attenuated to non-significance (e.g. ORTT 1.00). Our observed protective effect was consistent with the most extreme selective mortality scenario, in which essentially all of the previously reported increased mortality in MA subjects was (hypothetically) found in CT or TT carriers.
CONCLUSION: The MTHFR 677TT genotype was associated with marginally reduced risk of MA in our older population. Our simulation illustrated how even modest selective survival might obscure the apparent effect of a genetic or other risk factor in older populations. We speculate that some of the heterogeneity previously observed for this particular genetic variant may be due to age range differences in the studied populations."
23231478,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23231478/,"BACKGROUND: Lacunar infarcts constitute up to 25% of all ischaemic strokes. As acute intracranial vascular imaging has become widely available with computed tomographic angiography, thrombolysis of lacunar strokes has become contentious because an intracranial vascular lesion cannot be visualized. We studied the effect of thrombolysis on lacunar strokes compared to other clinical ischaemic stroke sub-types.
METHODS: Ischaemic stroke patients from phase 3 of the Registry of the Canadian Stroke Network data (July 2003-March 2008) were included. Lacunar stroke was defined as a lacunar syndrome supported by computed tomography brain showing a subcortical hypodense lesion with a diameter <20 mm. Clinical syndromes were used to define other stroke sub-types. The outcomes were mortality at 90 days, modified Rankin Scale score 0-2 at discharge, occurrence of intracranial haemorrhage as a complication of stroke in-hospital, and discharge disposition to home.
RESULTS: A total of 11,503 patients of ischaemic stroke were included from the Registry of the Canadian Stroke Network 3 between July 2003 and March 2008. Lacunar strokes formed 19.1% of the total strokes. The total number of patients who received tissue plasminogen activator was 1630 (14.2%). A significant association was found between tissue plasminogen activator treatment and outcomes after controlling Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project types--for modified Rankin Scale at discharge and discharge to home, but not for mortality. A thrombolysis-by-Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project stroke sub-type interaction was observed due to lack of benefit among the posterior circulation stroke sub-types. Patients with lacunar strokes, partial anterior circulation stroke, and total anterior circulation strokes all benefited approximately equally from thrombolysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Thrombolysis is associated with clinically improved outcome among patients with lacunar stroke syndromes."

METHODS: Perinatal women (n = 45) completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale at 16 weeks' and 30 weeks' gestation and again at four weeks postpartum. Immediately after completing the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, participants also completed mood diaries with separate visual analogue scales for depressed, irritable, anxious, and euphoric/activated moods. This was done twice daily for one week. A comparison group of 31 non-perinatal women without depression or premenstrual symptoms completed identical mood diaries for seven consecutive weeks. Mood instability was represented by the mean square successive difference statistic.
RESULTS: Perinatal women showed higher mean levels of depressed, irritable, anxious, and high mood instability than the non-perinatal women. The findings held when pregnant women who were depressed were removed from the comparison, except that the difference in depressed mood instability was no longer significant.
CONCLUSION: Wider fluctuation in mood in pregnant and postnatal women is consistent with the common belief that perinatal women are moodier than non-perinatal women."

The aim of this study was to determine if there was a difference in bacterial colony-forming units (CFUs) on sterile gloves versus clean gloves in an outpatient clinical setting.
METHODS: Volunteers self-gloved with pairs of clean gloves, and culture swabs were obtained from the palmar surface. Cultures were also obtained after volunteers self-donned sterile gloves and donned sterile gloves with the assistance of a surgical technician.
RESULTS: Twenty-five volunteers participated. Mean growths were as follows: clean gloves, 14.08 ± 15.45 CFUs/mL (range, 0-44 CFUs/mL); self-donned sterile gloves, 1.28 ± 4.28 CFUs/mL (range, 0-20 CFUs/mL); and technician-assisted sterile gloves, 1 positive with 8 CFUs/mL.
CONCLUSIONS: There was a statistically significant difference in bacterial load on clean gloves versus sterile gloves (P < .001). However, when comparing the bacterial contamination on clean gloves with that required to cause an infection, it appeared that this statistically significant difference was clinically irrelevant."
23231937,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23231937/,"BACKGROUND: Skin and breast cancers are the 2 most common malignancies in US women. Early detection with appropriate therapy is essential in improving survival rates. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare general surgery (GS) and family medicine (FM) residents in their ability to identify and appropriately treat common skin and breast lesions.
METHODS: Thirty-three-question, institutional review board-approved, Web-based surveys (1 breast and 1 skin survey) were each sent to 244 GS and 452 FM training programs (both university-based and community-based programs) uniformly distributed across the United States. Each survey included demographics and 20 multiple-choice questions (10 lesion identification questions and 10 corresponding treatment questions).
RESULTS: A total of 374 completed resident surveys were collected (242 FM, 132 GS). Respondents were uniformly distributed geographically (55.9% women, 44.1% men; 54.2% community based, 45.8% university based). GS residents correctly identified 82.7% of lesions compared with 83.3% for FM residents (P = .89) and correctly treated 76.8% of lesions compared with 75.4% for FM residents (P = .81). No significant identification or treatment differences were noted by postgraduate year (PGY), but both GS and FM residents had lower accuracy of correct treatment identification compared with lesion identification, which was significant for GS PGY 2 residents (P = .02), FM PGY 2 residents (P = .03), and FM PGY 2 residents (P = .03). University-based GS residents had a more significant disparity between correct identification and correct treatment (83.6% vs 74.6%, P = .03) compared with community-based GS residents (80.4% vs 74.6%, P = .11). Both university-based and community-based FM residents had significant disparities in this comparison (university-based FM residents with 82.4% vs 69.8%, P = .02, vs community-based FM residents with 86.7% vs 74.5%, P = .04).
CONCLUSIONS: Both GS and FM residents incorrectly treated more lesions than they diagnosed. This diagnosis-treatment disparity was more pronounced among university-based residents. Validation of this observation may better identify potential training deficiencies in breast and skin oncology to enhance GS resident education."
23231969,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23231969/,"BACKGROUND: Many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) collect cost-effectiveness data. Without appropriate sample size calculations, patient recruitment may cease before the cost-effectiveness of the intervention can be established or continue after the cost-effectiveness of the intervention is established beyond doubt.
PURPOSE: We determined the frequency with which cost-effectiveness is considered in sample size calculations and whether RCT-based economic evaluations are likely to come to inconclusive results at odds with the clinical findings.
METHODS: We searched the National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED) to identify RCT-based cost-utility analyses. RCTs that collected individual patient data on costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were eligible. Studies using models to extrapolate the results of RCTs or with insufficient information on incremental costs and QALYs were excluded.
RESULTS: In total, 38 trials met eligibility criteria. Only one considered cost-effectiveness in sample size calculations. RCTs were less likely to reach definitive conclusions based on the cost-effectiveness results than the primary clinical outcome (15.8% vs. 42.1%; McNemar; p = 0.01). In trials that provided sufficient data, exploratory analysis indicated that the median power to detect important differences was 29.5% for QALYs, 94.1% for costs, and 78.7% for the primary clinical outcome. In three trials (7.9%), a definitely more effective intervention was found to be expensive and probably not cost-effective.
LIMITATIONS: Our results reflect trials where authors considered within-trial estimates of cost-effectiveness to be meaningful. In focusing on one primary clinical outcome from each RCT, we have simplified the clinical effectiveness results, although the primary outcome will usually be one that policy makers use in judging the 'success' of the intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: Economic evaluations conducted alongside RCTs are valuable, but often present inconclusive evidence. Trial results may lead to discordant messages when the most effective intervention is probably not the most cost-effective. Despite methodological advances, trialists rarely assessed the extent to which their trial might resolve the key uncertainties about the cost-effectiveness of interventions. We recommend that grant funders should do more to encourage trialists to include economic end points in sample size calculations, particularly when the majority of costs and benefits of the intervention occur within the time frame of the trial."
23232195,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23232195/,"BACKGROUND: Although combined oral and nasal steroid therapy is widely used in nasal polyposis, a subset of patients show an unfavorable therapeutic outcome. This study aimed to evaluate whether oral prednisolone produces any additive effects on subsequent nasal steroid therapy and to evaluate if any clinical variables can predict therapeutic outcome.
METHODS: Using a 3:2 randomization ratio, 67 patients with nasal polyposis received 50 mg of prednisolone and 47 patients received placebo daily for 2 weeks, followed by mometasone furoate nasal spray (MFNS) at 200 micrograms twice daily for 10 weeks. Clinical response was evaluated by nasal symptom score (NSS), peak expiratory flow index (PEFI), and total nasal polyps score (TNPS). Potential predictor variables were assessed by clinical history, nasal endoscopy, allergy skin test, and sinus radiography.
RESULTS: At the end of the 2-week oral steroid phase, the prednisolone group showed significantly greater improvements in all nasal symptoms, nasal airflow, and polyp size than the placebo group. In the nasal steroid phase, while the MFNS maintained the outcome improvements in the prednisolone group, all outcome variables in the placebo group showed continuing improvements. At the end of the nasal steroid phase, there were no significant differences of most outcome improvements between the two groups, except in hyposmia, PEFI, and TNPS (p = 0.049, p = 0.029, and p = 0.005, respectively). In the prednisolone group, patients with polyps grade 3 and endoscopic signs of meatal discharge showed significantly less improvement in total NSS, PEFI, and TNPS than patients with grade 1-2 size and negative metal discharge.
CONCLUSION: In the 12-week treatment evaluation of nasal polyposis, pretreatment with oral steroids had no significant advantage for most nasal symptoms other than earlier relief; however, combined oral and nasal steroid therapy more effectively improved hyposmia, polyps size, and nasal airflow. Polyps size grade 3 and/or endoscopic signs of meatal discharge predisposed to a poorer treatment outcome."
23232196,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23232196/,"BACKGROUND: The olfactory and gustatory functions of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) patients have not been documented by validated tests. Disorders of the nasal/oral cavity may interfere with the olfactory and gustatory functions. Fifty-four HHT patients were investigated by smell/taste tests.
METHODS: HHT patients provided subjective ratings in areas such as ability to perceive smell/taste. ""Sniffin' Sticks"" were used for smell tests, and taste strips were used for taste tests.
RESULTS: HHT patients rated their subjective olfactory and gustatory function on a visual analog scale from 0 (none) to 100 (high) as 65.3 ± 27.7 and 68.1 ± 25.1, respectively. Comparison of smell test results of HHT patients with normative data of sex- and age-matched controls from Hummel et al. revealed that HHT patients had lower threshold values, whereas there was no difference in identification and discrimination values. HHT patients were hyposmic. In the case of taste qualities, all values (sweet, sour, salty, and bitter) in HHT patients were lower than those in normative data of Mueller et al. However, HHT patients were not hypogeusic. The duration of disease, extranasal manifestation, and treatments did not significantly correlate with smell/taste test values.
CONCLUSION: Compared with healthy people, HHT patients exhibit reduced olfactory and gustatory function; however, HHT patients are hyposmic and not hypogeusic. This chemosensory deficit may highlight an early sign of disease and has no correlation with disease severity. HHT patients should be informed about these potential disease manifestations, thus enabling them to improve their quality of life."
23232386,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23232386/,"BACKGROUND: Skeletal dysplasias may be associated with cervical spinal instability or stenosis. Cervical spine flexion-extension plain radiographs in children with skeletal dysplasia are difficult to interpret. The purpose of this study was to review the indications, efficacy, and safety of performing flexion-extension magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) under sedation/anesthesia in these children.
METHODS: Retrospective, Institutional Review Board-approved review of 31 children with skeletal dysplasia who underwent 38 cervical spine flexion-extension MRI studies under sedation/anesthesia. Indications included abnormal neurological examination, suspected instability, stenosis, or inconclusive findings on flexion-extension radiographs. Studies were performed by the radiology technologist as directed by the radiologist with an anesthesiologist present. MRI was evaluated for odontoid hypoplasia, os odontoideum, cerebrospinal fluid effacement, cord compression, spinal cord changes, cervical canal narrowing in the neutral, flexion, and extension positions. Neurological examinations were recorded before and after MRI to assess safety.
RESULTS: The average age at MRI was 3 years, 2 months. In 6 patients whose plain radiographs showed C1-C2 or subaxial instability, flexion-extension MRI showed no cord compression. Nine patients with inconclusive plain radiographs had abnormal MRI findings. An os odontoideum not seen on plain radiographs was diagnosed in 3 patients on flexion-extension MRI. On the basis of the MRI findings, 14 patients underwent surgery, 9/14 had increased cord compression in flexion or extension compared with neutral, and observation was continued in 17 others. Patients who underwent surgery had significant cord compression on MRI. There were no significant changes in the neurological examinations after MRI.
CONCLUSIONS: Cervical spine flexion-extension MRI under sedation/anesthesia in children with skeletal dysplasia is safe under adequate supervision and is necessary to guide accurate medical and surgical decision making. Flexion-extension MRI is useful for identifying dynamic changes in canal diameter resulting in cord compression not seen on plain radiographs, and it is also useful for identifying patients with suspected plain film instability who may not have stenosis or cord compression on MRI.

23232590,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23232590/,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: To investigate (i) associations of intimate partner violence (IPV) and chronic undernutrition among women of reproductive age and (ii) whether women who experience both poverty and IPV are unique in their nutritional disadvantages.
SUBJECTS/METHODS: This study used the data from the 2007 Bangladesh Demographic Health Survey, a cross-sectional, nationally representative study. Analyses were based on the responses of 3861 currently married, non-pregnant women. Exposure was determined from maternal reports of physical and sexual IPV. Chronic undernutrition among women was the main outcome variable of interest. Descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic regression methods were employed in the analysis.
RESULTS: Over 53% of married Bangladeshi women experienced physical and/or sexual violence from their husbands. Experience of physical IPV (adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=1.22; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.02-1.46) and both physical and sexual IPV (AOR=1.24; 95% CI=1.04-1.58) was associated with an increased risk of chronic undernutrition among women. A magnitude of three or more types of physical IPV appeared to have more profound consequences on women's undernutrition. Findings also revealed that women who are poor and have experienced IPV are unique in their nutritional disadvantages.
CONCLUSIONS: Experience of IPV is an important risk marker for the increased risk of chronic undernutrition among women of reproductive age in Bangladesh. Women experiencing IPV need help irrespective of the socioeconomic status they belong to. Targeted intervention at IPV among the poor may help improve nutritional status among women of reproductive age."
23232734,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23232734/,"OBJECTIVE: User-friendly scores to assess knowledge of guidelines for prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) are scarce and have mainly evaluated nurses, but not students or physicians. Gaps between knowledge and actual clinical practice have not been sufficiently analyzed. We assessed knowledge of and adherence to guidelines for prevention of VAP among physicians, nurses, and students in adult ICUs.
METHODS: All adult ICU healthcare workers were invited to complete a 20-point questionnaire. The first part assessed personal knowledge of international guidelines for prevention of VAP; the second part assessed daily clinical practice. Personal knowledge and daily practice were scored from 0 to 10 points.
RESULTS: We invited 257 ICU healthcare workers to participate in the study, and 167 (65%) accepted (32/54 physicians, 108/176 nurses, and 27/27 students). The median (IQR) personal knowledge scores for physicians, nurses, and students were 6 (5-7), 5 (4-6), and 5 (4-7), respectively. The median scores for daily clinical practice for physicians and nurses were 5 (4-6) and 4 (3-5), respectively. Healthcare workers with more than 1 year of ICU experience scored significantly better in personal knowledge than those with less experience: 6 (5-7) versus 4 (3-6), P = .004.
CONCLUSIONS: A simple, easy-to-complete questionnaire enabled us to rapidly evaluate personal knowledge and reported clinical practice in prevention of VAP in large teaching institutions. These scores will be used as baseline figures to assess the impact of educational and intervention campaigns."
23232824,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23232824/,"INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: The objective of this study was to assess whether resolution of urgency symptoms in women undergoing surgical repair of pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is associated with any measurable change in voiding parameters.
METHODS: This was a prospective observational study. Women with symptomatic POP stage 2 or greater requiring surgery and who had concurrent urinary urgency and/or urinary urgency incontinence (UUI) were eligible for inclusion. Uroflowmetry data was collected from eligible women with urgency who underwent POP repair both preoperatively and at 10 weeks postoperative. Previously published preliminary data were used for an a priori power calculation. Urgency was assessed pre- and postoperatively with the Urgency Perception Scale (UPS). Participants were divided into those who experienced urgency resolution and those with persistent urgency. Differences in voiding parameters were evaluated at baseline and postoperatively in the two groups. The primary outcome measures were change in maximum flow rate and presence of urgency symptoms as determined by the UPS 10 weeks postoperatively. A paired Student's t test was used to evaluate whether there was any significant difference in uroflowmetry parameters between the two groups postoperatively, with an unpaired Student's t test test being used to evaluate any differences in these parameters at baseline. Discrete data were evaluated using Fisher's exact test.
RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-eight women were recruited to the study. Urgency resolved in 61.7 % of participants, with resolution being associated with a significant increase in maximum flow rate from 11.2 [confidence interval (CI) 3.4-20.1] to 26.9 (CI 17.1-35.2) (p = 0.03), even when corrected for voiding volume.
CONCLUSION: This large prospective study indicates that urgency resolution after prolapse repair is associated with an increase in urinary flow rate, indicating a possible aetiological role for voiding in women with POP and urgency."
23232827,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23232827/,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of early intranasal steroid administration on wound healing after sinus surgery.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized, placebo-controlled, blinded animal study.
SETTING: Animal laboratory.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Forty-two male New Zealand rabbits underwent bilateral 3-mm punch resection of the concha nasalis ventralis. The animals were divided into 3 groups: saline, late steroid, and early steroid. The saline group received saline drops, the late steroid group received saline drops for 7 days followed by intranasal mometasone furoate 50 µg/nostril/d, and the early steroid group received intranasal mometasone furoate (same dose) starting on postoperative day 1. The animals were sacrificed on postoperative days 10 and 21. Left nasal specimens were examined histopathologically with hematoxylin-eosin and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) stains. Right nasal specimens were examined with high-performance liquid chromatography, and hydroxyproline levels were measured as mg/g in wet tissue.
RESULTS: Late steroid and early steroid groups were similar with regard to MMP-9 staining on days 10 and 21. On day 10, the early steroid group revealed significantly intense MMP-9 staining when compared with the saline group, and the late steroid and early steroid groups revealed significant fibrosis when compared with the saline group. Hydroxyproline levels were similar in all groups on day 10. The early steroid group revealed significantly higher hydroxyproline levels when compared with the late steroid group on day 21.
CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that early intranasal steroid administration after sinus surgery in an animal model has no detrimental effects with regard to wound-healing parameters."
23232975,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23232975/,"BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine disorder exhibiting variable age at onset of clinical features allied with complex diseases in the later life. ACE is a pleiotropic molecule associated with various pathophysiological functions. The present study was aimed to establish the frequency of ACE I/D gene polymorphism in patients and controls and to assess the influence of this polymorphism on anthropometric and various clinical features of the condition.
METHODS: ACE I/D genotyping was carried out in 259 PCOS patients and 315 healthy ultrasound scanned women of South Indian origin.
RESULTS: The distribution of DD, ID and II genotypes in patients was 39, 37 and 24 %, whereas in the controls it was 31, 51 and 18 % respectively. Significant difference was observed in the genotypic frequency distributions between the patients and controls, however the allelic frequencies did not vary between the groups (p>0.05). Quartile analysis revealed preponderance of DD genotype in the first two quartiles and a linear increase of II genotype from first to the last quartiles. Further, Multiple Logistic regression analysis revealed significant association of ACE I/D gene polymorphism with acanthosis and age at onset (AAO) of the syndrome (p<0.05).
CONCLUSION: The present study is the first report to highlight the predisposing role of DD and protective role of ID genotype towards PCOS. Patients with single or double dose of D allele may develop PCOS symptoms at an early age and also significantly associated with acanthosis, a marker of insulin resistance."
23232987,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23232987/,"BACKGROUND: Surgical treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC) should be aimed primarily at achieving a combination of surgical-oncologic radicalness and the highest possible quality of life. In recent years, surgical therapy for T1 CRC has tended toward less radical interventions. The question regarding changes in survival and recurrence rates still is unanswered.
METHODS: A retrospective medical chart review of patients surgically treated in our department for T1 CRC from January 1990 to December 2010 (n = 223) was performed. Charts were reviewed for tumor-specific parameters, local recurrence, distant metastasis, and patient survival. The different treatment options used were strictly separated for a more detailed workup.
RESULTS: Radical resection (RR) was performed for 57.1 %, local resection (LR) for 14.8 %, and an endoscopic approach (EA) for 28.1 % of the study population. After receipt of the histology report, 35.7 % of the patients initially resected nonradically underwent reoperation, mostly using RR. Seven patients experienced a local recurrence over time (3.6 %): one after initial RR, three after LR, and three after EA. Systemic recurrence occurred for nine patients (4.6 %) over time, six of whom had undergone initial RR. High-risk criteria were shown for 20 T1 CRCs. For 60 % (12/20) of the patients, initial RR was performed. Radical reoperation was performed for 75 % of the nonradically treated high-risk tumors. One high-risk patient without reoperation experienced metastatic disease over time. The 5-year overall survival rate was 87.2 %, itemized for the defined subgroups as follows: 83.9 % for RR, 82.8 % for LR, and 58.2 % for EA.
CONCLUSION: Patients with T1 CRC had a distinctly higher incidence of local recurrence after EA or LR. Explicit workup in terms of risk classification is crucial to reducing the risk of local and systemic recurrence. A nonradical approach should be only a second option for patients with T1 CRC, namely, those solely in clearly low-risk situations or those with distinct comorbidities."
23233262,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23233262/,"PURPOSE: Children with Down syndrome (DS) and cerebral palsy (CP) often have reduced visual acuity (VA). This study assessed VA and low-contrast acuity (LCA) with Lea symbols in DS and CP populations to explore whether LCA measures provide useful additional information about visual performance. VA and LCA were also measured in a large group of typically developing young people.
METHODS: High-contrast VA and LCA performance was measured monocularly using crowded Lea symbols with 45 young people with CP (mean age 11.8 ± 4 years), 44 with DS (mean age 10.5 ± 3 years), and 211 controls (mean age 11.4 ± 3 years). Refractive status was confirmed with cycloplegic retinoscopy.
RESULTS: DS AND CP GROUPS HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER ACUITIES THAN CONTROLS AT ALL CONTRASTS (P 0.001). MEAN (SD) HIGH-CONTRAST VA WAS AS FOLLOWS: DS = +0.39 ± 0.2 logMAR; CP = +0.18 ± 0.2 logMAR; controls = -0.04 ± 0.1 logMAR. Mean 2.5% LCA was as follows: DS = +0.73 ± 0.2 logMAR; CP = +0.50 ± 0.2 logMAR; controls = +0.37 ± 0.1 logMAR. For controls, the mean difference between VA and 2.5% LCA was 0.40 logMAR (95% limits of agreement, ± 0.22 logMAR). While there was a positive relation between VA and 2.5% LCA scores (linear regressions, P < 0.0001), considerable variation existed, with VA explaining only 36% of the variance in LCA performance for control data.
CONCLUSIONS: VA and LCA performance was significantly poorer in DS and CP groups than in controls, and high-contrast VA did not reliably predict low-contrast performance. Therefore both high- and low-contrast acuity assessment are valuable to fully describe an individual's visual function, and this may be particularly relevant in DS and CP in cases in which patients are unable to articulate visual difficulties. Age-specific reference data from a large sample of typically developing young people across a broad age range are presented for clinicians using high- and low-contrast Lea symbols."
23233912,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23233912/,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to review of US state child care center regulations on oral health and nutrition as related to early childhood caries (ECC).
METHODS: Child care center regulations for the 50 states and the District of Columbia, as of April 2010, were audited for their inclusion of 8 oral health and 11 nutrition topics related to the development of or care for ECC. The topics are based on selected recommended standards from Caring for Our Children: National Health and Safety Performance Standards; Guidelines for Out-of-Home Child Care Programs.
RESULTS: On average, states had 2.6 (±1.7 SD; range=0-6) of the oral health standards and 5.9 (±2.5; range=1-11) of the nutritional standards included in their regulations. States varied greatly on the content covered. Seven states did not include any of the reviewed oral health topics. The 2 least covered regulations for oral health were ""toothbrush maintenance"" (4 states) and ""oral health screening"" (5 states).
CONCLUSIONS: The weakness of coverage in child care center regulations for early childhood caries prevention calls to strengthen these policies for their potential to improve the oral health and obesity status of US children."
17363752,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17363752/,"OBJECTIVE: The lack of a universally applicable model for the metabolic syndrome in the pediatric population makes it difficult to define this syndrome and compare its prevalence across studies and diverse populations. We sought to assess whether a single underlying factor could represent the metabolic syndrome in adolescents.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999-2002), we conducted a confirmatory factor analysis to assess the validity of waist circumference, triglycerides, fasting insulin, and systolic blood pressure (SBP) as potential phenotypic traits for the metabolic syndrome in adolescents aged 12-17 years (n = 1,262). A multiple-group approach was used to test the invariance in factor loadings across sex and race/ethnicity.
RESULTS: The estimates of factor loadings for the total sample were 0.76, 0.46, 0.81, and 0.42 for waist circumference, triglycerides, fasting insulin, and SBP, respectively. The goodness-of-fit indexes were adequate for the total sample (comparative fit index, 0.99; standardized root mean square residual, 0.02), Caucasian boys (1.0; 0.01), African-American boys (0.99; 0.03), Mexican-American boys (1.0; 0.01), Mexican-American girls (1.0; 0.01), and Caucasian girls (0.95; 0.04) and acceptable for African-American girls (0.94; 0.05). There were no significant differences in factor loadings of the four measured variables between boys and girls and among the three racial or ethnic subgroups.
CONCLUSIONS: The metabolic syndrome as a single underlying factor for the four simple phenotypic traits may be plausible in adolescents. The proposed model appears to be generalizable across sex and race/ethnicity."
17364077,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17364077/,"INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to determine if patient information needs are being met and the level of patient satisfaction with rheumatology practitioners in participatory decision-making and thereby indirectly explore whether concordance was achieved.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The design was a cross-sectional postal questionnaire survey of 420 patients attending outpatient clinics at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital who were taking disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or a biological treatment. The population served is ethnically homogeneous and predominantly Caucasian.
RESULTS: The response rate was 76%. Most respondents (79%) had inflammatory arthritis while 66% had rheumatoid arthritis. Seventy-seven per cent of patients reported that the rationale behind commencing treatment was explained and that they were given ample opportunities to ask questions. Eighty-two per cent said they were given an appropriate amount of information. Sixty-four per cent of patients were satisfied with their level of participation in the decision-making process, although a substantial number (25%) said that information from different sources was conflicting. There was no correlation between concern about side effects and patients' perceptions of the effectiveness of medication. Females were more concerned than males about possible side effects; P =0.009, using the Mann-Whitney U test. One third of the patients altered their medication in response to whether their arthritis felt better or worse.
CONCLUSION: The majority of patients were satisfied that their information needs were met and with the care provided in the practitioner clinic. Participatory decision-making was sub-optimal despite patient satisfaction with the amount of time allocated to meeting their information needs. We found that patients exercise autonomy in managing their arthritis by regulating their medications through an active decision-making process, which is informed by their previous experience of medication, and how well controlled they felt their arthritis was. Research into this decision-making process may hold the key to achieving concordance."
17364208,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17364208/,"OBJECTS: We evaluated whether the presence of lacunar skull deformity (LSD) with myelomeningocele is a predictive factor for subsequent hydrocephalus development.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the clinical and radiological records of 18 infants with myelomeningocele, divided the patients into groups with (group A, n=9) and without (group B, n=9) ventriculomegaly at birth and assessed whether the presence of LSD was predictive of the necessity for ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) placement.
RESULTS: LSD was present in five group A patients. All nine group A patients underwent VPS placement. Among the group B patients, five had LSD; they underwent VPS placement. A significantly higher proportion of those with ventricle enlargement or LSD at birth required VPS placement (p=0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Adding to the ventriculomegaly at birth, the presence of LSD alerts to the necessity to monitor these infants closely to determine the necessity for VPS placement."
17364300,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17364300/,"BACKGROUND: Prevention of lumbopelvic pain in pregnancy has been sparsely studied. One aim of this study was to assess if a 12-week training program during pregnancy can prevent and/or treat lumbopelvic pain. A randomized controlled trial was conducted at Trondheim University Hospital and three outpatient physiotherapy clinics. Three hundred and one healthy nulliparous women were included at 20 weeks of pregnancy and randomly allocated to a training group (148) or a control group (153).
METHODS: The outcome measures were self-reported symptoms of lumbopelvic pain (once per week or more), sick leave, and functional status. Pain drawing was used to document the painful area of the body. The intervention included daily pelvic floor muscle training at home, and weekly group training over 12 weeks including aerobic exercises, pelvic floor muscle and additional exercises, and information related to pregnancy.
RESULTS: At 36 weeks of gestation women in the training group were significantly less likely to report lumbopelvic pain: 65/148 (44%) versus 86/153 (56%) (p=0.03). Three months after delivery the difference was 39/148 (26%) in the training group versus 56/153 (37%) in the control group (p=0.06). There was no difference in sick leave during pregnancy, but women in the training group had significantly (p=0.01) higher scores on functional status.
CONCLUSIONS: A 12-week specially designed training program during pregnancy was effective in preventing lumbopelvic pain in pregnancy."
17364500,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17364500/,"OBJECTIVES: Autoimmune sensorineural hearing loss (ASNHL) is a relatively rare disorder which can lead to total deafness. At present, no specific laboratory test with adequate sensitivity and specificity is available to confirm the clinical suspicion of ASNHL. The aim of this study was to identify if evaluation of anti-hsp70 antibodies is an accurate diagnostic tool in patients affected by ASNHL.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study.
METHODS: During 4-year (2001-2005), all patients with SNHL who were referred to the Eye, Ear, Nose and Throat Department of Parma University, Italy, underwent specific tests to determine the autoimmune origin of the disease. Patients with a consistent suspicion of ASNHL underwent the routine serologic tests and a test for determination of anti-hsp70 antibodies. The same patients were divided into three groups: (1) idiopathic ASNHL; (2) ASNHL associated with ocular inflammation, i.e. Cogan's Syndrome; (3) ASNHL associated with a systemic autoimmune disease (SAD). The control group included: (1) healthy subjects; and (2) patients affected by SAD, without any ocular or audiovestibular disease.
RESULTS: 88 subjects (67 patients, defined as ""study group"", and 21 controls) were evaluated. Anti-hsp70 antibodies were isolated in 52% of the study group patients, and in 4% of the control group (chi2 = 13.009, p < 0.01). In the idiopathic ASNHL patients, 59.5% were found positive for anti-hsp70 antibodies. About 50% of patients affected by CS and 37.5% of patients affected by SAD with SNHL were found positive. In the control group, anti-hsp70 antibodies were found in 8.3% of healthy subjects and in none of the patients with SAD and no hearing loss.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study confirms the value of the anti-hsp70 test in the serological diagnosis of autoimmune hearing loss. It is still the only available diagnostic marker that identifies an autoimmune origin of hearing loss."
17364748,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17364748/,"PURPOSE: To evaluate whether treatment of systemic hypertension has an effect on progression of optic nerve parameters in glaucoma suspects using confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy.
METHODS: Two hundred eyes of 103 glaucoma suspect patients were included in this retrospective cohort study. Thirty-one patients (of whom 59 eyes were included in the study) had systemic hypertension under treatment (based on medical history). The remaining 72 age-matched normotensive controls (of whom 141 eyes were included in the study) were not on blood-pressure-lowering medications. Each patient had a follow-up period of at least 4 years with a minimum of four Heidelberg retinal tomograph tests (one baseline and three follow-up scans). The slopes of progression of optic nerve head parameters with time were studied and compared between these two groups using mixed effects regression models.
RESULTS: Patients with systemic hypertension showed a statistically significant increase in cup area (slope 0.2, p = 0.03), cup-to-disk area ratio (slope 0.01, p = 0.007), and decrease in rim area (slope -0.4, p = 0.03), rim-to-disk area ratio (slope -0.01, p = 0.005), and global Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer (RNFL) thickness (p = 0.008) with time. The differences in slopes of progression of many parameters between hypertensives and normotensives were statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: Systemic hypertension treated with hypotensive medications may be a risk factor for increased progression of optic nerve parameters in glaucoma suspects compared with age-matched normotensive subjects."
17364757,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17364757/,"PURPOSE: To compare the nature and extent of inter and intralimb coupling during two-handed catching and the effect of manipulating task constraints in children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) and their typically developing peers (AMC).
METHOD: Twenty children aged 7 - 10 years, ten with DCD and 10 AMC attempted to catch a ball ten times in condition 1 (C1), ball to the midline; condition 2 (C2), ball to the left shoulder and condition 3 (C3), ball to the right shoulder. Both 3D kinematic data and video data were collected.
RESULTS: Children with DCD caught fewer balls than the AMC children, regardless of age or condition (p <or= 0.001). Children with DCD demonstrated a higher degree of linkage between limbs in C1 and a lower degree of between limb coupling in C2 and C3 when compared to the AMC (p <or= 0.05). Differences between the AMC7 - 8 and AMC9 - 10 group were found with respect to interlimb coupling.
CONCLUSIONS: The influence of manipulating task constraints and the individual nature of children with DCD must be considered by those involved in rehabilitation. By doing so, children with DCD may search for appropriate motor solutions to many functional movement tasks required for everyday life."
17364804,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17364804/,"PURPOSE: This study evaluates the benefits of targeted early rehabilitation at home after total hip or knee replacement surgery and analyses the cost effectiveness of such a scheme.
METHOD: Patients recovering from Total hip replacement (THR, n = 220) and Total knee replacement (TKR, n = 174) were assessed in a NHS District General Hospital setting. Suitability of patients for early rehabilitation at home scheme (RAHS) was assessed at the pre-operative clinic by rehabilitation team. Length of in-patient stay (LOSH), duration on the scheme, number of bed days saved, cost appraisal, readmission rates and complications were recorded.
RESULTS: Targeted early rehabilitation resulted in reduced hospital stay (from 14-8.17 days for THR and from 12-8.21 days for TKR), without any increase in complication rates. Significance testing revealed no statistical difference between the patient groups with regards to age, residence status, mobility and transfer ability on their length of stay in hospital or on the rehabilitation scheme. The patients who underwent total knee replacement required significantly more number of visits by the rehabilitation team than those who underwent total hip replacement (p value < 0.05). This resulted in an overall saving of pound 301,124 for the trust over the study period.
CONCLUSIONS: Targeted early rehabilitation resulted in reducing the length of hospital stay without an increase in complication rates. The use of such a scheme brought significant savings to the trust without an increase in readmission rates."
17365976,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17365976/,"BACKGROUND: We aimed to analyze influence of insulin dependency on short-term outcomes after OPCAB in patients with diabetes.
METHODS: Retrospective cohort study was planned based on chart review. Study population consisted of 148 diabetic cases (63 insulin-dependent diabetics in group I and 85 non-insulin-dependent diabetics in group II). Patients' preoperative data and risk factors for adverse outcomes are analysed. The primary endpoint was all causes of mortality during the in-hospital course. Preestablished secondary endpoints included all major postoperative complications, including non-fatal acute myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, sepsis, shock, mediastinitis, respiratory insufficiency, and renal insufficiency, and minor postoperative complications, including mechanical ventilation for more than 24 hours, inotropic support, reoperation for bleeding, and necessity of blood transfusion. Additional analysis was performed on the duration of stay in the intensive care unit and overall hospital stay.
RESULTS: Group I patients were significantly more likely to have hypertension (87.3% versus 82.5%, p=0.023), they also had a trend toward higher prevalence of hypercholesterolemia (71.4% versus 68.6%, p=0.092) and body mass index (28.1+/-4.2 versus 26.9+/-3.7, p=0.085). Angiographic characteristics and number of distal anastomosis were similar in the two groups. There was no significant difference in mortality during the in-hospital course as the primary endpoint. However, analysis in secondary endpoints revealed that group I patients were significantly more likely to have stroke (3.1% versus 2.3%, p=0.027), sternal wound infection (4.7% versus 3.4%, p=0.036) and atrial arrhythmia (28.3% versus 20.9%, p=0.021). Moreover, group I patients were significantly more likely to stay longer than 2 days in ICU (14.2% versus 11.6%, p=0.038). Higher prevalence of renal dysfunction was also observed in group I patients (7.9% versus 6.9%, p=0.069).
CONCLUSION: Similar to insulin dependent diabetes who had on-pump CABG, insulin dependent diabetes develop higher rate of major postoperative complications and stay longer in ICU after off-pump CABG."
17366333,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17366333/,"OBJECTIVE: Speeding tickets are the most commonly used tool to deter speeders, yet little is known about how speeding citations affect individual drivers' behavior over time. This study examined the effects of being cited for speeding and types of legal consequences on drivers' subsequent speeding citations, which are an indicator of speeding behavior.
METHODS: A cohort of 3,739,951 Maryland licensed drivers were identified and followed for one year. Drivers were categorized by whether or not they received a speeding citation in May 2002. Among those cited for speeding in May 2002, drivers were grouped by type of penalty (fines and points; probation before judgment [PBJ, which results in fines but no points]; or no legal consequences). The relative risks (RR) and 95 percent confidence intervals (CI) of receiving a speeding citation during follow-up were compared between drivers ticketed and not ticketed in May 2002, as well as among different penalty groups. Cox proportional hazards regression modeling was used to adjust for potential confounders, including age, gender, alcohol-impaired driving, and residence. Kaplan-Meier survival functions were used to examine timing of violations.
RESULTS: Young drivers and male drivers were more likely to receive a speeding citation. Drivers who received a speeding citation in May 2002 had almost twice the risk of receiving a speeding citation during follow-up, compared with those not cited for speeding that month (RR 1.6, 95% CI 1.52-1.68). Overall legal consequences had no significant effect on the risk of receiving a repeat speeding citation relative to ticketed drivers who escaped those consequences (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.84-1.15); however, stratified analyses showed a significant decrease in repeat citations among females (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.63-0.90) and drivers who received PBJ (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.67-0.96). Kaplan-Meier curves showed that the study group of speeders had a significantly shorter time between May 2002 until receipt of a speeding citation than controls. Among penalty groups, significantly shorter times until receipt of another citation were observed among drivers escaping consequences or receiving fines/points compared with drivers receiving fines/PBJ.
CONCLUSIONS: Drivers who receive speeding citations are at increased risk of receiving subsequent speeding citations, suggesting that speeding citations have limited effects on deterrence in the context of the current traffic enforcement system. When comparing different penalties, PBJ is associated with a reduced rate of recidivism more than stronger penalties; however, it is unclear whether the reduction primarily is attributable to the penalty itself or to characteristics of drivers receiving PBJ. Increasing drivers' perceptions that they are at risk of being caught speeding may improve the effectiveness of speeding law enforcement."
17366558,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17366558/,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of clinical varicocele on testicular microcirculation using spectral Doppler analysis.
METHODS: Forty-nine young and healthy volunteers were enrolled in this prospective study. Varicocele grades were determined according to sonographic parameters. Patients with left-sided clinical varicocele were classified as the patient group (n = 15), while the remaining patients served as controls (n = 34). Spectral Doppler measurements of testicular arteries (peak systolic/end diastolic velocity, resistance index, pulsatility index) were measured from capsular and intratesticular branches.
RESULTS: No statistically significant difference was found between the Doppler parameters obtained from the intratesticular branches of both testes and the capsular branches of the right testis. On the other hand, in left-sided clinical varicocele cases, the average resistance index (RI) and pulsatility index (PI) of capsular branches of the left testes (RI, 0.68 +/- 0.04; PI, 1.22 +/- 0.15) were significantly greater than in the control group (RI, 0.64 +/- 0.06; PI, 1.07 +/- 0.18) (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Increased RI and PI of capsular branches of testicular arteries on spectral Doppler examination may be an indicator of impaired testicular microcirculation in patients with clinical varicocele. Further studies addressing the correlations with sperm counts are needed to determine the cut-off values for these indices."
17367105,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17367105/,"OBJECTIVES: It is generally recognised that choices concerning treatment or screening should be people's own, autonomous decisions. However, in the context of genetic counselling, many studies found that counsellors deviate from nondirectiveness, or that subjective norm influences behaviour. The present study aimed to investigate whether prenatal counsellors (midwives, gynaecologists) influence pregnant women's decisions and their attitudes regarding prenatal screening. It was hypothesised that uptake rates and attitudes would be associated with the counsellor's attitude toward prenatal screening.
METHODS: Pregnant women attending their midwifery or gynaecology practice were asked to fill out postal questionnaires before and after they were offered prenatal screening for Down syndrome. Their prenatal counsellors also filled in a questionnaire. These questionnaires assessed attitudes toward prenatal screening and background variables. The study sample consisted of 945 pregnant women, being guided by 97 prenatal counsellors.
RESULTS: Multilevel regression analyses revealed that neither uptake rates, nor attitude toward prenatal screening were significantly predicted by counsellors' attitudes toward prenatal screening.
CONCLUSION: It is suggested that the advice these pregnant women were reported to have received, should rather be interpreted as an indication of shared decision-making and social support than of social pressure and undesired influence."

METHODS: A random sample of patient information on drug treatments published on the website of the main UK Diabetes charity was assessed for readability using two accepted measures and compared with articles from three national newspapers published the same day, in the setting of a hospital-based diabetes centre. The main outcome measures were Flesch-Reading Ease and Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scores available within Microsoft Office 2000.
RESULTS: Information provided for patients and medically related articles from two of three newspapers had suboptimal readability, requiring literacy skills well above the UK average.

17367526,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17367526/,"BACKGROUND: Doctors have a relatively high degree of emotional distress, but seek help to a lesser degree and at a later stage than other academic groups. This can be deleterious for themselves and for their patients. Prevention programs have therefore been developed but it is unclear to what extent they reach doctors in need of help. This study describes doctors who participated in a self-referrral, easily accessible, stress relieving, counselling program in Norway, and compares them with a nationwide sample of Norwegian doctors.
METHODS: Two hundred and twenty seven (94%) of the doctors, 117 women and 110 men, who came to the resort centre Villa Sana, Modum, Norway, between August 2003 and July 2005, agreed to participate in the study. Socio-demographic data, reasons for and ways of help-seeking, sick-leave, symptoms of depression and anxiety, job stress and burnout were assessed by self-reporting questionnaires.
RESULTS: Forty-nine percent of the Sana doctors were emotionally exhausted (Maslach) compared with 25% of all Norwegian doctors. However, they did not differ on empathy and working capacity, the other two dimensions in Maslach's burnout inventory. Seventy-three percent of the Sana doctors could be in need of treatment for depression or anxiety based on their symptom distress scores, compared with 14% of men and 18% of women doctors in Norway. Twenty-one percent of the Sana doctors had a history of suicidal thoughts, including how to commit the act, as compared to 10% of Norwegian doctors in general.
CONCLUSION: Sana doctors displayed a higher degree of emotional exhaustion, symptoms of depression and anxiety as well as job related stress, compared with all Norwegian doctors. This may indicate that the program at Villa Sana to a large extent reaches doctors in need of help. The counselling intervention can help doctors to evaluate their professional and private situation, and, when necessary, enhance motivation for seeking adequate treatment."
17367557,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17367557/,"BACKGROUND: Post-tonsillectomy morbidity statistics are obtained when patients present to hospital with complications. The two common morbidities are pain and haemorrhage. Hospital-recorded morbidity rates may be an underestimation, as some patients are treated by general practitioners and are therefore not included in hospital audits.
METHODS: Prospective, cohort, questionnaire study to assess: the post-tonsillectomy haemorrhage rate (i.e. actual rate versus hospital recorded rate); and the number of patients with post-operative pain and/or bleeding who were treated with antibiotics by their general practitioner.
RESULTS: The response rate was 76 per cent (70/92). The actual rate of secondary haemorrhage was three times that noted in the hospital records (15.7 vs 5.7 per cent, respectively). Fifteen patients (21 per cent) required extra analgesia after discharge. General practitioners prescribed antibiotics for pain alone in six patients (11 per cent).
CONCLUSION: The actual post-tonsillectomy haemorrhage rate is much higher than that recorded in hospital statistics. General practitioners differ in their treatment of post-tonsillectomy patients presenting with pain alone; some prescribe antibiotics in addition to analgesia."
17368360,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17368360/,"PURPOSE: This study was designed to evaluate decision making among Israeli, Eastern European, and South American dental school graduates in oral surgery issues.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: During a military dental convention, a survey was conducted among 85 dentists that included a questionnaire and a panoramic image presentation.
RESULTS: Removal of the mandibular third molar was recommended more often by the Israeli graduates, Eastern European dentists recommended less maxillary antagonist extraction, and South American graduates had the lowest rate of recommendation for extraction of a partially impacted mesioangular and distoangular mandibular third molar in a 19-year-old patient, and of a fully impacted horizontal mandibular third molar in 19- and 35-year-old patients. In all groups, more dentists recommended extraction of disease-free third molars in 35-year-old than in 19-year-old patients.
CONCLUSION: According to study results, decision making regarding third molar treatment is not evidence-based and is not rational. Further postgraduate education in this area is warranted."
17369520,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17369520/,"BACKGROUND: A randomized clinical has shown the effectiveness of intramuscular electrical stimulation for the treatment of poststroke shoulder pain.
OBJECTIVE: Identify predictors of treatment success and assess the impact of the strongest predictor on outcomes.
METHOD: This is a secondary analysis of a multisite randomized clinical trial of intramuscular electrical stimulation for poststroke shoulder pain. The study included 61 chronic stroke survivors with shoulder pain randomized to a 6-week course of intramuscular electrical stimulation (n = 32) versus a hemisling (n = 29). The primary outcome measure was Brief Pain Inventory Question 12. Treatment success was defined as > or = 2-point reduction in this measure at end of treatment and at 3, 6, and 12 months posttreatment. Forward stepwise regression was used to identify factors predictive of treatment success among participants assigned to the electrical stimulation group. The factor most predictive of treatment success was used as an explanatory variable, and the clinical trials data were reanalyzed.
RESULTS: Time from stroke onset was most predictive of treatment success. Subjects were divided according to the median value of stroke onset: early (<77 weeks) versus late (> 77 weeks). Electrical stimulation was effective in reducing poststroke shoulder pain for the early group (94% vs 7%, P < .001) but not for the late group (31% vs 33%). Repeated-measure analysis of variance revealed significant treatment (P < .001), time from stroke onset (P = .032), and treatment by time from stroke onset interaction (P < .001) effects.
CONCLUSIONS: Stroke survivors who are treated early after stroke onset may experience greater benefit from intramuscular electrical stimulation for poststroke shoulder pain. However, the relative importance of time from stroke onset versus duration of pain is not known."
17369677,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17369677/,"BACKGROUND: The role of sentinel lymph nodes in colorectal cancer remains unclear.
METHODS: Cryosections from central para-aortic mesenterial lymph nodes were stained using mAb BER-Ep4. Overall survival and distant recurrence were calculated using Kaplan-Meier plots.
RESULTS: All patients (n = 48) were free of distant metastases and curatively resected (R0). 23 pN0, 13 pN1 and 12 pN2 stages were found. 21/48 patients (44%) showed BER-Ep4+ cells in their central lymph nodes (7/23 pN0, 8/13 pN1, 6/12 pN2). In 6/23 pN0 patients, BER-Ep4+ cells were also found in locoregional nodes (p = 0.03, Fisher's exact test). pN status predicted overall survival (p = 0.006, Kaplan-Meier curve, log-rank test). An impact was exerted by central mesenteric BER-Ep4+ cells on overall survival (p = 0.009 in pN0 patients, p = 0.07 for all pN) and distant recurrence-free survival (p = 0.001 in pN0 patients, p = 0.007 for all pN). Multivariate analysis showed an independent prognostic effect on overall survival in pN0 patients (p = 0.022).
CONCLUSION: Central lymph nodes are sentinels of disease not amenable to extended lymphadenectomy and might identify patients at risk of distant organ recurrence."
17369759,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17369759/,"AIM AND METHODS: Are physicians and their relatives at risk of postoperative complications when they are scheduled for surgery? With the aim to answer this question, a case control study was performed from a cohort of 11,756 patients scheduled for surgery from 01/01/1987 to 12/31/2002. Fourty seven patients were physicians and 122 were a close relative to a physician. The percentage of physicians in the current series is comparable to that in the general urban population in France. Each of these patients was matched with 5 patients as controls regarding sex, age, diagnosis, procedure, and date of surgery.
RESULTS: No statistically significant difference was observed between the 47 physicians and their 235 controls in the occurence of postoperative complications: 6% vs 6% (Odds ratio (OR)=1,07; CI(95%): 0,28-3,74), unplanned return to the operative room: 2% vs 2% (OR=1,00; CI: 0,11-8,8), and postoperative mortality: 0% vs 0,5% (p=0,07). No stastistically significant difference was observed between the 122 close relatives to a physician and their 610 controls in the occurence of postoperative complications: 6% vs 6% (OR=1,00; CI: 0,43-2,3), unplanned return to the operative room: 2% vs 3% (OR=0,55; CI: 0,18-3,4), and postoperative mortality: 1% vs 0,5% (OR=1,67; CI: 0,13-12,12).
CONCLUSION: this study does not confirm the widespread opinion that postoperative course would be worse in physicians as patients and in their close relatives. Their recovery is not different from that to other patients if they are treated as well as other patients."
17370084,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17370084/,"BACKGROUND: A marginal ulcer developing after an initial operation for gastroduodenal ulcer is a serious threat to the patient, and a challenge to surgeons. Helicobacter pylori is the primary cause of peptic ulcer disease. However, its role in ulcer recurrence, especially of marginal ulcer (MU), after peptic ulcer surgery is unclear. This study aimed to determine any association between H. pylori infection and perforated MU by comparing the prevalence of H. pylori and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) use in patients with perforated (PMU) and in those with nonperforated MU (NPMU).
STUDY DESIGN: The study retrospectively evaluated the records of 16 patients with PMU who underwent surgical treatment and 24 patients with NPMU who underwent medical treatment in Atatürk University, School of Medicine, Department of General Surgery and Gastroenterology, between January 1995 and December 2004.
RESULTS: The rate of H. pylori in the PMU group was significantly higher than that of the NPMU group (P < 0.01). There was a significant relationship between NSAID consumption and PMU compared with NPMU patients (P < 0.01). There was also a significant relationship between NSAID consumption and H. pylori and PMU (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Eradication of H. pylori after the first PMU operation especially in cases with impaired hemodynamics, severe peritoneal contamination, and/or a diameter smaller than 1 cm and avoiding the use of NSAIDs will surely reduce the risk of relapsing ulcers."
17370138,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17370138/,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to measure the impact of hospitalisation on hypnotic and anxiolytic (HA) drug prescription, during and after hospitalisation.
METHOD: A descriptive study was carried out over three periods: before, during and after hospitalisation (three-month follow-up), examining the presence or absence of HA treatment at each stage. The HA drug list studied was selected using the World Health Organisation (WHO) Anatomical Therapeutic and Chemical (ATC) classification system. Trained final-year pharmacy students asked a series of structured questions during hospitalisation and postal questionnaires were sent to included patients one and three months after discharge. All the in-patient departments in the University Hospital of Besançon-France-were included, except units with pre-, peri-, and post-operative HA treatments. All in-patients present in the selected units on February 12, 2003, aged over 18, who gave their consent and were considered able to answer by the nursing team, were finally included.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: An eight-branch descriptive model, including the three study periods with two states (presence or absence of HA treatment) at each stage.
RESULTS: A total of 260 in-patients were included, and a further 112 (43%) completed the whole study (alive, non re-hospitalised, one- and three- months post discharge response). 48% (n = 260), 64% (n = 260) and 58% (n = 112) of the included patients had sleep disorder complaints respectively before, during and after hospitalisation. HA usage increased when comparing pre- and during hospitalisation (33% vs. 51%; n = 112; p < 0.0001) and decreased when comparing during hospitalisation and post-discharge (51% vs. 43%; n = 112; p < 0.0001). The descriptive model showed an overall persistence of treatment induced by hospital stay in 5.35% of the patients.
CONCLUSION: Hospital appeared to have a significant impact on delayed HA use in the French general population. Our results should incite hospital prescribers to transversally reconsider the whole sleep disorder treatment strategy in hospital settings, from improving patient's accommodation conditions, to working out a consensus on the justification of prescription of HA and precising the exact place of nursing team in sleep disorders management."

17371633,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17371633/,"INTRODUCTION: The prevention of disorders in social communication and attention is hampered by the lack of effective tools to screen in the first year of living. In Denmark public health nurses perform screening of physical and mental health in all infants, and at the age of 8-10 months a standardised test, BOEL, is performed to screen for hearing loss plus social communication and attention disturbances.
METHOD: The predictive value of abnormal reactions at the BOEL test at 8-10 months of age was investigated in a subpopulation of 211 children from the CCCC 2000. Predictions were calculated in relation to outcome concerning psychopathological disturbances in social communication and attention, diagnosed by child psychiatric assessment at 18 months.
RESULTS: Communication and attention disturbances at 18 months were predicted by the BOEL test with predictive validity of positive test (PV pos) 29%, and the predictive validity of negative test (PV neg) 95%. The BOEL test was found superior to the general clinical judgement by the public health nurses.
CONCLUSION: The infant mental health screening by public health nurses seems to have potential concerning early identification of social communication and attention disturbances by using the BOEL test, but investigations of larger populations and with a longer time of observation are needed."
17371680,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17371680/,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the stage-related clinical features of 8th cranial nerve schwannoma.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: Descriptive study of 71 patients whose diagnosis and/or treatment have been carried out at our centre between 1997-2003. Gender, age, and symptoms were considered, with special attention to gender. Determination of tumoral stage following Tos and Thomsen image criteria.
RESULTS: The mean age was 64.6 (range, 20-87) with a marked incidence between 52 and 70 years (62 % of the whole), slightly higher in females and in the left ear. The main symptoms were those derived from involvement of the 7th and 8th cranial nerves, with other cranial nerves and cerebello-pontine structures being involved in larger tumours, although a high variability was noted in clinical patterns of same-stage cases and in the first symptom. Our study also found a high variability in hearing conservation and a marked frequency of vestibular or facial (motor and sensory) symptoms. There were also very infrequent forms of presentation that are highlighted.
CONCLUSIONS: There is no typical clinical pattern and no typical first symptom in 8th cranial nerve schwannomas. Any audiovestibular or facial symptom, even the slightest, may be the first expression of 8th cranial nerve schwannoma. There is no stage-specific symptom except for those with involvement of the cerebello-pontine or cerebral structures."
17372294,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17372294/,"BACKGROUND: Previous research has shown an association between cumulative economic hardships and various health outcomes. However, the cumulative effects of economic hardships in regard to gender differences have not been given enough attention.
METHODS: 1981 women and 1799 men were followed up over a period of 16 years (1981-1997), using data from the Swedish Survey of Living Conditions panel study. The temporal association between economic hardships and self-rated health, psychological distress and musculoskeletal disorders was analysed.
RESULTS: A dose-response effect on women's health was observed with increasing scores of cumulative exposure to financial stress but not with low income. Women exposed to financial stress at both T(1) and T(2) had an increased risk of 1.4-1.6 for all health measures compared with those who were not exposed. A similar consistent dose-response effect was not observed among men.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a temporal relationship between cumulative economic hardships and health outcomes, and health effects differ by gender. Financial stress seems to be a stronger predictor of poor health outcomes than low income, particularly among women. Policies geared towards reducing health inequalities should recognise that long-term exposure to economic hardships damages health, and actions need to be taken with a gender perspective."
17372295,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17372295/,"OBJECTIVES: To identify areas of Britain whose residents have relatively low age specific mortality, despite experiencing long-term economic adversity.
METHODS: Longitudinal, ecological study of all residents of Britain from 1971 to 2001.
RESULTS: 54 of Britain's 641 parliamentary constituencies were identified as having been persistently economically disadvantaged in the period 1971-2001. Within this group, there was marked variation in age group specific mortality and in the age ranges with relatively high or low mortality. A systematic scoring process identified 18 constituencies as providing strong and consistent evidence of low mortality across a range of age groups, relative to the 54 constituencies as a whole. These 18 were labelled ""resilient"". Among age groups >24 years, mortality rates in the resilient areas were significantly lower than in the other economically disadvantaged areas. For example, at ages 45-59 years, the average all cause mortality rate in the resilient constituencies was 607 per 100 000 population (95% CI 574 to 641) and 728 (670 to 787) in the non-resilient constituencies (p = 0.013).
CONCLUSIONS: Areas with similar adverse economic histories do not all have similarly high mortality rates. It is unlikely that a single factor explains these results. Selective migration cannot be discounted as an explanation, but particular sociocultural features of areas (including the political, economic, ethnic and religious characteristics of their population) may also be protective."
17372794,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17372794/,"CONTEXT: Disease management programs are increasingly used to manage costs of patients with chronic disease.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine the clinical characteristics and measure the health care expenditures of patients most likely to be targeted by disease management programs.
DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of prospectively obtained data.
SETTING: A general medicine practice with both faculty and residents at an urban academic medical center.
PARTICIPANTS: Five thousand eight hundred sixty-one patients enrolled in the practice for at least 1 year.
MAIN OUTCOMES: Annual cost of diseases targeted by disease management.
MEASUREMENTS: Patients' clinical and demographic information were collected from a computer system used to manage patients. Data included diagnostic information, medications, and resource usage over 1 year. We looked at 10 common diseases targeted by disease management programs.
RESULTS: Unadjusted annual median costs for chronic diseases ranged between $1,100 and $1,500. Congestive heart failure ($1,500), stroke ($1,500), diabetes ($1,500), and cancer ($1,400) were the most expensive. As comorbidity increased, annual adjusted costs increased exponentially. Those with comorbidity scores of 2 or more accounted for 26% of the population but 50% of the overall costs.
CONCLUSIONS: Costs for individual chronic conditions vary within a relatively narrow range. However, the costs for patients with multiple coexisting medical conditions increase rapidly. Reducing health care costs will require focusing on patients with multiple comorbid diseases, not just single diseases. The overwhelming impact of comorbidity on costs raises significant concerns about the potential ability of disease management programs to limit the costs of care."
17372863,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17372863/,"BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIM: The total number of upper gastrointestinal endoscopies is increasing, and despite guidelines for endoscopy referral for general practitioners, the proportion of patients found to have no endoscopic abnormalities is still up to 60% (and increasing). The aim of this study was to assess the association between general practitioners' referral indications and endoscopic findings.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: General practitioners of patients referred for an open-access endoscopy between January 2002 and December 2004 were asked to specify the reason for referral on a specially designed form. The relative frequency of patients actually having an endoscopic abnormality was assessed for each referral indication.
RESULTS: A total of 1298 people were included in the study. A relevant endoscopic abnormality was found in 48% of patients. Patients with an endoscopic abnormality were not more often referred with ""alarm"" symptoms or failure of empirical treatment than patients without an abnormal endoscopic finding (31% with an endoscopic abnormality vs. 30% without an endoscopic abnormality had alarm symptoms; 57% of people in both groups experienced failure of empirical treatment). Referral with alarm symptoms had a positive predictive value of 4% for cancer (prevalence 2%; P < 0.01), and referral with reflux-like symptoms had a positive predictive value of 33% for finding reflux esophagitis (prevalence 22%; P < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: General practitioners' referral indications for open-access endoscopy did not add any relevant predictive value for endoscopic findings in comparison with what might have been expected from overall prevalence. Only alarm symptoms slightly increased the probability of finding cancer and only reflux-like symptoms slightly increased the probability of finding reflux esophagitis."
17373120,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17373120/,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to analyze the course of labor of grand multiparas (4 deliveries and more) in comparison to multiparas (2 or 3 deliveries).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A group of 400 grand multiparas were included in the study and compared with a group of 393 multiparas. All the deliveries took place in the City Hospital in Puck in the years 1998-2002. The age of parturients, duration of pregnancy, pregnancy accompanying pathologies, course and way of delivery, indications for cesarean section, complications of labor and newborns' condition were taken into account and analyzed statistically.
RESULTS: It occurred that grand multiparas were significantly more often countryside dwellers, experienced preterm deliveries, gained less weight during pregnancy and amniorrhexis took place in a more advanced 1st stage of labor. Perineal ruptures and episiotomies were significantly less frequent in the study group. Moreover, grand multiparas preferred traditional form of labor, more rarely deciding on water labor, despite its common access. There were no differences as to the duration of labor stages, accompanying pathologies, the use of oxytocin, postpartum curettage and newborns' condition.
CONCLUSIONS: Grand multiparity seems not to be an independent risk factor of obstetrical complications and should not be considered dangerous in centers with well organized modern perinatal care."
17373244,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17373244/,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the level of surgical training of French interns with that of interns in other European countries.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between 2005 and 2006, an exhaustive questionnaire (www.esnz.net) was sent to 288 young urologists in 30 different European countries. Interns were classified into 3 groups: France (group 1, n = 28), Western Europe (group 2, n = 75) and Eastern Europe (group 3, n = 85). Items concerning surgical practice were analysed.
RESULTS: The mean age of the interns was 30.8 years (25.7-35.8), 34.6 years (27.4-48.0) and 31.3 years (25.3-51.3) in groups 1 to 3, respectively. The mean number of months of urology training was 28 months (6-60), 44 months (6-72) and 37 months (2-120), respectively. The mean of weekly working time was 70 hours (40-90), 60 hours (35-90) and 65 hours (40-100). French interns were technically more at ease than interns in groups 2 or 3 for all surgical procedures (open, laparoscopic, endourological). Certain criteria were significantly (p < 0.05) associated with a better level of technical skills: the number of weekly working hours, the small number of interns per department, the diversity of internships, the use of the intern record and the presence of an active tutor
CONCLUSION: French interns appear to learn urological surgical procedures more easily than other European interns. However the scientific training of interns must also be evaluated in order to propose a global assessment system of urology training in Europe."
17373977,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17373977/,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the frequency and the specificity of nail changes associated with connective tissue diseases (CTD).
METHODS: In a case-control study, 190 patients including those with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; 56), rheumatoid arthritis (RA, 47), primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS; 35), systemic sclerosis (SSc; 39), and dermatomyositis/polymyositis (DM/PM; 13) were enrolled in the study. Patients with SLE and other CTDs were compared with two different control groups. Twenty nails were examined. Nail features were noted and classified. Nail samples were collected for mycological cultures.
RESULTS: In patients with SLE, erythema of proximal nailfold (P<0.01), splinter haemorrhages in fingernails (P<0.01), capillary loops in proximal nailfold (P<0.05), periungual erythema (P<0.05), and thin nail plates (P<0.05) were more common than those in controls. Only splinter haemorrhages were associated with the disease activity. In patients with SSc and DM/PM, splinter haemorrhages (P<0.05) and capillary loops in proximal nailfold (P<0.01) in fingernails were common as well. Increase in longitudinal curvature (P<0.001), transverse curvature (P<0.01), and white dull colour in fingernails were other frequent findings in patients with SSc. Increase in transverse curvature was associated with the disease activity in SSc. In patients with RA, splinter haemorrhages (P<0.05), red lunula (P<0.05), and white dull colour (P<0.05) in fingernails were frequent. The sensitivity values of all these changes were very low. However, their specificity values were found to be relatively high.
CONCLUSION: Proximal nailfold is the most important site of affection in CTDs. These nail changes can be used in combination with highly sensitive diagnostic modalities to establish an accurate diagnosis."
17374600,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17374600/,"BACKGROUND: Valproate (VPA) is an antiepileptic drug with a broad spectrum of efficacy. Although usually well-tolerated, it may have side-effects of which encephalopathy is one of the most serious.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical characteristics of valproate encephalopathy (VE) in five older patients with remote symptomatic seizures treated with rapid VPA loading.
DESIGN: Case series.
SETTING: Teaching hospital
PATIENTS: Five patients (71-89 years old) with underlying cerebrovascular disease or dementia and symptomatic seizures.
RESULTS: VE was characterised by decline in conscious level and (in some cases) increase in seizure frequency. Three of the five patients had elevated ammonia levels. EEG showed generalised slow activity, in some cases accompanied by additional epileptic discharges. The condition was reversible in four patients after VPA discontinuation. One patient died.
CONCLUSIONS: Older people may be at particular risk of VE because of co-morbid pathology, age-related metabolic changes and co-medication."
17374797,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17374797/,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to compare the differences between prescribed and delivered energy among critically ill children and to identify the factors that impede the optimal delivery of enteral nutrition in the first 5 days of nutrition support.
METHODS: In a prospective cohort study, we evaluated 55 critically ill children aged 8.2 +/- 11.4 months (0-162.3 months), who were fed for > or =2 days through a gastric or postpyloric tube. The patients were followed from admission until day 10 of enteral nutrition. Prescribed and delivered energy were recorded daily and compared with each other and with the estimated basal metabolic rate (BMR). The Paediatric Index of Mortality 2 (PIM 2) was used to estimate illness severity.
RESULTS: The ratio of delivered:required energy was <90% in 55.7% of the enteral nutrition days. Low prescription was the main reason for not achieving the energy goal in the first 5 days of enteral nutrition. Discrepancies between prescribed and delivered: energy were attributable to interruptions in feeding caused by clinical instability, airway management, radiologic and surgical procedures, and accidental feeding tube removal. The other factors associated with the delivery of less than required energy were PIM 2 > or =15%, gastrointestinal complications, dialysis, and use of alpha-adrenergic vasoactive drugs. The latter was the only variable in multivariate analysis that was associated with not ultimately achieving energy goal.
CONCLUSIONS: The prescription and delivery of energy were not adequate in >50% of enteral nutrition days. The gap between the effective administration and energy requirements can be explained by both underprescription and underdelivery. Administration of vasoactive drugs was the only variable independently associated with a low energy supply."
17375218,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17375218/,"PURPOSE: To evaluate tissue lesions, especially those of the intestinal innervation, in an excluded jejunal loop subjected to ischemia and reperfusion in rats.
METHODS: To evaluate the role of ischemia and reperfusion lesions in an excluded intestinal loop, four groups of 20 rats were set up: control group (GCEI7) and three experimental groups (GIREI7, GIREI14 and GIREI28). They were all subjected to exclusion of an intestinal segment of six centimeters in length, at a distance of 10 centimeters from the Treitz angle. The 60 animals in the three experimental groups were additionally subjected to ischemia of the vascular pedicle for 30 minutes. The control group and the experimental group GIREI7 were evaluated on the 7th day after the operation. The groups GIREI14 and GIREI28 (which also underwent ischemia) were utilized to evaluate the evolution of the lesion over time, on the 14th and 28th days after the operation, respectively. From the intestinal excluded loop, we take one ring of 0,5 cm distal and proximal, that were fixed in formaline 10% solution in order to do histological (HE) and immuno-hystochemial (PS-100) evaluation (enteric nervous system.) The distal loop was exteriorized in stoma and the proximal part closed with polipropilene 6-0.
RESULTS: It was observed a decrease in the number of ganglionic cells in the myenteric plexus in the group subjected to ischemia and reperfusion (GIREI7), in relation to the control group (GCEI7) at the 7th post-operative day (Mann-Whitney test: p = 0.0173 *. Comparing the numbers of ganglionic cells in the myenteric plexus before and after jejunal loop exclusion GCEI7 - (Wilcoxon test: p = 0.0577). GIREI7 - Comparing the numbers of ganglionic cells in the myenteric plexus before and after ischemia (*p = 0.0399). Comparing the percentage variations in ganglionic cells in the myenteric plexus on the 7th, 14th and 28th days after the procedure, in the groups GIREI7, GIREI14 and GIREI28, it was observed that there were no significant alterations. Kruskal-Wallis test: p = 0.6501.
CONCLUSION: There was a decrease in the number of ganglionic cells in the myenteric plexus due to ischemia and reperfusion that did not recover in the late post-operative period."
17375363,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17375363/,"UNLABELLED: Peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) is the preferred and gentlest type of dialysis in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). One of the most frequent complications following peritoneal dialysis catheter (P-catheter) placement is malfunction owing to displacement, which frequently entails major problems for the patient, including reoperation and the risk of having to switch to haemodialysis. Consequently, to ensure optimal P-catheter function and reduce patient morbidity, it is essential to develop and assess new surgical techniques for dialysis catheter placement. The objective of this survey is to describe and assess a laparoscopic-assisted procedure for P-catheter placement.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Survey of laparoscopic-assisted P-catheter placements performed during a one-year period. The study describes the operative procedure, catheter function and complications. Furthermore, a comparison with open surgery performed in the period is made.
RESULTS: One of nine P-catheters inserted using laparoscopic-assisted surgery under general anaesthesia was displaced while four of 13 P-catheters inserted using traditional open surgery under local anaesthesia were displaced. The five displaced catheters were subsequently fixed laparoscopically under general anaesthesia.
CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic P-catheter placement is uncomplicated, quick and reduces P-catheter displacement frequency. Drawbacks include costly equipment and the need for general anaesthesia. Future follow-up will reveal whether laparoscopically placed P-catheters yield longer-lasting and better-functioning catheters than traditionally placed P-catheters."
17375891,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17375891/,"OBJECTIVE: Exercise electrocardiography is commonly available and a cost-effective test and therefore is widely used for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease. However, false positivity remains an important problem resulting in many unnecessary coronary angiographic examinations. In this study, we aimed to test the hypothesis that post-exercise B-type natriuretic peptides secreted in response to transient myocardial ischaemia induced by exercise, add any further information on positive test results.
METHODS: Patients who underwent exercise electrocardiography with the suspicion of coronary artery disease were screened and those with positive test results based on standard electrocardiography criteria were selected. Blood samples for B-type natriuretic peptides were obtained within 5 minutes after exercise test. Patients included in the study had preserved left ventricular function on echocardiography. At least 70% stenosis of one epicardial coronary artery on coronary angiography was diagnosed as significant coronary artery disease.
RESULTS: Of the 55 patients (age 59.8 +/- 7.6 y; 48 men) included in the study 29 had (52.7%) coronary artery disease requiring revascularization (CAD+) and 26 (47.3%) did not have significant coronary artery disease (CAD-). The cardiovascular risk factor profile of CAD+ and CAD- patients were similar (all p > 0.05). The median post-exercise B-type natriuretic peptide level was significantly higher in CAD+ (47.20 pg/ml) than CAD- patients (18.90 pg/ml) (P = 0.001). The sensitivity and specificity of a post-exercise B-type natriuretic peptide level > 30 pg/ml for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease in exercise test positive patients were calculated as 72% and 69%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The measurement of post-exercise B-type natriuretic peptide levels may increase the diagnostic value of positive exercise electrocardiography."
17376048,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17376048/,"BACKGROUND: Aperistalsis with complete lower esophageal sphincter (LES) relaxation, characterized by the complete relaxation of the LES and aperistalsis of the esophageal body on manometry, has been considered by some authors to be an early manifestation of classic achalasia, which is defined as incomplete relaxation of the LES and aperistalsis of the esophageal body. The aim of the present study was to compare the clinical features of patients with aperistalsis with complete LES relaxation, with those of patients with classic achalasia.
METHODS: Eighteen patients with aperistalsis with complete LES relaxation and 53 patients with classic achalasia were analyzed with regard to clinical history, the maximal diameter of the esophageal body on barium esophagogram, LES resting pressure and the duration of LES relaxation on manometric recordings, and the selected treatment and its efficacy.
RESULTS: The aperistalsis with complete LES relaxation group had distinctly different features compared to those of the classic achalasia group including older age, more frequent association with non-cardiac chest pain, less frequent association with dysphagia and weight loss, lower LES resting pressures, and longer duration of LES relaxation. However, the two groups were similar in terms of maximal diameter of the esophageal body, and efficacy associated with pneumatic dilation.
CONCLUSIONS: Aperistalsis with complete LES relaxation on manometry is not necessarily an early manifestation of classic achalasia. However, this condition does not preclude a diagnosis of achalasia or a good response to achalasia therapy."
17376127,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17376127/,"BACKGROUND: A previous epidemiological survey from an American referral clinic noted a high incidence of neurological symptoms among patients with type I (non-neuronopathic) Gaucher disease all of whom were treated with specific enzyme replacement.
OBJECTIVES: The current study replicates the above in a larger cohort of Ashkenazi Jewish patients with at least one N370S mutation which has been assumed to be protective of neurological involvement. About half the patients had mild disease and were untreated. Methods - Self-reporting questionnaires were sent to patients and their significant others as socio-economically matched controls.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference between groups in incidence of concomitant diseases and medications, except patients who reported a significantly higher incidence of vitamin B(12) deficiency and gammopathies. Patients reported significantly higher incidence of virtually all symptoms and signs of peripheral neuropathy and a significantly higher number of symptoms than controls (mean 4.4 vs 2.4).
CONCLUSIONS: The conclusion of this study, as of the seminal study, is that the high incidence of neurological complaints in patients with the non-neuronopathic form of Gaucher disease should be viewed in the context of concomitant illnesses, specifically, vitamin B(12) deficiency and gammopathies, regardless of the need for enzyme replacement therapy."
17376610,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17376610/,"OBJECTIVES: In a retrospective study of bilateral Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS), cases were analysed to determine the relationship between the two events.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: From 1971 to 2001, among 812 patients with DCIS in Bergonie Institute, 78 suffering from bilateral DCIS and only19 were treated entirely in our institute. It was either synchronous DCIS or asynchronous (before 6 months). We realised a comparative study between, clinical and pathological characteristics of each DCIS.
RESULTS: In case of asynchronous DCIS, contra lateral DCIS occurred after a median 75-months period and until 22 years after the first event. We found at least for one histological subtype an agreement in 53% of cases. In 31% of cases, the grade was the same. For low plus intermediary grade versus high grade, the agreement was 53%. There was a subtype and grade agreement of 32% and a subtype or grade agreement in 63% of cases.
CONCLUSION: Histological agreement between the two lesions indicated the possible existence of in situ bilateral disease in these women. The local relapse rate was 20% and all of them were invasive. The risk of relapse in controlateral breast is high and patient needs a long follow up even in case of mastectomy."
17376937,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17376937/,"OBJECTIVE: To explore how the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine controversy impacted on the lives of parents caring for children with autism.
DESIGN: Qualitative focus group study.
SETTING: United Kingdom.
PATIENTS: A purposively selected sample of 38 parents took part in 10 focus group discussions between March 2003 and May 2005.
RESULTS: Many parents felt that the MMR vaccine could be too potent for children who are susceptible to developing autism. Of the parents whose children received the MMR vaccine, many felt guilty that they may have caused or contributed to their child's autism. Some parents felt frustrated by health professionals' lack of understanding of the negative impact the MMR controversy has had on them. Some parents were anxious about subsequent MMR decision-making for their children.
CONCLUSIONS: The controversy has had a negative impact on some parents of children with autism. This has implications for health professionals, who need to be particularly aware of the issues these parents face in future MMR decision-making for their affected child and younger siblings. It is anticipated that these findings will raise awareness among health professionals of the difficulties faced by such parents. More generally, there is a need to promote a greater awareness of the important role health visitors can play in parental decision-making and for research examining whether health professionals feel they receive sufficient training in communication skills. It is also essential that the latest scientific research findings are disseminated quickly to these parents and to those health professionals advising parents on matters of vaccine safety."
17377056,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17377056/,"OBJECTIVE: We believe that many studies in the literature show a falsely elevated specificity for carotid MR angiography (MRA) in the detection of high-grade stenosis. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that inclusion of a substantial proportion of normal carotid arteries in a study population will falsely elevate the specificity of MRA for confirming a high-grade carotid artery stenosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-seven carotid arteries were evaluated in 63 patients suspected of having a high-grade carotid stenosis, and all vessels were evaluated with contrast-enhanced MRA. Two subgroups were created, and the specificity of MRA was calculated for each group using digital subtraction angiography (DSA) as the gold standard. Group 1 included 44 vessels classified as high-grade stenosis on sonography and all were evaluated with DSA. To test our hypothesis, group 2 included the 44 carotid arteries from group 1 plus 33 carotid arteries classified as normal or minimally narrowed on sonography and MRA.
RESULTS: In group 1, the specificity of MRA for accurately confirming a high-grade stenosis was 29% for contrast-enhanced maximum-intensity-projection (MIP) images alone and 75% for contrast-enhanced axially reformatted source images as compared with DSA. When the 33 normal arteries from group 2 were added to the data set, the specificities increased to 70% and 89%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The calculated specificity of MRA as a confirmatory test for high-grade carotid stenosis is highly dependent on the proportion of normal carotid arteries included in the calculation. Based on our results, the specificity of MRA reported in the literature has likely been overstated because of spectrum bias."
17377180,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17377180/,"PURPOSE: To determine if there is a difference in intervention patency for central venous stenosis (CVS) and occlusion between patients with autogenous hemodialysis fistulas and those with grafts.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective study was performed from March 1998 to September 2005 identifying all patients with autogenous fistulas and synthetic grafts who underwent percutaneous angioplasty and/or stent placement for CVS. This study cohort consisted of 38 patients (22 with fistulas and 16 with grafts). Age, sex, type of access, location and side of the access, location and side of the CVS, presence of diabetes, previous hemodialysis catheter placement, date and type of interventions, and outcomes were recorded. The patency of each intervention was estimated by using the Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Univariate and multivariate analysis of the variables were performed.
RESULTS: Eighty-nine interventions were performed; 83 were angioplasties and six were stent placements. Previous catheter placement on the side of the CVS occurred in 29 of the 38 patients (76%). Technical and clinical success of the interventions were 93.3% and 94.4% respectively. The intervention or primary patency rates +/- standard errors at 3, 6, and 9 months in the fistula group were 88.5% +/- 4.8, 59.4% +/- 7.6, and 46% +/- 7.9, respectively. In the graft group, the rates were 78.1% +/- 7.3, 40.7% +/- 9, and 16% +/- 7.3, respectively. With multivariate analysis, intervention patency remained significantly longer for fistulas (P .014) and in patients who did not have a previous catheter (P .001).
CONCLUSION: Longer intervention-free survival for CVS was observed in patients with autogenous fistulas compared with grafts and in patients who did not previously undergo hemodialysis catheter insertion."

METHODS: A forceps is attached to the PHANToM Premium 6DOF's stylus. By manipulating the forceps one can touch virtual objects. Nine subjects participated in this study. First, an object with certain stiffness kg, is presented: the subject can touch and learn its stiffness for 15 seconds. Then, following 15 seconds intermission, 20 objects with gradually different stiffness are presented. The subject touches these objects and chooses one of them, that has the same stiffness as the object presented before the intermission. This test is repeated 16 times for different kg.
RESULTS: The average 'remembered' stiffness kr is in close agreement with the given stiffness kg, but its variation is large (0,12<SD/kg<0.60).
CONCLUSIONS: We can roughly remember the object's stiffness from force-feedback through a forceps."
17377865,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17377865/,"BACKGROUND: The extent and the necessity of lymph node dissection has yet to be defined after resectional surgery for lung cancer. We aimed to analyze the lobe-specific extent of lymph node positivity in patients who underwent preoperative mediastinoscopy as a routine strategy.
METHODS: A total of 280 patients with non-small cell lung cancer with negative mediastinoscopy were operated on in our center between January 1997 and June 2003. Hilar and mediastinal lymphadenectomy was performed in every patient.
RESULTS: The most commonly involved lymph nodes were found to be paratracheal station lymph nodes (n = 83; 96.5 %) for right upper lobe tumors, subcarinal station lymph nodes (n = 52; 88.1 %) for right lower lobe carcinomas, aorticopulmonary lymph nodes (n = 62; 92.5 %) for left upper lobe and subcarinal station lymph nodes (n = 49; 96.0 %) for left lower lobe tumors. In the patients with right upper lobe, right lower lobe and left lower lobe tumors, the presence of a tumor at these stations was found to be an indicator for poor prognosis ( P = 0.033, P = 0.0038 and P = 0.0016, respectively). Patients with multiple station N2 disease did not survive beyond 3 years.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients who underwent routine mediastinoscopy, lobe-specific lymph node dissection could be recommended. Patients with multilevel N2 involvement did not seem to benefit from resectional surgery."
17377872,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17377872/,"PURPOSE: We examined how often ultrasound-guided core needle biopsies of lymph nodes yield subclassification of malignant lymphoma according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria and help to avoid excisional biopsies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The prospective study included 124 consecutive patients in whom 126 core needle biopsies of lymph nodes were performed to diagnose or rule out malignant lymphoma. If possible, we obtained 5 cylinders with a 14-gauge (G) needle. The pathologists of our institution, partly in cooperation with a lymphoma registry, decided whether a core needle biopsy was sufficient for subclassification or an excisional biopsy was necessary.
RESULTS: 95 of the 126 core needle biopsies (76.6 %) were performed with a 14-G needle. In 101 biopsies (80.2 %), we obtained at least 5 cylinders. In 120 of the 126 core needle biopsies (95 %), malignant lymphoma was diagnosed and subclassified or ruled out. Of the 64 lymphoma, 60 (94 %) were subclassified. Among them were 41 (93 %) of the 44 primary lymphomas and 19 (95 %) of the 20 recurrent lymphomas. In 5 of 126 cases (4 %), an excisional biopsy was necessary.
CONCLUSION: With ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy of lymph nodes, lymphoma can be reliably diagnosed and subclassified if preferably 5 cores are obtained with 14-G needles. Excisional biopsy is rarely necessary if core needle biopsy is inconclusive."
17377880,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17377880/,"HISTORY AND CLINICAL FINDINGS: A 69-year-old woman, who was being treated for a bipolar affective psychosis, was admitted because of abdominal pain, emesis and bloody stool.
EXAMINATIONS: Blood tests showed increased inflammation parameters. Ultrasound revealed a swollen intestinal wall. Coloscopy correlated with the ultrasound findings and demonstrated an ischemic colitis. The histological report at first corroborated this as the possible diagnosis. But angiography of the mesenteric vessels and duplex ultrasound of the cervical vessels were normal. COURSE AND THERAPY: The symptoms persisted under therapy with acetylsalicylic acid (100 mg daily), no food intake and intravenous fluids. The coloscopic picture and the laboratory tests remained unchanged. The findings did not normalize until most of the antipsychotic drugs, especially perazine, were discontinued. The angiographic and duplexultrasound results spoke against the initially suspected diagnosis of an ischemic origin, but for necrotizing colitis as an adverse effect of perazine. A second biopsy confirmed this explanation.
CONCLUSION: A necrotizing colitis as an adverse effect of drugs can simulate an ischemic colitis on endoscopy and in a biopsy. Even if the clinical pattern is present possible adverse reaction to the medication should be considered. The diagnosis of a necrotizing colitis was postulated only after the course of the disease had been taken into account and, in particular, atherosclerosis had been excluded as a possible cause, and an adverse reaction to the medication had been considered."

RESEARCH DESIGN: Descriptive, retrospective study.
METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Medical chart reviews of all patients admitted to a rehabilitation hospital following severe brain injury.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: Twenty-five patients met the inclusion criteria, 22 had a tracheostomy, and all were NPO. Subjects were divided into two cohorts. Group 1, n=10, mean age 43.5 years, received oral feedings early in coma recovery. Group 2, n=15, mean age 45.2 years, did not. Group 1, 30% returned to an oral diet of three meals daily at discharge from inpatient rehabilitation as compared to 40% in group 2 (chi2 = 0.260, p = 0.610). Average cost of care for group 1 = US$45 759 and group 2 = US$41 056 (p = 0.634).
CONCLUSION: Safe therapeutic oral feedings, in accordance with findings from instrumental swallowing examinations, are possible for patients with disordered consciousness. The therapeutic oral feedings do not significantly increase the cost of care, but the effectiveness of oral feedings early in coma recovery requires further investigation."
17378719,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17378719/,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of vaginal misoprostol versus dinoprostone for induction of labor (IOL) in patients with preeclampsia according to the WHO criteria.
STUDY DESIGN: Ninety-eight patients were retrospectively analyzed. A total of 47 patients received 3 mg dinoprostone suppositories every 6 h (max. 6 mg/24 h) whereas 51 patients in the misoprostol group received either 50 mug misoprostol vaginally every 12 h, or 25 mug every 6 h (max. 100 mug/24 h). Primary outcomes were vaginal delivery within 24 and 48 h, respectively.
RESULTS: The probability of delivering within 48 h was more than three-fold higher in the misoprostol than in the dinoprostone group: odds ratio (OR)=3.48; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.24, 10.30, whereas no significant difference was observed within 24 h (P=0.34). No correlation was seen between a ripe cervix prior to IOL and delivery within 24/48 h (P=0.33 and P=1.0, respectively). More cesarean sections were performed in the dinoprostone group due to failed IOL (P=0.0009). No significant differences in adverse maternal outcome were observed between both study groups, whereas more neonates (12 vs. 6) of the dinoprostone group were admitted to the NICU (P=0.068).
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that misoprostol may have some advantages compared to dinoprostone, including improved efficacy and lower cost of the drug, even in cases of preeclampsia."
17378779,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17378779/,"BACKGROUND: Increases in positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) are often associated with cardiovascular depression, responding to fluid loading. Therefore, we hypothesized that if stroke volume (SV) is reduced by an increase in PEEP this reduction is an indicator of hypovolemia or preload responsiveness, i.e. that SV would increase by fluid administration at zero end-expiratory pressure (ZEEP). The relationship between the cardiovascular response to different PEEP levels and fluid load as well as the relation between change in SV as a result of change in preload (Frank-Starling relationship) were evaluated in a porcine model. In addition, other measures of fluid status were assessed.
METHODS: Eight, 20-22 kg, anesthetized, mechanically ventilated pigs were subjected to 0, 10, and 20 cm H(2)O PEEP at 10% (of estimated blood volume) hypovolemia, normo- and 10% hypervolemia, and to ZEEP at 20% hypervolemia. SV, cardiac output, intrathoracic blood volume and airway, esophageal, vascular pressures, stroke volume variations, left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic areas and respiratory variations in the diameter of the inferior vena cava were obtained.
RESULTS: At hypovolemia and normovolemia, 10 cm H(2)O PEEP induced a significant decrease in SV, while no change occurred at 10% hypervolemia. SV measured at ZEEP increased from hypovolemia to normovolemia and 10% hypervolemia, while no change was found between 10% and 20% hypervolemia. The sensitivity and specificity decrease in SV by PEEP indicating an increase in SV by fluids was 60-88% and 67%, respectively, depending on the volemic (preload) levels.
CONCLUSION: Although the overall results suggest that a change in SV by PEEP might predict preload responsiveness, the individual response of SV by 10 cm H(2)O PEEP and of the successive fluid administration seemed to be dependent on where on the Frank-Starling curve the heart function was located."
17378818,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17378818/,"OBJECTIVES: To document trends in serum screening for Down's syndrome.
BACKGROUND: Trends in the uptake of serum screening for Down syndrome have not been documented in a UK population.
DESIGN: A retrospective review of the rate of uptake in a unit that has offered serum screening for Down syndrome to all pregnant women.
SETTING: A large north of England hospital that has offered universal Down syndrome screening using the 'triple test' since 1992.
PATIENTS: A total of 47,998 women who booked for antenatal care.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Uptake of serum screening for Down syndrome.
METHODS: The results of the screening programme were contemporaneously recorded on a computer database, and the study team accessed the data.
RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in the uptake of serum screening for Down syndrome from a maximum of 82.6% in 1993 to 41.4% in 2005. There was a significant but small trend upwards in the age of women accepting screening and also a significant trend in the increase in the screen-positive rates.
CONCLUSIONS: The reduction in uptake of Down syndrome screening over the past 13 years must be taken into account when planning a screening programme. Other units should be encouraged to review their rate of uptake to determine if our data are representative of a wider trend."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In all, 65 consecutive cystoprostatectomy specimens taken from June 1990 to March 2004 had prostatic material reviewed by one genitourinary pathologist (S.E.M.). The presence of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN), ASAP, and adenocarcinoma was recorded. Foci of ASAP found in the absence of cancer were assessed with additional sectioning, high-molecular weight keratin (CK903), and alpha-methylacyl coenzyme A racemase (AMACR) immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: In all, 24 of 65 specimens (37%) had adenocarcinoma. Of the 41 without cancer, 18 (44%) had neither HGPIN nor ASAP, 14 (34%) had HGPIN alone, three (7%) had ASAP alone (four foci), and six had both HGPIN and ASAP (15%). Two foci of ASAP were not present on any further sectioning. The remaining eight foci all lacked CK903 stain, indicating disruption of the basal cell layer. Of these eight, only five were present for the AMACR stain, all of which were positive. Two of these five developed into a lesion considered cancer on further sectioning.
CONCLUSION: ASAP identified in incidental prostates represented marginally sampled cancer in at least two of 10 foci assessed. The remainder could not be resolved as benign on further evaluation, and remained suspicious for malignancy."
17378873,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17378873/,"OBJECTIVES: As in other countries, office-based surgeons, outpatient clinics and hospitals in Germany are in increasing competition to each other. However, little is known about potential patients' preferences for surgical care provision. The aim of this study was to investigate the general public's preferences towards location and other attributes of surgical treatment.
METHODS: An economic evaluation technique, discrete choice analysis, was administered in a survey to a sample of a German general public Internet panel, representative in terms of age, gender and education. Responders were asked to choose their preferred provider of surgical care in a series of pairwise choices, defined by five attributes. Regression analysis was used to quantify preferences towards characteristics of care and to calculate utilities of treatment scenarios. The strength of preferences and the rate at which participants were willing to trade among attributes were estimated.
RESULTS: The response rate was 76% (n=1134). 'Specialization and experience of provider' was the single most important attribute, followed by 'waiting times' and 'staff continuity'. Subjects traded a 4-week waiting time to obtain surgery at a highly specialized institution. Responders favoured outpatient clinics over office-based and inpatient surgery, but 'location of care' preferences were only weak. Whether participants had undergone surgery in the past had only minor effect on their preferences.
CONCLUSIONS: Potential patients base their choice between providers mainly on characteristics of care delivery and not location of care. The competition between and among providers of surgical care of different types of institutional organization will be determined by what is offered to patients."
17379061,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17379061/,"BACKGROUND: Published guidelines suggest the management of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglyceride (TG) values after the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goal is achieved.
OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the attainment of optimal combined lipid values (LDL-C, HDL-C, and TGs) and associated therapy over time.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort analysis was conducted among managed-care patients who had a baseline lipid panel taken between October 1, 1999, and September 30, 2000; were naive to lipid therapy; and had plan eligibility for at least 12 months before and 12 to 36 months after the baseline lipid values. Patients were categorized as elevated-risk primary prevention (ERP) or as coronary heart disease (CHD) and CHD risk equivalents (CHD-RE). The attainment of optimal combined lipid values was assessed at baseline and quarterly thereafter. Associations between lipid values and the use of lipid-altering therapy were assessed using multivariate logistic regression.
RESULTS: A total of 30,348 patients were monitored for a mean (SD) duration of 27 (8) months. Mean (SD) age was 66 (12) years and 55% (16,549/30,348) were men; 43% (13,059/30,348) were categorized as ERP and 57% (17,289/30,348) as CHD-RE. Combined lipid values were optimal in 14% (4167/30,348),18% (5508/30,348), and 22% (2936/13,100) of patients at baseline, 12 months, and 36 months, respectively. After 36 months, 78% (10,164/13,100) of patients did not attain optimal combined lipid values. Lipid therapy, primarily statin monotherapy (87% [7992/ 92251), was prescribed in 30% (9225/30,348) of patients. After 36 months, 34% (4492/13,100) of patients had isolated elevated LDL-C and 20% (2588/13,100) had non-optimal HDL-C and/or TGs. Lipid therapy was associated with the attainment of optimal combined values for LDL-C and TGs (both, P < 0.05), but not for HDL-C. Because the study was retrospective, causality cannot be determined.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of this study, use of combination lipid therapy and targeted therapy aimed at the specific lipid abnormalities may increase the attainment of optimal lipid parameters."
17379090,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17379090/,"OBJECTIVE: Normal tissues, including the central nervous system, tolerate single exposures to narrow planes of synchrotron-generated x-rays (microplanar beams; microbeams) up to several hundred Gy. The repairs apparently involve the microvasculature and the glial system. We evaluate a hypothesis on the involvement of bystander effects in these repairs.
METHODS: Confluent cultures of bovine aortic endothelial cells were irradiated with three parallel 27-microm microbeams at 24 Gy. Rats' spinal cords were transaxially irradiated with a single microplanar beam, 270 microm thick, at 750 Gy; the dose distribution in tissue was calculated.
RESULTS: Within 6 hours following irradiation of the cell culture the hit cells died, apparently by apoptosis, were lost, and the confluency was maintained. The spinal cord study revealed a loss of oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and myelin in 2 weeks, but by 3 months repopulation and remyelination was nearly complete. Monte Carlo simulations showed that the microbeam dose fell from the peak's 80% to 20% in 9 microm.
CONCLUSIONS: In both studies the repair processes could have involved ""beneficial"" bystander effects leading to tissue restoration, most likely through the release of growth factors, such as cytokines, and the initiation of cell-signaling cascades. In cell culture these events could have promoted fast disappearance of the hit cells and fast structural response of the surviving neighboring cells, while in the spinal cord study similar events could have been promoting angiogenesis to replace damaged capillary blood vessels, and proliferation, migration, and differentiation of the progenitor glial cells to produce new, mature, and functional glial cells."
17379292,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17379292/,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of asthma and atopic disease has increased in recent decades, but precise reasons for this increase are unknown. BCG vaccination is thought to be among a group of vaccines capable of manipulating the immune system toward T(H)1 dominance and therefore reducing the likelihood of atopic disease.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the influence of neonatal BCG vaccination on the prevalence of wheeze in a large community population of children.
METHOD: In a historical cohort study, a parent-completed questionnaire was used to identify the prevalence of wheeze in BCG-vaccinated and nonvaccinated children in Manchester, England.
RESULTS: There were 2414 participants aged between 6 and 11 years. In a univariate analysis neonatal BCG vaccination was associated with a significantly lower prevalence of wheeze (odds ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.55-0.86), and statistical significance was retained when the analysis was adjusted for potential confounders (odds ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.53-0.87).
CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate an association between asthma symptom prevalence and neonatal BCG vaccination, relating to a possible 27% reduction in prevalence, and are therefore of considerable public health importance.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The capacity of neonatal BCG vaccination to reduce the prevalence of respiratory symptoms in children warrants further investigation."
17379453,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17379453/,"PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to determine regional control of local regional advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), along with the role and selection criteria for neck dissection after IMRT.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 90 patients with stage N2A or greater HNSCC were treated with definitive IMRT from December 1999 to July 2005. Three clinical target volumes were defined and were treated to 70 to 74 Gy, 60 Gy, and 54 Gy, respectively. Neck dissection was performed for selected patients after IMRT. Selection criteria evolved during this period with emphasis on post-IMRT [(18)F] fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in recent years.
RESULTS: Median follow-up for all patients was 29 months (range, 0.2-74 months). All living patients were followed at least 9 months after completing treatment. Thirteen patients underwent neck dissection after IMRT because of residual lymphadenopathy. Of these, 6 contained residual viable tumor. Three patients with persistent adenopathy did not undergo neck dissection: 2 refused and 1 had lung metastasis. Among the remaining 74 patients who were observed without neck dissection, there was only 1 case of regional failure. Among all 90 patients in this study, the 3-year local and regional control was 96.3% and 95.4%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Appropriately delivered IMRT has excellent dose coverage for cervical lymph nodes. A high radiation dose can be safely delivered to the abnormal lymph nodes. There is a high complete response rate. Routine planned neck dissection for patients with N2A and higher stage after IMRT is not necessary. Post-IMRT [(18)F] fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography is a useful tool in selecting patients appropriate for neck dissection."
17379661,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17379661/,"OBJECTIVE: To create a more culturally relevant developmental assessment tool for use in children in rural Africa.
DESIGN: Through focus groups, piloting work and validation, a more culturally appropriate developmental tool, based on the style of the Denver II, was created. Age standardised norms were estimated using 1130 normal children aged 0-6 years from a rural setting in Malawi. The performance of each item in the tool was examined through goodness of fit on logistic regression, reliability and interpretability at a consensus meeting. The instrument was revised with removal of items performing poorly.
RESULTS: An assessment tool with 138 items was created. Face, content and respondent validity was demonstrated. At the consensus meeting, 97% (33/34) of gross motor items were retained in comparison to 51% (18/35) of social items, and 86% (69/80) of items from the Denver II or Denver Developmental Screening Test (DDST) were retained in comparison to 69% (32/46) of the newly created items, many of these having poor reliability and goodness of fit. Gender had an effect on 23% (8/35) of the social items, which were removed. Items not attained by 6 years came entirely from the Denver II fine motor section (4/34). Overall, 110 of the 138 items (80%) were retained in the revised instrument with some items needing further modification.
CONCLUSIONS: When creating developmental tools for a rural African setting, many items from Western tools can be adapted. The gross motor domain is more culturally adaptable, whereas social development is difficult to adapt and is culturally specific."
17379819,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17379819/,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To evaluate whether cisplatin-induced stroke is mediated by vascular toxicity with release of prothrombotic endothelial and platelet-derived microparticles (MPs).
METHODS: Endothelial (CD31(+)CD41(-)), platelets (CD31(+)CD41(+)) and prothrombotic (Annexin V(+)) circulating MPs were quantified by flow cytometry in 18 patients with cancer, before and 3 days after administration of cisplatin, and compared with 18 healthy controls. Thrombin-antithrombin complex and prothrombin fragments (F(1+2)) were measured as markers of the activation of the coagulation.
RESULTS: In patients with cancer, baseline levels of circulating prothrombotic, endothelial and platelet-derived MPs were similar to healthy controls and decreased significantly after administration of cisplatin. High-baseline MPs levels were observed in 5 patients who received cisplatin for a second or third cycle. A high-baseline activation of the coagulation was observed in all patients without further increase after cisplatin infusion.
CONCLUSIONS: Cisplatin treatment is immediately followed by a decrease in circulating levels of endothelial and platelet-derived MPs. However, a transient increase in MPs is observed at the second and third infusion, and this may contribute to the cisplatin-induced stroke."
17381379,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17381379/,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To examine the class effect of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) on mortality in patients with heart failure who were aged 65 years or older.
DESIGN: Retrospective population-based study.
DATA SOURCE: Administrative database that stores information on hospital discharge summaries for the Canadian provinces of Quebec, Ontario, and British Columbia.
PATIENTS: A total of 6876 patients aged 65 years or older who were discharged with a primary diagnosis of heart failure between January 1, 1998, and March 31, 2003, and who filled at least one prescription for an ARB within 90 days of discharge.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Times to all-cause death in patients receiving individual ARBs were compared. Models were adjusted for demographic, clinical, physician, and hospital characteristics; models were also adjusted for dosage categories, which were represented by time-dependent variables. The cohort of 6876 patients had a mean +/- SD age of 78 +/- 7 years, and most (62%) were women. Losartan was the most frequently prescribed ARB (61%), followed by irbesartan (14%), valsartan (13%), candesartan (10%), and telmisartan (2%). Irbesartan, valsartan, and candesartan were associated with better survival rates than losartan (adjusted hazard ratios [HRs] and 95% confidence intervals [CIs] 0.65 [0.53-0.79], 0.63 [0.51-0.79], and 0.71 [0.57-0.90], respectively). No difference was noted in mortality in patients prescribed telmisartan compared with those receiving losartan (HR 0.92 [95% CI 0.55-1.54]).
CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients with heart failure who were prescribed losartan had worse survival rates compared with those prescribed other commonly used ARBs. The absence of a class effect for ARBs is consistent with data showing pharmacologic differences among the drugs."
17381482,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17381482/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether relative adrenal insufficiency (RAI) can be identified in nonseptic hypotensive patients in the intensive care unit (ICU).
DESIGN: Retrospective study in a medical-surgical ICU of a university hospital.
PATIENTS: One hundred and seventy-two nonseptic ICU patients (51% after trauma or surgery), who underwent a short 250 microg ACTH test because of > 6 h hypotension or vasopressor/inotropic therapy.
MEASUREMENTS: On the test day, the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II) and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score were calculated to estimate disease severity. The ICU mortality until day 28 was recorded. Best discriminative levels of baseline cortisol, increases and peaks were established using receiver operating characteristic curves. These and corticosteroid treatment (in n = 112, 65%), among other variables, were examined by multiple logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard regression analyses to find independent predictors of ICU mortality until day 28.
RESULTS: ICU mortality until day 28 was 23%. Nonsurvivors had higher SAPS II and SOFA scores. Baseline cortisol levels correlated directly with albumin levels and SAPS II. In the multivariate analyses, a cortisol baseline > 475 nmol/l and cortisol increase < 200 nmol/l predicted mortality, largely dependent on disease severity but independent of albumin levels. Corticosteroid (hydrocortisone) treatment was not associated with an improved outcome, regardless of the ACTH test results.
CONCLUSION: In nonseptic hypotensive ICU patients, a low cortisol/ACTH response and treatment with corticosteroids do not contribute to mortality prediction by severity of disease. The data thus argue against RAI identifiable by cortisol/ACTH testing and necessitating corticosteroid substitution treatment in these patients."
17381613,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17381613/,"BACKGROUND: Current practice in transfusion medicine promotes clear documentation of transfusion-related events including the fact that the patient has been informed of the related risks and benefits.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective review of 1005 patient charts was carried out to determine documentation.
RESULTS: Most patients were from general surgery (10.8%) and cardiac surgery (14.1%). In 75 percent of cases the physician had not documented that any discussion had occurred regarding the risks and/or benefits or alternatives. Only 12 percent of charts included information that the patient was subsequently told what blood components were given to them. The discharge summary recorded transfusion information in 32.1 percent of cases whereas the consult note had this information in 26.3 percent. Chart records matched the transfusion medicine records in 60.6 percent of cases. The most common error was in the blood unit identification number.
CONCLUSIONS: While accepted in theory, the practice of documenting patient information on transfusion is not well done."
17381649,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17381649/,"PURPOSE: Transesophageal echocardiography has emerged as an accepted approach before D.C. cardioversion for atrial fibrillation. The frequency of atrial thrombi detected on transesophageal echocardiography has varied from 7% to 23%. Many patients undergoing transesophageal echocardiography have had a previous transthoracic echocardiogram. Though transthoracic echocardiography has a low yield for the detection of intracardiac thrombi, it is highly accurate in diagnosing a structurally abnormal heart. The purpose of this study was to assess the frequency of thrombi detected by transesophageal echocardiography in patients with an entirely normal transthoracic echocardiogram and hence the advocacy of a selective approach in performing transesophageal echocardiography in patients undergoing D.C. cardioversion for atrial fibrillation.
METHODS: 112 consecutive patients with atrial fibrillation who had undergone transesophageal echocardiography before D.C. cardioversion were evaluated. They all had a transthoracic echocardiogram within the 2 months preceding their transesophageal echocardiogram. Based on their transthoracic echocardiographic study, they were divided into two groups: Group 1 consisted of patients with a normal transthoracic echocardiogram and Group 2, those with an abnormal study.
RESULTS: Thrombi or spontaneous echo contrast were found in 14 of 112 patients (16%). All however were detected in Group 2 patients. There was no patient with a normal transthoracic echocardiogram who had thrombus on his/her transesophageal echocardiogram.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that a selective approach may be exercised in the use of transesophageal echocardiography prior to D.C. cardioversion for atrial fibrillation. Patients with an entirely ""normal"" transthoracic echocardiogram may proceed directly to cardioversion without a precardioversion transesophageal echocardiogram."
17381800,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17381800/,"BACKGROUND: It is not clear why melanocyte disappearance occurs without fibrotic evolution in halo nevus and with fibrotic evolution in regressing melanoma.
METHODS: Six halo nevi, seven regressing primary melanomas, and seven primary melanoma (PM) without regression were studied using immunohistochemistry for the phenotype of inflammatory infiltrate and the expression of cytokines involved in fibrogenesis or macrophage regulation. Melanocytes were also evaluated using electron microscopy.
RESULTS: CD8(+) lymphocytes predominated in halo nevus, whereas CD4(+) lymphocytes prevailed in melanoma; a few macrophages were only found in melanoma. Fibrogenic cytokines, IL-6, platelet-derived growth factor, and transforming growth factor-beta were only expressed in melanoma, whereas basic fibroblastic growth factor was also expressed in halo nevus. Antifibrotic cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha was expressed at a higher degree in halo nevus. Cytokines involved in macrophage regulation were only expressed in melanoma.
CONCLUSIONS: Fibrogenic cytokines were more frequently expressed in melanoma than in halo nevus, irrespective of regression. At ultrastructural level, melanocytes showed a more activated status in regressing melanoma than in halo nevus, in compliance with a milieu richer in cytokines. Although the cytokine microenvironment does not completely justify the fibrotic evolution in regressing PM, the higher TNF-alpha expression in halo nevus suggests a possible role in nonfibrotic evolution of this lesion."

17381898,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17381898/,"OBJECTIVES: To examine how Australian children's reported everyday food preferences reflect dietary recommendations, and the impact of sociodemographic factors on these associations.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey.
SETTING/SUBJECTS: Three hundred and seventy-one parents of children aged 2-5 years, recruited from three socio-economic groups in two Australian cities, completed a survey on their child's liking for 176 foods and drinks on a 5-point Likert scale in addition to demographic descriptors. Preferences were compared with the recommendations of the Dietary Guidelines for Children and Adolescents in Australia and the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating.
RESULTS: Foods in the Extra Foods (non-nutritious foods) and Cereals groups of the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating were highly liked (mean: 4.02 and 4.01, respectively), whilst foods in the Vegetables group were liked least (mean: 3.01). A large percentage of foods in the Cereals and Extra Foods groups were liked (64% and 56%, respectively) in contrast to the other food groups, especially Vegetables (7%). Children liked foods that were higher in sugar (r = 0.29, P < 0.0001) and more energy-dense (r = 0.34, P < 0.0001) but not those higher in saturated fat (r = 0.16, P = 0.03), total fat (r = 0.12, P = 0.12) or sodium (r = 0.10, P = 0.18). Sociodemographic variables (e.g. socio-economic status, parental education, children's age and sex) explained little of the variation in children's food preferences.
CONCLUSIONS: Australian pre-school children's food preferences align with dietary guidelines in some respects, but not others. Interventions are needed to shift children's preferences away from non-nutritious foods that are high in energy density and sugar, and towards vegetables and fruits."

A purposive sample of clinics where more than 30 children were seen per day was drawn from 10 of the 11 districts in the Cape Metropole region and the two districts of the West Coast Winelands region. The number of children selected from each district was weighted in terms of population size for the two regions. At each clinic visited, the first five to 10 children seen on a day, and meeting the inclusion criteria for vitamin A supplementation (VAS) based on the vitamin A provincial policy guidelines, were selected. These included children with low birth weight (LBW), growth faltering, underweight and severe undernutrition, recurrent diarrhoea and lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), tuberculosis, measles, HIV/AIDS and eye signs of vitamin A deficiency. Clinic records were reviewed following consultation with the PHC nurse to identify if the child required vitamin A, exit interviews were conducted with mothers/caregivers, and Road to Health Charts (RTHCs) were reviewed. At the end of the study, PHC managers were interviewed to determine if problems could be identified with the Programme.
RESULTS: Forty-three of 123 (35%) and 13 of 40 (33%) of the fixed PHC clinics in the Cape Metropole and West Coast Winelands regions were visited, and a total of 300 children (234 from Cape Metropole, 66 from West Coast Winelands) with a mean (standard deviation) age of 24.3 (16.3) months and who met the inclusion criteria for VAS were selected. Of the total sample of children, 198 (66%) had multiple (i.e. more than one) indication and 102 (34%) had a single indication for VAS. There were a total of 617 indications for VAS in the two regions; 238 (39%) for growth faltering, 119 (19%) for underweight, 98 (16%) for LBW, 70 (11%) for LRTI, 51 (8%) for diarrhoea, 21 (3%) for HIV/AIDS and 20 (3%) for tuberculosis. A total of 102 (34%) of the children in the two regions received vitamin A supplements (Cape Metropole 29%; West Coast Winelands 52%). A record was made on the RTHC of 79 (77%) of the children who received VAS (Cape Metropole 76%; West Coast Winelands 79%). Twenty-four per cent of the mothers knew why their child had been given vitamin A (Cape Metropole 29%; West Coast Winelands 12%). Eleven per cent of the mothers had previously heard about the Vitamin A Supplementation Programme (Cape Metropole 12%; West Coast Winelands 6%). More than 81% of PHC managers indicated that health staff had been trained to implement the Vitamin A Supplementation Programme. The main problems identified by health staff in the two regions were lack of vitamin A capsules, inadequate training and difficulties in implementing the Programme.
CONCLUSIONS: Opportunities to administer vitamin A were underutilised in both regions. Recommendations such as improving mothers' awareness of the benefits of vitamin A and training of PHC nurses were made to the provincial Department of Health and are being implemented to improve the effectiveness of the Programme."
17381914,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17381914/,"OBJECTIVE: To examine UK country and ethnic variations in infant feeding practices.
DESIGN: Cohort study.
SETTING: Infants enrolled in the Millennium Cohort Study, born between September 2000 and January 2002.
SUBJECTS: A total of 18 150 natural mothers (11 286 (8207 white) living in England) of singleton infants.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Breast-feeding initiation, breast-feeding discontinuation and introduction of solid foods before 4 months. EXPLANATORY VARIABLES: Maternal ethnic group, education and social class.
RESULTS: Seventy per cent of UK mothers started to breast-feed, of whom 62% stopped before 4 months. Median age at discontinuing breast-feeding was 14, 13, 10 and 6 weeks in Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland, respectively. Thirty-six per cent of UK mothers (34% in England) introduced solids before 4 months. White mothers were more likely to discontinue breast-feeding (62%) and introduce solids early (37%) than most other ethnic minority groups; those stopping before 4 months were more likely to introduce solids early compared with those continuing to breast-feed beyond this age (adjusted rate ratio (95% confidence interval): 1.3 (1.1-1.2)). Educated mothers were less likely to stop breast-feeding before 4 months (white mothers, 0.8 (0.8-0.9); non-white mothers, 0.9 (0.8-1.0)) than those with no/minimal qualifications but, among ethnic minorities, were more likely to introduce solids early (1.3 (1.0-1.6)). Socio-economic status was positively associated with breast-feeding continuation among white women, and with age at introduction of solids among non-white women.
CONCLUSIONS: We have identified important geographic, ethnic and social inequalities in breast-feeding continuation and introduction of solids within the UK, many of which have not been reported previously. The factors mediating these associations are complex and merit further study to ensure that interventions proposed to promote maternal adherence to current infant feeding recommendations are appropriate and effective."

METHODS: Cross-sectional epidemiological study, conducted between 2001 and 2002. A sample of 3453 children under 5 years of age was taken from nine communities in the state of Bahia and five in the state of São Paulo. Data on housing, family and children were obtained by applying structured questionnaires in loco. Weight and height for each child were also measured. The association between wheezing and overweight was assessed by unconditional logistic multivariate regression models.
RESULTS: Overweight children had a greater frequency of wheezing and an odds ratio of 2.57 (95% confidence interval 1.51-4.37) was estimated after controlling for several potential confounding variables. The magnitude of the risk was not affected by several different model specifications.
CONCLUSION: Excess weight is associated with increased risk for wheezing in this population of children below 5 years of age."
17381944,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17381944/,"OBJECTIVE: To measure the effects of two school-based interventions on children's intake of fruit and vegetables (F&V).
DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of six primary schools were randomly assigned to (1) a free F&V distribution programme, or (2) a multicomponent programme, consisting of a classroom curriculum and parental involvement. The two interventions were evaluated on their effects and compared with six control schools in a pre-test-post-test design. Two methods were used for dietary assessment: a pre-structured food recall and a food-frequency questionnaire including only F&V.
SUBJECTS: A total of 939 parents of children aged 4-12 years filled out the questionnaire at both pre-test and post-test. The response rate was 54%.
RESULTS: Multilevel analyses showed that both programmes were equally effective in increasing children's fruit consumption by 0.2 portions per day. The free F&V distribution increased vegetable intake among non-native children and the oldest age group, and the multicomponent programme among the oldest children and girls. The distribution also caused an increased 24 h fruit, juice and vegetable intake among the youngest and the oldest age groups, and the multicomponent programme among all children.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that both interventions were shown to be effective for different subgroups regarding age, gender and ethnicity. When comparing both interventions, the distribution programme was shown to be more effective, especially in increasing vegetable consumption. An important next step will be to investigate which intervention has the greatest potential to be implemented in primary schools."
17381953,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17381953/,"OBJECTIVES: To examine the association between fruit and vegetable (F&V) availability and consumption, the possible influences on this association, research gaps, and implications for developing strategies to increase F&V consumption.
DESIGN: Systematic review of studies that have examined associations between F&V availability and consumption.
RESULTS: Qualitative studies conducted among children and adults indicated that greater availability was associated with greater consumption. This finding was supported by cross-sectional studies among children. Availability was associated with dietary psychosocial variables such as preferences, and it appears that availability may moderate the relationship between these psychosocial variables and consumption. Intervention studies attempting to increase availability have resulted in increased consumption, and availability has predicted change in consumption over an 18-month period.
DISCUSSION: Availability appears to be a key proximal determinant of consumption, especially of F&V, and thereby provides a target for change. However, the mechanisms that relate these variables are unclear and there is a need to clarify the direction of causality. We suggest that the possible causal mechanisms may include: (1) availability simply facilitates increased consumption; (2) the visual cues of available food may stimulate consumption; and (3) available food exposure may increase preference, which leads to increased consumption. Each of these possibilities requires close examination, as do policy-level interventions.
CONCLUSION: F&V availability is associated with increased consumption. Research that elucidates the mechanisms between availability and intake, and tests policy-level interventions, is needed to advance increased availability as a public health procedure."
17382137,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17382137/,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relation between the degree of stone-induced hydronephrosis and the outcome of shock wave lithotripsy in patients with distal ureter stones.
METHODS: A total of 215 patients with a solitary distal ureter stone with or without hydronephrosis were treated with shock wave lithotripsy. The degree of hydronephrosis was determined by renal ultrasonography. The patients were divided into four groups according to the degree of stone-induced hydronephrosis. Group 0 (44.2%) had no urinary system dilation, group 1 (32.5%) had mild dilation, group 2 (16.3%) had moderate dilation, and group 3 (7%) had severe dilation. The patients were treated with the Dornier MFL 5000 lithotripter. The results were compared in terms of the stone-free rates, number of shock waves, number of sessions, incidence of complications, number of secondary interventions, and time to stone clearance.
RESULTS: The mean stone size was 11.2 +/- 2.5 mm. In the hydronephrotic group, the stone-free rate was 74% compared with 83% in patients without hydronephrosis (P = 0.27). The mean time to stone clearance was 16.3 +/- 9.2 days. The differences among the four groups in terms of stone size and treatment outcome were not significant. However, the presence of hydronephrosis was significantly associated with repeat treatment (2.2 versus 1.6, P <0.001) and prolonged clearance time (18.7 versus 15.4 days, P <0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study have shown that in patients with solitary distal ureter stones, the degree of hydronephrosis caused by the stone does not affect the overall treatment success with shock wave lithotripsy. However, stones in obstructed systems tended to require repeat treatment and prolonged time for stone clearance."
17382148,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17382148/,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of body mass index (BMI) on outcome after orthotopic neobladder (NB) reconstruction.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients who underwent radical cystectomy and NB from 1992 to 2004. The patients were categorized according to BMI into group 1, BMI less than 25 kg/m2; group 2, BMI 25 to 29.9 kg/m2; and group 3, BMI greater than 30 kg/m2. The relationships among the BMI categories, the predominant complications (eg, urinary tract infection [UTI]; pyelonephritis; ureteral, bladder neck, and urethral stricture), other complications, and continence were analyzed.
RESULTS: Of the 343 patients who underwent radical cystectomy, 116 had an NB. The patient characteristics among the BMI groups were similar. Group 1 had fewer complications compared with the other groups (P <0.012). The principal complications observed were UTI, stricture, and pyelonephritis. The incidence of UTI, pyelonephritis, and wound infection were less in group 1 than in the other groups, with statistically significant differences (P = 0.001, P = 0.04, and P = 0.04, respectively). At the last follow-up visit, only 10% of the patients required clean intermittent catheterization to empty the NB, and no statistically significant differences were found in the continence status and voiding pattern among the groups.
CONCLUSIONS: An increased incidence of UTI, pyelonephritis, and wound infection was found in patients with increased BMI. However, they were transient and not life threatening. The continence and voiding patterns were relatively similar. Hence, an NB can be offered to patients with an increased BMI, and they should be formally counseled."
17382162,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17382162/,"OBJECTIVES: To prospectively evaluate the outcome of radical retropubic prostatectomy using three different techniques of vesicourethral anastomosis (VUA), with a different number of sutures used during this surgical step.
METHODS: Three groups of patients who had undergone nerve-sparing radical retropubic prostatectomy were compared. Overall, 90 patients with localized prostate cancer were recruited. The patients were randomly assigned to undergo one of three different VUA techniques. The anastomotic sutures consisted of four or six monocryl 2-0 stitches. The ""two-suture"" anastomosis in group 1 was performed by passing two U-shaped horizontal stitches at the 6-o'clock and 12-o'clock positions. The following intraoperative and perioperative parameters were considered for the comparative analysis: time to perform VUA, blood loss, hospitalization, and time to drain removal.
RESULTS: A statistically significant difference was found in terms of the mean time to anastomosis between groups 1 and 2 (3.61 +/- 1.14 versus 16.6 +/- 4.04, P <0.0001) and between groups 1 and 3 (3.61 +/- 1.14 versus 23.45 +/- 5.4, P <0.0001). No significant differences could be detected for blood loss, time to drain removal, or hospitalization. No significant difference was detected in terms of functional outcome (stricture rate, erectile function, and continence).
CONCLUSIONS: The number of stitches used for VUA during radical retropubic prostatectomy did not influence the perioperative and postoperative parameters. The time to VUA was considerably lower using our ""two-suture"" technique."
17382212,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17382212/,"BACKGROUND: In breast-conserving surgery (BCS), the method of margin assessment and the definition of a negative margin vary widely. The purpose of this study was to compare the incidence of positive margins and rates of reexcision between two methods of margin assessment at a single institution.
STUDY DESIGN: In July 2004, our protocol for margin evaluation changed from perpendicular inked margins (Group A, n=263) to tangential shaved margins (Group B, n=261). In Group A, margins were classified as positive, close, and negative. Margins designated as ""close"" were further defined as: < or = 1 mm, < or = 2 mm, and < or =3 mm. In Group B, shaved margins (by definition 2 to 3 mm) were reported as positive or negative.
RESULTS: The rate of reported ""positive"" margins was significantly higher in Group B: 127 of 261 (49%) versus 42 of 263 (16%), p < 0.001. But when patients with ""positive, close, or both"" kinds of margins were combined in Group A, there was no significant difference between the two techniques. Although the shaved margin was 2- to 3-mm thick, the rate of reexcision in Group B was significantly higher when compared with that in patients with ""positive, close, or both"" < or =3 mm margins in Group A (75% versus 52%, p < 0.001). The likelihood of finding residual disease remained the same (27% versus 32%, p=NS).
CONCLUSIONS: The tangential shaved-margin technique results in a higher proportion of reported positive margins and limits the ability of the surgeon to discriminate among patients with close margins, resulting in a higher rate of reexcision. The fact that many, but not all, patients with positive or close margins in both groups underwent reexcision emphasizes the role of surgical judgment in this setting. Longer followup is required to determine equivalency in rates of local recurrence between these two methods of margin assessment."
17382484,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17382484/,"UNLABELLED: In 2006, a pathogenic variant of the common intestinal organism Blastocystis was discovered in patients who were experiencing chronic gastrointestinal symptoms. Most species of Blastocystis inhabit humans with no symptoms. The discovery of a pathogenic variant of Blastocystis is significant, because Blastocystis is related to Entamoeba, a similar organism with pathogenic variants that kill over 100,000 people each year. Recent research has shown that Blastocystis infections may be undetectable using existing clinical methods. Medical case reports from the Middle East, Europe, and United States suggest that infection with this variant may already be widespread and misdiagnosed as one of several functional disorders.
HYPOTHESIS: A more virulent or transmissible type of Blastocystis emerged in the Middle East in the 1980's, and was transmitted to Europe and the United States by military and more significantly vacation and business travel. The lack of adequate tests made it impossible to detect the infection. Transmission to the larger population resulted in rising inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) rates in Europe in the 1990's. The relationship between IBD and autism is explored, along with the possibility that the same pathogen causes both conditions.
SUPPORTING DATA: Serological and epidemiological findings are presented supporting the hypothesis. Blastocystis survives sewage treatment, shows low host specificity, and can be spread by many animals. Several communities which have been studied due to high autism rates are located close to rivers which receive large quantities of sewage effluent, such as South Thames (England), Olmsted County (Minnesota, USA) and many communities in Oregon (USA).
CONCLUSIONS: Scientists from other countries represent the first line of defense against emerging infectious diseases, but their publications on Blastocystis are not well known in the United States and Europe. With the publication of corroborating research by Western scientists in core scientific journals, it is hoped that an appropriate response from the public health system will be forthcoming. Investigation into the existence of infection in the groups mentioned with sensitive and specific tests should be performed. Such tests could include a serum antibody test and a Polymerase Chain Reaction test specific to the pathogenic variant."
17382961,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17382961/,"OBJECTIVE: The current study examined the validity of using comorbid obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) to identify a subtype of individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
METHOD: Data for the current study were drawn from an ongoing, longitudinal study of the course of OCD and include intake assessments for 238 subjects with primary and current DSM-IV OCD who were treatment seeking.
RESULTS: More than one fourth of the subjects (N=65, 27%) met criteria for comorbid OCPD. As compared to OCD-OCPD subjects, the OCD+OCPD subjects had a significantly younger age at onset of first OC symptoms (p=0.013), and a higher rate of symmetry and hoarding obsessions, and cleaning, ordering, repeating, and hoarding compulsions (all p's<0.01). Individuals with OCD+OCPD had higher rates of comorbid anxiety disorders (p=0.007) and avoidant personality disorder (p=0.006). The OCD+OCPD subjects also had significantly lower ratings of global functioning (p=0.001) and more impaired social functioning (p=0.004), despite a lack of significant differences on overall severity of OCD symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that individuals with both OCD and OCPD have distinct clinical characteristics in terms of age at onset of initial OC symptoms, the types of obsessions and compulsions they experience, and psychiatric comorbidity. Our findings, coupled with data from family studies showing a higher than expected frequency of OCPD in first degree relatives of OCD probands, suggest that OCD associated with OCPD may represent a specific subtype of OCD. Additional research is warranted to further establish the validity of this subtype."
17383083,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17383083/,"OBJECTIVES: We investigated (1) whether sexual, physical, or emotional abuse experienced either as a child or as an adolescent/adult is associated with symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, and nocturia, and (2) the extent to which the observed association between abuse and urologic symptoms may be causal.
METHODS: Analyses are based on data from the Boston Area Community Health (BACH) survey, a community-based epidemiologic study of many different urologic symptoms and risk factors. BACH used a multistage stratified cluster sample to recruit 5506 adults, aged 30-79 yr (2301 men, 3205 women; 1770 black [African American], 1877 Hispanic, and 1859 white respondents).
RESULTS: The symptoms considered are common, with 33% of BACH respondents reporting urinary frequency, 12% reporting urgency, and 28% reporting nocturia. All three symptoms are positively associated with childhood and adolescent/adult sexual, physical, and emotional abuse (p<0.05), with abuse significantly increasing the odds of urinary frequency by a factor ranging from 1.6 to 1.9, the odds of urgency by a factor from 2.0 to 2.3, and the odds of nocturia by a factor from 1.3 to 1.5.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses extend previous work. First, we show a strong association between abuse and urinary frequency, urgency, and nocturia in a community-based random sample. Second, we move beyond discussion of statistical association and find considerable evidence to suggest that the relationship between abuse and these symptoms may be causal."
17383356,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17383356/,"BACKGROUND: A variety of definitive operations have been used to manage patients with double-outlet right ventricle and subpulmonary ventricular septal defect (Taussig-Bing anomaly). This study identifies the impact of the position of the great arteries and use of a staged surgical approach on the outcome after the arterial switch operation in children with Taussig-Bing anomaly.
METHODS: From 1986 through July 2005, 34 patients with Taussig-Bing anomaly underwent the arterial switch operation. The median age at operation was 21 days. Based on position of the great arteries, patients were divided into group I (side by side; n = 16) and group II (anteroposterior; n = 18). Aortic arch obstruction was present in 18 patients (53%), of whom 16 had prior repair with aortic arch reconstruction. Abnormal coronary artery patterns were present in 9 patients (27%).
RESULTS: There were 4 early deaths and 1 late death (3 from group I and 2 from group II). The actuarial survival rate was 85% at 15 years (81% in group I and 89% in group II). Right ventricular outflow tract obstruction (mean gradient, 46.0 +/- 5.5 mm Hg) developed in 5 cases (2 from group I and 3 from group II). One patient underwent reoperation for residual aortic arch obstruction. Freedom from reoperation was 80% at 15 years, and thereafter 85% in group I and 75% in group II. Statistical analysis of potential risk factors revealed no significant identifiers for death or need for reoperation between groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The arterial switch operation remains our preferred choice of treatment for children with Taussig-Bing anomaly. The position of the great arteries has no effect on postoperative morbidity and mortality. In the presence of aortic arch obstruction, staged arch reconstruction followed soon thereafter by early intracardiac repair has yielded excellent outcomes in our experience."
17383725,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17383725/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the proportion of fractures rated as abusive in children <36 months of age evaluated at a regional pediatric hospital increased over a 24-year period from 1979 to 2002. Fractures were chosen as an example of serious injuries in young children.
METHODS: Medical records were abstracted for all children <36 months of age who were seen at a single pediatric hospital with a fracture during three time periods: 1979-1983, 1991-1994, and 1999-2002. After reviewing the abstracted and radiographic information, two clinicians (one an expert on child abuse) and two pediatric radiologists each rated the likelihood of abuse using explicit criteria and a seven-point scale from definite abuse to definite unintentional injury. Ratings were done independently; when disagreements occurred, the case was discussed, and a joint rating was agreed upon, if possible. The proportions of cases rated as abuse were compared over the three time periods, and logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (OR).
RESULTS: In the early, middle, and late samples, there were 200, 240, and 232 children, respectively, with fractures. The proportion of cases rated as abuse decreased from 22.5% in the early period to 10.0% in the middle period and was 10.8% in the late period (p<.001). When comparing the odds of abuse in the middle and late groups to the odds of abuse in the early group (controlling for age, gender, ethnicity, type of medical insurance, and site of pediatric care), the adjusted ORs were .31 (95% CI=.15, .62) for the middle group and .45 (95% CI=.23, .86) for the late group. Thus, the odds of a given case being rated as abuse decreased by over 50% from the early period to the middle and late time periods. No statistically significant difference was found when comparing the odds of abuse for the middle group to those of the late group, OR: 1.46 (95% CI=.69, 3.08).
CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of abusive fractures in young children decreased substantially from 1979-1983 to 1991-1994 and 1999-2002 at a major pediatric hospital. We speculate that this decrease may reflect early recognition of less serious forms of maltreatment and the availability of services to high-risk families."
17384006,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17384006/,"BACKGROUND: Increased gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) is associated with cardiovascular disease. To date, however, few studies with sufficient sample size and follow-up have investigated the association of GGT with all-cause mortality.
METHODS: The relation of GGT to the risk of death was examined in a cohort of 283 438 first attendants (inpatients or outpatients) of the Vienna General Hospital with request for GGT analysis as part of a routine screening panel and was monitored for up to 13 years. To evaluate GGT as a predictor, Cox proportional hazards models were calculated, which were adjusted for age and sex.
RESULTS: In both men and women, GGT above the reference category (GGT > or = 9 U/L in women, > or = 14 U/L in men) was significantly (P <0.001) associated with all-cause, cancer, hepatobiliary, and vascular mortalities. Hazard ratios (HRs) for men and women were similar in all categories. Among patients who presented with GGT above the reference category, those younger than 30 years had higher all-cause mortality rates than did older individuals (HR 1.5-3.3 vs HR 1-1.3 >80 years, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: GGT is associated with mortality in both men and women, especially in patients younger than 30 years, and even high-normal GGT is a risk factor for all-cause mortality."
17384316,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17384316/,"OBJECTIVE: Depression has been linked with vascular risk factors and stroke. The authors examined the relationship between retinal microvascular abnormalities and depression symptoms in an elderly population.
METHODS: The Cardiovascular Health Study is a population-based study conducted in four U.S. communities initiated in 1989-1990. A total of 2,420 persons aged 65 years and older were included in the current analyses. During the 1997-1998 examination, retinal photographs were performed and assessed for retinal microvascular abnormalities (retinopathy, focal arteriolar narrowing, arteriovenous nicking, generalized retinal arteriolar narrowing, and generalized retinal venular dilation) according to standardized methods. Depression symptoms were assessed by a modified version of the Centers for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scale annually from 1989 through 1997-1998 and was defined as a CES-D score of >9.
RESULTS: Participants with retinal microvascular abnormalities were not more likely to have depression symptoms, with adjusted odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence intervals) of 1.08 (0.71-1.65) for retinopathy, OR 1.09 (0.71-1.68) for focal arteriolar narrowing, OR 0.85 (0.52-1.40) for arteriovenous nicking, OR 0.97 (0.70-1.34) for generalized arteriolar narrowing, and OR 0.79 (0.56-1.12) for generalized venular dilation. Retinal microvascular abnormalities were not related to depression symptoms in multinomial logistic regression comparing the three top quartiles of the depression CES-D scores with the lowest quartile.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study did not find an association between retinal microvascular abnormalities and depression symptoms in older people."
17384410,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17384410/,"BACKGROUND: The Broselow pediatric emergency tape (BT) was developed to provide a length-based estimate of body weight and equipment size during resuscitation.
OBJECTIVES: To conduct a validation study on the use of the BT in Korean children.
METHODS: Anesthesia records from children were retrospectively reviewed. The measured weights of the subjects were compared with the BT weight estimates by using Bland-Altman analysis. The accuracy of the BT and age-based formula in predicting the endotracheal tube (ETT) size were also compared. The authors drew a receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve to evaluate the cutoff height that would be acceptable for the application of BT without error in Korean children.
RESULTS: A total of 665 children (mean [+/- SD] age, 5.1 [+/- 3.3] years, 61.8% male) were enrolled. The average measured weight of the Korean children was 1.54 kg heavier than the BT estimates (95% CI = 1.24 to 1.85 kg). The BT estimates showed better agreement with the actually used ETT sizes than did the age-based formula estimates (86.9% vs. 34.9%, p < 0.001). The cutoff height of the ROC curve was 127.15 cm. When the BT was used in children who were shorter than the cutoff height, 98.8% of the enrolled children's estimated weights were within the limits of agreement.
CONCLUSIONS: The BT can be used in Korean children as a helpful adjunct during resuscitation to estimate the weight and ETT size."
17384840,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17384840/,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether procedures adopted by Brazilian physicians in the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension are in compliance with those advocated by the IV Brazilian Hypertension Guidelines.
METHOD: Survey carried out by means of telephone interviews with Brazilian physicians. The survey featured application of a questionnaire aimed to assess receipt of and compliance with the guidelines, and to evaluate various aspects regarding the treatment of hypertensive patients.
RESULTS: 68.3% of the respondents had received the guidelines and answered the questionnaire in full. The total sample consisted of 483 physicians--47% cardiologists, 31.7% internists, and 21.3% nephrologists. The survey showed high compliance with certain guideline topics such as more than one measurement at different times for the diagnosis of hypertension (94%), and providing guidance regarding lifestyle changes as a therapeutic strategy. As to arterial pressure levels used for diagnosis and therapeutic target, compliance with guideline recommendations lacks uniformity. The survey showed a clear preference for pressure levels lower than those recommended, especially in patients with comorbidities. Attempts to assess cardiovascular risk also proved to be low. Only 64.7% of the respondents reported that they seek to determine the presence of diabetes mellitus, and 56.4% check for dyslipidemia. The majority (59.3%) mentioned diuretics as the preferred drug class for initial drug treatment of hypertension.
CONCLUSION: We concluded that there is only partial compliance with Brazilian Hypertension Guidelines and that certain factors should be taken into consideration when drawing up future guidelines, such as: improved distribution; standardization of values for diagnosis and therapeutic target; more extensive coverage of ways for physicians to approach hypertensive patients to better evaluate their overall cardiovascular risk."
17384903,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17384903/,"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Major hepatectomy with concomitant pancreatoduodenectomy (M-HPD) is usually indicated for the resection of diffuse bile duct cancer or advanced gallbladder cancer. This is the only procedure that can potentially cure such advanced cancers, so both a low mortality rate and long-term survival could potentially justify performing this procedure.
METHODS: Between 1990 and 2005, the morbidity, mortality, and long-term survival of 26 patients with advanced biliary tract carcinoma 14 with diffuse bile duct cancer, 9 with advanced gallbladder cancer, and 3 with hilar bile duct cancer, who underwent hepatopancreatoduodectomy (HPD) were reviewed and analyzed.
RESULTS: The overall morbidity and mortality rates were 30.8% and 0%, respectively. Postoperative infectious complications occurred in 6 patients (23.0%). The 5-year survival rate of the 14 patients with diffuse bile duct cancer who underwent HPD was 51.9%, while the 5-year survival rate in the 12 of these patients who underwent M-HPD was 61.4%. Patients with diffuse bile duct cancer without residual tumor and those without lymph node metastasis had 5-year survival rates of 68.6% and 80%, respectively. Thirty-three percent (2 of 6) of the patients who underwent M-HPD for advanced gallbladder cancer survived for more than 5 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative biliary drainage, portal embolization, complete external drainage of pancreatic juice, reduction of intraoperative bleeding, and prevention of bacterial colonization of bile may enable the incidence of mortality and hepatic failure to approach zero in patients who undergo HPD. Surgeons should strive for complete clearance of the tumor with a negative surgical margin to achieve long-term survival when performing M-HPD."
17384955,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17384955/,"INTRODUCTION: A combination of cervical and intradural aneurysm in children in the absence of systemic disorders has previously not been reported.
CASE REPORT: We report two boys with an identical combination of fusiform cervical internal carotid aneurysm and ipsilaterally located vertebrobasilar aneurysm. They had no history of trauma, they did not display any personal or familial signs of systemic disease, and the testing for collagen disease was negative. The location and appearance of the aneurysms and the identical anatomical disposition in the patients indicated a non-randomly distributed segmental vulnerability.
CONCLUSION: The cases demonstrate primary morphological signs of a developmental error being expressed in two seemingly separate segments but linked by the hypoglossal artery. It suggests a segmental error related to this embryonic vessel. They also show that few phenotypes are specific for a genotypic disorder and highlight the importance of analysing different etiologies for aneurysm formation and anatomical disposition when taking treatment strategy decisions."

METHODS: A retrospective observational cohort study was performed on a consecutive series of 568 outpatients (282 women, 286 men) with type 2 diabetes treated with either glibenclamide (n = 378) or gliclazide (n = 190). Information on all-cause mortality and on causes of death up to 31 December 2004 was obtained by the City of Florence Registry Office. Non-fatal cases requiring hospitalization were identified through the regional hospital discharge system using International Classification of Diseases.
RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 5.0 +/- 1.6 and 4.4 +/- 2.0 years for death and cardiac events, respectively; during follow-up, 33 and 11 deaths were observed in the glibenclamide and gliclazide groups, with a yearly mortality rate of 4.3 and 2.2%, respectively (p < 0.05). At Cox regression, after adjustment for potential confounders, including comorbidity, glibenclamide treatment was associated with a significant increase in all-cause mortality [OR 2.1(1.2;2.7), p < 0.05], while the difference in cardiovascular mortality was not statistically significant after adjustment for age and sex. Mortality for malignancies was significantly higher in patients treated with glibenclamide after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, and insulin and metformin treatment, [OR 3.6(1.1;11.9); p < 0.05]. A higher incidence of cardiac events was associated with glibenclamide treatment only in patients with previously known ischaemic heart disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with glibenclamide could be associated with higher mortality for cardiovascular diseases and malignancies, in comparison with gliclazide."

DESIGN: A 2 (illness vs. neutral shopping prime) x 2 (illness-related vs. control word) mixed design with repeated measures on the second factor. Participants primed for the common cold (Experiment 1) and cardiovascular disease (Experiment 2) were compared with participants receiving a neutral shopping prime on a modified Stroop color naming task.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Attentional bias to illness related words was calculated as the difference between response latencies to illness words and neutral words under the prime conditions.
RESULTS: In Experiment 1, participants primed with common cold showed a response bias to words related to the common cold but not to words related to cardiovascular disease. Attentional bias among participants primed for common cold was significantly correlated with explicit illness representations assessed by the Revised Illness Perception Questionnaire. Experiment 2 replicated the findings in a different illness domain.
CONCLUSION: Illness-specific illness schemas can be activated."
17386205,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17386205/,"OBJECTIVES: To detect type-1 LADA (latent auto-immune diabetes in adults) in adults with overweight. To describe the metabolic variations in these patients after metformin treatment.
DESIGN: Observational, multi-centre study based on a series of cases.
SETTING: Health centres in Barcelona province, Spain.
PARTICIPANTS: Diabetic patients with overweight or obesity, diagnosed with diabetes for <2 years, aged between 35 and 65, and without clinical micro-macrovascular complications and without initial glycaemia-lowering drug treatment.
INTERVENTION: Metformin administration (1700 mg/day).
MEASUREMENTS: The metabolic control variable was HbA1c. Other variables measured were: body mass index (BMI), glucose in fast, insulinaemia, C-peptide, and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). We determined ICA, GADAb and IA2Ab antibodies to diagnose LADA-type diabetes.
RESULTS: In our sample of diabetics (N=103), we detected 3 type-1 LADA cases. These patients had higher levels of HbA1c, insulin and, especially, HOMA-IR. Metformin treatment for one year improved HbA1c in both groups (with and without type-1 LADA). However, the decrease in insulin one year afterwards was greater in type-1 LADA patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The percentage of type-1 LADA in our sample made us wonder whether we should search for pancreatic antibodies more often in primary care. More studies on the prevalence of type-1 LADA in our country are needed, especially in diabetic patients with overweight. Type-1 LADA patients improved their metabolic control after metformin treatment and showed a drastic decrease in insulin levels. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether metformin improves metabolic control, even though it may not protect insulin reserves, and to contrast metformin with other drugs."

This study aims to survey the practice and preferences of urogynaecologists and urologists worldwide as regards the transobturator tapes.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seven hundred and twenty surgeons worldwide were surveyed via postal/email questionnaire about their views and practice regarding the transobturator tape procedures (TOTs). They were asked about their technique and tape material preference and their reasons for choosing them. They were also asked about every detail of the procedure.
RESULTS: Adjusted response rate was 68%. Of the responding surgeons, 97% were well aware of the TOTs and only 44.3% undertake them. While 34.16% of the surgeons thought that TOTs are the way forward in the treatment of USI, 14.84% surgeons disagreed and the majority (51%) are yet to decide. With regards to technique of TOTs, most surgeons (38%) would prefer to use both techniques, while 34% use ""In-Out"" technique only and 28% use ""Out-In"" technique only. The vast majority (72%) use polypropylene mesh tapes due to better tissue incorporation and proven safety records. A few surgeons deviate from the originally described TOTs; 13.6% use a catheter guide to deviate the bladder and urethra during the trochar insertion and 31.41% use routine cystoscopy as part of the procedure.
CONCLUSION: Whilst one-third of the responding surgeons think that the transobturator approach for tension free vaginal tapes is the way forward for the management of USI, the majority are awaiting studies with longer-term results. The variation from the originally described TOT procedures seems to be inherited from the TVT procedure."
17386909,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17386909/,"BACKGROUND: Quality of life has been shown to improve significantly after successful parathyroid surgery and normalisation of serum calcium levels. What is not known is how much of that effect is related to the patient's perception of their procedure, and whether or not patients may perceive that a minimally invasive operation provides a better outcome than that of an open procedure.
METHODS: Two hundred and two consecutive patients who had undergone parathyroid surgery were selected for telephone interview. Of that group, 152 had had an open parathyroidectomy and 50 a minimally invasive approach, either an endoscopic assisted or a direct minimal access approach. Post-operative quality of life was assessed with both the Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36) and a disease-specific questionnaire. The SF-36 results were compared with a matched Australian population.
RESULTS: Patients who underwent a direct minimal access parathyroidectomy had significantly better vitality and emotional role limitation scores than those having an open procedure. The health status scores of all patients having surgery for primary hyperparathyroidism were significantly lower in five out of the eight domains than those of a matched Australian population. There was a significantly lower incidence of post-operative symptoms in the minimally invasive group as a whole.
CONCLUSIONS: Minimally invasive parathyroidectomy is associated with a greater improvement in post-operative quality of life than the open technique despite the fact that both result in equivalent normalisation of serum calcium levels. It is not clear if this is due to differences in the technique itself or is related to the patients' perceptions of having had a ""less invasive"" surgical procedure."

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional national survey in a primary care setting in France. A total of 1474 general practitioners enrolled 4183 patients with hip or knee OA. Construct validity of PCS and MCS was assessed by convergent and divergent validity and factor analysis.
RESULTS: Records of 4133 patients (98.8%) were analyzed (2540 knee, 1593 hip OA). PCS mean scores were 32.0+/-8.4 and 31.8+/-8.4 and MCS scores 47.1+/-11.0 and 46.8+/-11.1, for knee and hip OA, respectively. Acceptable convergent and divergent validity was observed, and correlation between PCS and MCS mean scores was low (r=0.14). However, factor analysis performed on the eight subscale scores failed to support the use of PCS and MCS aggregate scores. It extracted two factors which were similar for both OA types and differed from the a priori stratification. Scores for two subscales usually attributed to MCS - emotional role and social functioning - were shared between factors, and scores for another subscale - general health perception - usually belonging to the PCS was in the mental component factor.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that aggregate scores from the PCS and MCS of the SF-36 as they are currently defined may not be optimal for used in hip and knee OA patients to assess health-related quality of life."
17387443,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17387443/,"BACKGROUND: Psychiatric disorders are a serious public health problem, especially as many psychiatric disorders begin early in life. Disability pension (DP) with psychiatric diagnoses has, since the mid 1990s, increased in several European countries and regional differences within countries have emerged. It is not clear whether these regional differences are associated with differences in access to psychiatric health care.
AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate whether regional differences in DP with psychiatric diagnoses in Norway were associated with differences in psychiatric service provision (the number of staff employed and psychiatric beds available).
METHOD: The study population consisted of individuals aged 16-67 years living in Norway (n = 4,348,410) and six southern regions. Included cases were individuals who were granted a DP with a psychiatric diagnosis between 1 January and 31 December 1990, 1995 or 2000. Mental retardation was excluded. Data on cases were collected from the National Insurance Administration and data on psychiatric health care staff and beds was collected from Specialist Health Service, Statistics Norway. Regression models were used to calculate incidence rate ratios (IRR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using Norway as reference.
RESULTS: Staffing levels (per 10,000 inhabitants) did not differ substantially between the regions, with the exception of Oslo that had about 70% higher numbers of staff employed. In regression analyses controlling for numbers of psychiatric staff and beds, regional differences in DP remained. Both men and women in the semi rural regions Aust-Agder and Vest-Agder were significantly more likely to receive a DP with a psychiatric diagnosis, while the IRR for DP was reduced in Ostfold. Different psychiatric staff groups were associated with increased or decreased rates of DP. The adjusted IRR between number of psychiatric staff (man-years of staff per 10,000 inhabitants) and DP with psychiatric diagnoses were: 1.23 (1.18-1.29) for psychologists, 1.13 (1.04-1.23) for physicians, 1.03 (1.00-1.07) for nurses and 0.84 (0.80-0.88) for auxiliary nurses. Furthermore, increased numbers of beds were associated with DP with a psychiatric diagnosis (IRR 2.86 (2.03-4.05) for 100 beds/10,000 population).
CONCLUSION: Psychiatric provision (in terms of both staff and beds) was associated with the incidence of DP with psychiatric diagnoses but regional differences in provision did not explain the regional differences in DP with a psychiatric diagnosis. Future work needs to examine whether differences in case detection and case management are associated with regional differences in DP with psychiatric diagnoses."
17388036,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17388036/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine how women in a rural area perceive their bodies and modify their practices, considering alimentary behavior disorders (overweight, obesity, and thinness).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The approach was qualitative. An initial survey of 37 women in Huatecalco, Morelos, Mexico was conducted, from which six mothers were selected for extensive interviews.
RESULTS: Concern about their bodies was detected in some of these women. Obesity is rejected and thinness is equated with ""beauty"", and the publicity around losing weight (diets,""light"" foods and drinks, exercise, etc.) is modifying some of the alimentary practices among the women.
CONCLUSION: It is suggested that the cause of this phenomenon needs to be more extensively investigated, since it could become a public health problem in rural areas of the country."
17388232,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17388232/,"OBJECTIVES: The present study was carried out in tinnitus patients in order to study the psychological distress and the biochemical measures of this stressful condition. Psychological features were compared to immune and neuroendocrine parameters in order to verify in these subjects the possible presence of psychological and somatic responses to stress.
METHODS: We studied 85 tinnitus patients who underwent hematochemical immune tests: lymphocyte subpopulations (CD3; CD4; CD3+CD4; CD8; CD19; CD16NK; CD3+CD16+CD56; and CD4/CD8), cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone, beta-endorphin, prolactin, and urinary catecholamine.
RESULTS: Clinically, significant scores were obtained for hysteria, depression, paranoia, hypochondrias, and social introversion; and high scores were obtained for anxiety, depression, care for health, difficulty of treatment, low self-esteem, family and work difficulties, and social discomfort. There was a low to medium level of self-perception of stress. The less a subject felt stressed, the higher was his or her satisfaction level in the areas of psychological and physical functioning. The scores on the tests and the biochemical measures did not show a significant correlation, but there was a tendency to correlation for the lymphocytes CD19 and CD16NK and for adrenocorticotropic hormone.
CONCLUSIONS: The comparison between the psychometric and biochemical variables did not reveal any significant correlation among stress perception, daily satisfaction, and the biochemical parameters of stress."
17388830,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17388830/,"BACKGROUND: As pleurodesis causes systemic inflammation and is associated with considerable cost and morbidity during long-term follow up, the identification of patients who will experience an unsuccessful pleurodesis would be desirable. This study was aimed to investigate whether systemic inflammatory reaction induced by insuflation of talc into the pleura can predict the outcome of pleurodesis.
METHODS: A total of 58 consecutive patients (26 men, 32 women) with malignant pleural mesothelioma underwent video-assisted thoracoscopy under general anaesthesia with monopulmonary ventilation between the years 2003 and 2006. Four grammes of asbestos-free and sterile talc were insuflated into the pleural space under direct vision. To assess the success of pleurodesis, chest radiographs were obtained at the 8th and 30th postoperative days. Venous blood samples were drawn both on admission and at the 24th hour after pleurodesis for the analysis of white blood cells, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein.
RESULTS: The mean age (standard deviation) of patients was 59.0 +/- 12.0 years. Pleurodesis was achieved (no effusion on chest radiograph) in 43 of 58 patients (74.1%)(group I), whereas it was unsuccessful in the remaining 15 patients (25.9%)(group II). There was a significant difference between two groups for basal and postpleurodesis levels of measured inflammatory parameters, C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (for each, P < 0.05). However, the difference was not significant for white blood cells between the groups.
CONCLUSION: Serum levels of inflammatory parameters (C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate) may be used to predict the success of pleurodesis in patients with malign mesothelioma who underwent thoracoscopic talc poudrage."
17388832,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17388832/,"BACKGROUND: A policy of mandatory neck exploration for zone II injuries deep to platysma was promoted in the 1950s and was associated with a reduction in mortality when compared with expectant or delayed exploration. Recently many trauma centres have been practising selective neck exploration using physical examination and imaging to stratify patients to different management strategies. In the Auckland region, patients with penetrating zone II injury deep to platysma have been managed with mandatory neck exploration. As penetrating injuries in the Auckland region are caused by a range of sharp objects, with gunshot wounds rare, outcomes of management of zone II neck injuries in this population warrant investigation. The aim of this study was to determine the rate of therapeutic neck exploration in patients with penetrating zone II neck injury in the Auckland region and to suggest optimum management strategies for such injuries.
METHODS: Retrospective audit of all patients presenting to Auckland and Middlemore Hospitals, Auckland, New Zealand, between 1995 and 2005 was carried out. Review of electronic clinical records and operation notes was also carried out.
RESULTS: An overall positive neck exploration rate of 25% was obtained (87% for patients with hard signs on physical examination). Physical examination had a sensitivity of 93% and a positive predictive value of 87% in this case series. Neck exploration was not associated with known complications or missed injuries.
CONCLUSION: In the Auckland setting, physical examination would appear to be a safe and reliable method for the stratification of patients for either operative or conservative management."
17389473,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17389473/,"PURPOSE: To examine the possible association between pseudophakia and neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
METHODS: Reports of all patients undergoing fluorescein angiography in the authors' department over a 6-year period were retrospectively reviewed. Four hundred ninety-nine patients with recent onset of neovascular AMD in one eye and early age-related maculopathy (ARM) in the fellow eye were included in the study. Lens status (phakic or pseudophakic) in both eyes at the time of onset of neovascular AMD and the time between cataract surgeries (if performed) and onset of neovascular AMD were determined.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference in lens status between eyes with neovascular AMD and fellow eyes with early ARM (115/499 [23.0%] vs. 112/499 [22.4%] pseudophakic; P = 0.88, odds ratio 1.035, 95% CI 0.770-1.391). Subgroup analysis revealed no difference between the groups with large drusen, small drusen, or pigmentary changes only (respectively, 20.3% vs. 19.6% pseudophakic, P = 0.92; 20.5% vs. 23.3% pseudophakic, P = 0.84; 33.3% vs. 31.7% pseudophakic, P = 1.0). Pseudophakic eyes with neovascular AMD had not been pseudophakic for a significantly longer period at the time of onset of neovascular AMD than their pseudophakic fellow eyes at the same time point (225.9 +/- 170.4 vs. 209.9 +/- 158.2 weeks, P = 0.27).
CONCLUSIONS: The results do not support the hypothesis that pseudophakia is a major risk factor for the development of neovascular AMD."
17389656,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17389656/,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy of switching to a second biological drug in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients.
METHODS: Since 2000, Danish RA patients (n = 1021) receiving biological therapy have been registered in the nationwide DANBIO database. The first and second treatment series of patients, who switched therapy before 2005 (n = 235), were analysed for their reasons for switching, Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28), DAS28 improvement, European League against Rheumatology (EULAR) response and drug survival. Most patients switched from infliximab to etanercept or adalimumab.
RESULTS: Median survivals for switchers' first/second treatment were 37/92 weeks (all patients' first treatment 119 weeks). Reasons for switching were lack of efficacy (LOE; 109 patients), adverse events (AE; 72), other reasons (54). If patients experienced AE to the first drug, 15% had AE to the second. Median DAS28 improvements in first/second treatment at 3 months were: LOE switchers 1.1/1.6; AE switchers 1.5/0.8. In LOE switchers, a good/moderate EULAR response was more prevalent during the second treatment course than during the first (63% versus 54%, p = 0.02). AE switchers achieved similar EULAR responses to both treatments (59% versus 50%, p = 0.38).
CONCLUSION: LOE switchers had a better clinical response to the second treatment. AE switchers responded equally well to both treatments, with a low risk of discontinuing the second drug as a result of AE. Drug survival of the switchers' second biological therapy was higher than of the first, but lower than that of non-switchers. No difference between various sequences of drugs were found. Danish post-marketing data thus support that RA patients may benefit from switching biological therapy."
17390275,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17390275/,"BACKGROUND: The antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APLS) is characterised by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies in association with thrombotic disorders of the arterial and/or venous system, spontaneous abortion and thrombocytopenia. Several studies have shown that end-stage renal disease patients with APLS are at extremely high risk for graft thrombosis and graft loss after kidney transplantation.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We report on the treatment and clinical courses of 6 APLS renal transplant patients.
RESULTS: Of 3 patients treated with low-dose subcutaneous heparin two had early graft loss due to venous graft thrombosis; of those patients treated by systemic heparin (PTT goal 45-55 s) and followed by coumadin (INR 2.5-3.0) only one had early graft loss whereas 2 grafts are doing well 2 years post-transplant.
CONCLUSION: Our experience as well as recently published data suggest that kidney transplantation can be performed successfully in APLS patients if anticoagulation therapy is performed consistently. A general APL antibody screening prior to kidney transplantation does not seem to be justified at present. A prospective, randomised multicenter study is warranted to evaluate the management of these patients with respect to intensity, type and duration of anticoagulation therapy."
17390276,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17390276/,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to improve the validity of PSA-based tests by considerations of the dilutions caused by the individual plasmatic blood volume (or other relevant body fluids).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective analyses of patients who underwent adenomectomy (n = 32) or radical prostatectomy (pT1 - 4 N0 M0; n = 60) were carried out. We calculated the PSA density (PSAD) and two new PSA-based parameters (mPSA (Vp), mPSAD (Vp)) that converted t-PSA concentration and PSAD with regard to individual Vp (according to Sprenger's modified Retzlaff formula). Comparative statistics of receiver operating characteristics (ROC-) curves, AUC, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for t-PSA, mPSA (Vp), PSAD and mPSAD (Vp) were performed.
RESULTS: PSA was positively correlated with local tumour stage. With regard to the whole range of t-PSA (n = 92; 0.1 - 88.4 microg/L) the diagnostic selection between prostate carcinoma (CaP) and benign disease (BPH) was significantly improved by PSAD (AUC = 0.803) and mPSAD (Vp) (AUC = 0.806) (p < or = 0.003) compared to t-PSA und mPSA (Vp) (AUC = 0.531). Within the range of 4.0 - 10.0 microg/L PSA, the areas under the ROC curves were much better for t-PSA (AUC = 0.663), mPSA (Vp) (0.694) and PSAD (0.931) in gereral; mPSAD (Vp) provided the best AUC (0.947). However, although considering Vp does demonstrate better AUCs, this tendency does not reach the level of significance (yet).
CONCLUSIONS: The most conclusive way to improve PSA test validity is to adjust PSA to different ""volumes"". Therefore, elaborated devices for a better preoperative investigation of the whole volume of the prostate gland and its distinct partial volumes (such as carcinoma or benign tissues), as well as applied knowledge on the distribution and kinetics of PSA in body fluids, might substantially help to optimise the detection of curable patients with unknown carcinoma of the prostate."

METHODS: As part of a population-based study, 594 participants completed questionnaires at 1, 4 and 8 weeks postpartum.
RESULTS: No relationship was found between diverse infant feeding outcomes at 1-week postpartum and the development of depressive symptomatology at 4 or 8 weeks. Conversely, mothers with an Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Score>12 at 1 week postpartum were significantly more likely at 4 and/or 8 weeks to discontinue breastfeeding, be unsatisfied with their infant feeding method, experience significant breastfeeding problems and report lower levels of breastfeeding self-efficacy.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study suggest that early identification of breastfeeding mothers with depressive symptomatology is needed not only to reduce the morbidity associated with postpartum depression but also in attempt to promote increased rates of breastfeeding duration."
17391578,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17391578/,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the results of urine cultures and reagent strip testing in 2 groups of elderly emergency department (ED) patients: an asymptomatic group unlikely to have urinary tract infection (UTI), and a group who had vague symptoms and were considered at risk for UTI.
METHODS: We performed a prospective observational convenience study with 2 groups of 100 patients aged 65 or older. The asymptomatic group consisted of afebrile patients presenting to the ED with non-infectious complaints, while the symptomatic group included patients presenting with acute confusion, weakness or fever but no apparent urinary symptoms. We defined a positive urine culture as a single organism count greater than 100,000 CFU/mL in mid-stream specimens, or greater than 1000 CFU/mL in catheter specimens. We considered reagent strips positive if they demonstrated any reaction to the leukocyte-esterase assay, the nitrite assay or both.
RESULTS: Of the 33 positive cultures, 10 had negative reagent strips. Thirteen of the 14 positive nitrite tests were culture positive for a specificity of 92.8% and a sensitivity of 36.1%. Positive cultures did not infer a diagnosis of UTI. Of the 67 positive reagent strips, 41 (61.2%) were associated with negative cultures. Likelihood ratios (LRs) in both groups affirmed the inability of the reagent strips to help significantly in decision making, with positive and negative LR in the indeterminate range (control group: 2.8 and 0.31, symptomatic group: 2.7 and 0.46, respectively).
CONCLUSION: In the elderly, reagent testing is an unreliable method of identifying patients with positive urine [corrected] cultures. Moreover, positive urine culture rates are only slightly higher in patients with vague symptoms attributable to UTI than they are in (asymptomatic) patients treated for non-urologic problems, which suggests that many positive cultures in elderly patients with non- focal systemic symptoms are false-positive tests reflecting asymptomatic bacteriuria and not UTIs. Blood cultures, regarded by many as the criterion standard for UTI, do not have sufficient specificity to confirm the diagnosis of UTI in elderly patients with non-specific symptoms."
17391594,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17391594/,"BACKGROUND: Emergency department (ED) manipulation of complete minimally angulated distal radius fractures in children may not be necessary, due to the excellent remodeling potential of these fractures.
OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study was to determine the proportion of minimally angulated distal radius fractures managed in the ED with plaster immobilization that subsequently required manipulation. Our secondary objective was to document, at follow-up, changes in angulation for each wrist fracture.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study reviewed consecutive records of all children with bi-cortical minimally angulated (</=15 degrees of angulation in the sagittal plane and </=0.5 cm of displacement) distal metaphyseal radius fractures, alone or in combination with distal ulnar fracture. Details of treatment, radiographic findings, and clinical outcomes during the subsequent orthopedic follow up were recorded.
RESULTS: Of 124 patients included in the analysis, none required manipulation after their ED visit. All but 14 (11.3%) fractures were angulated </=20 degrees within the follow-up period. Two (1.6%) fractures that were initially angulated </=15 degrees progressed to 30 degrees -35 degrees , but remodeled within 2 years to nearly perfect anatomic alignment. By 6 weeks post-injury, no patients had clinically apparent deformity and all had normal function.
CONCLUSIONS: Minimally angulated fractures of the distal metaphyseal radius managed in plaster immobilization without reduction in the ED are unlikely to require future surgical intervention."

In this study, we investigated whether or not the Greulich-Pyle (G-P) method is sufficient at forensic age estimation for Turkish children.
METHODS: Plain radiographies of left hands and wrists of 492 (241 (49.0%) female, 251 (51.0%) male) healthy children between 11 and 18 years of age for girls and 11 and 19 years of age for boys were taken. Mean chronological ages (CA) were compared with mean skeletal ages according to G-P atlas for each gender and in the second step the differences those for each age group were determined. The children were Caucasian and had a low-middle socioeconomic status in this study population. The paired sample t test was used to indicate the difference between G-P (mean skeletal age according to G-P atlas) and CA (mean chronological age). In order to indicate the relation Pearson correlation coefficient was used. Modeling the relationship between G-P and CA linear regression was used. The analyses were done under SPSS 11.5.
RESULTS: The G-P compared to their CA. The CA was 14.52+/-2.18 S.D. years, S.E.: 0.14 (median: 14.47, range: 11.07-18.92 years) whereas G-P was 15.06+/-2.31 S.D. years, S.E.: 0.15 (median: 15.00, range: 10-18 years) for girls. The difference between the two parameters was statistically significant (p<0.001). The CA was 15.28+/-2.41 S.D. years, S.E.: 0.15 (median: 15.09, S.E. range 11.13-19.94 years) and G-P was 15.41+/-2.92 S.D. years, S.E.: 0.18 (median: 15.60, range 9-19 years) for boys. The difference was not statistically significant (p>0.05). There was a high correlation (Pearson r=0.882, p<0.001) for girls and (Pearson r=0.900, p<0.001) for boys. The determination coefficient (R2) is equal to 0.778 for girls and 0.81 for boys. The regression model also tested by ANOVA and it is found significant (p<0.01) for both genders. According to age groups G-P was advanced (0.17-1.1 year) almost for all ages and differences were significant at 11, 12, 14, 16 ages for girls. G-P was delayed at 11-14 ages (0.01-0.58 year) but not significant except for 13 years and G-P were significantly advanced in 15-17 ages (0.88-0.98 years) but then delayed in 18-19 years of age (0.02-0.48) for boys. The difference's standard deviation at 12, 13, 15, 16 years of ages for girls and between 12 and 16 and 18 years of ages for boys were more than 1 year.
CONCLUSION: When the results of the previous study and this study are compared, the test method could be used technically by pediatricians and other clinicians, but it is even more important for ethically unacceptable errors to disappear, especially in cases involving the possible criminal liability of the supposed minor. So standard deviation at 12, 15 years of ages for girls and 12, 15, 18 years of ages for boys were more than 1 year. But it is not known that the other methods whether more useful or not than this method. For the time being unless any other methods will be proved more useful, we have to use this method cautiously for possible criminal liability cases in forensic age diagnosis."

To reduce extreme poverty and create the foundation for a sustainable livelihood change, BRAC undertook a targeted programme since 2002 named, Challenging the Frontiers of Poverty Reduction/Targeting the Ultra Poor (CFPR/TUP).
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of the CFPR/TUP programme on food and energy consumption.
DESIGN: Two cross sectional surveys on food consumption were conducted, a pre-intervention survey in 2002 and a post-intervention survey in 2004 covering 180 intervention and 193 non-intervention households. Three days' recall method was administrated in both the survey rounds.
RESULTS: The baseline food consumption survey showed an inadequate food intake in all households, which did not differ between the two groups. At post-intervention, the quality and quantity of food intake improved significantly in the intervention households as compared to baseline. In this group, the consumption of various food items such as rice, pulse, vegetables, fish, fruit, milk and egg showed significant improvement (p<0.001), particularly, the level of fish consumption doubled in intervention households while in control households it remained almost unchanged (14 g/day to 27 g/day for intervention vs. 11 g/day to 13 g/day for control). Energy intake increased from 1750+/-650 Kcal/day to 2138+/-704 Kcal/day in intervention households (p<0.001), whereas no significant change was observed in control households. Percentages of energy from cereals decreased from 85% to 78% in intervention households (p<0.001) while it remained unchanged in control households.

17392354,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17392354/,"BACKGROUND: Limited data are available to predict the length of time required for a patient to achieve sputum culture conversion after starting therapy for pulmonary tuberculosis.
METHODS: Rates of sputum smear and culture conversion were determined at weeks 2, 4, 8 and 16 after initiating therapy in patients admitted to our Respiratory Isolation Unit from January 1997 to December 2003.
RESULTS: For the 184 patients included in the analysis, the mean time from the initiation of appropriate therapy to sputum culture and smear conversion were 34 +/- 26 and 38 +/- 32 days (mean +/- SD) respectively. Only 53% of patients obtained negative sputum cultures within the first 4 weeks of therapy. Multivariate analysis showed that the persistence of positive cultures during the first 4 weeks of therapy was associated with high bacillary counts in sputum smears at diagnosis [OR: 2.86; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.20-6.66], lung cavitations (OR: 4.0; 95% CI: 1.63-9.09) and a prolonged period of symptoms (OR: 3.57; 95% CI: 1.43-3.57). The only factor associated with the persistence of positive cultures after more than 16 weeks of therapy was infection with a multidrug-resistant strain.
CONCLUSIONS: High initial sputum bacillary counts and drug resistance result in delayed culture conversion. This should be taken into account when decisions regarding the potential discontinuation of isolation are made. The early identification of drug resistance is important for effective infection control in hospitals."

Anecdotal reports have characterized children with TSC as having high music responsiveness despite their developmental delay. This study is intended to investigate this putative musical skill of children with TSC and to elucidate the presence of non-delayed facets of their development.
MATERIAL/METHODS: This study examined 11 children with TSC: 10 children with DSM-IV autism and 92 healthy children who participated as control subjects. Correlation was examined between results obtained using Non-Verbal MMRC, which is a validated musical responsiveness battery, and results of a scientifically accepted standardized pediatric developmental test: the New Edition of the Kyoto Scale of Psychological Development. Inter-rater reliability among the three raters was also assessed.
RESULTS: The rhythm or melody score on the Non-Verbal MMRC and DA among children with TSC showed no significant correlation. In contrast, a significant correlation was found among normal children and those with autism. Moreover, the inter-rater reliability was good.
CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that children with TSC show high responsiveness to musical stimuli despite otherwise delayed development (e.g., language, cognition, motor skills). This report is the first stating that children with TSC have a unique tendency in terms of correlation between music and developmental age. These findings indicate a non-delayed area of TSC children's development and suggest the use of music as therapeutic intervention."
17392990,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17392990/,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: It is uncertain whether high serum uric acid levels are a true independent risk factor for coronary atherosclerosis or whether the association is due to other confounding variables. We therefore studied the relationship between elevated serum uric acid levels and coronary atherosclerosis after adjustment was made for confounding factors such as age, gender, body mass index, smoking, lipid profile, blood pressure and blood glucose levels.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 240 patients referred for coronary angiography to heart centres in the Shahid-Chamran and Sina hospitals, Isfahan, Iran. Blood chemistry data as well as traditional risk factors and uric acid levels were measured at enrollment. We used vessel, stenosis and extent scores to indicate the degree of coronary artery involvement.
RESULTS: This study was conducted on 240 patients with a mean age of 56 +/- 10.9 years (66% male; 37% female) who underwent coronary angiography. Student's t-test analyses revealed that there were significant differences in the mean uric acid levels between male and female patients (p = 0.001). We found no statistically significant correlation between serum uric acid levels and coronary atherosclerosis (p > 0.05). In addition, multivariate logistic regression analyses, using coronary atherosclerosis as dependent variable and traditional risk factors and uric acid levels as independent variables, did not show any significant difference.
CONCLUSION: These findings indicated that uric acid is not associated with coronary atherosclerosis. Any correlation reported in other studies was probably due to the relationship between high serum uric acid levels and other cardiovascular risk factors."
17393367,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17393367/,"BACKGROUND: Over the last years many technical improvements have been made in hemodialysis treatment. Vascular access (VA) still remains an important problem. Although the use of indwelling vascular catheters is discouraged, in Europe there is an increasing use of them. The K/DOQI Guidelines recommend a native arteriovenous fistula (AVF) as VA of choice. As reported by DOPPS, there is considerable geographic variation in the distribution of type of VA used amongst hemodialysis patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the time patients in four European countries have to wait before undergoing their first surgery for VA (AVF or graft).
METHODS: All incident patients admitted to HD clinics located in Turkey, Italy, the UK and Portugal of the European FME clinics network between October 1, 2002 and September 30, 2004 were considered. Data were gained from the Clinical Database EuCliD.
RESULTS: 2,152 patients (males 55.9%, mean age 62.5+/-15.7 years, diabetics 27%) were selected. Italy and Portugal had a higher proportion of elderly patients. At time of admission, the proportion of patients starting dialysis with AVF ranged between 23% and 60% from Turkey to Italy respectively. Patients with an indwelling catheter at admission are expected to undergo VA surgery as soon as possible. After 3 months of follow-up, about 75% of all patients had undergone surgery, however in the UK less than 50% of the patients had had a VA procedure. Overall, males have significantly higher probability of undergoing surgery, whilst elderly patients have a lower probability (27% and 14% respectively).
CONCLUSION: Significant differences exist between countries in the time interval from referral to creation of VA. Health care system related problems seem to be the major reason to explain such differences. Patients in the UK have longer waiting times than the other countries studied."
17394179,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17394179/,"OBJECTIVE: The Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada (SPARCC) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) spinal inflammation index has been developed to objectively measure inflammation in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and to assess change in response to therapeutic intervention. Scoring of the entire spine limits feasibility and a scoring method that records inflammation in only the more severely affected spinal segments may improve feasibility without sacrificing performance.
METHODS: MRI films of 68 patients with AS were assessed in random order by 2 blinded readers. Interreader reliability was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient. Pre- and posttreatment MRI films of 29 patients randomized to placebo or anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFalpha) therapy were read by readers blinded to chronology, and responsiveness was assessed by effect size and standardized response mean. The performance of scores based on 6, 8, 10, and all 23 spinal discovertebral units (DVU) was compared.
RESULTS: The median number of affected spinal levels per patient was 6.0 and 62% of all affected levels were included when analysis was limited to only the 6 most severely affected levels per patient. Comparison of DVU scores that were limited to only the more severely affected DVU (6-, 8-, 10-DVU score) with scores for all 23 spinal DVU showed excellent interreader reliability for status and change scores (Spearman's correlation >0.90) as well as similar construct validity. Responsiveness to anti-TNFalpha therapy was greater when the more limited scoring methods were used and was greatest with the 6-DVU score.
CONCLUSION: The SPARCC MRI spinal inflammation index performs better when analysis is limited to a maximum of 6 most severely affected levels compared with assessment of the entire spine. This should improve its feasibility in clinical trials and research."
17394181,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17394181/,"OBJECTIVE: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as a class have been shown to increase the risk of congestive heart failure (CHF) compared with celecoxib. The magnitude of the risk for individual NSAIDs is not known.
METHODS: Using administrative databases, we performed a nested case-control study in a population-based cohort of patients ages >or=66 years admitted for CHF between January 1998 and March 2003. Cases were patients readmitted for CHF after cohort entry (index date). Four controls were matched to each case on date of cohort entry and time between cohort entry and index date. Exposure was the current use of an NSAID or a coxib in the 7 days prior to CHF readmission. Using conditional logistic regression, we calculated the odds of readmission for CHF in patients exposed to naproxen, diclofenac, ibuprofen, indomethacin, or rofecoxib compared with celecoxib, after adjusting for possible confounding variables.
RESULTS: We identified 8,512 cases and 34,048 controls. The baseline characteristics between the groups were similar in general. The odds of being readmitted for CHF were higher in patients currently exposed to indomethacin (odds ratio [OR] 2.04, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.16-3.58) or rofecoxib (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.19-2.11) compared with celecoxib. There was no difference between naproxen, diclofenac, and ibuprofen compared with celecoxib, although the numbers of exposed cases and controls were small.
CONCLUSION: In elderly patients with known CHF, indomethacin and rofecoxib are associated with a greater risk of recurrent CHF compared with celecoxib. Alternatives should be considered for patients with CHF who require antiinflammatory drugs."
17394614,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17394614/,"AIM: This paper is a report of a study to explore experiences of partner notification for syphilis from the perspectives of gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men.
BACKGROUND: Partner notification is the 'cornerstone' of the prevention and control of sexually acquired infections. As a health strategy, it has been in use for over six decades and is employed across all continents. Its success relies almost entirely on the voluntary response of index patients in disclosing details of their sexual partners and sexual practices and the voluntary response of sexual partners who have been traced. However, internationally, few studies have explicitly explored lay experiences of partner notification.
METHOD: A purposive sample of 40 gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men was recruited from two genitourinary clinics in the Greater Dublin area of Ireland and a variety of gay social venues. Semi-structured interviews were carried out between December 2002 and February 2004.
FINDINGS: Men's perspectives on partner notification featured three interweaving stages: on tracing sexual partners, on informing partners and on attending clinics. Participants were in favour of partner notification, but did not find it easy to comply with the demands it made on their relationships. Compliance was difficult not only because of the problem of physically tracing casual and anonymous partners, but also because of the challenge of actually notifying partners. The main incentive for contacts to attend clinics was concern for their own health and that of others. Barriers to attending were fear of being exposed to the stigma of being gay and/or having a sexually acquired infection.
CONCLUSION: There is a need to develop evidence-based methods, which are grounded in the lay experience, to support index patients in 'breaking bad news' and for continued efforts to de-stigmatize sexually acquired infections and homosexuality in the view of the general public."
17394639,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17394639/,"BACKGROUND: Recent national healthcare reforms in Thailand aim to transfer primary care to family physicians, away from more expensive specialists. As Family Medicine has yet to be established as a separate discipline in Thailand, newly trained family physicians work alongside untrained general doctors in primary care. While it has been shown that Family Medicine training programs in Thailand can increase the quality of referrals from primary care doctors to specialists, information is lacking about whether such training affects the quality of patient care. In the Department of Family Medicine at Ramathibodi Hospital, trained family physicians work with residents and general doctors. Although this situation is not typical within Thailand, it offers us the opportunity to look for variations in the levels of satisfaction reported by patients treated by different types of primary care doctor.
METHODS: During a two-week period in December 2005, 2,600 questionnaires (GPAQ) were given to patients visiting the Department of Family Medicine at Ramathibodi Hospital. Patients were given the choice of whether or not they wanted to participate in the study. A cross-sectional analysis was performed on the completed questionnaires. Mean GPAQ scores were calculated for each dimension and scored out of 100. Student t-tests, ANOVA with F-test statistic and multiple comparisons by Scheffe were used to compare the perceived characteristics of the different groups of doctors. Five dimensions were measured ranging from access to care, continuity of care, communication skills, enablement (the patient's knowledge of a self-care plan after the consultation) and overall satisfaction.
RESULTS: The response rate was 70%. There were significant differences in mean GPAQ scores among faculty family physicians, residents and general doctors. For continuity of care, patients gave higher scores for faculty family physicians (67.87) compared to residents (64.57) and general doctors (62.51). For communication skills, patients gave the highest GPAQ scores to faculty family physicians (69.77) and family medicine residents (69.79). For enablement, faculty family physicians received the highest score (82.44) followed by family medicine residents (80.75) and general doctors (76.29).
CONCLUSION: Faculty family physicians scored higher for continuity of care when compared with general doctors and residents. General doctors had lower GPAQ scores for communication skills and enablement when compared to faculty family physicians and residents. Faculty family physicians had the highest GPAQ scores in many dimensions of family practice skills, followed by residents and general doctors."
17394656,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17394656/,"BACKGROUND: For shared decision making doctors need to communicate the effectiveness of therapies such that patients can understand it and discriminate between small and large effects. Previous research indicates that patients have difficulties in understanding risk measures. This study aimed to test the hypothesis that lay people may be able to discriminate between therapies when their effectiveness is expressed in terms of postponement of an adverse disease event.
METHODS: In 2004 a random sample of 1,367 non-institutionalized Danes aged 40+ was interviewed in person. The participants were asked for demographic information and asked to consider a hypothetical preventive drug treatment. The respondents were randomized to the magnitude of treatment effectiveness (heart attack postponement of 1 month, 6 months, 12 months, 2 years, 4 years and 8 years) and subsequently asked whether they would take such a therapy. They were also asked whether they had hypercholesterolemia or had experienced a heart attack.
RESULTS: In total 58% of the respondents consented to the hypothetical treatment. The proportions accepting treatment were 39%, 52%, 56%, 64%, 67% and 73% when postponement was 1 month, 6 months, 12 months, 2 years, 4 years and 8 years respectively. Participants who thought that the effectiveness information was difficult to understand, were less likely to consent to therapy (p = 0.004).
CONCLUSION: Lay people can discriminate between levels of treatment effectiveness when they are presented in terms of postponement of an adverse event. The results indicate that such postponement is a comprehensible measure of effectiveness."
24521531,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24521531/,"PURPOSE: Prescription drug abuse has reached epidemic proportions. Nonmedical prescription opioid use carries increasingly high costs. Despite the need to cultivate efforts that are both effective and fiscally responsible, the cost-effectiveness of universal evidence-based-preventive-interventions (EBPIs) is rarely evaluated. This study explores the performance of these programs to reduce nonmedical prescription opioid use.
METHODS: Sixth graders from twenty-eight rural public school districts in Iowa and Pennsylvania were blocked by size and geographic location and then randomly assigned to experimental or control conditions (2002-2010). Within the intervention communities, prevention teams selected a universal family and school program from a menu of EBPIs. All families were offered a family-based program in the 6th grade and received one of three school-based programs in 7th-grade. The effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of each school program by itself and with an additional family-based program were assessed using propensity and marginal structural models.
RESULTS: This work demonstrates that universal school-based EBPIs can efficiently reduce nonmedical prescription opioid use. Further, findings illustrate that family-based programs may be used to enhance the cost-effectiveness of school-based programs.
CONCLUSIONS: Universal EBPIs can effectively and efficiently reduce nonmedical prescription opioid use. These programs should be further considered when developing comprehensive responses to this growing national crisis."
24521564,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24521564/,"BACKGROUND: We evaluated whether quality of life correlates to age and activity in children following heart transplantation. In addition, quality of life in children following heart transplantation was compared with previously reported values in children with congenital heart disease. Quality of life remains an important aspect of therapy.
METHODS: The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Generic Core Scales and Cardiac Module were administered to 14 children who had previously undergone heart transplantation. Patients wore a pedometer for 7 days to assess daily activity.
RESULTS: The age at assessment was 13.1±1.9 years. The patients were 7.1±5.7 years post heart transplantation. There was a negative correlation between age at first heart transplantation and emotional (r=-0.64; p<0.05) and school function (r=-0.57; p<0.05). A negative correlation between patient's age at assessment and perceived physical appearance existed (r=-0.53; p<0.05). Daily steps negatively correlated with cognitive (r=-0.58; p<0.05), physical (r=-0.63; p<0.05), emotional (r=-0.62; p<0.05), and school function (r=-0.66; p<0.01). Heart transplantation patients reported better scores for treatment and symptoms (p<0.05) but lower physical health scores (p<0.01) than those with moderate congenital heart disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Paediatric heart transplantation patients reported overall similar quality of life as patients with moderate congenital heart disease. Children receiving heart transplants at an older age may require additional emotional and educational support. Heart transplantation patients with higher activity levels may be more aware of their physical, emotional, and cognitive limitations, and thus score lower on these quality of life indicators."
24521589,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24521589/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether well-child visits are a risk factor for subsequent influenza-like illness (ILI) visits within a child's family.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort.
METHODS: Using data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey from the years 1996-2008, we identified 84,595 families. For each family, we determined those weeks in which a well-child visit or an ILI visit occurred. We identified 23,776 well-child-visit weeks and 97,250 ILI-visit weeks. We fitted a logistic regression model, where the binary dependent variable indicated an ILI clinic visit in a particular week. Independent variables included binary indicators to denote a well-child visit in the concurrent week or one of the previous 2 weeks, the occurrence of the ILI visit during the influenza season, and the presence of children in the family in each of the age groups 0-3, 4-7, and 8-17 years. Socioeconomic variables were also included. We also estimated the overall cost of well-child-exam-related ILI using data from 2008.
RESULTS: We found that an ILI office visit by a family member was positively associated with a well-child visit in the same or one of the previous 2 weeks (odds ratio, 1.54). This additional risk translates to potentially 778,974 excess cases of ILI per year in the United States, with a cost of $500 million annually.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results should encourage ambulatory clinics to strictly enforce infection control recommendations. In addition, clinics could consider time-shifting of well-child visits so as not to coincide with the peak of the influenza season."
24521747,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24521747/,"OBJECTIVES: To explore the views of potential orthognathic patients regarding the influence of the BOS Orthognathic DVD in their decision making process.
DESIGN: Qualitative, cross-sectional study.
SETTING: A UK dental teaching hospital.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients considering orthognathic treatment.
METHODS: New patients were recruited from orthognathic clinics following an initial consultation. After an appropriate time to view the DVD, in-depth interviews were conducted with 10 patients (aged 16-48 years) in their homes. Interviews explored the attitudes and perceptions that influenced decisions about surgery, with a focus on the role of the DVD in this process. The interviews were transcribed and a framework analysis was undertaken.
RESULTS: The main themes identified were participant perceptions on the patient stories, use of images, the nature of the DVD itself and its usefulness in the decision making process. Participants reported they were heavily influenced by the patient stories. Virtual animations of surgery were seen as useful; whereas the before and after images of surgery were found to be disorientating. The design of the menu resulted in confusion or information being missed. The DVD was seen as a trusted resource, whereas the Internet was seen as biased, general and sensationalistic.
CONCLUSIONS: The DVD gives trusted information that patients cannot obtain or process from professional sources or the Internet. If used properly it can have a role in the decision making process, but should be seen within the context of other influences on the patient. This research has highlighted some aspects of the DVD that could be improved upon."
24521778,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24521778/,"BACKGROUND: Acute pyelonephritis (APN) versus acute rejection (AR) is a frequently encountered diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma in kidney transplants. Variable culture results, overlapping histologic features, and persistent graft dysfunction despite antibiotics are frequently encountered. Therefore, we explored the utility of intragraft microRNA profiles to distinguish between allograft APN and AR.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2003 and 2011, we identified 49 patients with biopsy features of APN, within the first 2 years posttransplant. MicroRNA profiling was performed on 20 biopsies (normal kidney, n=4; unequivocal AR, n=5; features of APN, n=11).
RESULTS: Only 32% (16/49) of the patients had concomitant positive urine cultures at biopsy, and in 8 of 16 patients, colony count was less than 10 CFU/mL. In 14 of 49 patients, positive urine culture did not coincide with the biopsy, and in 19 of 49 patients, urine cultures were negative. On microRNA profiling, good clustering was seen among the normal kidneys and among AR biopsies. Among the 11 biopsies with features of APN, 4 biopsies showed good clustering with a pattern distinct from AR; (these patients recovered graft function with antibiotics); 7 of 11 biopsies showed heterogeneity in microRNA profiles and variable outcomes with antibiotic treatment. We identified a panel of 25 microRNAs showing statistical difference in expression between AR and APN. MiR-99b, miR-23b let-7b-5p, miR-30a, and miR-145 were validated using qPCR.
CONCLUSION: Allograft pyelonephritis can be a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. A gestalt approach is required. In addition to histology and cultures, differential intragraft microRNA expression may prove helpful to distinguish APN from AR in renal allograft biopsies."
24521788,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24521788/,"AIM: To determine whether a child with chronic wet cough and poor response to at least 4 weeks of oral antibiotics is more likely to have bronchiectasis.
METHODS: All chest multi-detector computerised tomography (MDCT) scans at a single paediatric tertiary hospital from April 2010 to August 2012 were reviewed retrospectively so as to identify those ordered by respiratory physicians for assessment of children with a chronic wet cough. Information regarding age, sex, ethnicity, indication for imaging and the response to at least 4 weeks of antibiotics before having the scan were recorded from their charts. The data were analysed using simple and multiple logistic regression.
RESULTS: Of the 144 (87 males) eligible children, 106 (65 males, 30 Indigenous) aged 10-199 months had MDCT scan evidence of bronchiectasis. Antibiotic data were available for 129 children. Among the 105 children with persistent cough despite at least 4 weeks of antibiotics, 88 (83.8%) had bronchiectasis, while of the 24 children whose cough resolved after antibiotics, only six (25.0%) received this diagnosis (adjusted OR 20.9; 95% CI 5.36 to 81.8). Being Indigenous was also independently associated with radiographic evidence of bronchiectasis (adjusted OR 5.86; 95% CI 1.20 to 28.5).
CONCLUSIONS: Further investigations including a MDCT scan should be considered in a child with a chronic wet cough that persists following 4 weeks of oral antibiotics. However, while reducing the likelihood of underlying bronchiectasis, responding well to a single prolonged course of antibiotics does not exclude this diagnosis completely."
24521962,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24521962/,"BACKGROUND: The United States has established aortic supercenters, which have demonstrated clear improvements in the short-term and long-term outcomes after surgery on the thoracic aorta. This model of care does not exist in the United Kingdom. We have looked at our recent experience of emergency and elective thoracic aortic surgery and describe and compare our operative outcomes and 10-year survival with other regional centers and supercenters worldwide.
METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of data collected prospectively from our cardiac database on patients who underwent surgery on the thoracic aorta (n=318) between November 1999 and November 2012. The outcome measures were adjusted operative mortality, postoperative complications, and long-term survival.
RESULTS: Type A dissection was carried out on 23.90% of the patients and 76.10% had surgery on the aortic root and thoracic aorta for nondissection. The mean age of the patients was 62.21±14.1 years. The mean logistic EuroSCORE was 26 in the dissection group and 19 in the nondissection group. Hospital mortality was significantly greater (P<.05) in the dissection group compared with the nondissection group (23.7% vs 12.8%). Survival after dissection and nondissection surgery was 66.3%±5.6% versus 77.4%±2.8%, respectively, at 3 years, 63.9%±5.9% versus 71.8%±3.2% at 5 years, and 53.7%±7.4% versus 47.1%±6.0% at 10 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Our outcomes are comparable with other regional centers worldwide; however, they are not as good as those reported from the aortic supercenters. There should be continued impetus regarding the establishment of thoracic aortic surgery guidelines and specialist aortic centers in the United Kingdom."

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the impact of RB on patient perceptions of surgical informed consent.
DESIGN: Secondary analysis of a randomized trial.
SUBJECTS: Elective surgical patients were consented using iMedConsent, the VA's computer-based IC platform. Patients were randomized to RB (IC could not be signed until the patient satisfactorily expressed key elements) or standard iMedConsent (no RB).
MEASURES: A questionnaire was given immediately after IC assessing time for decision, satisfaction with and ease of understanding consent, and the amount of information provided about the proposed surgery (e.g., indications, benefits, risks, and alternatives). Groups were compared with Χ tests.
RESULTS: We enrolled 575 subjects (276 RB and 299 no RB); 92% were men with a mean age of 61.6 years and high school level reading ability. The groups were comparable in their perceptions regarding time to make a decision (RB 88% Strongly Agree (SA), no RB 88% SA; P = 0.61), satisfaction with consent (RB 90% SA, no RB 87% SA; P = 0.27), ease of understanding (RB 69% SA, no RB 67% SA; P = 0.73) receipt of the right amount of information regarding the indications (RB 85% SA, no RB 87%; P = 0.61), the benefits (RB 87% SA, no RB 86% SA; P = 0.29), and the risks (RB 87% SA, no RB 84% SA; P = 0.19) of surgery. More of the RB group felt they received the right amount of information about alternatives to surgery (RB 80% SA) than did the no RB group (69% SA); P = 0.01.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients were highly satisfied with RB during surgical IC RB is not detrimental to the consent process and may improve informed consent for surgery.

DESIGN: A cross-sectional study.
SETTING: Primary health-care centres in Jaen, Spain.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 168 chronically-ill elderly outpatients aged from 65 to 89 years.
MEASUREMENTS: Quality of life was measured using the World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF) questionnaire. A nutritional assessment was undertaken including socio-demographic variables, anthropometric measurements (body-mass index and calf circumference), functional evaluation (Barthel index and Folstein mini-mental status test) and a dietetic questionnaire. The mini-nutritional assessment test was used as an assessment tool to detect nutritional risk.
RESULTS: Quality of life in chronically-ill elderly subjects, as determined by the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire, which diminishes with age, is independent of anthropometric parameters and a statistically significant difference was found between gender, socio-demographic characteristics, functional capacity, nutritional status and the kind of chronic disease (p<0.05).
CONCLUSION: The relationship between the quality of life with the patients' socio-demographic characteristics, functional capacity and nutritional status underlines the importance of taking these factors into account in the management of chronically ill patients, especially women."
24522621,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24522621/,"INTRODUCTION: Traditionally, patients are kept nil-per-os/nil-by-mouth (NPO/NBM) prior to invasive cardiac procedures, yet there exists neither evidence nor clear guidance about the benefits of this practice.
OBJECTIVES: To demonstrate that percutaneous cardiac catheterisation does not require prior fasting.
METHODS: The data source is a retrospective analysis of data registry of consecutive patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and stable angina at two district general hospitals in the UK with no on-site cardiac surgery services.
RESULTS: A total of 1916 PCI procedures were performed over a 3-year period. None of the patients were kept NPO/NBM prior to their coronary procedures. The mean age was 67±16 years. 1349 (70%) were men; 38.5% (738/1916) had chronic stable angina, while the rest had ACS. 21% (398/1916) were diabetics while 53% (1017/1916) were hypertensive. PCI was technically successful in 95% (1821/1916) patients. 88.5% (1697/1916) had transradial approach. 77% (570/738) of elective PCI patients were discharged within 6 h postprocedure. No patients required emergency endotracheal intubation and there were no occurrences of intraprocedural or postprocedural aspiration pneumonia.
CONCLUSIONS: Our observational study demonstrates that patients undergoing PCI do not need to be fasted prior to their procedures."
24522865,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24522865/,"INTRODUCTION: The use of tourniquet in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has resulted in negligible intra-operative blood loss but notable post-operative blood loss, creating the ideal scenario for using topical haemostatic agents intra-operatively. Recently, medical adjuvants including tranexamic acid (TXA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) have been introduced. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of intra-articular TXA and H2O2 in reducing blood loss during TKA.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty patients, who underwent a primary TKA with 1,500 mg of intra-articular TXA between May 2011 and December 2011, were compared with two matching cohorts of 50 patients each who underwent TKA with 100 ml of 3 % H2O2 wash and TKA without any TXA or H2O2. All surgeries were performed by two senior surgeons. The total blood loss was calculated by the hemoglobin balance method.
RESULTS: The pre-operative serum hemoglobin levels were 13.1 ± 1.3, 13.1 ± 1.3 and 13.0 ± 1.2 g/dl (p > 0.05); while the drop in serum hemoglobin levels post-operatively was 2.0 ± 0.7, 2.4 ± 0.9 and 2.7 ± 0.8 g/dl for the TXA, H2O2 and Control groups, respectively (p < 0.001). The total amount of blood loss was 596 ± 449, 710 ± 279 and 760 ± 228 ml, respectively (p = 0.046). There was no difference in the duration of surgery between the three groups (p > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that intra-articular TXA reduced blood loss during TKA without significantly increasing the duration of surgery. We cannot justify H2O2 wash as an alternative to intra-articular TXA to reduce blood loss during TKA."

PURPOSE: To evaluate whether stress perfusion cardiac MRI is capable of detecting myocardial hypoperfusion in patients with 3-vessel CAD reliably.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two hundred and five patients with symptoms of CAD were included. The examination protocol comprised imaging of myocardial perfusion at stress (0.14 mg/kg/min adenosine for 4 min) using a 2D saturation recovery gradient echo sequence after administration of gadobutrol (0.1 mmol/kg body weight). Perfusion sequences were assessed qualitatively by two experienced observers. Coronary angiography served as standard of reference.
RESULTS: Sensitivity and specificity for hemodynamically relevant stenoses in patients with 0-, 1-, 2-, 3-vessel coronary artery disease were 100%/91%, 91%/73%, 90%/71%, 92%/64%; positive/negative predictive value, 67%/100%, 91%/73%, 83%/81%, 93%/58%; diagnostic accuracy, 93%/87%/83%/87%, respectively. The negative predictive value in patients with 3-vessel CAD was lower than in patients with 0- and 2-vessel CAD and the specificity lower than in patients with no CAD whereas the positive predictive value was higher than in patients with no CAD. The other proportions did not differ significantly between the groups.
CONCLUSION: The diagnostic value of stress perfusion cardiac MRI in patients with 3-vessel CAD is comparable to results in patients with 1- or 2-vessel CAD. In the rare event that stress perfusion images do not depict regional hypoperfusion in patients with severe 3-vessel CAD, myocardial ischemia could be identified by reduced semi-quantitative perfusion parameters."
24523431,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24523431/,"BACKGROUND: Older patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) are often lacking optimal support to continue rehabilitation after discharge from hospital. The objective of the study was to examine whether a home-based case management programme led by nurses can improve atherogenic risk factors, physical functioning, and mental health in the first year following discharge.
METHODS: The KORINNA study is a randomized two-armed parallel group trial including 329 patients (aged 65-92 years) from the Augsburg Hospital in southern Germany. The intervention consisted of an individualized follow-up programme with a duration of 1 year, including home visits and telephone calls. The control group received usual care. Secondary outcome measures included clinical parameters (blood pressure, lipid parameters), functional status measures, cognitive status, depressive symptoms, and nutrition risk.
RESULTS: At 1-year follow up, patients in the intervention group (n = 116) had significantly better low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (-8.4 mg/dl, 95% CI -16.4 to -0.4), hand grip strength (+2.53 kg, 95% CI 0.56 to 4.50), and SCREEN-II nutrition risk scores (+2.03, 95% CI 0.58 to 3.48) than patients in the control group (n = 136). The intervention group also had better mean scores with regard to self-reported disability, activities in daily living, and mental health, but differences were not always significant and meaningful.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the KORINNA study indicate that nurse-based case management can improve blood lipid levels, functional status, and nutrition risk of aged patients with MI."
24523637,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24523637/,"BACKGROUND: Increased insulin resistance is an extragastrointestinal manifestation of Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection. HP changes the level of inflammatory markers and cytokines and changes the adipocyte function by altering the adiponectin level. Given the high prevalence of HP and diabetes in our society, we evaluated the association between HP and serum adiponectin level. In this cross-sectional study, 211 diabetic patients under treatment other than insulin were studied. These patients were divided into two groups of HP+ and HP- based on their HP IgG antibody serology and their blood adiponectin levels were measured. Data was analyzed using independent t-test, Chi-square test, and Fisher's exact test.
RESULTS: Seventy-two patients with an average age of 51.56 ± 8.34 years were HP- and 139 patients with an average age of 50.35 ± 9.01 years were HP+. The mean serum adiponectin level in HP- and HP+ groups was 4.54 ± 5.43 and 5.64 ± 3.88 ng/mL, respectively. Insulin resistance degree was significantly higher in HP+ group (HP- = 3.160 ± 3.327 versus HP+ = 4.484 ± 3.781, P = 0.013) but no significant difference was found between the mean serum adiponectin level in HP- and HP+ groups (P = 0.140).
CONCLUSIONS: Although the insulin resistance degree was significantly higher in HP+ diabetic patients, no significant relationship was found between HP infection and serum levels of adiponectin."
24524380,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24524380/,"BACKGROUND: Medication-overuse headache (MOH) is caused by the regular use of medications to treat headache. There has been a lack of research into awareness of MOH. We distributed an electronic survey to undergraduate students and their contacts via social networking sites. Analgesic use, awareness of MOH, perceived change in behaviour following educational intervention about the risks of MOH and preferred terminology for MOH was evaluated.
FINDINGS: 485 respondents completed the questionnaire (41% having received healthcare training). 77% were unaware of the possibility of MOH resulting from regular analgesic use for headache. Following education about MOH, 80% stated they would reduce analgesic consumption or seek medical advice. 83% indicated that over the counter analgesia should carry a warning of MOH. The preferred terminology for MOH was painkiller-induced headache.
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the lack of awareness of MOH. Improved education about MOH and informative packaging of analgesics, highlighting the risks in preferred lay terminology (i.e., painkiller-induced headache), may reduce this iatrogenic morbidity and warrants further evaluation."
24524652,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24524652/,"BACKGROUND: Although an increased risk of preeclampsia in pregnancies conceived by in vitro fertilization (IVF) has been reported, it remains unknown whether IVF is associated with preeclampsia. In the present study, we sought to investigate whether IVF is associated with preeclampsia in pregnant women using propensity score matching analysis.
METHODS: This study included 3,084 pregnant women who visited the National Center for Child Health and Development before 20 weeks of gestation without hypertension or renal disease and delivered a singleton after 22 weeks of gestation between 2009 and 2011. Of the 3084 patients, 474 (15.4%) conceived by IVF (IVF group) and 2,610 (84.6%) conceived without IVF (non-IVF group). The propensity score for receiving IVF was estimated using multiple logistic regression with 27 maternal and paternal variables. This model yielded a c-statistic of 0.852, indicating a strong ability to differentiate between those conceiving with and without IVF. The association between IVF and onset of preeclampsia was assessed by the propensity matched sample (pair of N = 474).
RESULTS: There were 46 preeclampsia cases (1.5%) in the total study population, with a higher proportion of cases in the IVF group (15 cases, 3.2%) than the non-IVF group (31 cases, 1.2%). Before propensity score matching, the IVF group was 2.72 (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 1.46-5.08) times more likely to have preeclampsia when unadjusted, and 2.32 (95% CI: 1.08-4.99) times more likely to have preeclampsia when adjusted for maternal and paternal variables by logistic regression. After propensity score matching, the IVF group did not show a significantly greater association with preeclampsia compared to the non-IVF group (odds ratio: 2.50, 95% CI: 0.49-12.89), although point estimates showed a positive direction.
CONCLUSIONS: Propensity score matching analysis revealed that the association between IVF and preeclampsia became weaker than when conventional adjustments are made in multivariate logistic regression analysis, suggesting that the association between IVF and preeclampsia might be confounded by residual unmeasured factors."
24524844,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24524844/,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the patient satisfaction with medications commonly used for migraine therapy in patients seen in headache clinic in China with emphasis on the evaluation of Chinese patent medicine (CPM) in relieving acute migraine attack.
METHODS: Patients admitted at headache clinics in the neurological departments of four hospitals during April to October 2011 were enrolled in the investigation. The questionnaire was designed based on the validation of a diagnostic questionnaire for a population-based survey in China in 2009.
RESULTS: Among 219 eligible patients, 58% had used CPM at the acute attack of migraine while the guideline-recommended treatments were seldom used. However, patients using CPMs were less satisfied than those using Western Medicines (WMs) in either single medication groups or mixed medication groups (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Fifty-eight percent of the eligible respondents in Guangdong and Guangxi Province had used CPM at the acute attack of migraine, but based on our data, the effect of CPM on treating migraine attack was poor with low satisfaction compared with WMs. However, many factors may bias or explain our findings. This suggests the need for accelerated research in understanding patient choice, treatment availability, and use of medications."
24524916,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24524916/,"PURPOSE: Some authors have questioned the benefit of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of thyroid nodules ≥ 4 cm. They report that the results of the FNA are not as reliable when compared to nodules <4 cm. The aims of this study are to evaluate the accuracy and predictive values of ultrasound-guided FNA (USFNA) of thyroid nodules ≥ 4 cm and compare these findings to nodules <4 cm.
METHODS: A retrospective study of 998 patients who underwent thyroid surgery between 2006 and 2012 at the McGill University Thyroid Cancer Center was performed. USFNA and post-operative pathology diagnoses of nodules ≥ 4 cm versus those <4 cm were compared. Pre-operative USFNA results were divided into three groups: benign, indeterminate, and malignant/suspicious for malignancy subgroups. Post-operative results were separated into benign and malignant groups.
RESULTS: There were 225 patients with nodules ≥ 4 cm and 773 patients with nodules <4 cm. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for USFNA of nodules ≥ 4 cm were 84.62% (CI 71.91-93.10), 91.49% (CI 79.6-97.58), 91.67% (CI 80.0-97.63) and 84.31% (CI 71.4-92.95), respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for USFNA of nodules <4 cm were 90.48% (CI 86.1-93.8), 85.92% (CI 75.6-93.02), 95.8% (CI 92.41-97.96) and 71.76% (CI 60.95-81.0), respectively. The difference in diagnostic accuracy of USFNA between both groups was not statistically significant (p>0.05).
CONCLUSION: This study shows that the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for USFNA of nodules ≥ 4 cm are similar to that of smaller nodules. It is therefore suggested that these nodules undergo USFNA."
24525047,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24525047/,"BACKGROUND: It has been shown that left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD) develops in patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS). However, there is not sufficient evidence in the literature to determine whether this condition is due to increase in blood pressure, which is frequently encountered in MetS. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis whether LVDD in MetS is independent from the presence of hypertension.
METHODS: A total of 60 patients diagnosed with MetS and 30 healthy people, who were age- and gender-matched with the patient group, were included in the study as the control group. In the study group, 30 of the patients were normotensive whereas the other 30 had hypertension. Conventional echocardiographic examinations and tissue Doppler imaging were performed besides measurements of demographic and biochemical parameters.
RESULTS: In the hypertensive MetS group, early diastolic filling flow (E), early diastolic mitral annular velocity (E'), and E/A ratio were significantly lower compared to the control group. Late diastolic filling flow (A), deceleration time (DT), late diastolic mitral annular velocity (A'), and E/E' ratio were higher in the hypertensive MetS group than the control group. In the normotensive MetS group, E, E', and E/A ratio were also lower compared to the control group whereas DT, A', and E/E' ratio were higher.
CONCLUSION: These findings support the idea that LVDD may develop in patients with MetS even in the absence of hypertension. In addition, co-existence of hypertension with MetS contributes to further worsening of diastolic functions."
24525059,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24525059/,"BACKGROUND: Patient weights are frequently used in surgery for essential calculations including preoperative surgical planning, dosing of medications, and qualification for insurance reimbursement. Often, there is a disparity between patient-reported and actual measured weights. This study examines differences between self-reported and measured weights and implications in breast reduction surgery.
METHODS: A review was performed of 197 consecutive women who presented for breast surgery at an academic institution. Self-reported weights were recorded during the initial encounter, and the patients were subsequently weighed on the same day. A paired t-test was used to compare the self-reported and actual measured weights and stratified analysis performed based on body mass index (BMI). The Schnur sliding scale was used to estimate resection weights for reduction mammaplasty.
RESULTS: The overall mean difference in reported and measured weight was 3.0 lbs standard deviation (SD) 8.9 (P < 0.0001) with a maximum overestimation of 25 lb and underestimation of 80 lb. Statistically significant differences were found when stratified analysis was performed based on BMI as mean differences in the overweight (BMI 25-30) and obese (BMI > 30) groups were 1.7 lb SD 5.5 (P < 0.026) and 4.9 lbs SD 11.8 (P < 0.0002), respectively. Significant differences in calculated breast reduction resection weights, based on the Schnur sliding scale, were also found when comparing self-reported and measured weights in all groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Significant disparities between self-reported and measured weights were identified in patients presenting for breast surgery. These differences can influence important calculations of resection weights for breast reduction surgery. These differences may also affect dosing of medications and preoperative planning."
24525426,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24525426/,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Gallbladder specimens are routinely sent for histopathological examination after cholecystectomy in order to rule out the presence of gallbladder carcinoma (GBC). However, there is no evidence for the benefit of this costly practice. Our aim was to determine whether a selective strategy based on macroscopic appearance of gallbladder specimens is a reliable strategy to exclude them from histopathological examination.
METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted from January 2007 until November 2011 in a large community hospital in The Netherlands. All gallbladder specimen reports (n = 1,393) after cholecystectomy were included and searched for abnormal findings. Reports were excluded when a full histopathological report was not available (n = 18).
RESULTS: Out of the 1,375 patients, 185 had a macroscopically abnormal gallbladder specimen. Of these patients, 6 had GBC. All patients with GBC had macroscopic abnormalities, giving a negative predictive value of 100% to exclude gallbladder specimens from histopathological examination based on macroscopic abnormalities.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on our study it seems justified to exclude gallbladder specimens from histopathological examination based on the absence of macroscopic abnormalities. A more selective policy will reduce medical costs, saving EUR 1.3 million a year in The Netherlands alone, whilst maintaining patient safety."
24525746,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24525746/,"STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective radiographic study.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between pelvic tilt (PT) and the sacro-femoral-pubic angle (SFP angle) in AIS patients and to clarify whether the predictability of PT is affected by different curve patterns.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Pelvic retroversion is one of the compensatory mechanisms to maintain upright position and is also tied to health-related quality of life in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). However, measurement of spino-pelvic parameters including PT may not be accurate because of difficulty in visualizing femoral heads on lateral radiographs in some patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, 101 female AIS patients were recruited. The subjects were divided into 2 groups: thoracic scoliosis (TS) and lumbar scoliosis (LS) group. Long-cassette standing upright radiographs were obtained; PT and SFP angles were measured through digital analysis software (Surgimap Spine Software, New York, NY). The relations between PT and SFP angle were determined by the Pearson correlation coefficient (r). Linear regressions between PT and SFP angle were also performed.
RESULTS: The SFP angle was strongly correlated with PT in both groups, and PT could be estimated by the formulas: PT=74.052-0.991×SFP angle in the TS group and PT=65.345-0.881×SFP angle in the LS group. In the TS group, the SFP angle correlated with PT strongly with a Pearson coefficient of 0.65. Whereas in the LS group, the coefficient was weaker than that in the TS group (0.48 vs. 0.65); however, it still showed that PT was significantly associated with SFP.
CONCLUSIONS: Given the high correlation between PT and SFP angle, the SFP angle should be considered a reliable alternative option to PT, which has routinely excellent visibility in coronal films in AIS patients. The predictability was more accurate for AIS patients with thoracic curves than with lumbar curves."
24525916,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24525916/,"BACKGROUND: Clinical laboratories began offering whole-exome sequencing in 2011 at a cost between $4,500 and $9,000. Reported detection rates for deleterious mutations range from 25 to 50%. Based on the experience of our clinical genetics service, actual success rates may be lower than estimated rates. We report results from our own experience along with a survey of clinical geneticists to ascertain (i) current success rates for causal gene detection in a clinical setting; (ii) if there are insurance authorization issues; and (iii) if turnaround times quoted by the clinical laboratories are accurate; we also gauge provider opinions toward clinical whole-exome sequencing.
METHODS: We reviewed our results and the results of a survey that was electronically distributed to 47 clinical genetics centers.
RESULTS: A total of 35 exome reports were available. If all positive results are collated, we observe a success rate of 22.8%. One result incorrectly identified a known benign variant as pathogenic. Some insurers covered all testing, whereas others denied any insurance coverage. Only three (23.1%) of our reports were available within the laboratory's quoted turnaround times. More than 50% of clinicians queried in our survey had not ordered whole-exome sequencing at the current time, many stating concerns regarding interpretation, insurance coverage, and cost.
CONCLUSION: Clinical whole-exome sequencing has proven diagnostic utility; however, currently many clinicians have concerns regarding interpretation of results, insurance coverage, and cost."
24526098,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24526098/,"BACKGROUND: Urolithiasis is a common condition in pediatric populations in Turkey. The role of oxidative stress in renal stone formation in pediatric patients has not been reported to date. The aim of this study was to assess oxidative stress in childhood urolithiasis.
METHODS: Seventy-four children diagnosed with urolithiasis and 72 healthy control subjects were enrolled in the study. Kidney stone formers were evaluated by analysis of metabolic conditions related to urolithiasis, such as hypercalciuria, hyperoxaluria, hypocitraturia and hyperuricosuria. Urine total antioxidant status (TAS), and total oxidant status (TOS) were measured, and oxidative stress index (OSI) was calculated as an indicator of the degree of oxidative stress.
RESULTS: Among the stone formers, metabolic analyses revealed that 30 % had hypercalciuria, 45 % had hypocitraturia, 6 % had hyperoxaluria and 40 % had hyperuricosuria. Elevated levels of the renal tubular damage marker urinary N-acetyl- beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) was elevated in 25 % of the patient group, but microalbuminuria was not detected. Total oxidant status and total antioxidant status were significantly higher in stone formers than in the controls (p = 0.023 and 0.004, respectively). In addition, urinary NAG was significantly correlated with TOS (r = 0.427, p = 0.019).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study show that oxidative stress may play an important role in the pathogenesis of pediatric stone formers."

STUDY DESIGN: Rates of colposcopy referral were compared between two cohorts, each comprising all Pap samples with a diagnosis of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) tested for HR-HPV in our laboratory during a 12-month period. Cohorts I and II included Pap samples tested with HC2 (n = 1,856) and APTIMA (n = 1,651), respectively. The rates of quantity not sufficient (QNS) results were determined for all Pap samples during the same time periods.
RESULTS: The proportion of HR-HPV-positive Pap samples with an ASCUS diagnosis was significantly lower with APTIMA (42%) than with HC2 (53%; p < 0.0001). APTIMA also resulted in a significantly lower QNS rate among all Pap samples (0.42 vs. 4.3% with HC2; p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: The change in HR-HPV detection methodology from HC2 to APTIMA has led to a 21% reduction in colposcopy referrals and a 90% decrease in QNS rates at our institution. The new methodology has resulted in more cost-effective patient care and fewer insufficient samples requiring repeat HR-HPV testing."
24526247,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24526247/,"PURPOSE: TREATMENT of patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP) aims to reduce disability, improve functional capacity, and participation. Time contingent prescription of analgesics is a treatment modality in CLBP. The impact of analgesics on functional capacity is unknown. Aim of the study was to explore the effect of analgesics on functioning measured by functional capacity evaluation, and self-reported disability in patients with CLBP.
METHODS: Explorative Randomized Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial was performed in an outpatient pain rehabilitation setting on patients waiting for rehabilitation. Included patients had low back pain lasting >3 months, visual analogue scale worst pain ≥4.0 cm, and age >18 years. Outcome measures before (T0) and after treatment (T1): functional capacity, pain intensity, Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire. T1: global perceived pain relief. Patient characteristics and psychological questionnaires were assessed. Fifty patients were included in this study and were randomly assigned to 2 weeks treatment or placebo.
TREATMENT: acetaminophen/tramadol 325 mg/37.5 mg per capsule. Dose: maximum acetaminophen 1,950 mg and tramadol 225 mg per day; treatment and placebo titrated identically. Compliance and side-effects were monitored. TREATMENT effects between groups over time were compared.
RESULTS: One patient (treatment group) was lost to follow-up. Forty-nine patients remained in the study. TREATMENT effects in primary outcomes did not differ significantly between groups. A subgroup of 10 (42%) patients (treatment group) reported global pain relief (responders) who reduced self-reported disability (p < 0.05). Responders had significantly lower catastrophizing scores.
CONCLUSION: Overall treatment effects were small and non-significant. A subgroup, however, reported improved functioning as a result of treatment. Responders had lower catastrophizing scores."
24526273,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24526273/,"BACKGROUND: To test the velocimetric pattern of the ovarian artery as a routine ovarian reserve test.
METHODS: We enrolled 317 consecutive patients from January 2011 to June 2012. At the second day of the menstrual cycle, a transvaginal ultrasound was performed to evaluate the antral follicle count and ovarian volume, and Doppler of both ovarian arteries was also performed. Controlled ovarian stimulation was performed and the patients were divided in two groups according to the result of the intrauterine insemination: group A (nonpregnant women) and group B (pregnant women).
RESULTS: Ovarian velocimetric pattern was similar between the two groups. Follicle stimulating hormone value had a significant correlation with the ultrasound markers; however, the multiple regression linear analysis showed that the only independent variables were the antral follicle count (t = -2.74, p = 0.008) and the systolic/diastolic ratio (t = 3.95, p = 0.0005). The best parameters in predicting the pregnancy were the mean ovarian volume, total and partial antral follicle count between 7 and 10 mm, and the mean resistance index (area under the curve: 0.744, 0.671, 0.667, 0.573, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: The Doppler study of the ovarian arteries did not add significant information about the ovarian reserve status. Only the mean resistance index had a significant diagnostic accuracy, but its specificity (53%) is too low to consider it a screening test."
24526499,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24526499/,"BACKGROUND: With the recent, widespread availability of endoscopic hemoclips, it has become common clinical practice to apply hemoclips to some non-bleeding polypectomy sites ""prophylactically"" to prevent delayed post-polypectomy bleeding (PPB). Few published data support this practice, however.
AIM: The aim of this study was to compare rates of delayed PPB in matched patients who had polypectomies performed with and without the prophylactic placement of hemoclips.
METHODS: We reviewed medical records of patients who had elective colonoscopy at our VA Medical Center between July 2008 and December 2009. We identified patients who had hemoclips applied prophylactically (cases) and compared their rate of delayed PPB within 30 days to that of patients who had polypectomy without hemoclipping (controls). Controls were matched 1:1 to cases based on age and on factors known to contribute to the risk of PPB including polyp size, morphology, technique of polyp removal, number of polyps removed, and use of anticoagulants.
RESULTS: We identified 184 patients (cases) who underwent prophylactic hemoclipping and 184 well-matched controls. An average of 3.8 polyps per patient were removed in the case group compared to 3.3 polyps per patient in controls (p = 0.6). Delayed PPB occurred in three patients in the prophylactic hemoclip group and in one patient in the control group (1.6 vs. 0.5 %, p = 0.62).
CONCLUSIONS: We found no significant difference in the rate of delayed PPB between patients who had prophylactic hemoclipping of polypectomy sites and a well-matched control group of patients who had polypectomy without prophylactic hemoclipping. These data call into question the expensive practice of prophylactic hemoclipping."
24526561,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24526561/,"BACKGROUND: Anaemia is present in 12-30% of patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Many studies have shown that admission anaemia is an independent predictor of in-hospital or short-term mortality in patients with ACS. However, there is limited data on the long-term prognostic importance of anaemia in this group of patients.
AIM: To establish the relation between haemoglobin concentration on admission and six-year all-cause mortality in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated invasively.
METHODS: We retrospectively studied 551 patients with the diagnosis of STEMI referred to the catheterisation laboratory of our hospital and treated with successful primary percutaneous coronary intervention. Patients were divided into two groups according to admission haemoglobin concentration (< 13 g/dL in males and < 12 g/dL in females).
RESULTS: A total of 551 patients with STEMI (164 female, 30%) were included in the analysis, mean age was 63 ± 12 years. Anaemia on admission was present in 11% (n = 61) of the patients. Of the entire cohort, renal failure was present in 25% (n = 138), and diabetes in 16% (n = 88). Admission haemoglobin concentration was significantly associated with age (r = -0.2663, p < 0.05), blood pressure (systolic blood pressure [SBP]: r = 0.1940, diastolic blood pressure [DBP]: r = 0.2023, p < 0.05), glucose concentration (r = -0.1218, p < 0.05), white blood cells count (r = 0.1230, p < 0.05), cholesterol concentration (r = 0.1253,p < 0.05), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; r = 0.1819, p < 0.05), Killip-Kimball class (r = -0.1387, p < 0.05) and TIMI risk score for STEMI (r = -0.2647, p < 0.05). During follow-up, 27% (n = 130) of the patients died. The mortality rate was significantly higher in the patients with admission anaemia (47% vs. 24%, p = 0.0002). The patients with anaemia were older (p = 0.0007), had lower blood pressure (SBP: p = 0.007; DBP: p = 0.01), higher heart rate (p = 0.03), higher glycaemia concentration (p = 0.003), higher C-reactive protein concentration (p = 0.0007) and lower white blood cells count (p = 0.03). Patients with anaemia had more frequently renal failure (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m²) (p = 0.02) and a significantly higher TIMI risk score for STEMI (p = 0.01). In multivariate analysis, all-cause mortality was associated with: anaemia on admission (OR = 2.29; 95% CI 1.20-4.36; p = 0.011), low ejection fraction (OR = 2.97; 95% CI 1.78-4.96; p < 0.001) and age (OR = 1.65 [per 10 years]; 95% CI 1.34-2.03; p < 0.001). Anaemia on admission remained an independent predictor of six-year mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Admission anaemia significantly influences all-cause mortality in patients with STEMI treated invasively ina six-year follow-up and may be used for risk stratification in this population."
24527872,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24527872/,"BACKGROUND: Smoking has been associated with improved outcome in thrombolysed patients with myocardial infarction and higher recanalization rates in stroke patients treated with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). We hypothesized a positive association between smoking and favourable outcome in stroke patients treated with tPA and no such association in acute stroke patients not treated with tPA, suggesting a beneficial effect of smoking on thrombolysis with tPA.
METHODS: Stroke patients treated with tPA and stroke patients not treated with tPA, but presenting within 6 h after stroke onset, were included in two separate groups. Three groups were defined according to smoking habits: current smoking, previous smoking and no smoking. Functional outcome by modified Rankin Scale (mRS) was assessed after 1 week or at discharge, if discharged earlier. Favourable outcome was defined as mRS 0 or 1.
RESULTS: A total of 399 patients were treated with tPA (94 current smokers, 148 previous smokers and 157 non-smokers), whereas 424 patients were not treated with tPA (90 current smokers, 164 previous smokers and 170 non-smokers). Current smoking was independently associated with favourable outcome in patients treated with tPA when adjusted for confounders (OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.09-3.95, P = 0.025). There was no such association in acute stroke patients not treated with tPA (OR 1.26, 95% CI 0.67-2.36, P = 0.472).
CONCLUSION: Our study showed an association between current smoking and favourable short-term outcome in stroke patients treated with tPA, but not in acute stroke patients not treated with tPA. This may indicate a more effective thrombolysis with tPA in smokers."
24528046,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24528046/,"BACKGROUND: To investigate the indications of loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) and its overtreatment rates for the see and treat and three step strategies in cases of atypical squamous cells of undetermined cytology (ASC-US) and low grade intraepithelial neoplasia (LGSIL) cytology.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed colposcopy directed biopsy (CDB) and LEEP results of 176 paients with ASC-US or LGSIL cytologies who underwent colposcopic examination.
RESULTS: Initial cytologies were ASCUS in 120 women and LGSIL in 56. According to the see and treat approach immediate LEEP was performed for38 women. Among the remaining 138 women, LEEP was performed for 32 whose CDB results revealed CIN2/3 lesions. In the see and treat group the recognition of CIN2/3 was found to be 39.4%. The overtreatment rate was 60% as compared to 25% in the three step group. In CDB group detection of CIN 2 or greater lesions increased with 3 or more biopsies.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with ASC-US/LGSIL cytologies CDB should be performed before LEEP to prevent overtreatment, with attention to all suspected areas and more than 2 biopsies taken."
24528557,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24528557/,"BACKGROUND: Migraine is a disorder of central information processing which is characterized by a reduced habituation of event-related potentials. There might be positive effects of aerobic exercise on brain function and pain. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of exercise on information processing and clinical course of migraine.
METHODS: 33 patients completed a ten-week aerobic exercise programme. To examine the influence of the treatment on information processing and attention, Trail Making Test (TMT) A and B, d2-Letter Cancellation Test (LCT) and recordings of the Contingent Negative Variation (CNV) were performed before and after the training.
RESULTS: Patients showed a significant reduction of the migraine attack frequency, the iCNV-amplitude and the processing time for TMT-A and TMT-B after treatment. Moreover, there was a significant increase of the habituation and positive changes in parameters of attention (d2-LCT) after the training.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that aerobic exercise programme influences central information processing and leads to clinical effects on the migraine symptomatology. The results can be interpreted in terms of an improvement of a dysfunctional information processing and a stimulus selection under aerobic exercise."
24528562,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24528562/,"PURPOSE: Novel gabapentin-lactam (GBP-L) has shown its potency in enhancing new bone formation (NBF) in vitro. The objective of the present preclinical trial was to investigate the in vivo performance of GBP-L.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bilateral sinus floor augmentations in 10 adult sheep were conducted. Bovine bone mineral (BBM) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) combined with novel GBP-L were placed into the test sinus of each sheep. The BBM and MSCs alone served as the control on the contralateral side. Simultaneously, 3 dental implants were inserted in each maxillary sinus. The animals were sacrificed after 8 and 16 weeks, and the amount of NBF was analyzed using histomorphometry. The osteogenic potency of the MSCs was demonstrated using the colony-forming unit and differentiation assay. Statistical evaluation was performed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test and 3-factorial nonparametric analysis of variance.
RESULTS: The histologic examination showed NBF in tight contact with the original bone in the control and test groups. The NBF was not significantly different between the test and control sites (P > .05). However, a highly significant difference in NBF between the apical and coronal sites in the specimens from the control and test groups was detected (P < .05). GBP-L did not alter the multipotency of the MSCs or impair NBF.
CONCLUSIONS: Bone formation is initiated from the residual alveolar crest and along the implant. The elected mode of GBP-L application did not induce faster NBF. Alternate forms of application (eg, slow release or systemic administration) might clarify the controversial in vitro findings."
24528973,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24528973/,"INTRODUCTION: Concerns exist about radiation exposure during medical imaging. Comprehensive computerised tomography (CT) dose standards exist for adults, but are incomplete for children. We investigated paediatric CT radiation doses at a NHS Trust in order to define the extent of the risk.
METHODS: CT dose indicators (CTDI) were recorded for all scans on paediatric patients from January - December 2011 and benchmarked against American College of Radiologists reference levels (75 mGy for adult head, 25 mGy for adult abdomen, and 20 mGy for paediatric (5-year-old) abdomen). Size-specific dose estimates (SSDE) were calculated based on effective patient diameter as recommended by the American Association of Physicists in Medicine. Student t-test was used to compare CTDI and SSDE values for each anatomical region.
RESULTS: Of 53,648 paediatric emergency presentations, CT was requested in 211 (0.39%). One hundred fifty-four patients underwent 169 scans, with the rest being cancelled for clinical improvement or senior overrule. Indication for CT was trauma in 130/154 (90%), of which 55% were after falls, 19% following road traffic collisions, 12% after sporting injury, and 12% after alleged assault. CTDI values were available for 96/169 (57%) scans, with the rest lacking sufficient data. There was no significant difference between CTDI and derived SSDE values. 3% of head scans exceeded the adult head reference level.
CONCLUSION: There is wide variation in radiation exposure during paediatric trauma CT, with some scans delivering doses in excess of recommended adult values. There is an urgent need to define standards for radiation dose in paediatric CT for all ages and anatomical regions."
24529028,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24529028/,"BACKGROUND: The past five years has seen considerable expansion of wind power generation in Ontario, Canada. Most recently worries about exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMF) from wind turbines, and associated electrical transmission, has been raised at public meetings and legal proceedings. These fears have not been based on any actual measurements of EMF exposure surrounding existing projects but appear to follow from worries from internet sources and misunderstanding of the science.
METHODS: The study was carried out at the Kingsbridge 1 Wind Farm located near Goderich, Ontario, Canada. Magnetic field measurements were collected in the proximity of 15 Vestas 1.8 MW wind turbines, two substations, various buried and overhead collector and transmission lines, and nearby homes. Data were collected during three operational scenarios to characterize potential EMF exposure: 'high wind' (generating power), 'low wind' (drawing power from the grid, but not generating power) and 'shut off' (neither drawing, nor generating power).
RESULTS: Background levels of EMF (0.2 to 0.3 mG) were established by measuring magnetic fields around the wind turbines under the 'shut off' scenario. Magnetic field levels detected at the base of the turbines under both the 'high wind' and 'low wind' conditions were low (mean = 0.9 mG; n = 11) and rapidly diminished with distance, becoming indistinguishable from background within 2 m of the base. Magnetic fields measured 1 m above buried collector lines were also within background (≤ 0.3 mG). Beneath overhead 27.5 kV and 500 kV transmission lines, magnetic field levels of up to 16.5 and 46 mG, respectively, were recorded. These levels also diminished rapidly with distance. None of these sources appeared to influence magnetic field levels at nearby homes located as close as just over 500 m from turbines, where measurements immediately outside of the homes were ≤ 0.4 mG.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that there is nothing unique to wind farms with respect to EMF exposure; in fact, magnetic field levels in the vicinity of wind turbines were lower than those produced by many common household electrical devices and were well below any existing regulatory guidelines with respect to human health."
24529081,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24529081/,"INTRODUCTION: Stereoscopic vision is a critical part of the human visual system, conveying more information than two-dimensional, monoscopic observation alone. This study aimed to quantify the contribution of stereoscopy in assessment of radiographic data, using widely available three-dimensional (3D)-capable display monitors by assessing whether stereoscopic viewing improved the characterisation of cerebral aneurysms.
METHODS: Nine radiology registrars were shown 40 different volume-rendered (VR) models of cerebral computed tomography angiograms (CTAs), each in both monoscopic and stereoscopic format and then asked to record aneurysm characteristics on short multiple-choice answer sheets. The monitor used was a current model commercially available 3D television. Responses were marked against a gold standard of assessments made by a consultant radiologist, using the original CT planar images on a diagnostic radiology computer workstation.
RESULTS: The participants' results were fairly homogenous, with most showing no difference in diagnosis using stereoscopic VR models. One participant performed better on the monoscopic VR models. On average, monoscopic VRs achieved a slightly better diagnosis by 2.0%.
CONCLUSIONS: Stereoscopy has a long history, but it has only recently become technically feasible for stored cross-sectional data to be adequately reformatted and displayed in this format. Scant literature exists to quantify the technology's possible contribution to medical imaging - this study attempts to build on this limited knowledge base and promote discussion within the field. Stereoscopic viewing of images should be further investigated and may well eventually find a permanent place in procedural and diagnostic medical imaging."
24529341,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24529341/,"BACKGROUND: We aim to determine if C-reactive protein (CRP), lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), and procalcitonin (PCT) in drain fluid can serve as screening tools for colorectal anastomotic leakage (CAL).
METHODS: Patients included in this multicenter prospective observational study underwent left hemicolectomy, sigmoid resection, high anterior resection, low anterior resection, or subtotal colectomy. During the first 5 postoperative days, CRP, LBP, and PCT were determined on drain fluid.
RESULTS: In total 243 patients were included, of whom 19 (8%) developed CAL. CRP levels were higher in patients with leakage on day 3 and day 5, levels of LBP were higher on days 2, 3, and 4, and PCT levels were higher on day 5. Multivariate analysis showed LBP to be significantly related to CAL. An increase in the average initial value at the first postoperative day with 1 standard deviation increased the risk of leakage by 1.6 times.
CONCLUSION: Increased concentrations of LBP in drain fluid are significantly associated to a higher chance of CAL and could contribute in a future prognostic model for CAL."
24529482,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24529482/,"BACKGROUND: To date, for esophageal cancer (EC), the optimal timing of surgical procedures after neoadjuvant chemoradiation (nCRT) is not well defined. Data in rectal cancer suggest that a prolonged interval between treatment and operation may improve tumoral pathologic response, R0 resection rate, and survival. The aims of this study were to evaluate whether delaying operation after nCRT in EC increases pathologic response and has an impact on oncologic outcome or postoperative course.
METHODS: A total of 257 consecutive EC patients (n=161 squamous cell carcinomas and n=96 adenocarcinomas) undergoing nCRT followed by operation between 1997 and 2011 were retrospectively analyzed by the use of prospectively collected data. The patients were divided into two groups according to the median delay between nCRT and operation (<7 weeks, n=122; ≥7 weeks, n=135). The impact of surgical delay on outcomes was studied through univariable and multivariable analyses.
RESULTS: The groups were comparable regarding patient and tumor characteristics (p≥0.074). The ypT0 and R0 resection rates were similar between the two groups, as were postoperative course, median survivals, and incidence and patterns of recurrence (p≥0.332). Multivariable analysis failed to identify any impact of the surgical delay on the endpoints. Subgroup analysis according to the histologic type found similar results.
CONCLUSIONS: After nCRT for EC, delaying operation does not affect the ypT0 rate, postoperative course, or oncologic outcome and cannot therefore be justified by these aims."
24529517,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24529517/,"PURPOSE: We focus on a little-researched issue-how human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemics and programs in key populations in metropolitan areas affect epidemics in other key populations. We consider (1) How are earlier epidemics among people who inject drugs (PWID) and men who have sex with men (MSM) related to later AIDS incidence and mortality among heterosexuals?; (2) Were prevention programs targeting PWID or MSM associated with lower AIDS incidence and mortality among heterosexuals?; and (3) Was the size of the potential bridge population of noninjecting drug users (NIDUs) in a metropolitan area associated with later AIDS incidence and mortality among heterosexuals?
METHODS: Using data for 96 large U.S. metropolitan areas, Poisson regression assessed associations of population prevalences of HIV-infected PWID and MSM (1992); NIDU population prevalence (1992-1994); drug use treatment coverage for PWID (1993); HIV counseling and testing coverage for MSM and for PWID (1992); and syringe exchange presence (2000) with CDC data on AIDS incidence and mortality among heterosexuals in 2006-2008, with appropriate socioeconomic controls.
RESULTS: Population density of HIV+ PWID and of NIDUs were positively related, and prevention programs for PWID negatively related to later AIDS incidence among heterosexuals and later mortality among heterosexuals living with AIDS. HIV+ MSM population density and prevention programs for MSM were not associated with these outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to reduce HIV transmission among PWID and NIDUs may reduce AIDS and AIDS-related mortality among heterosexuals. More research is needed at metropolitan area, network, and individual levels into HIV bridging across key populations and how interventions in one key population affect HIV epidemics in other key populations."
24529599,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24529599/,"BACKGROUND: Presence of aphasia or severe neurologic deficits is considered an indication for preprocedural intubation (PPI) for endovascular treatment (ET) in acute ischemic stroke patients. We determined the feasibility, technical success rates, and outcomes of ET without PPI in 2 groups of patients: those with aphasia and those with an admission NIHSS score of 20 or more.
METHODS: The rates of intraprocedural intubation (IPI), good functional outcome at discharge (modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2), mortality, and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) were compared between those who did or did not undergo PPI in the above-mentioned patient groups.
RESULTS: A total of 60 (50%) of 120 patients with aphasia underwent ET without PPI; 6 of 60 patients required IPI. The odds of any ICH (odds ratio [OR] 6.3) and in-hospital mortality (OR 9.3) were significantly higher in those undergoing PPI. In the second analysis, 36 (39%) of 93 patients with an NIHSS score of 20 or more underwent ET without PPI; 6 of 57 patients required IPI. The risk of any ICH (OR 7.6) and in-hospital mortality (OR 5.0) was higher among patients who underwent PPI. The rates of good outcome at discharge were significantly lower among patients with aphasia (OR .1, 95% confidence interval [CI] .04-.2) or those with an NIHSS score of 20 or more (OR .07, 95% CI .005-.9) with PPI compared with those without PPI.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the risk of IPI, patients with aphasia or an admission NIHSS score of 20 or more who underwent ET with PPI had lower rates of good outcomes and higher rates of ICH and death."
24529650,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24529650/,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether outcomes based on stopwatch time and power output (PO) over a 15m-overground wheelchair sprint test can be used to assess wheelchair-specific anaerobic work capacity, by studying their relationship with outcomes on a Wingate-based 30s-wheelchair ergometer sprint (WAnT).
METHODS: Able-bodied persons (N=19, 10 men, aged 18-26 y) performed a 15m overground sprint test in an instrumented wheelchair and a WAnT. 15m-outcomes were based on stopwatch time (time and mean velocity over 15m) and on PO (primary outcome: highest mean unilateral PO over successive 5s-intervals (P5-15m)). WAnT-outcomes were mean unilateral PO over 30s and the highest mean unilateral PO over successive 5s-intervals. Correlation coefficients (Pearson's r) and coefficients of determination (R(2)) were calculated between 15m-sprint outcomes and WAnT-outcomes.
RESULTS: Time over 15m (7.2s (± 1.0)) was weakly related to WAnT-outcomes (r=-0.61 and -0.60, R(2)=0.38 and 0.36, p<0.01), similar to mean velocity over 15m (2.1 m·s(-1) (± 0.3), R(2)=0.43 and 0.39, p<0.01). P5-15m (38.1W (± 14.0)) showed a moderate relationship to WAnT-outcomes (r=0.77 and 0.75, R(2)=0.59 and 0.56, p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: It seems that outcomes based on stopwatch time over a 15m-overground sprint cannot be used to assess wheelchair-specific anaerobic work capacity, in contrast to an outcome based on PO (P5-15m). The 15m-sprint with an instrumented wheel can be implemented in rehabilitation practice and research settings when WAnT equipment is not available, although care is needed when interpreting P5-15m as an outcome of anaerobic work capacity given that it seems more skill-dependent than the WAnT."
24529684,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24529684/,"OBJECTIVES: Both bone and brain are frequent sites of metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Conflicting data exist whether EGFR mutant (+) patients are more prone to develop brain metastases or have a better outcome with brain metastases compared to EGFR/KRAS wildtype (WT) or KRAS+ patients. For bone metastases this has not been studied.
METHODS: In this retrospective case-control study all EGFR+ (exons 19 and 21) patients diagnosed at two pathology departments were selected (2004/2008 to 2012). For every EGFR+ patient a consecutive KRAS+ and WT patient with metastatic NSCLC (mNSCLC) was identified. Patients with another malignancy within 2 years of mNSCLC diagnosis were excluded. Data regarding age, gender, performance score, histology, treatment, bone/brain metastases diagnosis, skeletal related events (SRE) and subsequent survival were collected.
RESULTS: 189 patients were included: 62 EGFR+, 65 KRAS+, 62 WT. 32%, 35% and 40%, respectively, had brain metastases (p=0.645). Mean time to brain metastases was 20.8 [± 12.0], 10.8 [± 9.8], 16.4 [± 10.2] months (EGFR+-KRAS+, p = 0.020, EGFR+-WT, p = 0.321). Median post brain metastases survival was 12.1 [5.0-19.1], 7.6 [1.2-14.0], 10.7 [1.5-19.8] months (p = 0.674). 60%, 52% and 50% had metastatic bone disease (p=0.528). Mean time to development of metastatic bone disease was 13.4 [± 10.6], 23.3 [± 19.4], 16.4 [± 9.6] months (p = 0.201). Median post metastatic bone disease survival was 15.0 [10.6-20.3], 9.0 [5.2-12.9], 3.2 [0.0-6.9] months (p = 0.010). Time to 1st SRE was not significantly different.
CONCLUSIONS: Incidence of brain and bone metastases was not different between EGFR+, KRAS+ and WT patients. Post brain metastases survival, time from mNSCLC diagnosis to metastatic bone disease and 1st SRE did not differ either. Post metastatic bone disease survival was significantly longer in EGFR+ patients. Although prevention of SRE's is important for all patients, the latter finding calls for a separate study for SRE preventing agents in EGFR+ patients."
24529742,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24529742/,"AIMS: The α/β ratio for prostate cancer is thought to be low and less than for the rectum, which is usually the dose-limiting organ. Hypofractionated radiotherapy should therefore improve the therapeutic ratio, increasing cure rates with less toxicity. A number of models for predicting biochemical relapse-free survival have been developed from large series of patients treated with conventional and moderately hypofractionated radiotherapy. The purpose of this study was to test these models when significant numbers of patients treated with profoundly hypofractionated radiotherapy were included.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review of the literature with regard to hypofractionated radiotherapy for prostate cancer was conducted, focussing on data recently presented on prostate stereotactic body radiotherapy. For the work described here, we have taken published biochemical control rates for a range of moderately and profoundly fractionated schedules and plotted these together with a range of radiobiological models, which are described.
RESULTS: The data reviewed show consistency between the various radiobiological model predictions and the currently observed data.
CONCLUSION: Current radiobiological models provide accurate predictions of biochemical relapse-free survival, even when profoundly hypofractionated patients are included in the analysis."

CONCLUSIONS: Variations in coronal stability were shown to have no influence on the short-term clinical results of navigated total knee replacement."
24529805,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24529805/,"BACKGROUND: Debate exists within the surgical education community about whether 5 years is sufficient time to train a general surgeon, whether graduating chief residents are confident in their skills, why residents choose to do fellowships, and the scope of general surgery practice today.
STUDY DESIGN: In May 2013, a 16-question online survey was sent to every general surgery program director in the United States for dissemination to each graduating chief resident (CR).
RESULTS: Of the 297 surveys returned, 76% of CRs trained at university programs, 81% trained at 5-year programs, and 28% were going directly into general surgery practice. The 77% of CRs who had done >950 cases were significantly more comfortable than those who had done less (p < 0.0001). Only a few CRs were uncomfortable performing a laparoscopic colectomy (7%) or a colonoscopy (6%), and 80% were comfortable being on call at a Level I trauma center. Compared with other procedures, CRs were most uncomfortable with open common bile duct explorations (27%), pancreaticoduodenectomies (38%), hepatic lobectomies (48%), and esophagectomies (60%) (p < 0.00001). Of those going into fellowships, 67% said they truly had an interest in that specialty and only 7% said it was because they were not confident in their surgical skills.
CONCLUSIONS: Current graduates of general surgery residencies appear to be confident in their skills, including care of the trauma patient. Fellowships are being chosen primarily because of an interest in the subspecialty. General surgery residency no longer provides adequate training in esophageal or hepatopancreatobiliary surgery."
24529812,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24529812/,"BACKGROUND: The Affordable Care Act provides health care coverage to an increasing segment of the population at Medicaid reimbursement rates. Health care systems currently offset lower Medicaid reimbursement through higher payers. The ability to ""cost shift"" will be diminished as the Medicaid population increases.
STUDY DESIGN: A financial cost and revenue analysis of outpatient laparoscopic cholecystectomy at our institution was performed. Cost was defined as actual expense to the health care institution. Fixed and variable costs were identified to calculate a break-even point. Time spent from check in to dismissal was based on historic averages. When actual costs could not be pinpointed, estimates from industry experts were used. Reimbursement included surgeon and anesthesia professional fees and facility fees.
RESULTS: A total of 501 laparoscopic cholecystectomies were performed at the main operating room facility in 2012. Annual fixed costs were $252,637. Variable costs were $1,860/case. Personnel and single-use equipment made the largest contribution to variable costs. Reimbursement for professional and facility fees totaled $2,444/case. The break-even point occurred at 454 cases. Based on historic volume, the break-even point for the calendar year would occur on November 27.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis demonstrates that laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be performed with a positive margin at Medicaid reimbursement rates with sufficient volume. The minimal margin, however, could substantially limit the ability of lower-volume hospitals to provide these services and negatively impact access to care in this patient population."
24530105,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24530105/,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: Effectiveness of a resuscitation strategy may vary across communities. We hypothesize that a strategy that prioritizes initial emergency medical services (EMS) rhythm analysis (analyze early) will be associated with survival advantage among EMS systems with lower baseline (pretrial) ventricular fibrillation survival, whereas a strategy that prioritizes initial EMS cardiopulmonary resuscitation (analyze late) will be associated with survival advantage among systems with higher ventricular fibrillation baseline survival.
METHODS: We conducted a secondary, post hoc study of a randomized trial of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Subjects were stratified according to randomization status (analyze early versus analyze late) and EMS agency baseline ventricular fibrillation survival. We used a mixed-effects model to determine whether the association between favorable functional survival to hospital discharge and trial intervention (analyze late versus analyze early) differed according to EMS agency baseline ventricular fibrillation survival (<20% or >20%).
RESULTS: Characteristics were similar among patients randomized to analyze early (n=4,964) versus analyze late (n=4,426). For EMS agencies with baseline ventricular fibrillation survival less than 20%, analyze late compared with analyze early was associated with a lower likelihood of favorable functional survival (3.8% versus 5.5%; odds ratio [OR]=0.67 [95% CI 0.50, 0.90]). Conversely, among agencies with a ventricular fibrillation survival greater than 20%, analyze late compared with analyze early was associated with higher likelihood of favorable functional survival (7.5% versus 6.1%; OR=1.22 [95% CI 0.98, 1.52]). In the multivariable-adjusted model, for every 10% increase in baseline ventricular fibrillation survival, analyze late versus analyze early was associated with a 34% increase in odds of favorable functional survival (OR=1.34 [95% CI 1.07 to 1.66]).
CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that system-level characteristics may influence resuscitation outcomes."

STUDY DESIGN: Eighteen 12-14 week-old Swiss albino type female mice were randomly divided into three groups, each consisting of six mice: Group A: control group; Group B: mice exposed to cigarette smoke; Group C: mice exposed to cigarette smoke together with vitamin E. Groups B and C were exposed to cigarette smoke for 10 weeks. After 10 weeks, tubal excision was performed in all animals. Histopathologic examination of excised tubal tissue was conducted under light microscopy.
RESULTS: The number of cilia was significantly lower in Group B. Although not statistically significant, the median number of cilia in Group C was measured to be higher than in Group B but lower than in Group A.
CONCLUSION: Based on the results, it can be concluded that smoking decreases tubal cilia numbers. Supplementation by vitamin E may treat or at least help to slow down the decrease in number of cilia caused by smoking; therefore it could be used therapeutically in the treatment of smoking-related tubal damage."
24530404,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24530404/,"BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination is recommended in early adolescence. While limited data suggest that patients frequently delay initiation of the three-dose series, age-based variability in initiation of HPV vaccination and its clinical relevance are not well described. Thus, this study aims to characterize HPV vaccination delay among adolescent and young adult females.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study examined age at HPV vaccination initiation and missed opportunities for receipt of the first vaccine dose (HPV1) among 11-26 year-old females (n=22,900) receiving care at 16 urban academically-affiliated ambulatory care clinics between 2007 and 2011. Predictors of timely vaccination and post-licensure trends in age at HPV1 receipt were assessed using multivariable logistic regression and a generalized linear mixed model, respectively. Chlamydia trachomatis and Papanicolaou screening before HPV vaccination initiation, as markers of prior sexual experience and associated morbidity, were examined in a subcohort of subjects (n=15,049).
RESULTS: The proportion of 11-12 year-olds who initiated HPV vaccination increased over time (44.4% [2007] vs. 74.5% [2011], p<0.01). Initiation rates also improved among 13-26 year-olds. Thus, the mean age at HPV1 receipt remained unchanged between 2007 and 2011 (16.0 ± 2.7 vs. 15.9 ± 4.0 years, p=0.45). Spanish language was a positive predictor (AOR 1.62, 95% CI 1.05-2.48) of HPV vaccination initiation among 11-12 year-olds in 2011. The majority (70.8-76.4%) of unvaccinated subjects experienced missed vaccination opportunities. Of the subcohort, 36.9% underwent Chlamydia screening before HPV1 receipt (19.1% with ≥ 1 positive result). Of those with prior Papanicolaou screening (16.6%), 32.1% had ≥ 1 abnormal result.
CONCLUSIONS: These low-income, minority females frequently delayed initiation of HPV vaccination. Many had evidence of prior sexual experience and associated morbidity, placing them at risk of HPV-related complications. Promoting timely HPV vaccination and reducing missed vaccination opportunities are crucial."

We evaluate the outcomes of radiosurgery in a cohort of cerebellar AVMs and assess the effect of infratentorial location by comparing them to a matched cohort of supratentorial AVMs.
METHODS: From a prospective AVM radiosurgery database of 1400 patients, we identified 60 cerebellar AVM patients with at least 2 years of radiologic follow-up or obliteration. The median volume and prescription dose were 2.3 mL and 22 Gy, respectively. The median radiologic follow-up was 39 months. The cerebellar AVM patients were matched (3:1) to a cohort of supratentorial, lobar AVM patients based on AVM size and patient age. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with obliteration and favorable outcome.
RESULTS: Cerebellar and supratentorial AVMs were similar in baseline characteristics except for an increased incidence of ruptured lesions in the cerebellar AVM cohort (P < .001). Obliteration was achieved in 72% of cerebellar AVMs. Younger age (P = .019), no preradiosurgery embolization (P < .001), and decreased volume (P = .034) were independent predictors of obliteration. The annual risk of postradiosurgery hemorrhage in cerebellar AVMs was 1.3%. The rates of symptomatic and permanent radiation-induced changes were 7% and 3%, respectively. Compared with the matched supratentorial AVM cohort, there was no difference in the rates of obliteration, postradiosurgery hemorrhage, or symptomatic radiation-induced changes.
CONCLUSIONS: Radiosurgery is an effective treatment modality for cerebellar AVMs with relatively limited adverse events. Infratentorial location did not affect radiosurgery outcomes."
24530470,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24530470/,"OBJECTIVE: to evaluate changes in the biochemical profile of children treated or being treated for moderate or severe stunting in a nutrition recovery and education center.
METHODS: this was a retrospective longitudinal study of 263 children treated at this center between August of 2008 to August of 2011, aged 1 to 6 years, diagnosed with moderate (z-score of height-for-age [HAZ] < -2) or severe stunting (HAZ < -3). Data were collected on socioeconomic conditions, dietary habits, and biochemical changes, as well as height according to age.
RESULTS: the nutritional intervention showed an increase in HAZ of children with moderate (0.51 ± 0.4, p = 0.001) and severe (0.91 ± 0.7, p = 0.001) stunting during the monitoring. Increased levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) (initial: 71.7 ng/dL; final: 90.4 ng/dL; p = 0.01) were also observed, as well as a reduction in triglycerides (TG) in both severely (initial: 91.8mg/dL; final: 79.1mg/dL; p = 0.01) and in moderately malnourished children (initial: 109.2mg/dL; final 88.7mg/dL; p = 0.01), and a significant increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol HDL-C only in the third year of intervention (initial: 31.4mg/dL; final: 42.2mg/dL). The values of total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels remained high throughout the treatment (initial: 165.1mg/dL; final: 163.5mg/dL and initial: 109.0mg/dL; final: 107.3mg/dL, respectively).
CONCLUSION: the nutritional treatment for children with short stature was effective in reducing stunting and improving TG and HDL-C after three years of intervention. However, the levels of LDL-C and TC remained high even in treated children. It is therefore speculated that these changes may result from metabolic programming due to malnutrition."
24530723,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24530723/,"BACKGROUND: The objective of this exploratory study was to determine the rate of the complications of early surgery for symptomatic carotid stenosis, in 2 centers of Western France.
METHODS: Between January 2011 and January 2013, we prospectively enrolled all the patients admitted for transient ischemic accident (TIA) or minor stroke (Rankin ≤ 3) associated with an ipsilateral carotid stenosis >50% (North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial) and operated before the 14th day following the neurologic event at the University hospitals of Angers and Tours. The demographic data (gender, age, and medical history) and the characteristics of the procedures were recorded. The rates of stroke, TIA, and postoperative deaths defined the cumulative morbidity and mortality rate (CMMR) of the study.
RESULTS: Ninety-one patients were included in the study. They presented 27 TIAs and 64 strokes. The average elapsed time between the neurologic event and surgery was 9.8 days. During this time, 10 patients, that is, 11% of the operated cohort, presented a new ischemic neurologic event while waiting for surgery. Surgical operations consisted of 56 eversions (61.5%), 32 endarterectomies with patch (35.1%), 2 bypasses, and 1 direct closure. The CMMR reached 3.3%. Two patients presented with a stroke and 1 patient died of a cardiologic cause during the postoperative period.
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the interest of an early surgery for symptomatic carotid stenoses with a Rankin score of ≤3. The risk of recurrence of a cerebral ischemic accident during the preoperative period remains high."
24531389,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24531389/,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to compare the infection risk when internal fixation plates either overlap or did not overlap previous external fixator pin sites in patients with bicondylar tibial plateau fractures and pilon fractures treated with a 2-staged protocol of acute spanning external fixation and later definitive internal fixation.
DESIGN: Retrospective comparison study.
SETTING: Two level I trauma centers.
PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: A total of 85 OTA 41C bicondylar tibial plateau fractures and 97 OTA 43C pilon fractures treated between 2005 and 2010. Radiographs were evaluated to determine the positions of definitive plates in relation to external fixator pin sites and patients were grouped into an ""overlapping"" group and a ""nonoverlapping"" group.
INTERVENTION: Fifty patients had overlapping pin sites and 132 did not.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Presence of a deep wound infection.
RESULTS: Overall, 25 patients developed a deep wound infection. Of the 50 patients in the ""overlapping"" group, 12 (24%) developed a deep infection compared with 13 (10%) of the 132 patients in the ""nonoverlapping"" group (P = 0.033).
CONCLUSIONS: Placement of definitive plate fixation overlapping previous external fixator pin sites significantly increases the risk of deep infection in the 2-staged treatment of bicondylar tibial plateau and pilon fractures. Surgeons must make a conscious effort to place external fixator pins outside of future definitive fixation sites to reduce the overall incidence of deep wound infections. Additionally, consideration must be given to the relative benefit of a spanning external fixator in light of the potential for infection associated with their use.

24532048,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24532048/,"BACKGROUND: Major left thoracic (LT) curve is an atypical type in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) and showed independent clinical characteristics and natural history compared to major right thoracic (RT) curve. However, it's unclear whether the convexity of major thoracic curve would affect the surgical outcomes and risk of complications. A retrospective follow-up study was conducted to investigate whether the convexity of major thoracic curve would affect the surgical outcomes of patients with main thoracic AIS.
METHODS: Twelve LT-AIS patients underwent corrective spinal instrumentation and fusion were retrieved, and twelve patients with main RT-AIS matched for gender, chronological age, curve type, magnitude and surgical strategy were selected as control. All patients underwent at least 2-year follow-up. The pre- and post-operative radiographic parameters, intraoperative data and functional outcome assessed by Scoliosis Research Society questionnaire 22 (SRS-22) were analyzed and compared between two groups.
RESULTS: Patients with LT- and RT-AIS presented with similar magnitudes of thoracic curves, flexibility, fusion level and correction rate. Compared with RT-AIS, patients with LT-AIS showed longer operation time (average, 364 vs. 348 min) and larger amount intraoperative estimated blood loss (2,060 vs. 1,720 ml) although the differences were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). With at least 2-year follow-up, patients in two groups showed comparable loss of correction, coronal and sagittal balance, and the sagittal profiles. With regard to functional outcome, the scores of five categories of SRS-22 questionnaire were similar between two groups. No neurological or vascular complication was observed in these patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The radiographic and functional outcomes of LT-AIS patients underwent operation were comparable to those with RT-AIS. Longer operation time and more intraoperative blood loss may be expected in instrumentation and fusion for patients with LT-AIS, which might be because of the inconvenience on the surgical procedure."
24532435,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24532435/,"BACKGROUND: Primary aneurysmal bone cysts (ABCs) are benign, expansile bone lesions commonly treated with aggressive curettage with or without adjuvants such as cryotherapy, methacrylate cement, or phenol. It has been reported that occasionally these lesions heal spontaneously or after a pathologic fracture, and we observed that some ABCs treated at our center healed after biopsy alone. Because of this, we introduced a novel biopsy technique we call ""curopsy,"" which is a percutaneous limited curettage at the time of biopsy, obtaining the lining membrane from various quadrants of the cyst leading to consolidation (curopsy = biopsy with intention to cure).
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked whether (1) a curopsy results in comparable likelihood of healing of the ABC compared with more aggressive approaches involving curettage, (2) the two approaches differ in terms of the likelihood of recurrence after treatment, and (3) the two approaches differ in terms of complications after surgery.
METHODS: Between January 1, 1999 and June 30, 2012, 221 patients with a diagnosis of primary ABC were registered in our oncology database. Patients presenting with a pathologic fracture and those seeking a second opinion were excluded. One hundred ninety patients were included in the study. One hundred two (54%) were treated with curopsy and 88 (46%) were treated with curettage after a core needle biopsy. Complete followups were available for 88% (90 of 102) and 93% (80 of 88) of patients in those groups, respectively. During that period, a curopsy was performed for all patients with benign bone lesions with imaging suggestive of classic primary ABCs and for whom the core needle biopsy simply showed blood with no solid component. Curettage after a core needle biopsy was reserved for histologically confirmed primary ABCs, lesions with impending fractures, large lesions, if the ABC was thought to be a secondary disorder, and patients for whom the curopsy failed. All patients were followed up until consolidation of the lesion (mean, 9.6 weeks, range, 3-25 weeks, 95% CI, 8.32-10.9 for curopsy; mean, 11.4 weeks, range, 8-32 weeks, 95% CI, 10.6-12.3 for curettage). The median followup for all patients was 14 months (range, 6-36 months).
RESULTS: Of the 102 patients who had curopsy and observation, 83 (81%) required no additional treatment and the lesion resolved. Of the 88 patients who underwent curettage (with or without adjuvant therapy) after core needle biopsy, the success rate was 90% (79 of 88). Local recurrences in both groups (curopsy or curettage) were treated successfully with additional curettage in all but one case. Curopsy in comparison to curettage provided a mean shorter healing time (9.6 versus 11.4, p = 0.01) but there was a higher local recurrence and need for additional intervention rate (18.6% versus 10.2%, p = 0.04). There were no differences in the complications between the treatment groups.
CONCLUSIONS: A curopsy is a novel biopsy technique that was successful in resolving ABCs in 81% of the patients in our study. Curopsy, as a biopsy technique, for ABCs needs consideration as it potentially minimizes the number of patients needing a second procedure (a core needle biopsy being the first) as is the current practice. Furthermore, it does not disadvantage the patient or surgeon should additional intervention be needed in the form of curettage with or without adjuvants.

24532497,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24532497/,"PURPOSE: Leuprorelin is a well known luteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonist. However, there are insufficient data on the efficacy and safety of high dose leuprorelin acetate, especially in Asian patients with prostate cancer. We aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of leuprorelin acetate 22.5 mg administered at three-month intervals in patients with prostate cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In an open, prospective clinical trial enrolling 47 patients, we aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of leuprorelin acetate 22.5 mg in treating patients with histologically confirmed prostate cancer. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the leuprorelin acetate 22.5 mg in producing and maintaining castration levels of testosterone over a 6-month follow-up period and to determine its safety profile.
RESULTS: All 42 patients achieved serum testosterone levels within the castration range by 4 weeks. A breakthrough response was observed in one of 36 patients by 8 weeks. However, this patient was medically castrated by 12 weeks. There were no significant prostate-specific antigen (PSA) or testosterone changes according to clinical stage or body mass index. Twenty adverse events (AEs) in 15 of 42 patients (35.7%) were observed during this study. The most common AEs were hot flushes (n=4, 20.0%) with mild intensity, pain (n=2, 10.0%), and infection (n=2, 10.0%). No patient withdrew from the study due to AEs.
CONCLUSION: Leuprorelin acetate 22.5 mg was shown to be effective and safe in Asian patients with prostate cancer, even though sexual function decreased."
24532833,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24532833/,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of patient-reported outcomes (PRO) as primary indices for identification and prediction of a 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28)>3.2 among patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
METHODS: Patients with RA completed monthly online PRO [Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), Rheumatoid Arthritis Disease Activity Index (RADAI), visual analog scale (VAS) fatigue] and were clinically assessed every 3 months using the DAS28. Simple descriptive statistics, logistic regression, and the Bayesian joint modeling approach were used to analyze the data. The Bayesian joint model combines the scores and changes in the scores of 3 PRO to predict a DAS28>3.2 at the subsequent timepoint.
RESULTS: A group of 159 patients with RA participated. Stratified summaries of the PRO by DAS28 categories at baseline provided incremental values of the PRO for more active disease. However, on an individual level, the DAS28 and the PRO fluctuated over time. The prediction of subsequent DAS score by a single instrument at single timepoints resulted in moderate sensitivity and specificity. Using the intercept and slope of the combined PRO of the first 3 measurements to predict the DAS28 state at 3 months resulted in a sensitivity of 0.81 and a specificity of 0.92. After 10-fold cross validation, the model had a sensitivity of 0.61 and specificity of 0.75 to identify patients with a DAS28>3.2.
CONCLUSION: PRO showed fluctuating levels of disease activity over time, while on a group level disease activity stayed the same. Using the changes in RADAI, HAQ, and VAS fatigue over time to predict future DAS28>3.2 resulted in moderate performance after the internal cross-validation of the model (sensitivity 0.61, specificity 0.75)."
24533560,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24533560/,"BACKGROUND: Mycosis fungoides (MF) is the most common and one of the least aggressive forms of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Several studies have demonstrated the influence of human leucocyte antigen (HLA) genes on the susceptibility of MF, highlighting the importance of certain alleles but, until today, no studies have evaluated the relationship between HLA alleles and the prognosis of patients with MF.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to evaluate the polymorphism of HLA class I and class II alleles in a group of 46 MF Caucasian patients, looking for their influence in susceptibility and prognosis of the disease.
METHODS: Study population included a case-cohort sample of 46 Caucasian patients with MF that, between 1993 and 1997, underwent HLA class I and II genomic typing. All patients were diagnosed and followed up from 1977 to 2012 (mean follow-up of 11 years) and they were divided into three groups according to the evolution of the disease.
RESULTS: Molecular typing at low-resolution level revealed that HLA-A*24, A*68, A*69, B*35 and DQB1*05:02 alleles were involved in susceptibility to MF. Correspondence analysis underlined that long-lasting remission was characterized by HLA-A*24 and HLA-A*25 alleles, frequent relapse by HLA-DRB1*01, DQA1*01:01, DQB1*05:01 alleles and death by HLA-A*68, HLA-B*08, HLA-B*35, HLA-C*03 alleles.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the prognosis of MF patients is not only correlated with clinical/pathological/serological/immunological variables but it also relies on specific HLA alleles."
24533606,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24533606/,"OBJECTIVE: The aims of the study were to (1) compare the cardiometabolic risk profile between insulin-resistant and non-insulin-resistant women within similar body mass indexes (BMIs) and waist circumference (WC) groupings and (2) test the hypothesis that measurements of BMI are not inferior to WC in identifying insulin resistance.
METHODS: The sample consisted of 899 women without known cardiovascular disease or diabetes. BMI was used to divide participants in normal (<25.0 kg/m(2)), overweight (≥25-29.9 kg/m(2)), and obese (≥30.0 kg/m(2)) subgroups, and waist circumference ≥88 cm was used to identify women with or without abdominal obesity. The 25% of the population with highest fasting insulin concentrations was classified as insulin resistant. BMI, WC, blood pressure, and fasting plasma glucose, insulin, triglyceride, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations were compared using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). The relationships between obesity and insulin resistance were analyzed using univariate, multivariate, and logistic regression.
RESULTS: Triglyceride and glucose concentrations were higher and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations lower in the insulin-resistant group in each BMI category, as was the case when comparing by abdominal obesity. In the univariate analysis, correlations between obesity and the individual cardiometabolic risk factor were significant but weak. In multivariate analysis including both indices, only body mass independently predicted insulin resistance.
CONCLUSION: Insulin-resistant women were at greater cardiometabolic risk, irrespective of adiposity category. Obesity contributed to a modest variability in insulin resistance, and abdominal obesity does not add to the ability of BMI to predict insulin resistance."
24533664,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24533664/,"AIMS: Little is known about the long-term effects of intensive multifactorial treatment early in the diabetes disease trajectory. In the absence of long-term data on hard outcomes, we described change in 10-year modelled cardiovascular risk in the 5 years following diagnosis, and quantified the impact of intensive treatment on 10-year modelled cardiovascular risk at 5 years.
METHODS: In a pragmatic, cluster-randomized, parallel-group trial in Denmark, the Netherlands and the UK, 3057 people with screen-detected Type 2 diabetes were randomized by general practice to receive (1) routine care of diabetes according to national guidelines (1379 patients) or (2) intensive multifactorial target-driven management (1678 patients). Ten-year modelled cardiovascular disease risk was calculated at baseline and 5 years using the UK Prospective Diabetes Study Risk Engine (version 3β).
RESULTS: Among 2101 individuals with complete data at follow up (73.4%), 10-year modelled cardiovascular disease risk was 27.3% (sd 13.9) at baseline and 21.3% (sd 13.8) at 5-year follow-up (intensive treatment group difference -6.9, sd 9.0; routine care group difference -5.0, sd 12.2). Modelled 10-year cardiovascular disease risk was lower in the intensive treatment group compared with the routine care group at 5 years, after adjustment for baseline cardiovascular disease risk and clustering (-2.0; 95% CI -3.1 to -0.9).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite increasing age and diabetes duration, there was a decline in modelled cardiovascular disease risk in the 5 years following diagnosis. Compared with routine care, 10-year modelled cardiovascular disease risk was lower in the intensive treatment group at 5 years. Our results suggest that patients benefit from intensive treatment early in the diabetes disease trajectory, where the rate of cardiovascular disease risk progression may be slowed."
24533786,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24533786/,"AIM: To determine if hospital admission rates for diabetes complications (acute complications, chronic complications, no complications and hypoglycaemia) were associated with primary care diabetes management.
METHODS: We performed an observational study in the population in England during the period 2004-2009 (54 741 278 people registered with 8140 general practices). We used multivariable negative binomial regression to model the associations between indirectly standardized hospital admission rates for complications and primary healthcare quality, supply and access indicators, diabetes prevalence and population factors.
RESULTS: In multivariate regression models, increasing deprivation (incidence rate ratio: 1.0154; P < 0.001, 95% CI 1.0141-1.0166) and diabetes prevalence (incidence rate ratio: 1.0956; P < 0.001, 95% CI 1.0677-1.1241) were risk factors for admission, while most healthcare covariates, i.e. a larger practice population (incidence rate ratio 0.9999, P = 0.013, 95% CI 0.9999-0.9999), better patient-perceived urgent and non-urgent access to primary care (incidence rate ratio: 0.9989, P = 0.023; 95% CI 0.9979-0.9998 and incidence rate ratio: 0.9988; P = 0.003, 95% CI 0.9980-0.9996, respectively) and better HbA1c target achievement (incidence rate ratio: 0.9971; P < 0.001, 95% CI 0.9958-0.9984), were protective. Diabetes admissions decreased significantly during the period 2004-2009.
CONCLUSIONS: After controlling for population factors, better scheduled primary care access and glycaemic control were associated with lower hospital admission rates across most complications. There is little rationale to restrict primary care-sensitive condition definitions to acute complications. They should be revised to improve the usefulness of hospital admission data as an outcome measure, and to facilitate international comparisons. The risk of emergency hospital admission should be monitored routinely."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: An IRB approved retrospective analysis of 285 consecutive patients that underwent CT-guided placement of fiducial seeds in the lung alone (N=63), with concomitant core biopsy (N=53) or only core biopsy (N=169) was performed. Variables compared included: patient demographics, lesion size, depth from pleura, needle size, number of passes through pleura, number and size of core biopsies, number of seeds placed and technical success rates. Statistical analysis was performed using univariate and multivariate pair-wise comparisons.
RESULTS: A pathologic diagnosis of malignancy was confirmed in all cases undergoing seed placement alone and seed placement with concurrent biopsy, and in 144 of the biopsy alone lesions. On univariate analysis, major complication rates were similar for all three groups as were lesion size, depth, number of pleural passes, and technical success. Pair-wise comparisons of the remaining variables demonstrated a significant younger age and smaller needle size in the biopsy only group, and less minor complications in the fiducial only group. Overall there were 80/285 (28.1%) minor and 29/285 (10.2%) major complications. All major complications leading to admission consisted of either pneumothorax or hemothorax, while minor complications included asymptomatic stable or resolving pneumothoraces, transient hemoptysis or small hemothoraces.
CONCLUSIONS: A combined procedure of percutaneous pulmonary core biopsy and stereotactic seed placement can be performed without additional risk of a major complication when compared to performing these separately."

STUDY DESIGN: We performed a secondary analysis of the Consortium on Safe Labor data. Patients with twin gestations in vertex-vertex presentation greater than 32 weeks' gestational age were grouped according to race. Demographic information and neonatal and maternal outcomes were analyzed according to planned mode of delivery: elective cesarean or trial of labor (with subsequent vaginal delivery, unplanned cesarean, or combined delivery). The primary outcome was unplanned cesarean. Secondary outcomes included maternal and neonatal outcomes.
RESULTS: One thousand nine vertex-vertex twin pregnancies were identified. There were no significant differences across ethnicities in the rate of unplanned cesarean delivery, which occurred in 233 of patients undergoing trial of labor (27%). Elective cesarean occurred in 151 patients (15%). African American women were less likely to have an elective cesarean compared with whites (odds ratio, 0.5; 95% confidence interval, 0.3-0.8), and Asian women were more likely to have an elective cesarean compared with whites (odds ratio, 2.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-3.4. Combined delivery occurred in 67 patients (8%) and did not differ among the groups. Subgroup analysis did not reveal any significant differences in neonatal outcomes.

METHODS: In an experimental video-vignettes study, the impact of oncologist communication on trust was tested. Background characteristics (socio-demographics, trait anxiety, health locus of control and attachment style), reported trust, and the impact of communication on trust were compared between the two groups.
RESULTS: Cancer patient organization members (n=196) were younger and higher educated than clinical patients (n=148). Members felt more personal control over their health (p<.01) but were also more anxious (p<.05). They reported lower trust in general health care (p<.05), in their own oncologist (p<.001) and in the oncologist in the videos (p<.05). The impact of oncologist communication on trust was similar for both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite considerable differences in trust levels, both groups appear equally affected by oncologist communication. Thus, although including cancer patient organization members may impact the generalizability of some findings, using these participants to investigate communication appears justified.
PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Cancer patient organization members may regard their oncologist more critically. Research including both members and patients recruited through hospital clinics could take group membership into account as a possible confounder. Nonetheless, communicating competence, honesty and caring may benefit the relation with these patients similarly as with other patients."

We hypothesized that many patients who meet the objective enrollment criteria for these trials (""high-risk"") have similar perioperative outcomes as ""normal-risk"" patients.
METHODS: We reviewed a prospective institutional database and classified patients undergoing resection for clinical stage I lung cancer as ""high-risk"" and ""normal-risk"" by ACOSOG major criteria.
RESULTS: From 2000 to 2010, 1,066 patients underwent resection for clinical stage I lung cancer. Of these, 194 (18%) met ACOSOG major criteria for risk (preoperative forced expiratory volume in 1 second or diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide≤50% predicted). ""High-risk"" patients were older (66.4 vs 64.6 years, p=0.02) but similar to controls in sex, prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease. ""High-risk"" patients were less likely than ""normal-risk"" patients to undergo a lobectomy (117 of 194 [60%] vs 665 of 872 [76%], p<0.001). ""High-risk"" and control patients experienced similar morbidity (any complication: 55 of 194 [28%] vs 230 of 872 [26%], p=0.59) and 30-day mortality (2 of 194 [1%] vs 14 of 872 [ 2%], p=0.75). A regression analysis showed age (hazard risk, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.06) and coronary artery disease (hazard risk, 1.58; 95% confidence interval, 1.05 to 2.40) were associated with an elevated risk of complications in those undergoing lobectomy, whereas female sex (hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% confidence interval, 0.44 to 0.91) was protective. ACOSOG ""high-risk"" status was not associated with perioperative morbidity.
CONCLUSIONS: There are no important differences in early postsurgical outcomes between lung cancer patients characterized as ""high-risk"" and ""normal-risk"" by ACOSOG trial enrollment criteria, despite a significant proportion of ""high-risk"" patients undergoing lobectomy."

OBJECTIVE: To examine how achieving Magnet status is related to subsequent inpatient costs and revenues controlling for other hospital characteristics.
DATA AND METHODS: Data from the American Hospital Association Annual Survey, Hospital Cost Reporting Information System reports collected by Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and Magnet status of hospitals from American Nurses Credentialing Center from 1998 to 2006 were combined and used for the analysis. Descriptive statistics, propensity score matching, fixed-effect, and instrumental variable methods were used to analyze the data.
RESULTS: Regression analyses revealed that MH status is positively and significantly associated with both inpatient costs and net inpatient revenues for both urban hospitals and all hospitals. MH status was associated with an increase of 2.46% in the inpatient costs and 3.89% in net inpatient revenue for all hospitals, and 2.1% and 3.2% for urban hospitals.
CONCLUSIONS: Although it is costly for hospitals to attain Magnet status, the cost of becoming a MH may be offset by higher net inpatient income. On average, MHs receive an adjusted net increase in inpatient income of $104.22-$127.05 per discharge after becoming a Magnet which translates to an additional $1,229,770-$1,263,926 in income per year."

METHODS: Secondary analysis of a cross-sectional, multi-centre and nationwide register (HOspice and Palliative Care Evaluation (HOPE)). Documented inpatients from hospices and palliative care units from 2006 to 2008 who completed the self-assessed MInimal DOcumentation System (MIDOS) were included. Professionals' assessment were based on the integrated symptom and problem checklist (symptom scores, 0-3). Cohen's kappa (κ) was used to estimate the 'level of agreement' (LoA).
RESULTS: Two thousand six hundred twenty-three patients (mean age, 66.9 (SD, 12.8); 54.4% female; median Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score, 3; 95.9% with malignant disease) were analysed. Prevalence of breathlessness was 53.4% (1,398 patients) by professionals' and 53.1% (1,410 patients) by self-assessment. Presence was correctly evaluated by professionals in 80.9% of cases (sensitivity, 81.8%; specificity, 79.8%). Severity of breathlessness was correctly estimated in 65.7% of cases. LoA was good (κ=0.62) for the evaluation of presence of breathlessness and moderate (κ=0.5) for the estimation of severity. The proportion of over- or underestimated scores was similar.
CONCLUSIONS: If patient's self-rating, the gold standard of symptom assessment, is not possible, professionals' assessment might be a valid alternative, at least for assessing the presence of breathlessness."
24535277,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24535277/,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the phenotypic and molecular characteristics of Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates obtained between 2006 and 2012 in Slovenia.
METHODS: Gonococcal isolates obtained between 2006 and 2012 in Slovenia (n = 194) were investigated with Etest for susceptibility to cefixime, ceftriaxone, penicillin, ciprofloxacin, azithromycin, tetracycline, gentamicin and spectinomycin. All isolates were examined with N. gonorrhoeae multiantigen sequence typing for molecular epidemiology and sequencing of the major extended-spectrum cephalosporin (ESC) resistance determinants (penA, mtrR and penB) was performed.
RESULTS: The overall prevalence of decreased susceptibility or resistance to cefixime and ceftriaxone (MIC ≥0.125 mg/L) was 11% and 5%, respectively. The decreased susceptibility or resistance showed an epidemic peak in 2011 (33% for cefixime and 11% for ceftriaxone), decreasing to 6% and 4%, respectively, in 2012. ST1407 (9% of isolates), ST21 (6%) and ST225 (6%) were the most common sequence types (STs) during 2006-12. Genogroup G1407 (ST1407 most prevalent ST), an internationally spread clone with decreased susceptibility or resistance to ESCs, was most prevalent (48%) in 2009. However, the G1407 prevalence then declined: in 2010, 30%; in 2011, 28%; and in 2012, 8%. Instead, in 2012 the ESC- and ciprofloxacin-susceptible G21 was the predominant genogroup (26%).
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of gonococcal resistance to ESCs in Slovenia has been high, but fluctuating. Fortunately, in 2012 some ESC- and ciprofloxacin-susceptible clones, such as genogroups G21, G1195 and G2992, appeared to have mainly replaced the multidrug-resistant G1407 clone, a replacement also seen in several European countries."
24535596,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24535596/,"BACKGROUND: The Glasgow Blatchford score (GBS) is a pre-endoscopic risk assessment tool for patients presenting with upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage. There are few data regarding use in patients with variceal bleeding, who are generally accepted as being at high risk.
AIM: The aim of the study was to assess GBS in correctly identifying patients with subsequently proven variceal bleeding as 'high risk' and to compare GBS, admission and full Rockall scores in predicting clinical endpoints in this group.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data on consecutive patients with upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage presenting to four UK hospitals were collected. The GBS, admission and full Rockall scores were calculated and compared for the subgroup subsequently shown to have variceal bleeding. Area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) was used to assess the scores ability to predict clinical endpoints within this variceal bleeding subgroup.
RESULTS: A total of 1432 patients presented during the study period. Seventy-one (5%) had a final diagnosis of variceal bleeding. At presentation, none of this group had GBS less than 2, but six had an admission Rockall score of 0. In predicting need for blood transfusion, AUROC scores for GBS, full and admission Rockall scores were 0.68, 0.65 and 0.68, respectively. For endoscopic/surgical intervention the scores were 0.34, 0.51 and 0.55, respectively, and for predicting death the scores were 0.56, 0.72 and 0.70, respectively. None of these AUROC score comparisons were significant.
CONCLUSION: At presentation, GBS correctly identifies patients with variceal bleeding as high risk and appears superior to the admission Rockall score. However, GBS and both Rockall scores are poor at predicting clinical outcome within this group."
24535840,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24535840/,"BACKGROUND: Folic acid supplements can protect against neural tube defects (NTDs). Low folate and low vitamin B12 status may be maternal risk factors for having an NTD affected pregnancy. However, not all NTDs are preventable by having an adequate folate/ B12 status and other potentially modifiable factors may be involved. Folate and vitamin B12 status have important links to iron metabolism. Animal studies support an association between poor iron status and NTDs, but human data are scarce. We examined the relevance of low iron status in a nested NTD case-control study of women within a pregnant population-based cohort.
METHODS: Pregnant women were recruited between 1986 and 1990, when vitamin or iron supplementation in early pregnancy was rare. Blood samples, taken at an average of 14 weeks gestation, were used to measure ferritin and hemoglobin in 64 women during an NTD affected pregnancy and 207 women with unaffected pregnancies.
RESULTS: No significant differences in maternal ferritin or hemoglobin concentrations were observed between NTD affected and nonaffected pregnancies (case median ferritin 16.9 µg/L and hemoglobin 12.4 g/dl versus 15.4 µg/L and 12.3g/dl in controls). As reported previously, red cell folate and vitamin B12 concentrations were significantly lower in cases. Furthermore, there was no significant association of iron status with type of NTD lesion (anencephaly or spina bifida).
CONCLUSION: We conclude that low maternal iron status during early pregnancy is not an independent risk factor for NTDs. Adding iron to folic acid for periconceptional use may improve iron status but is not likely to prevent NTDs."
24535940,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24535940/,"PURPOSE: We investigated rates of occult malignancy in the breast and sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in patients undergoing prophylactic mastectomy (PM) and whether routine sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is justified.
METHODS: A retrospective review of our database identified patients undergoing PMs with SLNB. Descriptive statistics were utilized for data summary. A P value of <0.05 was considered significant.
RESULTS: There were 384 patients during the study period who underwent 467 PMs. Of the 467 PMs, 15 (3.2%) cancers were found on final pathology. All 6 of the invasive cancers identified were T1. A total of 682 SLNs were taken for an average of 1.46 SLNs per PM. There were 5 positive SLNs (1.1%). All were in patients undergoing contralateral PM for either history of breast cancer or new diagnosis of breast cancer. Only one patient with a positive SLN was found to have an occult breast malignancy in the PM specimen.
CONCLUSION: In 467 PMs performed, 15 (3.2%) occult malignancies were found in the breast and 5 (1.1%) positive SLNs were found. Based on these results, the routine use of SLNB at the time of PM is unnecessary and does not warrant the morbidity associated with this procedure."

The objectives of this article are to characterise the fidelity of melanomas diagnosed in a high-risk clinic to the ABCD and to review potential methods for early clinical detection of melanoma.
METHODS: All cases of primary melanoma diagnosed by one clinician at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center over the past 11 years were evaluated for the presence of the ABCD. The melanomas were analysed for asymmetry of contour, unevenness in distribution of colours and textures, border irregularity, number of colours present and diameter.
RESULTS: In all, 236 melanomas were analysed. Of these, asymmetry of contour was present in 65% and 94% demonstrated unevenness in the distribution of colours and textures. The borders were regular in 12% of the melanomas and colour variegation was present in 63%. In total, 28% of the lesions were small, with a diameter less than 6 mm. This study was limited by the subjectivity of clinical lesion analysis.
CONCLUSION: We put forward for your consideration a new mnemonic: 'Do UC (different, uneven, changing) the melanoma?' This mnemonic encompasses differential, analytical and comparative cognition strategies for an enhanced early detection of melanoma."

This study aimed to investigate the effect of early onset and pack-years of smoking on type II diabetes risk.
METHODS: We used the most recent cross-sectional National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey set of South Korea (2010) and the United States (2009-2010). Participants who were diagnosed with diabetes after age 20 were included (South Korea: n = 7273, 44% male; U.S.: n = 3271, 52% male). Cox proportional models, stratified by sex and country, were used to estimate hazard ratios.
RESULTS: 7.1% of South Korean men, 5.5% of South Korean women, 15.5% of U.S. men, and 12.4% of U.S. women had type II diabetes; 40% of South Korean men, 34% of U.S. men, and 21% of U.S. women began smoking before age 20 (57%, 49%, 36% of those who had type II diabetes, respectively). Type II diabetic participants were older and married; have a higher BMI, low income, and less education; lack moderate physical activity, smoked more and earlier compared to those without type II diabetes. Differences in risk factors including life-style behaviors and SES were found in both diabetic and non-diabetic populations. Men who began smoking before age 16 had a higher type II diabetes risk than who never smoked (South Korea: hazard ratio [HR] 2.46, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-5.79; U.S.: HR 1.64, 95% CI 1.01-2.67), as did U.S. men who began smoking between 16 and 20 years (HR 1.58, 95% CI 1.05-2.37). Smoking pack-years were also associated with type II diabetes in U.S. men (HR 1.07, 95% CI 1.01-1.12). In women population, however, associations were not found.
CONCLUSIONS: Early onset of smoking increases type II diabetic risk among men in South Korea and the U.S., and type II diabetic risk increases with higher pack-years in U.S. men, however, no associations were found in women population. Underage tobacco policy and education programs are strongly needed in both countries."
24548816,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24548816/,"BACKGROUND: Skin-to-skin contact reduces pain response in preterm infants subjected to minor painful procedures, such as heel lance. Diaper change is a procedure performed several times daily in hospitalized preterm infants. Routine care giving tasks such as diaper change may be stressful for the infant.
AIMS: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether diaper change induces stress and if skin-to-skin contact could reduce such stress, measured by changes in skin conductance.
STUDY DESIGN: This was a randomized crossover pilot study in 19 preterm infants with gestational age between 28 and 34 weeks. The diaper change procedure was done twice in each infant, once during skin-to-skin contact, and once in incubator or bed with the mother present.
OUTCOME MEASURES: During diaper change heart rate (HR), peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), and changes in skin conductance (SC) peaks per sec, using the Skin Conductance Algesimeter (SCA), were registered.
RESULTS: The mean SC peaks/sec increased/decreased significantly under/after change of diapers which thereby underpins that this is a stressful procedure for the preterm infant. Skin-to-skin contact (SSC) entails significantly lower stress levels (p<0.05) compared to diaper changed in an incubator/bed measured by the SCA.
CONCLUSIONS: Diaper change is a stressful procedure for preterm infants and may be ameliorated by skin-to-skin contact."
24548849,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24548849/,"PURPOSE: Stress is the most often reported seizure-precipitant in epilepsy. As most evidence for the relation between stress and epilepsy is derived from human self-reports, observational studies including a larger part of the population could provide additional proof. A stressor often reported to increase seizure frequency in children with epilepsy in the Netherlands is the national celebration of Saint Nicholas' eve (December 5) and the weeks before; this is the main period of festivities for children in this country. To study the relation between stress and epilepsy, we analyzed epilepsy information-seeking behavior on the Internet, an indirect measure of seizure frequency, around this national children's celebration.
METHODS: Google Trends was used to extract relative search percentages for 'epilepsy' on Google in the Netherlands, the United States, and the United Kingdom between 2004 and 2013. Relative search percentages during the Saint Nicholas period were compared with baseline.
RESULTS: Epilepsy searches increased by 14% in the Saint Nicholas period compared with baseline (p<0.001). This effect was not found for searches performed in the same period in the United States or the United Kingdom, countries where this holiday is not celebrated.
CONCLUSIONS: The increase in epilepsy information-seeking behavior in the Saint Nicholas period is possibly caused by an increased occurrence of epileptic seizures. This underscores the potential of health information-seeking behavior on the Internet to answer clinically relevant research questions and provides circumstantial evidence for a relation between stress and the occurrence of epileptic seizures."
24549164,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24549164/,"OBJECTIVES: Examine the probability of new active substances (NASs) approved in Canada between 1 January 1997 and 31 March 2012 acquiring a serious postmarket safety warning.
DESIGN: Cohort study.
DATA SOURCES: Annual reports of the Therapeutic Products Directorate and the Biologic and Genetic Therapies Directorate; evaluations of therapeutic innovation from the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board and Prescrire International; MedEffect Canada website.
INTERVENTIONS: Postmarket regulatory safety warning or withdrawal from market due to safety reasons.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Compare the probability of acquiring a postmarket safety warning in Canada in four different groups of drugs: (1) traditional medications versus biologics; (2) medications that offer significant new therapeutic benefits versus those that do not. Determine how well the type of review that an NAS received from Health Canada predicted the product's postmarket therapeutic value.
RESULTS: The probability of a traditional NAS acquiring a serious safety warning and/or being withdrawn was 29.9% (95% CI 21.8% to 40.2%) vs 27.3% (95% CI 18.2% to 39.7%) for an NAS of biological origin (p=0.47, log-rank test). For medications that were significant therapeutic advances the probability was 40.2% (95% CI 24.5% to 60.9%) vs 33.9% (95% CI 26.4% to 42.7%) for those that were not (p=0.18, log-rank test). Health Canada was 77.4% accurate in predicting the therapeutic importance of an NAS.
CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference in postmarket regulatory safety action between traditional medications and biologics and no difference between drugs with significant therapeutic benefits and those without. Although these results draw on Canadian data, they are likely to be relevant internationally. Further research should assess whether the current level of premarket safety evaluation is acceptable."
24549392,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24549392/,"PURPOSE: To determine the extent to which the clinical manifestations of a cohort of people undergoing surgery for lumbosacral nerve root compression satisfy those described in The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance.
METHOD: We studied consecutive admissions for lumbar nerve root decompression surgery at two neurosurgical units. Pre-operatively, each person's clinical manifestations were documented and compared with NICE's description. Post-operatively, at three time points (within 48 h, 3 months, 12 months), each person rated their symptoms as either better, the same, or worse.
RESULTS: Pre-operatively, one person (0.8%), from 123 admissions, under 20 different consultant neurosurgeons, had manifestations consistent with NICE's clinical description of lumbar nerve root compression. Post-operatively, self-reported benefit associated with surgery appeared high, at all three time points (78-91%), supporting the diagnosis of symptomatic nerve root compression and the value of surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: In this small sample, from two units, NICE's description of the clinical manifestations of lumbar nerve root compression did not describe 99% of people having surgery for it. Using NICE's definition to triage people with low back pain could result in prolonged symptoms and delayed treatment. Diagnosing lumbar nerve root compression is complex. NICE's guidance requires examination."
24549463,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24549463/,"BACKGROUND: The Defence Medical Services (DMS) primarily recruits its trained General Practitioners (GPs) from the NHS and since 1970, the number of men entering medicine has doubled whereas the number of women has increased 10-fold; female GPs will outnumber their male counterparts by 2017. This study performs a quantitative assessment of the potential impact of feminisation of UK General Practice upon the DMS recruitment and workforce planning.
METHODS: General Medial Council General Practice Certificate of Completion of Training (GMC GP CCT) data were analysed to identify any change in the percentage of male and female GP Specialty Training Registrars successfully completing GP vocational training between 2007 and 2012, thus becoming potentially recruitable into the DMS as independent GPs.
RESULTS: A 3% increase was seen in the number of women achieving GMC GP CCT between 2007 and 2012 (p=0.015). The percentage of DMS GP Specialty Training Registrars (GPStRs) gaining their GMC GP CCT in 2012 who were women (25%) was about half that seen nationally (59%). A lack of 2007 by-sex GMC GP CCT data for DMS GPStRs prevented a comparison with 2012.
CONCLUSIONS: The national increase of only 3% infers feminisation of UK General Practice is not an immediate challenge for the DMS. Nevertheless, as feminisation of the UK GP workforce is expected to continue, the future cohort from whom the DMS will recruit its GPs is likely to contain increasing numbers of women. With the return to contingency, the DMS may wish to consider the implications of increasing numbers of female GPs upon service delivery in the UK and overseas, and explore more flexible medical employment models."
24549773,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24549773/,"BACKGROUND: The direct anterior approach for THA offers some advantages, but is associated with a significant learning curve. Some of the technical difficulties can be addressed by the use of intraoperative fluoroscopy which may improve the accuracy of acetabular component placement.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: The purposes of this study were to determine if (1) there is decreased variability of acetabular cup inclination and anteversion with the direct anterior approach using fluoroscopic guidance as compared with the posterior approach THA without radiographic guidance; (2) if there is a learning curve associated with achieving accuracy with the direct anterior approach THA. We also wanted (3) to assess the frequency of complications including dislocation with the anterior approach, which initially had a learning curve, and the posterior approach.
METHODS: This retrospective, comparative study of 825 THAs (372 posterior THAs without fluoroscopic guidance and 453 direct anterior THAs, performed by one surgeon, focused on a radiographic analysis to determine cup inclination and anteversion on standardized pelvic radiographs using specialized software. The first 100 direct anterior THAs performed while transitioning from the posterior approach to the direct anterior approach were included in the learning curve group. During this learning curve period, the direct anterior approach was used for all patients except those with conversion of previously fixed intertrochanteric or femoral neck fractures to THAs, gluteus medius tears, and obese patients with an immobile abdominal pannus (100 of 127 THAs). Variability of the acetabular component was compared among the posterior group, learning curve group, and direct anterior group.
RESULTS: Variances for cup inclination and anteversion were significantly lower in the direct anterior group (19 and 16 respectively, p < 0.01) as compared with the posterior group (50 and 79 respectively).Target inclination and anteversion were achieved better in the direct anterior group (98% and 97% respectively) as compared with the posterior group (86% and 77% respectively) (p < 0.01, OR for inclination = 9.1, 95% CI, 3.5 to 23.4; OR for anteversion = 8, 95% CI, 4 to 16). In the learning curve group, target anteversion achieved (91% of cases) was marginally lower than that of the direct anterior group (p = 0.03; OR = 2.9, 95% CI, 1.1 to 7.3) and target inclination (95%) was similar (p = 0.13). There was one posterior dislocation in the posterior group, two anterior dislocations in the learning curve group, and none in the direct anterior group.
CONCLUSIONS: Use of fluoroscopy with the patient in the supine position during direct anterior THA enables intraoperative assessment of cup orientation resulting in decreased variability of acetabular cup anteversion. However, there is a learning curve associated with achieving this accuracy. We could not discern whether this difference was the result of the approach or the use of fluoroscopy in the direct anterior group.

24549776,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24549776/,"BACKGROUND: While the majority of terrible triad elbow injuries (ulnohumeral dislocation with radial head and coronoid fractures) are managed surgically, nonoperative treatment may be appropriate in selected patients, but results with this approach have been limited by very small studies.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We assessed (1) functional outcomes using two validated questionnaires, (2) elbow ROM, strength, and stability, (3) the presence of union and arthritis on radiographs, and (4) complications among a group of patients managed nonoperatively for terrible triad injuries.
METHODS: Between 2006 and 2012, we retrospectively identified 12 patients with terrible triad elbow injuries who were treated nonoperatively and met the following criteria: (1) a concentric joint reduction, (2) a radial head fracture that did not cause a mechanical block to rotation, (3) a smaller coronoid fracture (Regan-Morrey Type 1 or 2), and (4) a stable arc of motion to a minimum of 30° of extension to allow active motion within the first 10 days. Eleven patients were available for followup of at least 12 months after the injury (mean, 36 months; range, 12-90 months). Outcome measures included two patient-reported functional outcome measures (DASH, Mayo Elbow Performance Index [MEPI]), a standardized physical examination to record elbow ROM and stability, isometric strength measurements, and radiographic evidence of bony union and elbow arthrosis. Complications were also recorded.
RESULTS: At latest followup, mean ± SD DASH score was 8.0 ± 11.0 and mean MEPI score was 94 ± 9. Mean ROM of the affected elbow was 134° ± 5° flexion, 6° ± 8° extension, 87° ± 4° pronation, and 82° ± 10° supination. No instability was detected. Strength assessments demonstrated the following mean percentages of the contralateral, unaffected elbow: flexion 100%, extension 89%, pronation 79%, and supination 89%. Four patients had arthritic changes on radiographs that did not call for treatment as of latest followup. Complications included one patient who underwent surgical stabilization for early recurrent instability and another who underwent arthroscopic débridement for heterotopic bone.
CONCLUSIONS: In selected patients, nonoperative treatment of terrible triad injuries is an option that can provide good function and restore stable elbow ROM. However, nonoperative management requires close clinical and radiographic followup to monitor for any delayed elbow subluxation or fracture displacement.

24550349,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24550349/,"AIMS: The previous literature has suggested that the iatrogenic atrial septal defects (IASDs) may follow left atrial (LA) access by transseptal (TS) puncture, especially in the case of a single TS for more than one catheter. The aim of the present study is to describe the prevalence of patent foramen ovale (PFO) and IASDs in a cohort of atrial fibrillation (AF) patients undergoing redo catheter ablation (CA) procedures in a high-volume centre accessing LA by a standardized single TS puncture.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients (n = 197) who underwent at least one redo AFCA, between 2004 and 2012, were retrospectively enroled. Transoesophageal echocardiography was performed before each procedure during which LA was accessed via a PFO, if present, or by single TS for both the mapping and ablation catheters. At baseline, PFO was detected in 43 (21.8%) patients. Clinical and echocardiographic parameters recorded did not differ within patients presenting with or without PFO. Left atrium was accessed via PFO in 39 (90.7% of those with PFO) patients during the first procedure. New-onset IASD occurred in 11 (5.6%) patients following the first procedure and in 1 (2.2%) patient following the second procedure. The clinical and echocardiographic parameters did not differ within the patients irrespective of whether IASD was reported or not. No TS-related complications occurred.
CONCLUSION: In the present cohort, LA access by PFO or single TS for both the mapping and ablation catheters lead to a small risk of asymptomatic IASD, not increased by redo procedures, confirming that it represents a safe approach. No clinical and/or echocardiographic parameters seemed to predict IASD occurrence."
24550434,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24550434/,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to examine whether the socioeconomic context of urban areas affects differences in adult mortality from injuries in the districts of all seven South Korean metropolitan cities, after adjusting for individual demographic and socioeconomic indicators.
METHODS: Two different sets of data were used in this study: (1) the National Death Registration data from 2003 to 2008; and (2) the National Census in 2005. Variables for individual characteristics were gender, age, residential area and educational level. A geographic deprivation index was calculated based on the Carstairs Index. Multilevel Poisson regression models were used to analyse the relationship between area deprivation levels and injury mortality.
RESULTS: Greater mortality risks of traffic accidents, falls, suicide and all injuries were found in the elderly, the less educated and men, compared with their counterparts. The most deprived districts were at greater risks of death due to traffic accidents (risk ratio (RR)=1.34; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.73), falls (RR=1.63; 95% CI 1.20 to 2.20), suicide (RR=1.09; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.17) and all injuries (RR=1.14; 95% CI 1.07 to 1.22) compared with the least deprived districts, even after individual level socioeconomic variables were controlled for. However, area level deprivation did not show cross level interactions with the individual level education in estimating fatal injury risks.
CONCLUSIONS: Both contextual and compositional effects of socioeconomic status on injury mortality among urban areas in South Korea should be considered in allocating resources for injury prevention."
24550670,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24550670/,"BACKGROUND: Stroke survivors may not be receiving optimal rehabilitation as a result of a shortage of hospital resources, and many of them are institutionalized. A rehabilitation program provided in a short-term residential care setting may help to fill the service gap.
OBJECTIVES: The primary objectives of this study were, first, to examine whether there were significant differences in terms of rehabilitation outcomes at 1 year after admission to the rehabilitation program (defined as baseline) between those using short-term residential care (intervention group) and those using usual geriatric day hospital care (control group), and, second, to investigate whether lower 1-year institutionalization rates were observed in the intervention group than in the control group.
PARTICIPANTS: 155 stroke survivors who completed at least the first follow-up at 4 months after baseline.
INTERVENTION: The intervention group was stroke survivors using self-financed short-term residential care for stroke rehabilitation. The control group was stroke survivors using the usual care at a public geriatric day hospital.
MEASUREMENTS: Assessments were conducted by trained research assistants using structured questionnaires at baseline, 4 months, and 1 year after baseline. The primary outcome measures included Modified Barthel Index score, Mini-Mental Status Examination score, and the institutionalization rate.
RESULTS: Cognitive status (as measured by Mini-Mental Status Examination score) of patients in both groups could be maintained from 4 months to 1 year, whereas functional status (as measured by Modified Barthel Index score) of the patients could be further improved after 4 months up to 1 year. Meanwhile, insignificant between-group difference in rehabilitation outcomes was observed. The intervention participants had a significantly lower 1-year institutionalization rate (15.8%) than the control group (25.8%).
CONCLUSION: Short-term residential care for stroke rehabilitation promoted improvements in rehabilitation outcomes comparable with, if not better than, the usual care at geriatric day hospital. Furthermore, it had a significantly lower 1-year institutionalization rate. This type of service could be promoted to prevent institutionalization."
24552040,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24552040/,"OBJECTIVE: The goal of our study was to compare the incidence of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) observed in students at the School of Physical Education and Sports (SPES), which is a school that provides higher education in athletics, with that observed in students studying in other departments of the university. Our hypothesis was that people with ADHD most commonly turn to sports.
METHOD: The study enrolled 318 (75.7% of 420) students who were studying in the SPES of Gaziantep University; 277 students from the medical, nursing, administration, and engineering faculties were enrolled to serve as a control group. All students enrolled in the study were informed about the study before the lesson, and the students who agreed to participate provided written consent. Scales used in this study were: a sociodemographic information form which was prepared by the investigators, the Wender-Utah Rating Scale (WURS), and the Adult ADD/ADHD DSM-IV Based Diagnostic Screening and Rating Scale (ADD/ADHD).
RESULTS: WURS scores were significantly higher (25.07 +/- 15.15 versus 21.37 +/- 14.28; p = 0.002) in the SPES group than the control group. In addition, the percentage of subjects with a WURS score above the cut-off of 36 was higher in the SPES group than the control group (22.4% versus 15.2%; p: 0.028). The two groups were not significantly different in terms of the subscales of the ADD/ADHD scale. A correlation was found between the educational achievement of the students in the SPES group and the ADD/ADHD-inattention subscale (r = .111, p = 0.015) and WURS scale (r = .113, p = 0.011).
CONCLUSIONS: More systematic studies with larger samples in this domain will be useful in obtaining a clearer picture regarding professional attraction of people with ADHD to sports."
20156839,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20156839/,"BACKGROUND: Given sparse knowledge on dissemination, this study sought to explore key benefits, barriers and contextual factors that are perceived to be important to the adoption and implementation of the 'Community Guide's' evidence-based physical activity recommendations.
DESIGN: We conducted case studies in two states where extensive adoption and implementation of the Guide's recommendations have occurred and in two states where widespread dissemination has lagged. Interviews (n = 76) were semi-structured and included both quantitative and qualitative methods. Participant perceptions from the following areas were examined: (i) priority of physical activity, (ii) awareness of and ability to define the term 'evidence-based approaches' and (iii) awareness, adoption, facilitators, benefits, challenges and barriers to Guide adoption.
RESULTS: Key enabling factors among high capacity states included: funds and direction from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; leadership support; capable staff; and successful partnerships and collaborations. Restraining forces among low capacity states included: the Guide recommendations being too new; participants being too new to current job; lack of time and training on how to use the Guide recommendations; limited funds and other resources and lack of leadership.
CONCLUSION: To be effective, we must gain an understanding of contextual factors when designing for dissemination."
20156897,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20156897/,"OBJECTIVE: The goal was to determine whether patient-held vaccination records improve vaccination rates.
METHODS: The public-use files of the 2004-2006 National Immunization Survey, a national, validated survey of households with children 19 to 35 months of age, were used. The main outcome was up-to-date (UTD) vaccination status (4 diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis/diphtheria-tetanus vaccine, 3 poliovirus vaccine, 1 measles vaccine, 3 Haemophilus influenza type B vaccine, and 3 hepatitis B vaccine doses), and the main predictor was the use of a vaccination record. Control variables were race/ethnicity, maternal education, poverty status, language, number of children in the home, state of residence, and number of health care providers.
RESULTS: Overall, 80.8% of children were UTD, and 40.8% of children had vaccination records. Children with vaccination records were more likely to be UTD (83.9% vs 78.6%; P < .0001). The largest effects associated with vaccination records were seen for children with multiple providers, comparing with and without a vaccination record (82.8% vs 71.9%; P < .0001), those with low maternal education, (81.6% vs 72.9%; P < .0001), and those with > or =4 children in the household, (76% vs 69.6%; P < .004). Logistic regression predicting UTD status and controlling for race/ethnicity, maternal education, poverty level, language, number of children in the home, and number of vaccine providers revealed the vaccination record to be associated with a 62% increase in the odds of UTD status (odds ratio: 1.62 [95% confidence interval: 1.49-1.77]).
CONCLUSIONS: Use of patient-held vaccination records is an easily implemented strategy that is associated with increased immunization rates. A greater effect was seen in groups at risk for underimmunization. Methods to incorporate and to ensure effective use of these records should be implemented."
20156920,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20156920/,"OBJECTIVE: We examine socio-economic status (SES) and geographic differences in willingness of respondents to pay for community-based health insurance (CBHI).
METHODS: The study took place in Anambra and Enugu states, south-east Nigeria. It involved a rural, an urban and a semi-urban community in each of the two states. A pre-tested interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect information from a total of 3070 households selected by simple random sampling. Contingent valuation was used to elicit willingness to pay (WTP) using the bidding game format. Data were examined for correlation between SES and geographic locations with WTP. Log ordinary least squares (OLS) was used to examine the construct validity of elicited WTP.
RESULTS: Generally, less than 40% of the respondents were willing to pay for CBHI membership for themselves or other household members. The proportions of people who were willing to pay were much lower in the rural communities, at less than 7%. The average that respondents were willing to pay as a monthly premium for themselves ranged from 250 Naira (US$1.7) in a rural community to 343 Naira (US$2.9) in an urban community. The higher the SES group, the higher the stated WTP amount. Similarly, the urbanites stated higher WTP compared with peri-urban and rural dwellers. Males and people with more education stated higher WTP values than females and those with less education. Log OLS also showed that previously paying out-of-pocket for health care was negatively related to WTP. Previously paying for health care using any health insurance mechanism was positively related to WTP.
CONCLUSION: Economic status and place of residence amongst other factors matter in peoples' WTP for CBHI membership. Consumer awareness has to be created about the benefits of CBHI, especially in rural areas, and the amount to be paid has to be augmented with other means of financing (e.g. government and/or donor subsidies) to ensure success and sustainability of CBHI schemes."
20156922,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20156922/,"BACKGROUND: In the last decades, a marked increased prevalence of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) has been observed worldwide. The aim of this study was to evaluate the changing features of DTC referred to our institution between 1969 and 2004.
METHODS: Clinical and pathological features and prognostic factors were analyzed in 4187 DTC patients, subdivided into two groups: group 1 (n = 1215) and group 2 (n = 2972) diagnosed before and after 1990, respectively.
RESULTS: Group 2 showed an increased proportion of micropapillary carcinoma and a concomitant decrease of follicular histotype. Male percentage was greater in group 2, whereas median age at diagnosis was unchanged. DTC of group 2 were more frequently associated with multinodular goiter or autoimmune thyroiditis, but many were unexpected findings. Features of aggressiveness were significantly less frequent in group 2, and the survival rate was greater (98.7 vs. 91.4%, P < 0.0001). Gender, age, histotype, tumor size, extrathyroidal macroinvasion, and lymph node and/or distant metastases were found to be poor prognostic factors in both groups using univariate analysis, but with multivariate analysis, only advanced age (odds ratio = 22.52 for older patients) and advanced stage (odds ratio = 53.54 for more advanced cases) were independently correlated with a lower survival.
CONCLUSIONS: DTC patients diagnosed after 1990 have smaller tumors with less advanced stage and a better prognosis. The question of whether this is related to the finding of tumors with a low clinical penetrance or to the anticipation of diagnosis remains to be clarified. Despite these significant differences, both advanced stage and older age still represent the most important poor prognostic factors for survival."
20156958,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20156958/,"BACKGROUND: Often in randomized controlled trials of cancer screening, cause of death is determined by a mortality review committee. However, little is known regarding how findings from mortality review compare to those from death certificates alone.
PURPOSE: To examine the results of four different U. S. trials of cancer screening when death certificate data only were used, as compared to results using all available mortality review information.
METHODS: Trials included were the Health Insurance Plan of New York breast screening trial (HIP), the Minnesota trial of fecal occult blood testing, and the Johns Hopkins and Mayo Lung Projects, which each examined chest x-ray and sputum cytology. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and Cohen's kappa for death certificates were calculated for all arms of all trials. Separate intention-to-screen analyses were conducted for each trial using cause of death information from either death certificates alone or full mortality review data.
RESULTS: Generally there was excellent agreement between the death certificates and the mortality review committee as to the underlying cause of death (kappa >0.85 in all cases); death certificate agreement was similar between arms in all trials. Modest changes in the screening effectiveness estimates were observed when mortality review information was utilized, ranging from a 9% decrease to a 2% increase in the calculated mortality rate ratios. However, in one instance (HIP) a statistically significant benefit of screening was observed when mortality review committee data were used (rate ratio (RR) 0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62- 0.95) but not when death certificate data were used (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.65-1.03).
LIMITATIONS: Although considered to be the gold standard, even carefully conducted mortality review may result in errors in cause of death assignment.
CONCLUSIONS: For each trial, results were similar regardless of the source of cause of death information."
20157135,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20157135/,"BACKGROUND: Estrogen plus progestin therapy increases the risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) in postmenopausal women. However, this increased risk might be limited to the first years of use and to women who start therapy late in menopause.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effect of continuous estrogen plus progestin therapy on CHD risk over time and stratified by years since menopause.
DESIGN: Women's Health Initiative randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00000611)
SETTING: 40 U.S. clinical centers.
PATIENTS: 16 608 postmenopausal women with an intact uterus at baseline from 1993 to 1998.
INTERVENTION: Conjugated equine estrogens, 0.625 mg/d, plus medroxyprogesterone acetate, 2.5 mg/d, or placebo.
MEASUREMENTS: Adherence-adjusted hazard ratios and CHD-free survival curves estimated through inverse probability weighting.
RESULTS: Compared with no use of hormone therapy, the hazard ratio for continuous use of estrogen plus progestin therapy was 2.36 (95% CI, 1.55 to 3.62) for the first 2 years and 1.69 (CI, 0.98 to 2.89) for the first 8 years. For women within 10 years after menopause, the hazard ratios were 1.29 (CI, 0.52 to 3.18) for the first 2 years and 0.64 (CI, 0.21 to 1.99) for the first 8 years, and the CHD-free survival curves for continuous use and no use of estrogen plus progestin crossed at about 6 years (CI, 2 years to 10 years).
LIMITATION: The analysis may not have fully adjusted for joint determinants of adherence and CHD risk. Sample sizes for some subgroup analyses were small.
CONCLUSION: No suggestion of a decreased risk for CHD was found within the first 2 years of estrogen plus progestin use, including in women who initiated therapy within 10 years after menopause. A possible cardioprotective effect in these women who initiated therapy closer to menopause became apparent only after 6 years of use.

20157178,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20157178/,"OBJECTIVE: To identify associations between men's self-reports of ill-fitting condoms and selected condom use problems, using an event-specific analysis.
METHODS: A convenience sample of men was recruited via advertisements in newspapers (two urban and one small town) and a blog on the website of a condom sales company. Men completed a questionnaire posted on the website of The Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction. Inclusion criteria were: at least 18 years old, used condoms for penile-vaginal intercourse in the past 3 months and the ability to read English.
RESULTS: In controlled, event-specific, analyses of 436 men, those reporting ill-fitting condoms (44.7%) were significantly more likely to report breakage (adjusted odds ratio (AOR 2.6), slippage (AOR 2.7), difficulty reaching orgasm, both for their female partners (AOR 1.9) and for themselves (AOR 2.3). In addition, they were more likely to report irritation of the penis (AOR 5.0) and reduced sexual pleasure, both for their female partner (AOR 1.6) and for themselves (AOR 2.4). Furthermore, they were more likely to report that condoms interfered with erection (AOR 2.0), caused erection loss (AOR 2.3), or became dry during sex (AOR 1.9). Finally, they were more likely to report removing condoms before penile-vaginal sex ended (AOR 2.0).
CONCLUSIONS: Men and their female sex partners may benefit from public health efforts designed to promote the improved fit of condoms."
20157717,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20157717/,"INTRODUCTION: The morphologic and immunohistochemical findings of a well-circumscribed leiomyoadenomatoid tumor located in the posterior uterine wall are reported.
CASE REPORT: The patient was a 55-year-old white woman who complained of peri/postmenopausal and irregular bleeding during the past 4 months. The adenomatoid component was intermingled with bland smooth muscle fascicles and was composed of vacuolated cells, tubules, and slit-like structures crossed by epithelial bridges. Immunohistochemistry revealed positivity to epithelial and mesothelial markers in the adenomatoid component and strong immunoreaction for smooth muscle markers in the leiomyomatous one.
CONCLUSIONS: The well-defined circumscription and the presence of mesothelial component intermingled with the leiomyomatous proliferation favors the hypothesis that a leiomyo-adenomatoid tumor should be considered as a subtype of adenomatoid tumor with distinctive morphological features. Only four previous cases of this rare neoplasm have been reported to date, one in the epydidimis and the other three cases in the uterine wall, one of them affecting also to the right ovary."
20158351,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20158351/,"OBJECTIVE: It is well known that exposure to noise can lead to hearing loss. Craniotomy drills have significant noise and vibration. Since a noise induced by the drill during craniotomy is thought to be one of the causes, we examined its effect on the sensorineural hearing in this study.
METHODS: Thirty-nine patients who had undergone craniotomy operations served as the basis for this study between Jul. 2007 and Dec. 2008. Standard pure-tone audiometry (PTA) and speech recognition thresholds (SRT) were calculated for all subjects before, one week and 1 year after craniotomy.
RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were not observed at the lower and middle frequencies (0.25-2 kHz), however, differences in the hearing thresholds at higher frequencies (4-6 kHz) were statistically significant before and after craniotomy. Mean pure-tone thresholds obtained was significantly more in older subjects when compared to young patients. Moreover, the correlation between increased number of burr holes and sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) was statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that drill-generated noise during craniotomy has been incriminated as a cause of SNHL. Possible noise disturbance to the inner ear can only be avoided by minimizing the number of burr holes and the duration of harmful noise exposure to the cochlear structures."
20159212,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20159212/,"OBJECTIVE: Disagreements concerning the stability of alexithymia and its ability to predict subsequent psychiatric disorders prevail. The aim of this 7-year follow-up study was to examine whether alexithymia predicts subsequent major depression, personality disorder, or alcohol use disorders in a population-based sample.
METHODS: The four-phase Kuopio Depression Study (KUDEP) was conducted in the eastern part of Central Finland. The study population (aged 25-64, n=2050) was randomly selected from the National Population Register. Data were collected in 1998, 1999, and 2001. In 2005, a subsample (n=333, 43 were excluded) of the 3-year follow-up population (1998-2001) was gathered and their diagnoses of mental disorders were confirmed by the Structure Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I (SCID-I). Alexithymia was measured using the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) and depressive symptoms using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-21). For both of these measures, two groups were formed based on the median of their sum score (summing the 1998, 1999, and 2001 scores). Logistic regression analyses were performed.
RESULTS: BDI sum scores, but not those of TAS, were associated with subsequent major depressive disorder, personality disorder, and alcohol use disorders in 2005. The BDI sum scores explained 35.7% of the variation in concurrent TAS sum scores.
CONCLUSION: Alexithymia did not predict diagnoses of major depressive disorder, personality disorder, or alcohol use disorders. Alexithymia was closely linked to concurrent depressive symptoms. Thus, depressive symptoms may act as a mediator between alexithymia and psychiatric morbidity."
20159669,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20159669/,"OBJECTIVE: Due to organ shortage, average waiting time for a kidney in Germany is about 4 years after start of dialysis. Number of kidney grafts recovered can only be maintained by accepting older and expanded criteria donors. The aim of this study was to analyse the impact of donor and recipient risk on kidney long-term function.
METHODS: All deceased kidney transplantations were considered. We retrospectively studied 332 patients between 2002 and 2006; divided in 4 groups reflecting donor and recipient risk.
RESULTS: Non-marginal recipients were less likely to receive a marginal organ (69 of 207, 33%) as compared to marginal recipients, of whom two-thirds received a marginal organ (p<0.0001). Graft function significantly differed between the groups, but detrimental effect of marginal recipient status on eGFR after 12 months (-6 ml/min/1.73qm, 95% CI -2 to -9) was clearly smaller than the effect of marginal donor status (-10 ml/min/1.73qm, 95% CI -7 to -14).
CONCLUSIONS: As we were able to show expanded criteria donor has a far bigger effect on long-term graft function than the ""extra risk"" recipient. Although there have been attempts to define groups of recipients who should be offered ECD kidneys primarily the discussion is still ongoing."
20162279,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20162279/,"BACKGROUND: In the past decade numerous studies have been published on the successful treatment of fecal incontinence with sacral neuromodulation (SNM). The underlying mechanism of action for lower bowel motility disorders has been unclear. In the present study, the effect of SNM on the rectoanal angle in patients with fecal incontinence was investigated.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 12 consecutive patients who qualified for SNM an X-defecography study was performed before SNM and at 6 months after permanent implant. Three single lateral rectal views were taken: one during rest, one during squeeze, and one during Valsalva's maneuver, after which the patient was asked to evacuate as rapidly and completely as possible during lateral fluoroscopy. At 6 months two further defecography studies were performed, one during stimulation with the pacemaker on and one with the pacemaker off.
RESULTS: The defecography studies showed that the rectoanal angle decreased during rest, squeeze, and Valsalva's maneuver. A slight increase in rectoanal angle was seen during defecation. However, the differences did not reach statistical significance. Sacral neuromodulation improved fecal continence significantly in all patients at 6 months. Median incontinence episodes per week decreased from 6.2 to 1.0 (P = 0.001), and incontinent days per week decreased from 3.7 to 1.0 (P = 0.001) with SNM. There were no significant changes in the median resting and squeeze anal canal pressures, 46.5 versus 49.7 mmHg and 67.1 versus 72.3 mmHg, respectively. Median stimulation amplitude at follow-up was 2.7 V (range: 0.9-5.3 V).
CONCLUSIONS: Rectoanal angle did not decrease significantly in patients with fecal incontinence during SNM."
20162308,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20162308/,"PURPOSE: To report a case of altered CYP2C19 metaboliser status following 5-fluorouracil treatment.
METHODS: A 78-year-old male with stage III colorectal adenocarcinoma was prescribed with weekly iv 5-fluorouracil and folinic acid (FU/FA). Fourteen weeks after starting FU/FA, the patient was enrolled in a clinical study to investigate the role of tumour burden on drug metabolising enzyme activity. CYP2C19 genotype was determined and the activity of CYP2C19 was measured using proguanil (PG) as a probe substrate. A metabolic ratio (PG/CG) for CYP2C19 activity was determined on three separate occasions, 7 days apart.
RESULTS: The patient was homozygous wild type (CYP2C19*1/*1), and on the first test, the metabolic ratio was concordant with the extensive metaboliser genotype. However, at day 14 and day 21, the metabolic capacity of this enzyme had decreased, and the subject had become a poor metaboliser (PG/CG > 30). The patient developed grade III hand and foot syndrome at day 10 of the study during the period of null CYP2C19 activity.
CONCLUSIONS: Although 5FU is not a substrate for hepatic drug metabolising CYP enzymes, it may interfere with the synthesis of CYP2C19. Decreased activity of a related enzyme, CYP2C9, following 5FU has been reported previously. Down regulation of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 synthesis by 5FU therapies may explain the adverse effect of 5FU on the clinical disposition of warfarin and phenytoin."
20162424,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20162424/,"INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to try to understand if psychological evaluation of patients candidate to sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) could be a potential selection criterion to identify those patients who could successfully respond to this treatment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 2005 to 2007, 68 patients with slow transit constipation were identified, and all of them fulfill the selection criteria for the SNS treatment. The MMPI-2 test was purposed to all the patients. Wexner score, bowel movements, and SF36 were recorded in all the patients.
RESULTS: Twenty-three patients (33.8%) refused the psychological evaluation. Forty-five patients completed the test: only 13 patients (19.1%) had a score in the normal range of the scales of the MMPI-2 and were implanted with the temporary test for SNS. After the screening period, 11 patients (84.6%) reported more than 50% improvement of bowel movements per week and no need of laxatives, so they were definitively implanted. The mean follow-up period was 22 months (range 12-36). The mean number of bowel movements per week and Wexner score were significantly improved after 1 year (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: A complete and accurate psychological evaluation could be very important in the selection of the patients with STC that could benefit from SNS."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-one patients were treated for IP and 47 patients attended regular post-operative follow-up appointments for at least one year (mean: 54 months).
RESULTS: The patients were assigned to 3 groups: group Ia, in which IP was not confirmed until the post-operative pathology findings; group Ib, in which IP was confirmed during the operation; and group II, in which IP was confirmed before the operation. There were nineteen (37%) patients in group Ia, nine patients (18%) in group Ib and twenty-three patients (45%) in group II. The recurrence rates for groups Ia, Ib and II were 33%, 11% and 5% respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The initial presentation of bilateral sinonasal disease can easily lead the doctor into the misdiagnosis of IP. Bony erosion, remodelling, and a widening of the natural orifice of the sinuses on a CT scan are useful signs indicating IP. The correct diagnosis prior to surgery is a determinant of outcome. The use of frozen sections should, however, improve outcome as well. In this study we highlight the high prevalence and relatively low control rate of misdiagnosed IP (pathology undetermined pre-operatively) and hope to remind clinicians that early recognition of the tumour is most beneficial to patients."

DESIGN: Cohort study comparing self-reported risk behaviors prior to and three months after HIV testing.
SETTING: Clinica Familiar Luis Angel Garcia, an HIV specialty clinic located in a Guatemalan National Hospital.
SUBJECTS, PARTICIPANTS: 144 people undergoing HIV testing were enrolled. 44 were HIV positive. 41 HIV positive and 49 HIV negative subjects returned for follow-up interviews.
INTERVENTION: All subjects were tested and received voluntary counseling regarding HIV infection, transmission, prevention, and interpretation of HIV test results.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary study outcome measure was change in self-reported risk behaviors three months after voluntary counseling and testing.
RESULTS: Men were more likely than women to report a history of sexually transmitted diseases, more than 2 sexual partners, using alcohol with sex, and receiving money for sex; they were less likely to have a regular partner. 26% of men reported non-heterosexual orientation; no woman did. Alcohol was the primary drug of abuse in both men and women. At three month follow-up HIV positive subjects showed decreases in the average number of sexual partners, use of alcohol with sex, and episodes of unprotected sex.
CONCLUSIONS: Voluntary counseling and testing resulted in changes in some self-reported risk behaviors, but only among HIV positive subjects. On nearly all measures men report riskier behavior than women. Alcohol is the most commonly used drug in this population and is often used with sex."

METHODS: The study population comprised respondents aged 25-64 (n = 79,100) replying to nationally representative annual postal surveys from 1982 to 2008 (average response rate 72%). The main measurements were the prevalence of respondents who had drunk at least eight (men) or five (women) drinks in the previous week ('moderate to heavy drinkers') and prevalence of those who weekly (men) or monthly (women) drank six or more drinks on a single occasion ('heavy episodic drinkers') (one 'drink' containing 11-13 g ethanol). Logistic models were used to test differences across population subgroups in the changes in drinking.
RESULTS: Following the reduction of alcohol prices in 2004, drinking increased among men and women aged 45-64. Among men, both moderate to heavy drinking and heavy episodic drinking increased in the lowest educational group. Among women, moderate to heavy drinking increased mostly in the lowest and intermediate educational groups, while the highest increases for heavy episodic drinking were in the intermediate and highest female educational groups.
CONCLUSION: Alcohol consumption increased especially among those aged 45-64 and among lower educated people following the reduction in alcohol prices in 2004 in Finland."
20164811,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20164811/,"PURPOSE: Evidence of the effect of leisure time physical activity (LTPA) modes on the motor abilities of a mature population is scarce. The purpose of this study was to compare the motor abilities of physically active and inactive men and women and to examine the associations of different exercise modes and former and recent LTPA (R-LTPA) with motor ability and various physical tests.
METHODS: The LTPA of the participants (men n = 69, women n = 79; aged 41-47 yr) was ascertained by a modified Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire, including questions on the frequency, duration, and intensity of R-LTPA and former LTPA and on exercise modes. Motor abilities in terms of balance, agility, and coordination were assessed with a battery of nine tests supplemented with five physical fitness tests. Multiple statistical methods were used in analyses that were conducted separately for men and women.
RESULTS: The MET-hours per week of R-LTPA correlated statistically significantly with the tests of agility and static balance (rs = -0.28, P = 0.022; rs = -0.25, P = 0.043, respectively) among men and with the static balance (rs = 0.41), 2-km walking (rs = 0.36), step squat (rs = 0.36) (P < or = 0.001, respectively), and static back endurance (rs = 0.25, P = 0.024) among women. In the stepwise regression among men, the most frequent statistically significant predictor was the playing of several games. For women, a history of LTPA for more than 3 yr was the strongest predictor for good results in almost all tests.
CONCLUSIONS: Participants with long-term and regular LTPA had better motor performance, and especially a variety of games improve components of motor ability. Diverse, regular, and long-term exercise including both specific training and general activity develops both motor abilities and physical fitness."
20167434,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20167434/,"AIMS: Research suggests that diagnostic orphans (i.e., individuals experiencing only 1-2 criteria for DSM-IV alcohol dependence) may be at increased risk for developing more severe alcohol problems. This study aimed to: (i) investigate the course of diagnostic orphans in the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), and (ii) explore whether a specific symptom endorsement pattern(s) could identify diagnostic orphans at Wave 1 who remitted or progressed to alcohol dependence at Wave 2.
METHODS: Current drinkers (n = 15,751) were divided into diagnostic groups at Waves 1 and 2: no-alcohol use disorder (AUD); one-criterion orphans, two-criterion orphans, alcohol abuse, or alcohol dependence. Multinomial logistic regression analysis explored the association between diagnostic status at Wave 1 and Wave 2. Chi-square tests investigated differences in the criteria endorsement patterns of diagnostic orphans.
RESULTS: Compared to the no-AUD group, one-criterion orphans at Wave 1 were twice as likely to be in the abuse group and four times more likely to be dependent at Wave 2. Two-criterion orphans were three times more likely to be in the abuse group and eight times more likely to have progressed to dependence. Criterion endorsement patterns of diagnostic orphans at baseline did not significantly differentiate between those who remitted and those who progressed to dependence at follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Like previous research, diagnostic orphans are at increased for developing to more severe alcohol problems. Relying solely on the DSM-IV AUD diagnostic criteria, however, may not be sufficient to identify those diagnostic orphans who are at risk for progressing to dependence."

However, in last few years several pieces of evidence question this such assumption, suggesting that the sexual state of A. fumigatus may still be undiscovered. These investigations have finally led to the recent discovery of a teleomorph stage of A. fumigatus, which has been named Neosartorya fumigata.
AIMS: To review the most important findings on A. fumigatus sexuality and discuss the possible implications of such findings on its pathogenicity.
METHODS: A bibliographic search was performed to find the main works that study the sexuality of fungal pathogens and, especially, of A. fumigatus. Moreover, data from our recent investigations in this field were also introduced to the discussion.
RESULTS: The existence of a teleomorph for A. fumigatus could have significant clinical repercussions, as sexual reproduction might produce offspring with increased virulence and/or resistance to antifungal agents. In this sense, the results of our investigations suggest the existence of an association between the MAT1-1 mating type and the invasiveness of A. fumigatus isolates.
CONCLUSIONS: The study of the sexual reproduction of the fungal pathogens and its possible relationship with virulence will continue to be a topic of interest during the next years, not only because of its basic interest, but also for the possible clinical repercussions."
20167592,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20167592/,"BACKGROUND: The rate of new contrast-enhancing lesions (CELs) on monthly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans has been shown to decrease over a 9-month period in placebo-treated patients with relapsing-remitting (RR) multiple sclerosis (RRMS).
OBJECTIVE: We examined this phenomenon in placebo-treated secondary progressive MS (SPMS) patients.
METHODS: Patients were chosen from two clinical trials. Monthly scans were taken at screening, baseline and months 1-9 for Cohort-1 and months 1-6 for Cohort-2. We examined the monthly new CEL rates according to initial CEL level: 0, 1-3, >3 CELs at screening, and presence and absence of pre-study relapses.
RESULTS: Respectively, 59, 21 and 14 of the 94 Cohort-1 patients, and 36, 17 and 9 of the 62 Cohort-2 patients had 0, 1-3 and >3 initial CELs. For Cohort-1, the monthly new CEL rates did not change during follow-up, regardless of initial CEL level. For Cohort-2, the monthly rate was unchanged in the 0 initial CEL subgroup, but decreased 33% (95% confidence interval: 8%, 52%) from months 1-3 to months 4-6 in the other two subgroups. For the combined cohorts, a decreasing rate was observed in the 12 patients with >3 initial CELs and pre-study relapses.
CONCLUSIONS: The short-term trend of new CEL activity in placebo-treated SPMS patients may vary across cohorts."
20168194,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20168194/,"BACKGROUND: : Caregivers (CGs) of heart failure (HF) patients are increasingly assuming greater responsibilities in symptom assessment, evaluation, and decision making and may be asked to serve as proxies. The purpose of this study was to examine the degree of congruence between HF patients and their primary CG on symptom assessment and self-care management behaviors.
METHODS: : The sample consisted of 70 HF patients receiving home healthcare and their designated CG. Patients were primarily between 40 and 85 years of age and female (60%). Caregivers were predominately female (76%) and spouses (43%). Congruence in symptom assessment and management between HF patients and their designated CGs was measured in this descriptive cross-sectional study using the Heart Failure Symptom Survey and Self-care of Heart Failure Index.
RESULTS: : The Spearman correlation coefficient and concordance correlation coefficient were used to assess the degree of congruence on symptom evaluation scores from the Heart Failure Symptom Survey. Dyads had the strongest correlations on ratings of the HF patients' symptoms of extremity edema, difficulty concentrating, and dizziness. Lower congruence (Spearman correlation <0.40) was found on feeling depressed, shortness of breath at night, and shortness of breath when lying down. Scores on the Self-care of Heart Failure Index self-care management and self-care confidence scales were not significantly different within the HF dyads.
CONCLUSIONS: : Based on moderate levels of correlations on most HF symptoms in this study, the CG as proxy appears to be a reasonable substitute for patient responses in a community setting. However, greater family preparation for symptom assessment is warranted to improve congruence for future symptom assessment."
20169114,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20169114/,"BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that cost sharing (i.e.,copayments and deductibles) decreases health expenditures but also reduces essential care. Value-based insurance design (VBID) has been proposed to encourage essential care while controlling health expenditures. Our objective was to estimate the impact of broader diffusion of VBID on US health care benefits and costs.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used a published computer simulation of costs and life expectancy gains from US health care to estimate the impact of broader diffusion of VBID. Two scenarios were analyzed: (1) applying VBID solely to pharmacy benefits and (2) applying VBID to both pharmacy benefits and other health care services (e.g., devices). We assumed that cost sharing would be eliminated for high-value services (<$100,000 per life-year), would remain unchanged for intermediate- or unknown-value services ($100,000-$300,000 per life-year or unknown), and would be increased for low-value services (>$300,000 per life-year). All costs are provided in 2003 US dollars. Our simulation estimated that approximately 60% of health expenditures in the US are spent on low-value services, 20% are spent on intermediate-value services, and 20% are spent on high-value services. Correspondingly, the vast majority (80%) of health expenditures would have cost sharing that is impacted by VBID. With prevailing patterns of cost sharing, health care conferred 4.70 life-years at a per-capita annual expenditure of US$5,688. Broader diffusion of VBID to pharmaceuticals increased the benefit conferred by health care by 0.03 to 0.05 additional life-years, without increasing costs and without increasing out-of-pocket payments. Broader diffusion of VBID to other health care services could increase the benefit conferred by health care by 0.24 to 0.44 additional life-years, also without increasing costs and without increasing overall out-of-pocket payments. Among those without health insurance, using cost saving from VBID to subsidize insurance coverage would increase the benefit conferred by health care by 1.21 life-years, a 31% increase.
CONCLUSION: Broader diffusion of VBID may amplify benefits from US health care without increasing health expenditures."
20169365,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20169365/,"BACKGROUND: Safety and efficacy of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for esophageal neoplasias have not been adequately investigated in elderly patients. This study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ESD for esophageal neoplasias in elderly patients.
METHODS: Fifty-three superficial esophageal neoplasias treated with ESD using a combination of small-caliber-tip transparent hood and flex knife from May 2006 to June 2009 were divided into elderly group (aged 70 years or older: 25 lesions in 23 patients) and nonelderly group (younger than aged 70 years: 28 lesions in 25 patients). Therapeutic efficacy, complications, and follow-up results were evaluated retrospectively.
RESULTS: The history of cerebral infarction or cardiopulmonary disease and the usage of antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants were significantly higher in elderly group (p 0.0050 and p 0.0013, respectively). Median procedural times in the elderly group and the nonelderly group were 93 ± 53 (range, 42-235) min and 95 ± 55 (range, 40-230) min (p 0.73), respectively. Median sizes of the neoplasias and the resected specimens were 14 ± 11 (range, 5-45) mm and 15 ± 17 (range, 5-83) mm (p 0.56), and 35 ± 12 (range, 18-60) mm and 38 ± 17 (range, 18-90) mm (p 0.38), respectively. En bloc resection rate was 100% in each group. Body temperature and white blood cell counts of the next day after ESD were significantly higher in the nonelderly group than in the elderly group (p 0.0087 and p 0.0043, respectively). There were no complications, such as postoperative bleeding or perforation, in each group. The median follow-up period of 23 ± 10 (range, 4-35) months in the elderly group revealed no local or distant metastasis.
CONCLUSIONS: ESD with a combination of small-caliber-tip transparent hood and flex knife is a safe and effective treatment for superficial esophageal neoplasia in elderly and nonelderly patients."
20169461,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20169461/,"BACKGROUND: Recent studies have suggested that mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) may offer advantages over intravenous cyclophosphamide (IVC) for the treatment of lupus nephritis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of MMF compared with IVC in the induction therapy of proliferative lupus nephritis.
METHODS: We randomly assigned 47 patients with newly diagnosed active proliferative lupus nephritis class III or IV to open-label oral MMF 2 g/day for 6 months or intravenous cyclophosphamide 0.5-1 g/m(2) monthly for 6 months in addition to corticosteroids.
RESULTS: In the intention-to-treat analysis, 14 of the 24 patients (58.33%) receiving MMF and 12 of the 23 patients receiving cyclophosphamide (52.17%) had remission (P = 0.48); complete remission occurred in 6 of the 24 patients (25%) and 5 of the 23 patients (21.74%), respectively (P = 0.53). Improvements in packed cell volume, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies titer (anti-dsDNA), serum complement, proteinuria, urinary activity, renal function, serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor alpha concentration and the systemic lupus activity measure score were similar in both groups. Two patients assigned to MMF and another patient assigned to IVC developed end-stage renal failure with commencement of dialysis. Adverse events were similar. Major infections occurred in two patients in each group. There was no difference in gastrointestinal side effects, but more diarrhea occurred in those receiving MMF.
CONCLUSION: In this 24-week trial, MMF or IVC combined with corticosteroids demonstrated equal efficacy in inducing remission of proliferative lupus nephritis."
20169464,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20169464/,"OBJECT: Increases in low-frequency fluctuations (LFF, 0.01-0.1 Hz) of BOLD fMRI signal were observed during sedation and sleep. We tested the hypothesis that sedation-induced LFF increases may be mediated by increased head motion likely associated with these brain states.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty healthy volunteers were scanned in resting-state baseline and (15 thereof) in midazolam sedation condition. After standard preprocessing, LFF power was computed from average time series from 14 ROIs representing 5 functional networks (visual, motor, auditory, default mode, dorsal attentional). We assessed the effects of sedation on LFF and indirect effects of head motion (mean relative displacement) using mediation analysis.
RESULTS: Sedation increased LFF power with the indirect effect of motion on sedation-induced LFF significant for all networks. Global mean corrected data showed similar but weaker results: significant total effect for auditory, motor and visual; significant mediation for auditory and motor networks. Motion was strongly correlated with LFF even at baseline. Reported results were significant at p < 0.05.
CONCLUSION: The study confirms that conscious sedation induces LFF increase, but demonstrates that this effect is mediated by increased head motion. Hence, caution in design and interpretation is recommended for studies comparing subjects or conditions differently predisposing to head motion."

20170277,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20170277/,"PURPOSE: To explore how patients with persistent unexplained pain interpret and utilise the biopsychosocial model. This might have an impact on the outcome from treatment programmes that adopts a biopsychosocial approach.
METHOD: We conducted three interviews with 20 patients attending a pain management programme for persistent unexplained back pain; prior to attending the course, immediately following the course and at 1 year. We used the methods of grounded theory.
RESULTS: Patients battled through several dialectic tensions in an attempt to legitimise their pain: First, patients wanted a medical diagnosis but also recognised that psychosocial factors contributed to their pain. Second, although the outward appearance of pain was important to legitimacy, it was also important not to appear 'too ill'. Third, meeting others with unexplained pain reinforced credibility, but patients also described how they were not 'like the others'. Finally, although holding on to one's self was important, patients also described an acceptance of loss.
CONCLUSIONS: These dialectic tensions are likely to have an impact on a person's decision to embrace the biopsychosocial model, and might therefore effect their outcome. Health care professionals should be sensitive to the cultural ambiguity of patients with persistent unexplained pain."
20170311,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20170311/,"OBJECT: Intracranial monitoring for temporal lobe seizure localization to differentiate neocortical from mesial temporal onset seizures requires both neocortical subdural grids and hippocampal depth electrode implantation. There are 2 basic techniques for hippocampal depth electrode implantation. This first technique uses a stereotactically guided 8-contact depth electrode directed along the long axis of the hippocampus to the amygdala via an occipital bur hole. The second technique involves direct placement of 2 or 3 4-contact depth electrodes perpendicular to the temporal lobe through the middle temporal gyrus and overlying subdural grid. The purpose of this study was to determine whether one technique was superior to the other by examining monitoring success and complications.
METHODS: Between 1997 and 2005, 41 patients underwent invasive seizure monitoring with both temporal subdural grids and depth electrodes placed in 2 ways. Patients in Group A underwent the first technique, and patients in Group B underwent the second technique.
RESULTS: Group A consisted of 26 patients and Group B 15 patients. There were no statistically significant differences between Groups A and B regarding demographics, monitoring duration, seizure localization, or outcome (Engel classification). There was a statistically significant difference at the point in time at which these techniques were used: Group A represented more patients earlier in the series than Group B (p < 0.05). The complication rate attributable to the grids and depth electrodes was 0% in each group. It was more likely that the depth electrodes were placed through the grid if there was a prior resection and the patient was undergoing a new evaluation (p < 0.05). Furthermore, Group A procedures took significantly longer than Group B procedures.
CONCLUSIONS: In this patient series, there was no difference in efficacy of monitoring, complications, or outcome between hippocampal depth electrodes placed laterally through temporal grids or using an occipital bur hole stereotactic approach. Placement of the depth electrodes perpendicularly through the grids and middle temporal gyrus is technically more practical because multiple head positions and redraping are unnecessary, resulting in shorter operative times with comparable results."
20170318,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20170318/,"BACKGROUND: Eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP) has been widely investigated in the clinical practice as a potential biomarker for asthma. However, there are conflicting data concerning its validity in other respiratory disorders.
METHODS: Serum ECP levels were retrospectively analyzed in 441 patients (227 males and 214 females) suffering from respiratory disease and visited for the first time, and in 33 healthy subjects (17 males and 16 females).
RESULTS: The mean of ECP was significantly higher (p = .0001) in patients compared with healthy volunteers. No correlation was found between serum ECP value and peripheral eosinophil absolute number (p = .881; r = .007). The predictive model was significant only for asthma, with a sensitivity of 70% and a specificity of 74% (efficiency 73%).
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that serum ECP may be considered a marker for identifying only asthmatic patients with an efficiency of 73% and is not useful for the differentiation of other respiratory disorders."
20170515,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20170515/,"INTRODUCTION: Prediction of optimal cytoreduction in patients with advanced epithelial ovarian caner preoperatively.
METHODS: Patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer who underwent surgery for the first time from Jan. to June 2008 at gynecologic oncology ward of TUMS (Tehran University of Medical Sciences) were eligible for this study. The possibility of predicting primary optimal cytoreduction considering multiple variables was evaluated. Variables were peritoneal carcinomatosis, serum CA125, ascites, pleural effusion, physical status and imaging findings.Univariate comparisons of patients underwent suboptimal cytoreduction carried out using Fisher's exact test for each of the potential predictors. The wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare variables between patients with optimal versus suboptimal cytoreduction.
RESULTS: 41 patients met study inclusion criteria. Statistically significant association was noted between peritoneal carcinomatosis and suboptimal cytoreduction. There were no statistically significant differences between physical status, pleural effusion, imaging findings, serum CA125 and ascites of individuals with optimal cytoreduction compared to those with suboptimal cytoreduction.
CONCLUSIONS: Because of small populations in our study the results are not reproducible in alternate populations. Only the patient who is most unlikely to undergo optimal cytoreduction should be offered neoadjuvant chemotherapy, unless her medical condition renders her unsuitable for primary surgery."
20170531,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20170531/,"BACKGROUND: Both giardiasis and zinc deficiency are serious health problems worldwide. In Mexico, the prevalence of G. intestinalis was estimated at 32% in 1994. It remains a health problem in northwestern Mexico. Recent surveys (1987, 1995, and 1999) reported zinc deficiency in the Mexican population. The association of giardiasis and malabsorption of micronutrients has been well documented, although the association with zinc remains controversial. This study investigated the association between giardiasis and zinc deficiency in schoolchildren from northwestern Mexico.
METHODS: We combined a cross-sectional design with a longitudinal follow-up six months after parasite treatment. The baseline sample consisted of 114 schoolchildren (mean age 8.8 yr) from seven suburban public schools, grouped as Giardia-free (n = 65, 57%) and Giardia-infected (n = 49, 43%). Three stool analyses per child were done using Faust's method. Children with giardiasis received secnidazole. Serum zinc was determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Height and weight were measured. Socioeconomic information was obtained in an oral questionnaire, and daily zinc intake was assessed using 24 hour-recalls. Pearson's correlation and ANCOVA and paired t-test analyses were used to determine the association between giardiasis and zinc status.
RESULTS: Longitudinal analysis demonstrated a significant increase of the mean serum zinc levels in the Giardia-infected group six months after treatment (13.78 vs. 19.24 mumol/L mumol/L; p = 0.001), although no difference was found between the Giardia-free and the Giardia-infected groups (p = 0.86) in the baseline analysis. Z scores for W/A and H/A were lower in the Giardia-infected than in the Giardia-free group (p < 0.05). No difference was observed in the socioeconomic characteristics and mean daily intakes of zinc between the groups (p > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Giardiasis may be a risk factor for zinc deficiency in schoolchildren from northwestern Mexico."
20170532,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20170532/,"BACKGROUND: Diffuse alveolar haemorrhage (DAH) has been rarely reported in association with pulmonary infections.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 43 year old immunocompetent man presenting with dyspnoea, fever and haemoptysis. Chest imaging showed bilateral ground glass opacities. Microbiological and molecular tests were positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and treatment with isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide was successful. In this case the diagnosis of DAH relies on clinical, radiological and endoscopic findings. Routine blood tests documented the presence of anticardiolipin antibodies. In the reported case the diagnostic criteria of antiphospholipid syndrome were not fulfilled.
CONCLUSIONS: The transient presence of anticardiolipin antibodies in association with an unusual clinical presentation of pulmonary tuberculosis is intriguing although a causal relationship cannot be established."
20170553,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20170553/,"BACKGROUND: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) has witnessed dramatic treatment advances over the past decade. However, with the exception of epoprostenol, data from short-term randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have not shown a benefit of these drugs on survival. There remains a need to differentiate between available therapies and current endpoint responses which in turn, could be used to guide treatment selection and provide long-term prognostic information for patients.
METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search of MEDLINE and EMBASE databases for RCTs of PAH-specific therapy published between January 1980 and May 2009. Articles were selected if they contained a placebo comparator and described hemodynamic changes from baseline. We applied the weighted mean change in hemodynamic variables to the equation developed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Registry to estimate long-term survival with each therapy.
RESULTS: Ten RCTs involving 1,635 patients met the inclusion criteria. Suitable hemodynamic data were identified for bosentan, sitaxentan, sildenafil, epoprostenol, beraprost and treprostinil. 77.6% of patients were female and the mean (SD) age was 46.5 +/- 4.9 years. 55.5% of patients had idiopathic PAH (iPAH), 23.9% PAH related to connective tissue disease, and 18.2% PAH related to congenital heart disease. Based on the effects observed in short-term trials and, relative to placebo, all analyzed therapies improved survival. The estimated 1-year survival was 78.4%, 77.8%, 76.1%, 75.8%, 75.2%, and 74.1% for epoprostenol, bosentan, treprostinil, sitaxentan, sildenafil, and beraprost, respectively. These estimates are considerably lower than the 1-year observed survival reported in several open-label and registry studies with PAH-specific therapies: 88% - 97%.
CONCLUSION: When applied to the NIH Registry equation, hemodynamic changes from baseline appear to underestimate the survival benefits observed with long-term PAH therapy."
20170585,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20170585/,"BACKGROUND: Cognitive training (CT) may be effective as a therapeutic strategy to prevent cognitive decline in older adults. This review evaluates CT as a preventive tool at various stages of a prevention hierarchy with specific reference to healthy older adults, ""at risk"" and clinical populations. It also considers the underlying mechanism of CT, namely that which suggests that CT acts via promoting neuroplasticity.
METHODS: Evidence for CT in healthy, ""at risk"" and clinical populations has been systematically reviewed elsewhere. This review re-examines several studies in each group to clarify the potential of CT as a preventive technique, with a key focus on the secondary level of prevention.
RESULTS: Studies in healthy older adults and those with mild cognitive impairment are largely positive and suggest that CT has the potential to improve cognition. However, findings in relation to Alzheimer's disease are mixed. Limitations of existing research include diverse methodologies and CT programs, small samples, insufficient focus on functional outcomes, sustainability and generalization of effects and the need for imaging data to delineate mechanisms of change. Additionally, there is limited data on those with late-life depression, despite this being an independent risk factor for dementia.
CONCLUSIONS: CT offers promise as a preventive therapeutic technique in healthy older adults and particularly as a secondary prevention method for ""at risk"" groups. Future investigations need to focus on methodological constraints and delineating possible neuroplastic mechanisms of action. Nonetheless, CT programs may represent a viable, non-pharmacological early intervention strategy, as they are easily-implemented, engaging and promote social interaction in group settings."
20170601,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20170601/,"BACKGROUND: Academic buoyancy is students' ability to successfully deal with setbacks and challenges that are typical of academic life. The present study extends previous preliminary cross-sectional work that tentatively identified five motivational predictors of academic buoyancy - referred to as the '5Cs' of academic buoyancy: confidence (self-efficacy), coordination (planning), commitment (persistence), composure (low anxiety), and control (low uncertain control).
AIMS: The study seeks to more clearly ascertain the effects of motivation (and its mediating role) on academic buoyancy over and above prior academic buoyancy.
SAMPLE: The study comprised N=1,866 high school students from six schools.
METHOD: Longitudinal data were collected (1 year apart) and the hypothesized model exploring longitudinal effects was tested using structural equation modelling.
RESULTS: After controlling for prior variance in academic buoyancy, the 5Cs were significant predictors of subsequent academic buoyancy. Furthermore, over and above the direct effects of prior academic buoyancy on subsequent academic buoyancy, the 5Cs significantly mediated this relationship.
CONCLUSIONS: The study concludes with a discussion of the substantive, applied, and methodological implications for researchers and practitioners seeking to investigate and address the academic buoyancy of students who require the capacity to effectively function in an ever-challenging school environment."
20170991,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20170991/,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with lymphoedema cholestasis syndrome 1/Aagenaes Syndrome need a fat reduced diet when cholestatic. We wanted to assess the need for dietary counselling outside cholestatic episodes, and hypothetized that no counselling was needed.
METHODS: Fifteen patients above 10 years of age without symptoms of cholestasis were compared with a sex and age matched control group. Diet from a four-day weighed record and blood samples were compared between the two groups and with general Norwegian recommendations.
RESULTS: The patients had a similar diet to the healthy controls, except for statistically significant lower intake of energy from total fat (p=0.04) and saturated fat (0.02), and fish (0.05). The patients met the dietary recommendations for macronutrients, except for saturated fat, monounsaturated fat, refined sugar and fibre. Supplements were needed to meet the micronutrient recommendations. Patients had a significantly lower serum level of alpha-tocopherol (0.01) compared with the control group, and the serum 25-OH D level was below reference ranges.
CONCLUSIONS: The patients would benefit from counselling on fat quality, carbohydrates including fibre intake, and individual needs for vitamins D and E. To secure serum 25-OH D and alpha-tocopherol levels within reference ranges, regular examinations to determine the need for supplementary vitamins D and E are recommended."

AIM: To evaluate the ability of Laser Doppler Imaging (LDI) to predict burn wound outcome in paediatric patients prior to and after 48 h from the time of injury.
METHODS: A prospective evaluation was performed in 400 children over a 12-month period that presented to our burns clinic. Patients were divided into two groups: those that presented within 48 h of injury (n=160) and those that presented after 48 h (n=240). Patients were reviewed until healing had occurred or operative intervention was required.
RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 2.4 years (range 0.1-15.9 years). For patients who presented within 48 h, the sensitivity and specificity of the LDI was 78% and 74% respectively compared to 75% and 85% for those scanned after 48 h. This difference was not statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: LDI predicted burn wound outcome in children within 48 h of the burn wound. Moderate degrees of movement, infection, whether first aid was administered and type of dressing did not impact on the accuracy of LDI."
20171558,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20171558/,"PURPOSE: Synthetic mesh has revolutionized abdominal wall hernia repair. However, mesh infections present a clinical problem because the standard practice of surgical excision is fraught with increased morbidity. Here, single-institutional outcomes in managing mesh-related collections via percutaneous drainage are retrospectively reviewed to assess its effectiveness.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 21 patients underwent drainage of perimesh collections. Three types of mesh were employed: polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE; n = 5), polypropylene (n = 14), and porcine dermal collagen (n = 3). One patient received both polypropylene and PTFE. Drainage was performed with ultrasound guidance (n = 19) or surgical drain exchange (n = 2). Mesh type, culture results, fluid collection size, and location were analyzed with respect to need for mesh excision.
RESULTS: Sixteen of 21 patients (76%) were successfully treated with drainage. One required additional surgical capsulectomy; the mesh was salvaged. Four required mesh excision because of recurrent infection (n = 2) or lack of improvement of clinical course (n = 2). Recurrent infection occurred in six patients, with mesh salvage via conservative management or new drainage in four. Fluid cultures were positive in 68% of patients (n = 13), with Staphylococcus aureus the most common organism. Cultures did not predict mesh excision (P = .26). The PTFE excision rate trended higher compared with polypropylene (40% vs 14%; P = .27). No porcine dermal collagen mesh was excised. Neither fluid collection size nor location predicted mesh excision. Mean follow-up was 319 days (range, 6-1,406 d).
CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous drainage of suspected mesh-related abscess is effective. The use of PTFE mesh trended toward a higher excision rate."
20171694,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20171694/,"PURPOSE: Traditionally, diagnosis and treatment plans for Peyronie's disease have been based on history and physical examination. Penile ultrasound provides rapid, anatomical information to establish disease severity, and to monitor progression and response to medical therapy. We determined the relationship between ultrasound characteristics and progression to surgical intervention in men with Peyronie's disease.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 518 patients with Peyronie's disease. Patients completed a Peyronie's disease specific questionnaire detailing medical history, health related behaviors and Peyronie's disease characteristics, and underwent sonographic evaluation of the penis. Measurements of subtunical calcifications, septal fibrosis, tunical thickening (tunica thickness greater than 2 mm) and intracavernous fibrosis were made. Progression to surgery was determined from the medical record.
RESULTS: In this cohort (mean patient age 53.8 years, range 20 to 78) 31% of patients had calcifications, 50% had tunical thickening, 20% had septal fibrosis and 15% had intracavernous fibrosis. Overall 25% of the cohort progressed to surgical intervention after an average followup of 1.25 years (range 0 to 7.6). Patients who underwent surgery were more likely to have subtunical calcifications present at the first clinic visit (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.16-2.62). No other sonographic characteristics were associated with progression to surgery. After adjustment for age, marital status, degree of curvature, additional penile deformity, difficulty with penetration, ability to have intercourse and prior treatment for Peyronie's disease, calcifications were strongly associated with progression to surgery (OR 2.75, 95% CI 1.25-3.45).
CONCLUSIONS: In a large cohort of patients with Peyronie's disease the presence of sonographically detected sub-tunical calcifications during the initial office evaluation was independently associated with subsequent surgical intervention."
20171745,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20171745/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine if restrictions of postoperative diet concerning hard food and hot drinks as well as excessive physical exertion influence recovery during 14 days after T&A surgery.
METHODS: 800 patients aged 3-13 years (median 6) underwent curette adenoidectomy with or without scissors tonsillotomy. 413 adenoidectomies and 387 adenotonsillotomies were performed. Caregivers of the children completed a questionnaire reporting their child's postoperative activity, diet, pain level, peak and duration, episodes of nausea and fever, medication and caregivers' satisfaction scores. The children were enrolled to food and effort restricted (FER), food non-restricted (FnR), effort non-restricted (EnR), and food and effort non-restricted (FEnR) groups at the end of follow-up.
RESULTS: Two hemorrhages requiring repeat surgery under general anesthesia in FER group and 42 mild episodes of spontaneously subsiding bleeding from nose or mouth occurred. More than one episodes of hemorrhage were observed in other 8 individuals (total incidence of hemorrhages 9.7%). No hemorrhages were noted in the FEnR and FnR groups. There were 23 (4.4%) participants with episodes of bleeding, among them 21 mild hemorrhages, in the FER group and 21 (12.0%) in the EnR group (p<0.001). Peak pain level was lowest in FEnR group (p<0.001) and indications for antibiotics most frequent in FnR group (p<0.001). Parental satisfaction level was highest in FnR and FEnR groups (p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of caregivers reported care of children after T&A surgery according to the instructions. Most frequently disobeyed instructions were those concerning physical exertion. Diet and activity restrictions seem to influence postoperative recovery. Parental satisfaction scores were highest in non-restricted groups."
20171795,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20171795/,"PURPOSE: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) generally induces significant changes in the pathologic extent of disease. This potential down-staging challenges the standard indications of adjuvant radiation therapy. We assessed the utility of lymph node irradiation (LNI) in breast cancer (BC) patients with pathologic N0 status (pN0) after NAC and breast-conserving surgery (BCS).
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Among 1,054 BC patients treated with NAC in our institution between 1990 and 2004, 248 patients with clinical N0 or N1 to N2 lymph node status at diagnosis had pN0 status after NAC and BCS. Cox regression analysis was used to identify factors influencing locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRR-FS), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS).
RESULTS: All 248 patients underwent breast irradiation, and 158 patients (63.7%) also received LNI. With a median follow-up of 88 months, the 5-year LRR-FS and OS rates were respectively 89.4% and 88.7% with LNI and 86.2% and 92% without LNI (no significant difference). Survival was poorer among patients who did not have a pathologic complete primary tumor response (hazard ratio, 3.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-7.99) and in patients with N1 to N2 clinical status at diagnosis (hazard ratio = 2.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.15-4.36). LNI did not significantly affect survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Relative to combined breast and local lymph node irradiation, isolated breast irradiation does not appear to be associated with a higher risk of locoregional relapse or death among cN0 to cN2 breast cancer patients with pN0 status after NAC. These results need to be confirmed in a prospective study."
20171799,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20171799/,"PURPOSE: To examine the relationship between lymphovascular invasion (LVI) and regional nodal failure (RNF) in breast cancer patients with zero to three positive nodes treated with breast-conservation therapy (BCT).
METHODS AND MATERIALS: The records of 1,257 breast cancer patients with zero to three positive lymph nodes were reviewed. All patients were treated with BCT at Massachusetts General Hospital from 1980 to December 2003. Lymphovascular invasion was diagnosed by hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections and in some cases supported by immunohistochemical stains. Regional nodal failure was defined as recurrence in the ipsilateral supraclavicular, axillary, or internal mammary lymph nodes. Regional nodal failure was diagnosed by clinical and/or radiologic examination.
RESULTS: The median follow-up was 8 years (range, 0.1-21 years). Lymphovascular invasion was present in 211 patients (17%). In univariate analysis, patients with LVI had a higher rate of RNF (3.32% vs. 1.15%; p = 0.02). In multivariate analysis, only tumor size, grade, and local failure were significant predictors of RNF (p = 0.049, 0.013, and 0.0001, respectively), whereas LVI did not show a significant relationship with RNF (hazard ratio = 2.07; 95% CI, 0.8-5.5; p = 0.143). The presence of LVI in the T2/3 population did not increase the risk of RNF over that for those with no LVI (p = 0.15). In addition, patients with Grade 3 tumors and positive LVI did not have a higher risk of RNF than those without LVI (p = 0.96).
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that LVI can not be used as a sole indicator for regional nodal irradiation in breast cancer patients with zero to three positive lymph nodes treated with BCT."
20171812,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20171812/,"PURPOSE: To describe the MRI appearances of squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal before and after chemoradiation and to assess whether MRI features predict for clinical outcome.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty-five patients (15 male, 20 female; mean age 60.8 years) with histologically proven squamous cell cancer of the anal canal underwent MRI before and 6-8 weeks after definitive chemoradiation. Images were reviewed retrospectively by two radiologists in consensus blinded to clinical outcome: tumor size, signal intensity, extent, and TNM stage were recorded. Following treatment, patients were defined as responders by T and N downstaging and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Final clinical outcome was determined by imaging and case note review: patients were divided into (1) disease-free and (2) with relapse and compared using appropriate univariate methods to identify imaging predictors; statistical significance was at 5%.
RESULTS: The majority of tumors were ≤T2 (23/35; 65.7%) and N0 (21/35; 60%), mean size 3.75 cm, and hyperintense (++ to +++, 24/35 patients; 68%). Following chemoradiation, there was a size reduction in all cases (mean 73.3%) and a reduction in signal intensity in 26/35 patients (74.2%). The majority of patients were classified as responders (26/35 (74.2%) patients by T and N downstaging; and 30/35 (85.7%) patients by RECIST). At a median follow-up of 33.5 months, 25 patients (71.4%) remained disease-free; 10 patients (28.6%) had locoregional or metastatic disease. Univariate analysis showed that no individual MRI features were predictive of eventual outcome.
CONCLUSION: Early assessment of response by MRI at 6-8 weeks is unhelpful in predicting future clinical outcome."
20171847,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20171847/,"BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia patients and their relatives show aberrant functional connectivity in default network regions (DRs) such as the medial prefrontal, lateral temporal, cingulate and inferior parietal cortices and executive regions such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Gray-matter volumetric alterations may be related to these functional connectivity deficits. Also, gray-matter volume inter-regional correlations may reflect altered inter-regional functional connectivity.
AIMS: To examine our prediction of alterations of gray-matter volumes and inter-regional volume correlations for DRs and the DLPFC in offspring of schizophrenia patients (OS).
METHODS: We assessed 64 adolescent and young adult OS and 80 healthy controls (HC) using T1-MRI. Regional gray-matter volumes and inter-regional volume correlations between the DRs and between the DLPFC and DRs on each side were compared across groups.
RESULTS: Compared to HC, OS had reductions in several DRs and the DLPFC after controlling age, gender, and intra-cranial volume, and correcting for multiple comparisons. OS had stronger (more positive) gray-matter volume inter-correlations between DRs and between DRs and the DLPFC.
CONCLUSIONS: Volumetric deficits in the default network and in the DLPFC may be related to familial diathesis in schizophrenia and to functional connectivity abnormalities in those at familial risk. Increased inter-correlations between DRs and between DR and DLPFC gray-matter volumes may serve as surrogate indices of abnormal functional connectivity."
20172152,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20172152/,"BACKGROUND: Debate remains about the relative prognostic importance of the histologic subtype of malignant pleural mesothelioma.
METHODS: From a prospective database, the details of 312 malignant pleural mesothelioma surgical patients were reviewed. A comparison was made of the survival from the three major cell types.
RESULTS: One hundred ninety-five patients underwent radical surgery, and 117 underwent nonradical surgery. Final histologic subtype was epithelioid in 218 patients, biphasic in 66 patients, and sarcomatoid in 28 patients. The median survival was 15.3 months in the epithelioid group, 10.1 months in the biphasic group, and 5.0 months in the sarcomatoid group. On univariate analysis in the epithelioid group, age (p = 0.005), International Mesothelioma Interest Group stage (p = 0.001), radicality of the procedure (p = 0.001), leukocytosis (p = 0.016), and preoperative or postoperative chemotherapy (p = 0.012) were significant prognostic factors influencing postoperative survival. In the biphasic group, preoperative anemia was the only significant factor (p = 0.007). In sarcomatoid patients, International Mesothelioma Interest Group stage and radicality of the surgical procedure were significant prognostic variables (p = 0.012 and p = 0.015, respectively). Multivariate analysis in the epithelioid group identified International Mesothelioma Interest Group stage (p = 0.001), radicality of the procedure (p = 0.008), and preoperative or postoperative chemotherapy (p = 0.007) as significant prognostic factors, whereas in the sarcomatoid group, only the International Mesothelioma Interest Group stage (p = 0.012) was significant and the radicality of surgery had no effect.
CONCLUSIONS: The extremely poor prognosis of sarcomatoid malignant pleural mesothelioma is independent of the extent of surgery unlike other cell types. Patients with sarcomatoid histology should therefore be considered separately in trials evaluating radical procedures and adjuvant treatment. The treatment of biphasic pleural mesothelioma remains debatable."
20172301,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20172301/,"INTRODUCTION: In November 2007, a legislative initiative regarding the presumed consent for organ donation was proposed for parliamentary debate in Romania and was followed by public debate. The study aimed to asses public opinions expressed in the Romanian media.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: An Internet search was made. The pro and con reasons, the affiliation of parts involved in the debate and suggested future direction of action were identified.
RESULTS: The Internet search had 8572 results. The parts involved in the pro and con debate consisted of governmental structures, physicians, ethicists, politicians, media, religious authorities, nongovernmental associations, and lay persons. The main pros were the low rate of organ donation and the long waiting lists, enhancement of organ procurement, avoidance of wasting valuable organs, avoiding responsibility, and the stress imposed to the family in giving the donation consent, humanitarian purposes (saving lives), going along with the scientific progress, and less bureaucracy. The main cons were an unethical issue, violation of human rights, denial of brain death, unethical advantage of public ignorance, unethical use of underprivileged people, little results in terms of organ procurement, but huge negative effects on public opinion, public mistrust in transplant programs and impossibility of refusal identification due to particularities of the Romanian medical system.
CONCLUSION: The con opinions prevailed. For the moment, Romania seems to be unprepared to accept presumed consent. A future change in public perception regarding organ transplantation may modify the terms of a public debate."
20172533,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20172533/,"OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the dopamine receptor D4 gene (DRD4) exon III VNTR moderates the risk of infants with regulatory disorders for developing attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) later in childhood.
STUDY DESIGN: In a prospective longitudinal study of children at risk for later psychopathology, 300 participants were assessed for regulatory problems in infancy, DRD4 genotype, and ADHD symptoms and diagnoses from childhood to adolescence. To examine a potential moderating effect on ADHD measures, linear and logistic regressions were computed. Models were fit for the main effects of the DRD4 genotype (presence or absence of the 7r allele) and regulatory problems (presence or absence), with the addition of the interaction term. All models were controlled for sex, family adversity, and obstetric risk status.
RESULTS: In children without the DRD4-7r allele, a history of regulatory problems in infancy was unrelated to later ADHD. But in children with regulatory problems in infancy, the additional presence of the DRD4-7r allele increased the risk for ADHD in childhood.
CONCLUSIONS: The DRD4 genotype seems to moderate the association between regulatory problems in infancy and later ADHD. A replication study is needed before further conclusions can be drawn, however."
20172561,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20172561/,"PURPOSE: In a prospective 2-center study we confirmed and extended published results of the positive effect on post-prostatectomy stress incontinence of transobturator sling suspension using an Advance male sling.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From September 2007 to June 2008 a male sling was placed and evaluated in 36 men according to the Rehder and Gozzi method. Diagnosis was based on 24-hour urine loss measured by a pad test, a 24-hour micturition frequency volume chart and cystoscopy. A visual analog scale for continence and bother, and a pad test were used preoperatively and postoperatively to objectively evaluate operative results.
RESULTS: At 1-year followup cure was achieved in 9.0% of patients and improvement was achieved in 45.5%. No effect on incontinence was seen in 36.5% of patients and 9.0% experienced worsening incontinence by pad test. The mean +/- SD visual analogue scale score of 6.1 +/- 2.2 (range 0 to 10) preoperatively improved significantly to 4.6 +/- 3.0 at 3 months (p = 0.024) and not significantly to 4.9 +/- 3.1 by 1 year postoperatively (p = 0.39). Improved incontinence did not correlate with patient age or incontinence severity. Complications developed in 2 patients, including sling infection and postoperative urinary retention in 1 each.
CONCLUSIONS: The transobturator sling suspension operation is a minimally invasive, safe procedure for male postoperative stress incontinence. Significantly improved continence was not observed on pad test but significant improvement in continence and bother was seen on the visual analog scale at 3 months."
20172886,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20172886/,"BACKGROUND: A project sponsored by the University Health System Consortium has addressed the inaccuracy and high variability across institutions concerning the use of the failure to rescue (FTR) quality indicator defined by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). Results indicated that of the complications identified by the quality indicator, 29.5% were pre-existing upon hospital admission.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study was to investigate the possible bias to FTR measures by including cases of complications that were pre-existing at admission.
METHODS: Hospital discharges between 1 January 1996 and 30 September 2007 were retrospectively gathered from administrative databases. Using definitions outlined by the AHRQ and the National Quality Forum (NQF), FTR rates were calculated. Using present on admission coding, FTR rates were recalculated to differentiate between the rates of pre-existing and that of acquired cases.
RESULTS: Using the AHRQ definition, the overall FTR rate was 11.60%. The FTR rate for patients with pre-existing complications was 8.85%, whereas patients with complications acquired during hospitalisation had an FTR rate of 18.46% (p<0.001). The NQF FTR rate was 9.93%. Pre-existing and acquired FTR rates using the NQF measure were 9.42% and 12.77%, respectively (p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Current definitions of FTR measures meant to identify inhospital complications appear biased by the inclusion of problems at admission. Furthermore, many patients with these complications are excluded from the algorithms. When taking into account the timing of the ""complications"", these measures can be useful for internal quality control. However, it should be stressed that the usefulness of the measures to compare institutions will be dependent on coding practices of institutions. Validation using chart review may be required."
20172893,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20172893/,"BACKGROUND: Systematic flexible bronchoscopy is advocated in the initial management of childhood pulmonary tuberculosis.
METHODS: Our aim was to describe and to compare the systematic flexible bronchoscopy findings of 53 children (6.5 + or - 4.4 years; 52.8% boys) with active pulmonary tuberculosis to their initial clinical and radiological (chest x-ray, n=53; CT, n=45) features in an 11-year retrospective study.
RESULTS: Flexible bronchoscopy was normal in 51% of cases. A severe tracheobronchial involvement (extrinsic compression >50% or obstructive endoluminal mass >25% of the lumen) was found in 10 patients. Flexible bronchoscopy guided therapy in 13 cases (steroids n=12, bronchoscopic extraction of a granuloma n=1) and permitted isolation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in three patients (5.7%). No useful information was obtained by flexible bronchoscopy in 73.5% of cases. No correlation was found between flexible bronchoscopy findings and clinical features or x-ray findings. Conversely, a strong correlation was found between severe bronchoscopic involvement and tracheobronchial luminal narrowing on CT. The CT negative predictive value was 100% (95% CI 91% to 100%). Based on CT results, flexible bronchoscopy could have been avoided in about 60% of our patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Flexible bronchoscopy remains a very relevant tool in the diagnostic and therapeutic management of childhood pulmonary tuberculosis but resulted in treatment modification or microbiological proof in a minority of our patients. We propose that flexible bronchoscopy in children with pulmonary tuberculosis be limited to those who show tracheobronchial luminal narrowing on an initial CT scan."
20173368,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20173368/,"OBJECTIVE: We aim to determine if urine cytology was still necessary as a routine part of the evaluation for the presence of urological malignancy and to evaluate its cost effectiveness.
METHODS: Urine cytology reports over a 6-year period (2000-2005) were retrieved from our institution's pathology department database. Patients with urine cytology positive for malignant cells were identified. We retrospectively reviewed the charts of these patients for age, sex, flexible cystoscopy and radiological imaging results. The cost of urine cytology was retrieved from the pathology department.
RESULTS: There were a total of 2,568 urine cytological examinations. Of these, 25 were positive for malignant cells. There were 19 male (76%) and 6 female (24%) patients with a mean age of 72 years (range: 49-97). In 21 patients with positive cytology, a bladder tumor was identified at flexible cystoscopy and/or imaging studies. For a positive cytology yield of 1%, EUR 210,000 was spent.
CONCLUSIONS: Routine urine cytology was not cost effective and did not add to the diagnostic yield beyond cystoscopy and diagnostic imaging. It may be omitted in the initial evaluation of urological malignancy."
20173373,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20173373/,"OBJECTIVE: Air Force pilots are subjected to acceleration (G) forces with a known effect upon the vascular system. Specific training and anti-G maneuvers are used to counteract this effect, and allow pilots to operate at the limits of human endurance. The objective of the present study is to determine whether acceleration affects the incidence of varicocele.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The incidence of varicocele during training in 234 Air Force pilots was assessed. Height, weight, BMI and testicular volume were recorded for every participant. A group of 35 pilots with an absence of varicocele, randomly selected, acted as the control group.
RESULTS: Left-sided varicocele was confirmed in 23 (9.8%) pilots. Affected pilots tended to be taller (p = 0.073) and had a smaller mean left testicular volume (p < 0.001) than the control group. Eight cases (35%) were grade I, 10 (43%) were grade II, and 5 (22%) were grade III. For grades I and II, there was a trend for the testicular volume to decrease (p = 0.349 and 0.067, respectively). In grade III varicocele, this difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of varicocele in fighter pilots during training is not higher than in other groups of the same age. Affected individuals tend to be taller, with ipsilateral testicular hypotrophy."
20173445,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20173445/,"BACKGROUND: During myocardial perfusion imaging with Tc-99m sestamibi, intestinal and hepatic radiotracer activity commonly interfere with visualization of the inferior wall of the myocardium leading to difficulties in interpretation. This study was undertaken to assess if carbonated lime drink ingestion prior to imaging prevents the said interference and improves the quality of images.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study group comprised 33 consecutive patients including 26 males (age range: 30-80 years) and 7 females (42-62 years) who were referred for myocardial perfusion imaging. Of 33 patients, 21 (18 males, 3 females) were imaged at rest, 5 patients (3 males, 2 females) underwent physical stress, and 7 patients (5 males, 2 females) had pharmacological stress with adenosine. Five to 10 minutes after intravenous injection of 296 to 444 MBq (8-12 mCi) Tc-99m MIBI, anterior, and left anterior oblique (LAO) 45 degree planar views were acquired with a gamma camera using LEHR collimator. Each view was acquired for 100 seconds in a 256 x 256 matrix in all patients. Thereafter each patient was administered about 250 mL of a carbonated lime drink and repeat views were acquired within 5 minutes with the same parameters. Quantitative assessment of counts in the inferior wall of myocardium (M) to those in adjacent abdomen (A) was performed on both pre- and postintervention studies by drawing an ROI of about 50 +/- 5 pixels. M/A ratios were recorded for each patient in both the groups. The student t test was performed to evaluate the significance of difference between pre- and postintervention images. P < 0.05 was considered significant. All patients underwent myocardial perfusion single photon emission computed tomography.
RESULTS: It was found that the inferior wall of the myocardium was better visualized, and there was no interference from gut or hepatic tracer activity in postintervention planar and single photon emission computed tomography reconstructed views as compared with preintervention images in all patients. The M/A ratio expressed as mean +/- SD was significantly higher in the postintervention group, viz. 2.19 +/- 0.71 in the anterior and 2.07 +/- 0.70 in the LAO45 views as compared with those of preintervention values of 1.50 +/- 0.59 in the anterior and 1.41 +/- 0.49 in the LAO 45 views, respectively (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: We conclude that intake of carbonated lime drink is a simple and an effective technique to improve the image quality of the inferior wall of the myocardium on myocardial perfusion imaging with Tc-99m MIBI. This technique may also help in reducing the time interval between injection of radiotracer and imaging, which is otherwise delayed in routine practice."
20173469,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20173469/,"PURPOSE: Preoperative chemoradiotherapy can lead to pathologic complete response of rectal cancer. This study was designed to determine the relationship between postchemoradiotherapy pathologic T stage (ypT stage) and nodal metastases and to evaluate whether pathologic complete response of the primary tumor results in sterilization of mesorectal lymph nodes.
METHODS: Clinicopathological data from 1997 to 2007 of a prospectively maintained colorectal cancer database were examined. Inclusion criteria were patients with extraperitoneal rectal cancer who underwent preoperative chemoradiotherapy and subsequent radical resection. Statistical analysis was performed by use of Kruskall-Wallis and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests.
RESULTS: Two hundred forty-two patients were identified (73.1% male, median age, 57 y (range, 36-85 y)). Data regarding preoperative chemoradiotherapy were available for 177 patients (73.1%). The median dose of radiotherapy was 5040 cGy (3060-6100 cGy). The mean preoperative radiotherapy dose and interval between chemoradiotherapy and surgery are similar when stratified by ypT stage (P = .55 and P = .72, respectively). Low anterior resection was performed in 174 patients (71.6%), and the remainder underwent abdominoperineal resection. A mural pathologic complete response was achieved in 62 patients (25.6%). In this pathologic complete-response group, positive lymph nodes were found in 2 patients (3.2%). The rate of metastatic lymph nodes increased as ypT stage increased (ypT1 = 11.1%, ypT2 = 29.2%, ypT3 = 37.3%).
CONCLUSION: Patients with a mural pathologic complete response have a low rate of positive lymph nodes. These findings may have implications for the management strategies of these patients, including the use of local resection or a watch-and-wait policy. When the response to chemoradiotherapy is not complete, radical surgery should remain the treatment based on high rates of lymph node involvement."
20173478,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20173478/,"UNLABELLED: The surgical circumferential resection margin in total mesorectal excision surgery is defined by the relationship of the tumor to the mesorectal fascia. Patients with anticipated tumor invasion of the mesorectal fascia receive neoadjuvant therapy to downstage/downsize the tumor and to obtain tumor-free resection margins.Tumor relationship to the mesorectal fascia is accurately determined by MRI. Compared with MRI, multidetector-row computed tomography is more widely available, faster, less costly, and provides the ability to simultaneously assess the liver, peritoneum, and retroperitoneum for metastases.
PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to compare the accuracy of multidetector-row CT with conventional MRI in diagnosis of rectal cancer invasion of the mesorectal fascial envelope.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: During a 2-year period, all patients were enrolled in this study who had biopsy-proven rectal carcinoma and were referred, as a part of the routine preoperative staging workup, for a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis and also an MRI of the pelvis.All examinations were reviewed independently by 2 radiologists who were blinded from one another, from the findings of the other modality, and from clinical information. Both observers were dedicated abdominal radiologists who are experienced in reading pelvic CT and MRI. Categorical agreement between MRI and multidetector-row CT for all the evaluated parameters of the tumor position, mesorectal fascia, and lymph nodes, as well as the interobserver agreement between CT and MRI, was determined by the intraclass correlation weighted kappa statistic to measure the data set's consistency.
RESULTS: Among the study's 92 patients, the tumor characteristics suggested by multidetector-row CT agreed with those of MRI, with a weighted kappa ranging from 0.488 to 0.748 for the first reader and 0.577 to 0.800 for the second reader. Interobserver agreement ranged from 0.506 to 0.746.Agreement regarding mesorectal fascia characteristics differed significantly between multidetector-row CT and MRI, depending on the level of assessment. In the distal rectum, agreement was 0.207 for the first reader and 0.385 for the second reader. In the mid rectum, agreement was 0.420 and 0.527, respectively, and in the proximal rectum agreement was 0.508 and 0.520. Interobserver agreement was 0.737 at the distal level and 0.700 at the mid and proximal levels. Agreement regarding measurement of the distance from the tumor to the mesorectal fascia was 0.425 for the first reader and 0.723 for the second reader, with interobserver agreement of 0.766. Agreement in assessment of the number of lymph nodes ranged from 0.743 to 0.787 for the first reader and 0.754 to 0.840 for the second reader. Interobserver agreement ranged from 0.779 to 0.841. Agreement in assessment of the size of the lymph nodes ranged from 0.540 to 0.830 for the first reader and 0.850 to 0.940 for the second reader. Interobserver agreement ranged from 0.900 to 0.920. Agreement in assessment of the distance from nodes to the mesorectal fascia was 0.320 for the first reader and 0.401 for the second reader, with interobserver agreement of 0.950.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study differ from previously published data by demonstrating substantial agreement between readers in multidetector-row CT assessment of the tumor, mesorectal fascia, and lymph nodes. With the exceptions of mesorectal fascia in the distal rectum and the distance from the nodes to mesorectal fascia, other evaluated parameters were assessed with moderate and substantial agreement between multidetector-row CT and MRI. However, our findings suggest that multidetector-row CT does not correlate well enough with MRI findings to replace it in rectal cancer staging."
20173482,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20173482/,"PURPOSE: The severity and most appropriate treatment of diverticulitis in young patients are still controversial. The aim of this study is to compare young patients (<or=50 years) with older patients (>50 years) regarding clinical and radiologic parameters of acute left colonic diverticulitis and to determine whether differences exist in presentation and treatment.
METHODS: We reviewed medical records of 271 consecutive patients with left colonic acute diverticulitis admitted to our institution from 2001 through 2004: 71 patients were aged 50 years or younger and 200 patients were older than 50. Clinical and radiologic parameters were analyzed. Conservative treatment was standardized, and included antibiotic therapy and bowel rest. Criteria for emergency surgical treatment were diffuse peritonitis, pneumoperitoneum, and septic shock.
RESULTS: Conservative treatment alone was successful in 64 patients (90.1%) in the younger group and in 152 patients (76%) in the older group (P = .017). The percentage of patients requiring surgery at admission or during the hospital stay was significantly lower in younger than in older patients (5.6% vs 20.5%, P = .007), and the percentage of patients requiring emergency end colostomy was higher (although not significantly) in the older group (1.4% vs 9.0%, P = .059). No differences in rate of successful conservative treatment were observed between patients with a first episode and those with recurrence in either age group (P = .941 in the younger group; P = .227 in the older group).
CONCLUSION: Young age is not a predictive factor of poor outcome in the management of first or recurrent episodes of acute diverticulitis. Patients older than 50 years more frequently need emergency surgical treatment."
20173618,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20173618/,"INTRODUCTION: Laparoscopy is rapidly emerging as the preferred surgical approach to a number of different diseases because it permits a correct diagnosis and accurate treatment; however, it is not yet being applied in a widespread manner in the management of benign or malignant colorectal disease. The aim of this work is to illustrate retrospectively the results of our experience of laparoscopic colorectal surgery carried out in a community hospital over the last 5 years to document its feasibility, safety, and benefits when carried out by general surgeons in this setting.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between January 2003 and December 2007 a total of 628 patients underwent a colorectal procedure. Among them, 328 (52.2%) were operated on with a laparoscopic approach.
RESULTS: In 12 cases, we had to convert to the open approach. Major complications occurred in 3.6% whereas minor occurrences occurred in up to 10%.
CONCLUSIONS: Even if limited by its retrospective design, our experience exhibits that the laparoscopic may well be a safe and effective approach to colon pathology in a community hospital setting. Such features make laparoscopy a challenging alternative to open surgery in the approach to colon disease and it can be proven to be cost-effective without undue risk, as long adequate laparoscopic training is undertaken by the surgeon and proper preparation observed."
20174998,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20174998/,"PURPOSE: Developments in electronic data collection methods have allowed researchers to generate larger datasets at lower costs, but relatively little is known about the comparative performance of the new methods. This paper considers the comparability of two modes of administration (face-to-face and remote electronic) for the time trade-off.
METHOD: Data were collected from a convenience sample of adults (n = 135) randomised to either a face-to-face time trade-off or a remote electronic tool. Patterns of responses were considered. For each sample, standard regression analysis was undertaken to generate a valuation set, which were then contrasted.
RESULTS: The pattern of responses differed by mode of administration, with the electronic tool yielding larger standard deviations and higher proportions of responses at -1, 0 and 1. The impact of this on the regression was difficult to disentangle from the high variability around individual scores of states, which is a common feature of responses to time trade-off tasks. Under the scoring algorithms generated by mode of administration, the difference between scores exceeded 0.1 for 100 of the 243 EQ-5D health states.
CONCLUSIONS: This comparison demonstrates that variability arising from mode of administration needs to be considered in developing health state valuations. While electronic administration has considerable cost advantages, particular attention to the design of the task is required. This has wider implications, as all modes of administration may have mode-specific impacts on the distribution of valuation responses."
20175026,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20175026/,"OBJECTIVE: Improvements in microneurosurgical techniques, radiotherapy and chemotherapy for the treatment of high grade gliomas resulted in better local tumor control and longer progression-free survival. Multicentric (MC) lesions located distant from the initial resection area contribute to treatment failure in a growing number of patients. These MC lesions may develop within the course of the disease (metachronous) or may already be present at the time of first tumor manifestation (synchronous). To look for mechanisms and regular patterns behind MC glioma manifestations and to investigate whether they are ""a second primary tumor"" or the result of continuous diffuse glioblastoma cell invasion, we retrospectively analyzed the initial and all follow-up MR studies of our high grade glioma (HGG) patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: MR studies of 247 consecutive patients treated for HGG at a single institution were analyzed. MC tumor manifestation was defined as more than one gadolinium enhancing lesion within the brain on MRI without a connecting signal alteration in T2 sequences and/or without a connecting hypointense mass in T1 sequences. The minimal distance to define two solitary lesions was set at >10 mm. According to these specifications 40 patients showed MC tumor manifestations in their MR studies on admission or during treatment of their disease. The MR studies of these cases were retrospectively analyzed for patterns in MC tumor manifestation and progression. Topographical specifications and delay in manifestation were used to explain possible pathways of development. Kaplan Meyer survival graphs for metachronous and synchronous MC disease were calculated.
RESULTS: 24 patients showed MC tumor manifestation at the time of admission. 16 cases developed MC manifestation within a follow-up period of 3-57 months. The location of all lesions could be categorized into one of three distinct patterns (white matter, subependymal, intraventricular). The patterns showed individual and location-specific time gaps to metachronous manifestation. Calculated from the time of first tumor diagnosis, the median survival was longer for patients with metachronous MC lesions (353 days, p<0.05) compared to patients with synchronous MC lesions (110 days) or patients without multicentricity (234 days). Patients with metachronous lesions showed a similar survival (72 days) as patients with synchronous MC lesions (110 days) once they developed MC disease.
CONCLUSION: The topographical patterns and temporal characteristics of MC disease suggest that all manifestations share common mechanisms such as an active migratory process. Our data therefore do not support the concept of an independent MC development of multiple gliomas."
20175282,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20175282/,"PURPOSE: A pulsus parvus et tardus of the carotid artery, i.e., a small weak pulse with a delayed systolic peak, is a well-recognized clinical finding of aortic stenosis (AS). However, the diagnostic value of radial arterial pressure curves has not been specifically investigated. In this study, we investigated whether the radial arterial curves of patients with AS had distinguishable characteristics.
METHODS: We studied 17 AS patients (valve area less than 0.8 cm2) and 17 control patients. The durations for the following intervals were measured, from the ECG-R to the beginning of the arterial pressure wave upstroke (PTT(Up)), from the ECG-R to the peak of the arterial pressure (PTT(peak)), and the difference between PTT(peak) and PTT(Up) (T(Upstroke)).
RESULTS: The radial arterial pulse pressures did not differ significantly, indicating absence of a pulsus paruvus in the radial pressure of the AS patients. The PTT(Up) and PTT(peak) in the AS patients were 134 +/- 18 and 337 +/- 44 ms, respectively, while these values in the control patients were 143 +/- 21 and 286 +/- 64 ms. As a result of the differences in PTT(Up) and PTT(peak), the T(Upstroke) in the AS patients was greater than that in the control patients. The T(Upstroke) cutoff point that gave the maximal sensitivity (0.93) and specificity (0.65) was 156 ms.
CONCLUSION: Our study using the radial arterial curve validated a pulsus tardus as a diagnostic sign for severe AS, while the validity of a pulsus parvus as a diagnostic sign was not confirmed."
20175773,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20175773/,"PROBLEM: To compare the prevalence of 112T>C point mutations among women experiencing RPL with fertile control women.
METHOD OF STUDY: Buccal swabs were obtained from 232 individuals: 136 with a history of >or=2 abortions, 37 with at least 2 live births and 59 with a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). DNA was extracted and PCR amplification of Apo E codons was performed.
RESULTS: The allelic frequency of a cytosine at position 112 was 11.4% (31/272) among patients experiencing RPL, compared with a frequency of 5.4% (4/74) among the fertile controls (P = 0.19) and 19.5% (23/118) among individuals with a history of DVT. However, significantly more E3/E4 and E4/E4 genotypes were seen among individuals experiencing RPL and DVT than fertile controls (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Apo E4 codon 112C point mutation is, by itself, not associated with an elevated risk of recurrent pregnancy loss, but rather codon 112C in association with codon 158C is a risk factor for RPL."
20175800,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20175800/,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the influence of levodopa on swallowing dysfunction in Parkinson's disease patients.
METHODS: A systematic review of the literature and a meta-analysis were performed. All studies referring to levodopa and swallowing dysfunction that provided direct data or data that could be transformed into mean +/- standard deviation were considered for analysis. The primary efficacy variables were Oral Transit Time (OTT), Pharyngeal Transit Time (PTT) for both thin fluids and solids, and aspiration.
RESULTS: Seven studies describing swallowing functions in PD patients using levodopa were found, and five of these matched the inclusion criteria. No clinically meaningful improvement after levodopa intake was noted. Adverse effects were not reported by the authors.
CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis shows that levodopa intake was not associated with an improvement of swallowing dysfunction in Parkinson's disease patients."
20175902,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20175902/,"BACKGROUND: The strongest causal evidence that customary spanking increases antisocial behavior is based on prospective studies that control statistically for initial antisocial differences. None of those studies have investigated alternative disciplinary tactics that parents could use instead of spanking, however. Further, the small effects in those studies could be artifactual due to residual confounding, reflecting child effects on the frequency of all disciplinary tactics. This study re-analyzes the strongest causal evidence against customary spanking and uses these same methods to determine whether alternative disciplinary tactics are more effective in reducing antisocial behavior.
METHODS: This study re-analyzed a study by Straus et al.1 on spanking and antisocial behavior using a sample of 785 children who were 6 to 9 years old in the 1988 cohort of the American National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. The comprehensiveness and reliability of the covariate measure of initial antisocial behavior were varied to test for residual confounding. All analyses were repeated for grounding, privilege removal, and sending children to their room, and for psychotherapy. To account for covarying use of disciplinary tactics, the analyses were redone first for the 73% who had reported using at least one discipline tactic and second by controlling for usage of other disciplinary tactics and psychotherapy.
RESULTS: The apparently adverse effect of spanking on antisocial behavior was replicated using the original trichotomous covariate for initial antisocial behavior. A similar pattern of adverse effects was shown for grounding and psychotherapy and partially for the other two disciplinary tactics. All of these effects became non-significant after controlling for latent comprehensive measures of externalizing behavior problems.
CONCLUSIONS: These results are consistent with residual confounding, a statistical artifact that makes all corrective actions by parents and psychologists appear to increase children's antisocial behavior due to child effects on parents. Improved research methods are needed to discriminate between effective vs. counterproductive implementations of disciplinary tactics. How and when disciplinary tactics are used may be more important than which type of tactic is used."
20175924,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20175924/,"BACKGROUND: Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is a condition in which excessive levels of bacteria, mainly the colonic-type species are present in the small intestine. Recent data suggest that SIBO may contribute to the pathophysiology of Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The purpose of this study was to identify potential predictors of SIBO in patients with IBS.
METHODS: Adults with IBS based on Rome II criteria who had predominance of bloating and flatulence underwent a glucose breath test (GBT) to determine the presence of SIBO. Breath samples were obtained at baseline and at 30, 45, 60, 75 and 90 minutes after ingestion of 50 g of glucose dissolved in 150 mL of water. Results of the glucose breath test, which measures hydrogen and methane levels in the breath, were considered positive for SIBO if 1) the hydrogen or methane peak was >20 ppm when the baseline was <10 ppm, or 2) the hydrogen or methane peak increased by 12 ppm when baseline was >or=10 ppm.
RESULTS: Ninety-eight patients were identified who underwent a GBT (mean age, 49 y; 78% female). Thirty-five patients (36%) had a positive GBT result suggestive of SIBO. A positive GBT result was more likely in patients >55 years of age (odds ratio [OR], 3.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-9.0) and in females (OR, 4.0; 95% CI, 1.1-14.5). Hydrogen was detected more frequently in patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS (OR, 8; 95% CI, 1.4-45), and methane was the main gas detected in patients with constipation-predominant IBS (OR, 8; 95% CI, 1.3-44). There was no significant correlation between the presence of SIBO and the predominant bowel pattern or concurrent use of tegaserod, proton pump inhibitors, or opiate analgesics.
CONCLUSIONS: Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth was present in a sizeable percentage of patients with IBS with predominance of bloating and flatulence. Older age and female sex were predictors of SIBO in patients with IBS. Identification of possible predictors of SIBO in patients with IBS could aid in the development of successful treatment plans."
20176210,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20176210/,"OBJECTIVE: Although the surgical result of conventional aortic arch replacement has been improved with sophisticated techniques, it is still a deeply invasive procedure. On the other hand, advanced age has been reported as a factor of increased morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery. The number of octogenarians, however, is steadily increasing. The aim of this study is to analyze the outcome of aortic arch surgery in octogenarians.
METHODS: From January 1995 to September 2007, 113 octogenarians and 1 nonagenarian underwent aortic arch replacement (mean age, 83.0 +/- 2.5; 60 men) in our institute. All patients underwent surgery under hypothermic circulatory arrest. The lowest body temperature during circulatory arrest was below 22 degrees C until 2001 and 28 degrees C after 2002. Antegrade selective cerebral perfusion or retrograde cerebral perfusion was used as an additional brain protection technique. Emergency operations were performed in 37 (32.5%) patients; of them, 28 (75.7%) were for acute aortic dissection. Seventy-four (64.9%) patients underwent total arch aortic replacement and the other 40 (35.1%), hemiarch aortic replacement. Concomitant operations consisted of aortic root replacement in 1 patient, aortic valve replacement in 4, and coronary artery bypass grafting in 25.
RESULTS: The average duration of circulatory arrest, myocardial ischemic time, and pump time was 57 +/- 21, 123 +/- 45, and 224 +/- 80 minutes, respectively. The total hospital mortality was 7.9% (9/114), 5.2% (4/77) for elective operations and 13.5% (5/37) for emergency operations (P = .12). The hospital mortality was 19.2% (5/26) until 2001 and decreased to 4.5% (4/88) after 2002 (P = .015). Eleven (9.6%) of the 114 patients had a perioperative stroke, and 8 (7.0%) had transient neurologic dysfunction. Other complications were respiratory failure in 17 (14.9%) patients, bleeding in 6 (5.3%), gastrointestinal tract problems in 3 (2.6%), and mediastinitis in 1 (8.8%) patient. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was a multivariate predictor (P < .05) of hospital death and emergency operation was a predictor of perioperative stroke. The postoperative 1-year survival was 84.8%, the 3-year survival was 68.5%, and the 5-year survival was 58.1%.
CONCLUSIONS: The outcome of conventional aortic arch surgery in octogenarians is improving. The operations were performed with an acceptable operative risk even under emergency situations, including acute aortic dissection. The conventional surgical option for aortic arch diseases should not be abandoned only because of the high chronologic age of the patient."
20176456,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20176456/,"OBJECTIVE: To examine how online depression support group members respond to direct-to-consumer (DTC) antidepressant advertising.
METHODS: Survey of 148 depression forum members, administered via an online questionnaire.
RESULTS: Chronicity was high, as 79.1% had received a diagnosis of depression 3 or more years earlier. Respondents reported seeing advertisements for an average of 4.3 of seven brands investigated. A majority rated the information quality of these advertisements as ""poor"" or ""fair."" Attitudes toward antidepressant advertisements were neutral (mean: 2.96 on a five-point scale). More than half (52.4%) visited official websites provided in these advertisements, 39.9% had talked with a doctor after seeing an advertisement, 20.3% made an advertisement-induced prescription request, and 25.7% said these advertisements reminded them to take their antidepressants. Amount of attention given to these advertisements correlated positively with belief in the brain chemical imbalance causal model, but belief in this model did not predict prescription requests.
CONCLUSION: Awareness of DTC antidepressant advertisements is high among individuals with depression, but so is skepticism.
PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Among members of an online support group, these advertisements encourage patient-doctor dialogue, prescription requests, and adherence, but might also reduce the acceptability of psychotherapy and encourage doctor switching in a small number of patients."
20176736,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20176736/,"OBJECTIVE: Current data clearly demonstrate that sports-related chronic repetitive head trauma due to boxing might result in hypopituitarism. However, the mechanism of sports-related traumatic brain injury-induced pituitary dysfunction is still unclear. In order to understand whether autoimmune mechanisms could play a role in the pituitary dysfunction due to sports-related head trauma, we investigated the presence of antipituitary antibodies (APAs) and antihypothalamus antibodies (AHAs) in amateur boxers.
PATIENTS AND DESIGN: Sixty-one actively competing (n=44) or retired (n=17) male boxers (mean age, 26 years; range, 17-53) who had been evaluated regarding pituitary functions previously were included in the study. In all boxers and in 60 age/sex-similar normal controls, AHAs and APAs were investigated by an indirect immunofluorescence method.
RESULTS: AHAs were detected in 13 of 61 boxers (21.3%), and APAs were detected in 14 of 61 boxers (22.9%), but in none of the normal controls. Pituitary dysfunction was significantly higher in AHA-positive boxers (46.2%) than in AHA-negative boxers (10.4%) (P=0.003). There was a significant association between AHA positivity and hypopituitarism due to boxing (odds ratio: 7.37, 95% confidence interval 1.8-30.8). There was no significant association between APA positivity and hypopituitarism.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates for the first time the presence of AHAs and APAs in boxers who were exposed to sports-related head trauma. Moreover, the present investigation provides preliminary evidence that AHAs are associated with the development of pituitary dysfunction in boxers, thus suggesting that autoimmunity may have a role in the pathogenesis."
20177036,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20177036/,"BACKGROUND: Hospitals face increasing pressure to lower cost of care while improving quality of care. It is unclear if efforts to reduce hospital cost of care will adversely affect quality of care or increase downstream inpatient cost of care.
METHODS: We conducted an observational cross-sectional study of US hospitals discharging Medicare patients for congestive heart failure (CHF) or pneumonia in 2006. For each condition, we examined the association between hospital cost of care and the following variables: process quality of care, 30-day mortality rates, readmission rates, and 6-month inpatient cost of care.
RESULTS: Compared with hospitals in the lowest-cost quartile for CHF care, hospitals in the highest-cost quartile had higher quality-of-care scores (89.9% vs 85.5%) and lower mortality for CHF (9.8% vs 10.8%) (P < .001 for both). For pneumonia, the converse was true. Compared with low-cost hospitals, high-cost hospitals had lower quality-of-care scores (85.7% vs 86.6%, P = .002) and higher mortality for pneumonia (11.7% vs 10.9%, P < .001). Low-cost hospitals had similar or slightly higher 30-day readmission rates compared with high-cost hospitals (24.7% vs 22.0%, P < .001 for CHF and 17.9% vs 17.3%, P = .20 for pneumonia). Nevertheless, patients initially seen in low-cost hospitals incurred lower 6-month inpatient cost of care compared with patients initially seen in hospitals with the highest cost of care ($12 715 vs $18 411 for CHF and $10 143 vs $15 138 for pneumonia, P < .001 for both).
CONCLUSIONS: The associations are inconsistent between hospitals' cost of care and quality of care and between hospitals' cost of care and mortality rates. Most evidence did not support the ""penny wise and pound foolish"" hypothesis that low-cost hospitals discharge patients earlier but have higher readmission rates and greater downstream inpatient cost of care."
20177673,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20177673/,"OBJECTIVE: As pasteurization is becoming more widely used in limb salvage reconstruction, more study is required to understand about host-graft junction healing, graft revascularization and incorporation, and the incidence and type of complications among pasteurized autografts. This was mainly achieved by follow-up radiography. We aimed to clarify whether Tc99m bone scanning can be considered a reliable method in determining these three parameters.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-seven osteosarcoma patients with pasteurized autograft reconstructions were retrospectively reviewed using available scintigraphic and radiographic follow-up every 6 months postoperatively for 36 months. Follow-up of the unhealed cases was continued for the maximum follow-up period available for each case beyond the original study period, ranging from 1 to 15 months. Tc99m uptake was classified as cold, faint, moderate and high uptake. Junction healing was classified as none, partial and complete healing.
RESULTS: Seventy percent of junctions united with a mean of 22 months. Ninety to 100% of junctions showed increased uptake (high or moderate) at one time of the study regardless of final outcome. 85% of the pasteurized grafts showed the characteristic ""tramline appearance"". Four grafts (15%) were complicated: pseudoarthrosis and implant failure (1), fractured plate (1), intramedullary nail (IMN) fracture (1), and prosthesis stem loosening in the host bone (1), with underlying unhealed junctions in all cases.
CONCLUSION: Bone scanning can determine the stages of the graft's rim revascularization and incorporation; however, it cannot detect or predict junction healing or occurrence of complications. Supplementary treatment of unhealed junctions showing either decreased junctional uptake or graft quiescence may be warranted. Otherwise, detection of distant metastasis and early local recurrence remains the main application of Tc99m scanning in the management of bone sarcomas."
20177681,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20177681/,"BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal surgery are risk factors for deep venous thrombosis (DVT). The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the effectiveness of standardized prophylactic low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) therapy in patients who underwent surgery for ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Since 1999 all patients operated on for colorectal diseases in our institute have received 4,000 IU/day LMWH from the day of operation to discharge. The complete series of patients who had major colorectal surgery from 1999 until 2006 were reviewed for overt DVT episodes. Furthermore, 60 consecutive patients who were admitted for surgery for IBD were prospectively enrolled in the 2004-2006 period. Each patient underwent venous color Doppler ultrasound scan at admission and at discharge. Demographic data, disease activity, and clotting parameters were collected. Data were analyzed with Spearman's correlation test, multiple regression, and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves analysis.
RESULTS: The rate of DVT in UC patients was significantly higher than in colorectal cancer patients (p = 0.009), and the odds ratio (OR) for postoperative DVT in UC patients was 7.4 (95% CI 1.4-44.4; p = 0.017). Female gender, UC diagnosis, active rectal bleeding, aPTT value, aCL IgM, abeta2 IgM, and pANCA levels significantly correlated with postoperative DVT. At multivariate analysis only aCL IgM levels were found to be independently associated with postoperative DVT (p = 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our study showed that prophylactic therapy with 4,000 IU/day LMWH was not completely effective for the prevention of postoperative DVT in patients with CD, and even less so in those with UC. In these patients, a more tailored prophylactic therapy should be considered, and further randomized controlled trials testing the effectiveness of different prophylactic protocols would be advisable. Furthermore, aCL IgM serum levels might be helpful in identifying IBD patients who are at higher risk of postoperative DVT."
20177683,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20177683/,"BACKGROUND: Resection of primary and liver lesions is the optimal management of Stage IV rectal cancer with liver metastases. For patients with extensive liver metastases, FOLFOX and FOLFIRI have improved resection rates and survival. We compared survival outcomes in patients with Stage IV rectal cancer with liver metastases undergoing staged or synchronous resection with those undergoing primary rectal resection only or no resection at all.
METHODS: Patients with metastatic rectal cancer to liver were identified from a colorectal cancer database from 2002 to 2008. Patients received neoadjuvant chemoradiation and adjuvant FOLFOX or FOLFIRI therapy. The outcomes for patients who underwent synchronous resection, staged resection, resection of rectal tumor only, and no resection with chemotherapy only were compared. Statistical analysis was determined by ANOVA. Survival was determined using the Kaplan-Meier method.
RESULTS: Seventy-four patients were identified: 30 synchronous resections, 13 staged resections, 22 primary resection only, and 9 no resection. Median follow-up was 23 months (range = 4-58 months). Sixty-five percent of patients underwent liver resection with 26% rendered eligible for resection after adjuvant therapy. Those who underwent primary resection only had shorter median survival than those who underwent either staged or synchronous liver resection (31 vs. 47 vs. 46 months, respectively; P = 0.17). Survival was no different for synchronous versus staged resection (P = 0.6). Volume of liver disease predicted resectability (P = 0.001). Without liver resection, 2-year survival was approximately 60%. Palliative surgery was required in six of nine patients who did not undergo resection of their primary tumor.
CONCLUSIONS: Current chemotherapeutic regimens lead to improved survival in patients with unresectable liver metastases. Upfront chemotherapy in the asymptomatic patient compared with resection of the primary tumor does not appear to significantly affect survival. However, given that 60% of patients were alive after 2 years, resection of the primary lesion for palliative reasons and local control must be considered."

The objective of this study was to investigate if racial differences existed in the utilization of home BP monitoring devices.
DESIGN: A voluntary and self-administered survey study.
SETTING: Community pharmacies in the Greater Houston metropolitan areas, Texas, United States.
PARTICIPANTS: Subjects were recruited from community pharmacies if they were aged > or = 18 years and received a prescription drug for hypertension.
INTERVENTIONS: Each participant was given informed consent to complete a survey that consisted of questions about patient demographics and BP self-monitoring behavior.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary measures were the use of home BP monitors and the patient's knowledge of BP monitoring.
RESULTS: A total of 987 pharmacy customers were approached, of whom 834 patients agreed to participate (34.3% African Americans, 33.3% Whites, and 28.9% Hispanics). We found no association between race and BP monitor utilization. Patients with less education and lower income were associated with lesser use of BP monitors (P=.04 and P<.01 respectively). Patients with higher education and higher incomes were more knowledgeable about how to monitor BP at home. (P<.01).
CONCLUSION: This study found that the utilization of BP monitors was not different among races. Patients with lower education level and less income were associated with less home BP monitor use. Further studies to investigate the adherence to home BP monitor use and intervention to overcome barriers to self-monitoring is needed."
20178181,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20178181/,"OBJECTIVES: Examine whether three measures of perceived racial discrimination in health care detect similar rates of discrimination and show similar associations with patients' healthcare experiences.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study involving telephone surveys and medical record reviews.
SETTING: Veterans Affairs Pittsburgh Healthcare System.
PARTICIPANTS: 50 White and 50 African American veterans with diabetes.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Three types of measures of perceived racial discrimination in health care were compared: single-item and multi-item measures assessing personal experiences of discrimination in healthcare settings, and a measure assessing general racism in the healthcare system. Associations of each measure with patient-reported problems with their medical care and receipt of recommended preventive screenings were also explored.
RESULTS: More African American than White veterans reported perceived discrimination on all measures (personal discrimination, single-item: 42% vs 6%, P<.001; personal discrimination, multi-item: 42% vs 18%, P=.01; general racism: 74% vs 40%, P=.001). In the total sample, discrimination was more likely to be reported on the general racism measure than on the single-item (OR=36.53, 95% CI=7.95-167.89) or multi-item measures (OR=20.28, 95% CI=5.12-80.34) of personal discrimination. The multi-item measure of personal discrimination (OR=3.96, 95% CI=1.29-12.18) and general racism measure (OR=3.61, 95% CI=1.34-9.71) were significantly associated with patient-reported problems with their care. Receipt of recommended screenings was not associated with any of the discrimination measures.
CONCLUSIONS: Different measures of perceived racial discrimination in healthcare settings yield different rates of discrimination and show variable associations with patients' perceptions of care."
20178185,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20178185/,"OBJECTIVE: Pressed for time to address competing clinical demands within the brief clinical encounter, primary care clinicians often rely on observations of patients to select topics to address. Use of traditional, complementary, or alternative medicine (TM/CAM) may be an important topic for discussion with a patient, but identification of patients using TM/CAM is problematic. We conducted this study to determine if observable characteristics--among southwestern Hispanic and Native American persons--might suggest to the clinician that a patient is likely to use TM/CAM.
DESIGN: A combination of clinic staff focus groups, patient and clinician interviews, and a clinician focus group was used to explore possible predictors of TM/CAM use among primary care patients in practices serving predominantly Hispanic and Native American communities.
RESULTS: No easily observable characteristics were identified that clinicians might use to predict TM/CAM use in their patients. Less readily observable characteristics--identification with culture, family of origin, health condition--were more likely to be associated with TM/CAM use, but not infallibly so.
CONCLUSIONS: Rather than attempt to predict TM/CAM use by an individual patient, clinicians may be better served by assuming its use by all, by applying strategies for rapid and effective communications with patients about the topic, by selecting which patients to discuss TM/CAM use with based on clinical circumstances, and/or by gathering information about TM/CAM use as part of routine initial database development."

METHODS: Between January 2003 and December 2005 we prospectively enrolled 181 infants born alive between 23 and 32 weeks of gestation; 142 infants (78.5%) completed the follow-up visit. The association between candidate risk factors and delayed motor or mental development (Bayley Scales of Infant Development II; psychomotor or mental developmental index <85) was analysed by means of logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: Low maternal age, smoking in pregnancy, low gestational age, low birth weight, small for gestational age, chronic lung disease, intracerebral haemorrhage, periventricular leucomalacia, and retinopathy of prematurity (stages 3 and 4) all were associated with an increased risk for delayed development (p < 0.05, each). Smoking in pregnancy, small for gestational age and chronic lung disease maintained significance in a multivariable analysis.
CONCLUSION: Smoking in pregnancy emerged as a risk predictor for adverse neurodevelopmental outcome in our study. Strategies to reduce smoking in pregnancy should be further endorsed."
20178535,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20178535/,"AIM: The aim of this study was to examine women's perceptions of their care at the time of unexplained stillbirth, and whether these appear to affect wishes for management in subsequent pregnancy.
METHODS: An Internet-based survey was conducted of women after unexplained stillbirth, seeking information about their perceptions of management, and their wishes for care in a subsequent pregnancy.
RESULTS: One hundred and five completed surveys were included in the study group. Only 18 respondents (17%) reported that the diagnosis was broken in an uncaring way. Twenty respondents (19%) felt 'rushed into making decisions'. Almost all respondents (95%) felt that they were given adequate time with the baby after delivery. Fifty-seven respondents (54%) consented to perinatal autopsy. Most women (93%) wanted additional testing in their next pregnancy, 81% wanted delivery before the due date, but only 26% wanted cesarean delivery next time.
CONCLUSION: Women's perceptions of care at the time of an unexplained stillbirth did not appear to influence their wishes for management in the next pregnancy."
20178694,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20178694/,"OBJECTIVES: Social support for physical activity is reliably associated with regular physical activity, however the social cognitive processes, particularly post-intentional processes, that can explain this link have not been well characterized. In this study, we examined the extent to which the relationship between social support for physical activity and subsequent physical activity can be accounted for by planning processes.
DESIGN AND METHOD: The design was prospective observational and the sample consisted of 903 university students. Participants completed standard theory of planned behaviour, planning, and physical activity measures at 2 time points, approximately 7 weeks apart. A gender stratified multiple mediation model was conducted to test the study hypotheses.
RESULTS: A significant interaction between social support and gender was observed. This indicated that lower levels of social support for physical activity were associated with lower levels of physical activity at Time 2, for women only. In multiple mediation analysis, this was partly explained by the indirect effects of social support through perceived behavioural control and coping planning.
CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the importance of interpersonal processes in understanding the post-intentional social cognitive determinants of regular physical activity. It is likely that planning processes relating to physical activity are often influenced by those in the ongoing immediate social environment who support this behaviour. Future development of theory and interventions should take account of the socially interactive nature of planning processes."
20178723,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20178723/,"BACKGROUND: Predicting bleeding after percutaneous kidney biopsy (PKB) is difficult. The value of Platelet Function Analyzer-100 (PFA-100) is not studied in this setting.
METHODS: We undertook a prospective study of PFA-100 collagen/epinephrine (CEPI) and collagen/adenosine diphosphate (CADP) closure times among 56 participants (35 males and 21 females) undergoing PKB under real-time ultrasound (US) visualization at a tertiary teaching hospital. We collected data on age, sex, weight, height, blood pressure (BP), serum creatinine, random urine protein/creatinine ratio, electrolytes, PT/PTT, complete blood count, administration of desmopressin acetate and renal biopsy characteristics. Major outcomes were hematoma formation on US, packed red blood (PRBC) transfusions and hematuria. Data were analyzed with SPSS 16.
RESULTS: PFA-CEPI was abnormal in 5 (8.93%) and PFA-CADP abnormal in 8 (14.3%) participants. Post-biopsy hematoma formation on US was detected in 11 (19%) participants, 5 (8.9%) had macroscopic hematuria and 4 (7%) required PRBC transfusion. Bleeding events did not correlate with body mass index, baseline BP or with each other. Hematuria and US-observed hematomas did not appear to be clinically relevant. PRBC transfusions showed a significant association with elevated baseline BUN (p = 0.031), creatinine (p = 0.011) and the number of biopsy passes (p = 0.008). PFA-100 CEPI and CADP did not associate with any of the bleeding complications after PKB (p = NS).
CONCLUSIONS: Measuring PFA-100 is unlikely to add to the care of patients undergoing routine PKB. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00334204."
20178724,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20178724/,"INTRODUCTION: Low serum free triiodothyronine (FT3) concentrations have been reported in a high percentage of chronic renal failure patients and have been considered as an independent predictor of mortality in dialysis patients.
OBJECTIVE: Our aim has been to evaluate the prognostic value of FT3 levels for long-term mortality in stable hemodialysis patients surviving at least 12 months.
PATIENTS AND MEASUREMENTS: We retrospectively analyzed 89 stable hemodialysis patients (50 males; mean age 67.9 +/- 11.8 years). All patients had a baseline clinical and analytical evaluation. We analyzed the relationship between baseline FT3 and mortality by means of survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier) and Cox regression analysis.
RESULTS: Mean values of thyroid function test were: thyrotropin (TSH) 2.02 +/- 1.5 microU/ml, free thyroxine (FT4) 1.26 +/- 0.23 ng/dl, and FT3 2.7 +/- 0.4 pg/ml. During a median follow-up time of 33.6 +/- 14.9 (12 - 62) months, 41 patients died. FT3 was similar in patients who died or survived (2.6 +/- 0.5 vs. 2.7 +/- 0.4 pg/ml ns). Kaplan-Meier analysis did not show significant differences in mean survival according to tertiles of FT3. In multivariate Cox regression analysis, FT3 was not a predictor of mortality (RR 0,001; 95% CI; 0.000 to 1.73).
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that low FT3 levels are not predictive for mortality in a subgroup of stable HD patients who could survive more than 12 months."
20178888,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20178888/,"BACKGROUND: Decision making regarding surgical intervention in native valve endocarditis (NVE) is often complex and surgery is withheld in a number of patients either because medical treatment is considered the best treatment or because the risk of operation is considered too high. The objective of this study was to investigate the outcome of surgical treatment and to validate the ability of euroSCORE to predict operative mortality in NVE patients.
METHODS: Prospective cohort study including 323 consecutive NVE patients. Patients were divided into 3 groups based on treatment strategy and indication/contraindication for surgery. The additive and logistic euroSCORE was calculated and the observed and predicted mortality was compared.
RESULTS: Cardiac surgery was associated with a good prognosis, in-hospital and after 12months, compared to conservative treatment. After adjustment for confounders surgery was associated with a survival benefit (hazard ratio (HR) 0.45, 95% CI: 0.27-0.76%; p=0.003). When propensity score was used in regression adjustment, cardiac surgery was still associated with a better outcome after 12months (HR 0.41, 95% CI: 0.25-0.68; p<0.001). Observed mortality for patients receiving surgical treatment was 11% compared to a mean logistic euroSCORE mortality of 16% (NS). The discriminating ability of euroSCORE was good, area under the ROC curve 0.74 (95% CI: 0.64-0.84; p<0.001) logistic model and 0.75 (95% CI: 0.65-0.86; p<0.001) additive model.
CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac surgery was associated with a good prognosis when indicated regardless of euroSCORE, and surgery should only be withheld after thorough consideration. EuroSCORE remains a valuable tool to identify high-risk IE patients when surgery is considered."
20179328,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20179328/,"BACKGROUND: Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) are encouraged to stay active to maintain their mobility. Ambulatory activity monitoring (AM) provides an objective way to determine type and amount of gait-related daily activities.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of a home cueing training program on functional walking activity in PD.
METHODS: In a single-blind, randomized crossover trial, PD patients allocated to early intervention received cueing training for 3 weeks, whereas the late intervention group received training in the following 3 weeks. Training was applied at home, using a prototype cueing device. AM was applied at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 weeks in the patient's home, to record body movements. Postures and motions were classified as percentage of total time spent on (a) static activity, further specified as % sitting and % standing, and (b) % dynamic activity, further specified as % walking, % walking periods exceeding 5 seconds (W>5s) and 10 seconds (W>10s). Random coefficient analysis was applied.
RESULTS: A total of 153 patients participated in this trial. Significant improvements were found for dynamic activity (beta= 4.46; P < .01), static activity (beta=-3.34; P < .01), walking (beta= 4.23; P < .01), W>5s (beta = 2.63; P < .05), and W>10s (beta = 2.90; P < .01). All intervention effects declined significantly at 6 weeks follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Cueing training in PD patients' own home significantly improves the amount of walking as recorded by AM. Treatment effects reduced after the intervention period, pointing to the need for permanent cueing devices and follow-up cueing training."
20179404,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20179404/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) and plasma methionine levels are different in anorexia nervosa restricting type (AN-R) compared to anorexia nervosa binge eating/purging type (AN-BP).
METHODS: Cross-sectional design.
SUBJECTS: Subjects were recruited from the outpatient program of the Eating Disorders Program at St. Paul's Hospital, Vancouver, Canada. All subjects had a current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of mental Disorders - Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) AN-R, or AN-BP diagnosis. Controls were recruited from staff and trainees of Child and Family Research Institute, and Children's and Women's Hospital, University of British Columbia.
RESULTS: Samples were obtained from AN-R (N=30), AN-BP (N=32) and control women (N=73) and men (N=33). The 5- 95th% confidence intervals from the control women were taken as the normal range. The plasma tHcy and methionine for the control group had a 5-95th percentile range of 5.66-10.57 and 15.3-40.2 microM, respectively. Plasma tHcy was elevated in women with AN-BP (9.24+/-0.85 microM, N=32) but not with AN-R (7.90+/-0.38 microM, N=30). Plasma methionine was decreased in women with AN-BP (22.2+/-1.43 microM, N=32) compared to the control group of women (25.1+/-0.89 microM). The plasma methionine/tHcy ratio was elevated in the women with AN-BP (0.50+/-0.09) but not in those with AN-R (0.34+/-0.03).
CONCLUSION: Elevated plasma tHcy and decreased plasma methionine are consistent with impaired homocysteine remethylation. Altered methyl transfer capacity or methyl deficiency could impair monoamine neurotransmitter metabolism potentially impacting cognitive and psychological function.We hypothesize that the treatment of AN-BP should consider the need for nutritional support of methyl metabolism."
20179613,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20179613/,"GOAL: To examine whether endoscopic mucosal clipping prevents probe migration.
BACKGROUND: Ambulatory colonic manometry can provide useful pathophysiologic information regarding colonic motor function. However, probe displacement during prolonged recording can be problematic.
METHODS: Thirty healthy volunteers underwent 24-hour ambulatory colonic manometry with colonoscopic-assisted probe placement, and fluoroscopic confirmation of the location of most proximal sensor at hepatic flexure. Participants were randomized to 2 groups; in 14 participants (m/f=8/6), the probe was anchored to the colonic mucosa using mucosal clips and in 16 participants, (m/f=9/7), the probe was left unattached in the colon. Magnitude of transducer displacement was assessed by fluoroscopic localization. The difference between the number of transducers in each segment at the beginning (x) and at the end (y) of each study was summed up and divided by 2, to calculate the ""displacement score"" and this was taken as the main outcome measure.
RESULTS: In participants without clipping, the mean (s.d.) displacement score was 1.6 (0.9), implying displacement of transducers by 1.6 colonic segments relative to their initial location. In contrast, there was no displacement of transducers in those who received clipping. Clipping caused no adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic mucosal clipping is safe and effective for prevention of probe displacement, and ensures more accurate temporospatial resolution of data for prolonged colonic manometry recording."
20179635,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20179635/,"OBJECTIVE: To test whether glucocorticoids act as the endogenous agonist of cardiac mineralocorticoid receptors, we evaluated the cardiac effects of aldosterone and corticosterone and cardiac steroidogenesis vs. steroid uptake from plasma.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Both corticosterone and aldosterone increased left ventricular pressure in the rat heart. Aldosterone decreased coronary flow, whereas corticosterone increased it. All corticosterone effects were blocked by the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, RU486, and unaltered by the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, canrenoate, or the 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD11B)2 inhibitor, carbenoxolone. Unlike mineralocorticoid receptor blockade, RU486 did not ameliorate postischemia infarct size and arrhythmias. Corticosterone, when added to the perfusion buffer, rapidly accumulated at cardiac tissue sites, reaching steady-state levels that were identical to those in coronary effluent, independently of the presence of aldosterone, RU486 or canrenoate. After stopping the perfusion, cardiac corticosterone fully washed away with a half-life of less than 1 min. Measurements of steroid-synthesizing enzyme gene expression levels in human ventricular and atrial tissue pieces from heart-beating organ donors, patients with end-stage heart failure and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients revealed that under no condition, the human heart was capable of synthesizing aldosterone or cortisol de novo. Yet, expression of HSD11B1, HSD11B2, mineralocorticoid receptors and glucocorticoid receptors was found, and HSD11B2 and mineralocorticoid receptors were upregulated in pathological conditions. Moreover, aldosterone reduced cardiac inotropy in a Na/K/2Cl cotransporter-dependent manner.
CONCLUSION: Both cortisol/corticosterone and aldosterone accumulate in the cardiac interstitium. The presence of HSD11B2 and mineralocorticoid receptors/glucocorticoid receptors at cardiac tissue sites allows both steroids to exert their effects via separate mechanisms."
20179659,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20179659/,"OBJECTIVE: Bilateral lower cervical paraspinous intramuscular bupivacaine injections have recently been reported as a therapeutic modality for headache pain in adult patients presenting to an emergency department. In this study, we accomplished a retrospective review of all pediatric patients with headaches who were treated with this technique in an emergency department setting over a 16-month period. The therapeutic response of all pediatric patients who received bilateral lower cervical paraspinous intramuscular bupivacaine injections for headache pain is described in this article.
METHODS: Three separate databases were reviewed to capture all patients younger than 18 years with a diagnosis of headache who received bilateral cervical injections between June 30, 2003, and December 1, 2004, in the Medical College of Georgia and Children's Medical Center emergency departments. Their medical records were retrospectively reviewed to determine their response to this procedure.
RESULTS: The headaches of 13 patients younger than 18 years were treated with this procedure. The mean headache severity was 9.15, and the mean duration of headache was 3.16 days. Six (46.2%) of 13 patients had complete relief of their headaches, whereas 5 (38.4%) of 13 patients had partial relief. No significant relief was documented in 2 (15.4%) of 13 patients. A therapeutic response was documented in 11 (84.6%) of 13 of the patients.
CONCLUSIONS: These retrospective observations suggest that bilateral lower cervical paraspinous intramuscular injections with small amounts of bupivacaine may have a therapeutic role in the management of headache pain in children, and their rate of therapeutic response may be similar to that recently reported for adult headache patients."
20179952,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20179952/,"PURPOSE: Peritonitis is a life-threatening condition that may occur as a sequela of intra-abdominal infection. The management of peritonitis includes surgical intervention, antimicrobial therapy, and nutritional support. Arginine has been reported to have beneficial and adverse effects in subjects with inflammation, which might be related to the dose, time, and route of supplementation and the disease severity. So far, the optimal doses of parenteral arginine are not known. In this study, we investigated dose effects of parenterally supplemented arginine on anabolism and arginine-derived metabolites in sub-acute inflammation.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Male Wistar rats underwent modified cecal puncture procedure for induction of peritonitis were infused with total parenteral nutrition solutions for 7 days, which contained conventional, low, medium, and high doses of arginine, i.e., 1.61, 2.85, 4.08, and 6.54% of calories from arginine. Healthy, orally fed rats were included as references.
RESULTS: On day 7, peritonitic rats had significantly decreased body weight, declined serum albumin, and increased serum nitric oxide (NO) and tumor-necrosis factor-alpha compared to references (ANOVA, P < 0.05). There were no dose effects of parenteral arginine on body weight, nitrogen retention, and serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine in peritonitic rats. In contrast, plasma arginine, proline, and ornithine, and urinary urea nitrogen were significantly increased, whereas serum NO and plasma glutamine were significantly decreased in dose-dependent manners with parenteral arginine. Pharmacological dose of parenteral arginine may increase the synthesis of ornithine, urea, and proline instead of citrulline and NO in peritonitic rats.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that high dose of parenteral arginine may facilitate ureagenesis and proline conversion without causing augmentation of NO production in sub-acute inflammation. Therefore, pharmacological dose of parenteral arginine may not have benefits in anabolism but does not cause adverse effect in rats with sub-acute inflammation."
20180351,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20180351/,"BACKGROUND: Because of its wealth in blood capillaries and conjunctive fabric the lung is a potential body targets of microvascular diabetic complications.
AIM: The purpose of this work is to evaluate the respiratory function among 23 diabetics patients, while being helped of measurements of volumes and respiratory flows as well as pulmonary broadcasting capacity of CO.
METHODS: The measured parameters were the total pulmonary capacity (CPT), the vital capacity (CV), the functional residual capacity (CRF), residual volume (VR), maximum expiratory volume in 1 second (VEMS), the coefficient of Tiffeneau (VEMS/CV) and the expiratory flow of point (EPD). The pulmonary broadcasting capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO) was measured.
RESULTS: Residual volume (VR) was on average of 76.53 +/- 19.76% of the theoretical values, it was decreased among 12 patients. The functional residual capacity (CRF) on average of 86.11 +/- 19.47% of the theoretical values, found was decreased among 10 patients. The pulmonary diffusion (DLCO/VA), which varies approximately 10% with the change of position at the healthy subject, was normal in sitting position among studied patients (114.93 +/- 24.18%) and decreased only by 3.64 +/- 9.63% in position upright. Moreover, this variation was all the more weak as the rate of albuminuria was high.
CONCLUSION: Thus, the repercussions of the diabetes over the respiratory function exist, but remain often infraclinic because of the broad ventilatory reserve available to the human being. In addition, the absence of variation of DLCO/VA according to the position could constitute an invaluable index precociously to detect the lesions of the pulmonary capillary bed among patients presenting a nephropathy diabetic."
20181131,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20181131/,"BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) emerged as a public health problem, and the disease prevalence varies among different races. The present study was designed to investigate the prevalence of CD using serological markers in apparently healthy schoolchildren in Irbid City, Jordan. Additionally, the effect of positive serology on height, weight and body mass index (BMI) was evaluated.
METHODS: The study population consisted of 1985 children (1117 girls and 868 boys), age range was 5.5 to 9.5 years. Height and weight were measured and blood samples were collected from each individual. Serum samples were analyzed for IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (tTG) using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). tTG positive samples were further analyzed for IgA anti-endomysium antibodies (EmA) with a commercial ELISA. Samples confirmed positive with EmA were considered seropositive.
RESULTS: Sixteen children were CD positive. The serological prevalence was estimated to be 1:124 (0.8%; 95% CI, 0.5% to 1.3%). Significant impact on growth (height) was found in seropositive children. When both sexes were individually analyzed, only boys showed height reduction. Furthermore, seropositive boys also had a significant weight reduction.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that CD is prevalent among schoolchildren in Jordan. The seropositive children tend to have lower height, weight, and BMI than the seronegative group. These differences were significant only for boys. None of the participants is known to have CD prior to the study."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Analytical framework of the study consisted of gathering and reviewing of relevant political documents, international assistance project documentation, and analysis of routinely collected national statistical data based on the evaluation model of three groups of criteria: allocative, technical efficiency and financial sustainability in the public sector of Serbia from 2000 to 2007. Time trends were analyzed by Poisson regression models using average annual percentage changes--AAPC, and the percent of targeted change achieved by progress quotient--PQ.
RESULTS: Allocative efficiency of the PHC during period of 8 years was improved, but technical efficiency was almost unchanged for all service, except for preschool health care. Financial sustainability was also improved measured by indirect indicators of health expenditure.

20181575,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20181575/,"BACKGROUND: Patients with extensive lung metastases from nonseminomatous germ-cell tumours (NSGCTs) and dyspnoea at presentation are at high risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death within the first weeks after chemotherapy induction. This syndrome is linked to acute intra-alveolar haemorrhage related to early tumour necrosis, which in turn, can be complicated by pulmonary infection promoted by neutropenia. The management of these patients was modified at Institut Gustave Roussy in 1997 to try to avoid this complication.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data concerning all patients with lung metastases from NSGCT and dyspnoea or a partial pressure of oxygen (pO(2)) <80 mmHg treated from 1980 to 2006 in our institution were collected. Patients were treated in a specialised intensive care unit. From 1980 to 1997, the first chemotherapy cycle consisted in a full-dose regimen. After 1997, a 3-day reduced induction regimen of EP (cisplatin 20 mg/m(2)/day and etoposide 100 mg/m(2)/day) was used, with bleomycin and two additional days of EP being postponed to day 15, with the regular BEP regimen being started at day 21.
RESULTS: Twenty-five patients with poor-risk disseminated NSGCT according to the International Germ Cell Consensus Classification Group had extensive lung metastases plus dyspnoea at presentation (n = 6), a pO(2) <80 mmHg (n = 2), or both criteria (n = 17). Median human chorionic gonadotrophin was 200 000 UI (range 11-8 920 000), and 18 of 25 (72%) patients also had nonpulmonary visceral metastases. During the 1980-1997 period, 13 of 15 patients (87%) developed ARDS, 10 of whom died, and only 4 of 15 (27%) patients were long-term survivors. In contrast, during the 1997-2006 period, only 3 of 10 patients (30%) developed ARDS (P = 0.01), 2 of whom died, and 4 of 10 (40%) eventually survived.
CONCLUSION: Initial reduction of chemotherapy doses during the first cycle of chemotherapy for poor prognosis NSGCT with extensive lung metastases seems to prevent the risk of early death due to ARDS."
20181676,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20181676/,"BACKGROUND: In the management of chronic stable angina, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) provides symptomatic relief of angina rather than improvement of prognosis. Current guidelines recommend optimization of medical therapy prior to elective PCI. It is not clear if these guidelines are adhered to in clinical practice.
AIM: The aim of this multi-centre study was to determine the extent to which these treatment guidelines are being implemented in the UK.
DESIGN: This was a multi-centre study involving six hospitals in the UK.
METHODS: The medical treatment and extent of risk factor modification was recorded for consecutive patients undergoing elective PCI for chronic stable angina at each site. Data collected included anti-anginal drug therapy, lipid levels and blood pressure (BP). Data on heart rate (HR) control were also collected, since this represents a fundamental part of medical anti-anginal therapy. Target HR is <60 b.p.m. for symptomatic angina.
RESULTS: A total of 500 patients [74% male; mean age +/- SD (64.4 +/- 10.1 years)] were included. When considering secondary prevention, 85% were receiving a statin and 76% were on an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker. In terms of medical anti-ischaemic therapy, 78% were receiving beta-blockers [mean equivalent dose of bisoprolol 3.1 mg (range 1.25-20 mg)], 11% a rate limiting calcium antagonist, 35% a nitrate or nicorandil and one patient was receiving ivabradine. The mean total cholesterol (95% confidence interval) was 4.3 mmol/l (4.2-4.4), mean systolic BP of 130 +/- 24 mmHg and mean diastolic BP of 69 +/- 13 mmHg. Serum cholesterol was <5 mmol/l in 77% and <4 mmol/l in 42% of the patients, 62% of the patients had systolic BP < 140 mmHg and 92% had diastolic BP < 90 mmHg. Considering European Society of Cardiology targets, 50% had systolic BP < 130 mmHg and 76% had diastolic BP < 80 mmHg. A large proportion of patients did not achieve target resting HR; 27% of patients had a resting HR of >or=70 b.p.m., 40% had a resting HR between 60 and 69 b.p.m. and 26% had a resting HR between 50 and 59 b.p.m. The resting HR was not related to the dose of beta-blocker.
CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of the patients with chronic stable angina undergoing elective PCI did not achieve therapeutic targets for lipid, BP and HR control. Over 50% of patients did not receive adequate HR lowering anti-anginal therapy to achieve recommended target resting HR."
20182267,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20182267/,"OBJECTIVE: The occurrence of pressure ulcers (PUs) in nursing homes is a marker for poor quality of care. We examine whether differences in PU prevalence between black and white residents are due to within- or across-facility disparities.
METHODS: Minimum Data Sets (2006-2007) are linked with the Online Survey Certification and Reporting database. Long-term care residents with high risk for PUs are identified. The dependent variable is dichotomous, indicating PU presence/absence. Individual race and facility race-mix are the main variables of interests.The sample includes 59,740 long-term care high-risk residents (17.4% black and 82.6% white) in 619 nursing homes. We fit 3 risk-adjusted logit models: base, conditional fixed-effects, and random-effects.
RESULTS: Unadjusted PU prevalence is 14.5% (18.2% for blacks and 13.8% for whites). Overall, blacks are more likely to have PUs than whites, controlling for individual risk factors. We find no such effect within facilities after additional accounting for facility fixed effects. The effect of race is significantly different between the base and the conditional fixed-effects logit model. The random-effects and conditional fixed-effects logit models show similar results, demonstrating that higher PU presence among blacks is associated with greater facility-specific concentration of black residents.
CONCLUSION: Greater PU occurrence among blacks may not result from differential within-facility treatment of blacks versus whites. Rather, blacks are more likely to reside in facilities with poorer care quality. To improve PU care for blacks, efforts should focus on improving the overall quality of care for facilities with high proportion of black residents."
20182270,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20182270/,"BACKGROUND: Process measures have been developed and implemented to evaluate the quality of care patients receive in the hospital. This study examines whether there is an association between the quality of in-hospital cardiac care and a hospital's proportion of low-income patients.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A retrospective analysis of 1979 hospitals submitting information on 12 quality of care (QoC) process measures for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and congestive heart failure (CHF) patients to the Hospital Quality Alliance during 2005 and 2006 and meeting all study inclusion criteria. Mean hospital performance ranged from 84.2% (ACE inhibitor for left ventricular systolic dysfunction) to 95.9% (aspirin on arrival) for AMI QoC process measures and from 64.4% (discharge instructions) to 92.4% (left ventricular function assessment) for CHF QoC process measures. Regression analyses indicated a statistically significant negative association between the proportion of low-income patients and hospital performance for 10 of the 12 cardiac QoC process measures, after controlling for selected hospital characteristics.
CONCLUSIONS: Hospital adherence to QoC process measures for AMI and CHF patients declined as the proportion of low-income patients increased. Future research is needed to examine the role of community characteristics and market forces on the ability of hospitals with a disproportionate share of low-income patients to maintain the staffing, equipment, and policies necessary to provide the recommended standards of care for AMI and CHF patients."

METHODS: Patients with CRC diagnosed in six hospitals in southern Netherlands during January to December in 2005 (n = 445) and January to July in 2008 (n = 353) were included. The time between diagnosis and start of treatment was assessed, and the proportion of patients treated within the recommended time (<15 working days) was calculated.
RESULTS: The time to treatment for colon cancer patients was 13 working days in 2005 and 17 working days in 2008. For rectal cancer patients, the median time to preoperative radiotherapy was 28 working days in 2005 and 30 working days in 2008, and the median time to surgical treatment for rectal cancer patients was 26 working days in 2005 and 18 working days in 2008. Time to treatment did not shorten between 2005 and 2008 for colon and rectal cancer patients, except for rectal cancer patients who underwent surgery as initial treatment in patients aged >70 years and those with stage I disease. Substantial variation was seen among hospitals.
CONCLUSIONS: Time to treatment for patients with CRC in southern Netherlands did not shorten between 2005 and 2008. The time to treatment should be reduced to meet the advice of the Dutch Cancer Society."
20182811,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20182811/,"BACKGROUND: The prognosis of patients with gastric cancer and para-aortic lymph node (PALN) metastasis is poor. Recent Japanese randomized trials concluded that prophylactic PALN dissection is not effective for curable advanced gastric cancer. However, the value of curative resection in patients with pathologically positive PALN is not determined yet.
METHODS: We retrospectively identified 178 patients with pathologically positive PALN who underwent curative resection at the Cancer Institute Hospital from 1980 to 2004. Patient characteristics were analyzed and independent prognostic factors for death were identified by Cox proportional hazard model.
RESULTS: Partial gastrectomy was the most frequently performed procedure (142 of 178). Postoperative morbidity and mortality rates were 30 and 2%, respectively, with a 5-year survival rate of 13.0%. Multivariate analysis revealed the total number of positive nodes (hazard ratio, 1.804; 95% confidence interval, 1.221-2.665) and macroscopic type (hazard ratio, 1.697; 95% confidence interval, 1.138-2.530) as independent prognostic factors, while age, sex, histology, pathological tumor depth, and degree of PALN dissection were not statistically significant. The 5-year survival rate increased to 28.6% in patients with < or =15 positive nodes and macroscopic type other than type 4.
CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic PALN dissection can not be justified in curable advanced gastric cancer. However, R0 resection including PALN retrieval might be beneficial in patients with pathologically positive PALN, providing patients are carefully selected and operations are performed safely."
20183808,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20183808/,"OBJECTIVE: To assess whether, when using spherical sampling with Virtual Organ Computer-Aided Analysis (VOCAL) for calculating three-dimensional (3D) power Doppler angiography (PDA) indices, the sphere volume affects performance in the prediction of malignancy in vascularized cystic-solid or solid adnexal masses.
METHODS: One hundred and thirty-eight women (mean +/- SD age, 51.8 +/- 14.1 years) diagnosed as having vascularized cystic-solid or solid adnexal masses on B-mode and two-dimensional (2D) power Doppler ultrasound were evaluated by 3D-PDA prior to surgery. Five women had bilateral masses, giving a total number of 143 masses analyzed. Vascularization was assessed using VOCAL software. 3D-PDA vascular indices (vascularization index (VI), flow index (FI) and vascularization flow index (VFI)) from the most vascularized area within papillary projections and solid areas were calculated automatically using spherical sampling. Five different volumes of sphere were used (1 cm(3), 2 cm(3), 3 cm(3), 4 cm(3) and 5 cm(3)) in each case. A definitive histological diagnosis was obtained in each case after surgical tumor removal.
RESULTS: One hundred and seventeen (82%) masses were malignant and 26 (18%) were benign. Morphological evaluation revealed 34 (24%) unilocular solid masses, 49 (34%) multilocular solid masses and 60 (42%) mostly solid masses. The 1-cm(3) sphere could be used in 100% of the cases, the 2-cm(3) sphere could be used in 98.2% of the cases and the 3-5-cm(3) spheres could be used in 97.2% of the cases. The median VI, FI and VFI for all sphere volumes were significantly higher in malignant compared with non-malignant tumors. Receiver-operating characteristics curve analysis showed that VI and VFI, independently of sphere volume, were better predictors of malignancy than was FI. The best cut-off values for the 3D-PDA indices differed depending on sphere volume. VI was significantly more specific than were VFI and FI.
CONCLUSIONS: Sphere volume does not affect the performance of 3D-PDA. We recommend the use of different cut-off values for 3D-PDA indices for discriminating between benign and malignant adnexal masses, depending on the sphere volume used. Use of VI is preferable due to its higher specificity."
20184486,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20184486/,"OBJECTIVE: The G1057D polymorphism in the insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS-2) gene has been reported to be associated with insulin resistance, obesity and type 2 diabetes. However little is known about its possible association with cancer. To investigate this association, we determined the distribution of its genotypes and frequency of alleles in endometrial cancer patients.
METHODS: The study population consisted of 184 subjects: 44 patients with endometrial cancer and 140 controls without cancer. All the patients were primarily treated with surgical intervention. DNA was extracted from the leucocytes by high pure polymerase chain reaction (PCR) template preparation kit. Genetic polymorphism of IRS-2 G1057D was detected by using PCR-based restriction fragment-length polymorphism.
RESULTS: For IRS-2 G1057D polymorphism, there was a significant difference in genotype distribution and allele frequency between endometrial cancer patients and controls (p < 0.001). The risk for endometrial cancer was 4.87 times higher in the individuals with the IRS-2 DD genotype compared to the GG genotype [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.74-13.63 p = 0.003]. Also individuals with the IRS-2 D allele had a significantly higher risk of endometrium cancer compared with individuals with the IRS-2 G allele, with a relative risk of 2.23 (95% CI: 1.36-3.67, p = 0.001) for cases compared with population controls.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that IRS-2 G1057D polymorphism may be associated with endometrial cancer."
20184511,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20184511/,"OBJECTIVES: The AHA/ACC/ESC Guidelines for management of atrial fibrillation (AF) patients suggest criteria for adequate rate control. We hypothesized that AF patients fulfilling these criteria would have better quality of life (QoL) and exercise capacity compared to the ones not fulfilling the criteria.
DESIGN: Heart rate at rest, during moderate exercise and over 24 hours, and peak oxygen uptake (VO(2) peak) were measured in patients with permanent AF, all aged 75 years, recruited from two Norwegian municipalities. SF-36 Physical component summary (PCS) and Mental component summary (MCS) QoL scores were assessed. The similar program was also applied to 71 age-matched subjects in sinus rhythm.
RESULTS: Twenty-seven AF patients participated. Six (22%) of the AF patients satisfied the Guidelines' criteria for rate control; their VO(2) peak (mean +/- SD) was 23.0 +/- 6.5 versus 22.6 +/- 5.3 ml/kg/min in AF patients not satisfying the criteria, PCS score had median (25(th), 75(th) percentile) 44 (30, 57) versus 41 (31, 47), and MCS score had median 52 (40, 62) versus 56 (43, 60), all p-values > 0.500. When the rate criteria were applied to the group in sinus rhythm, only 45% had heart rates within the ranges recommended by the Guidelines for AF patients.
CONCLUSION: AF patients satisfying the Guidelines' criteria for adequate rate control did not have higher oxygen uptake or report better QoL than AF patients not satisfying the criteria."
20184638,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20184638/,"AIM: Perineal approaches are considered to be the 'gold standard' in treating elderly patients with external rectal prolapse (ERP) because morbidity and mortality with perineal approaches are lower compared with transabdominal approaches. Higher recurrence rates and poorer function are tolerated as a compromise. The aim of the present study was to assess the safety of laparoscopic ventral rectopexy (LVR) in elderly patients, compared with perineal approaches.
METHOD: The prospectively collected databases from two tertiary referral pelvic floor units were interrogated to identify outcome in patients of 80 years of age and older with full-thickness ERP treated by LVR. The primary end-points were age, American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) grade, mortality, and major and minor morbidity. Secondary end-points were length of stay (LOS) and recurrence.
RESULTS: Between January 2002 and December 2008, 80 [median age 84 (80-97) years] patients underwent rectopexy. The mean ± standard deviation ASA grade was 2.44 (± 0.57) (two patients were ASA grade I, 42 patients were ASA grade II, 35 patients were ASA grade III and one patient was ASA grade IV). The median LOS was 3 (range 1-37) days. There was no mortality, and 10 (13%) patients had complications (one major and nine minor). At a median follow-up of 23 (2-82) months, two (3%) patients had developed a recurrent full-thickness prolapse.
CONCLUSION: LVR is a safe procedure for using to treat full-thickness ERP in elderly patients. Mortality, morbidity and hospital stay are comparable with published rates for perineal procedures, with a 10-fold lower recurrence."
20184759,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20184759/,"BACKGROUND: Natural health products (NHPs), such as herbal medicines and vitamins, are widely available over-the-counter and are often purchased by consumers without advice from a healthcare provider. This study examined how consumers respond when they believe they have experienced NHP-related adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in order to determine how to improve current safety monitoring strategies.
METHODS: Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with twelve consumers who had experienced a self-identified NHP-related ADR. Key emergent themes were identified and coded using content analysis techniques.
RESULTS: Consumers were generally not comfortable enough with their conventional health care providers to discuss their NHP-related ADRs. Consumers reported being more comfortable discussing NHP-related ADRs with personnel from health food stores, friends or family with whom they had developed trusted relationships. No one reported their suspected ADR to Health Canada and most did not know this was possible.
CONCLUSION: Consumers generally did not report their suspected NHP-related ADRs to healthcare providers or to Health Canada. Passive reporting systems for collecting information on NHP-related ADRs cannot be effective if consumers who experience NHP-related ADRs do not report their experiences. Healthcare providers, health food store personnel, manufacturers and other stakeholders also need to take responsibility for reporting ADRs in order to improve current pharmacovigilance of NHPs."
20185288,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20185288/,"BACKGROUND: Opioid substitution therapy (OST) continues to face strong resistance in the former Soviet Central Asian republics. OST was discontinued by the Uzbek government in 2009. In Kyrgyzstan, with about 950 people currently receiving OST, the programme was about to be suspended in 2009. In Kazakhstan, a small pilot project serves 50 clients. Turkmenistan may introduce OST in 2010, while the Tajik Ministry of Health approved the introduction of an OST pilot in summer 2009.
METHODS: This paper draws upon the analysis of interests of the OST-affected groups in Tajikistan as a case study to understand the roots of resistance to OST.
RESULTS: In Tajikistan, OST may be contrary to the interests of some narcologists, law enforcement officers and drug dealers. People who use drugs do not play any role in national drug-policy making. The HIV prevention community within the Tajik executive bodies receives major financial support from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM) to respond to an IDU driven epidemic, and yet it is the only group which has nothing to gain from the absence of OST.
CONCLUSION: The Tajik government agreed to introduce OST in order not to jeopardize its future funding from GFATM. If the interests of the OST-affected groups are ignored, there is a high chance that OST in Tajikistan may remain a perpetual pilot project even despite all the necessary resources would come from GFATM and other donors. Putting ""narcology on pilot"" may prove helpful in both tackling the OST ""perpetual pilots"" and shifting the focus of public attention towards major inadequacies of the existing state-funded drug treatment systems in the region."
20185536,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20185536/,"INTRODUCTION: Although deep vein thromboses (DVTs) are common, only a minority of patients referred with suspected DVT will have the condition. Various strategies exist to allow rapid and safe discharge of low-risk patients, thus precluding the need for imaging.
AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the accuracy of clinical risk assessment, D-Dimer analysis, computerized strain gauge plethysmography (CSGP) or a combination of the above in the assessment of outpatients with suspected DVT.
METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study on outpatients referred with suspected DVT to our medical assessment unit. Patients systematically underwent clinical risk assessment, D-Dimer analysis, CSGP and imaging with ultrasonography and/or venography.
RESULTS: One hundred and eighty patients with suspected DVT were included in the analysis. Using a threshold of 0.6 mg/l, D-Dimer had a sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) of 100% for detecting DVT. Incorporating D-Dimer analysis with clinical risk assessment increased the specificity of the test. The sensitivity and NPV of CSGP were poor at 52.8 and 86.7%, respectively. Incorporating CSGP with D-Dimer did not influence decision making. Although the sensitivity of CSGP was higher for above knee (73.7%) than below knee DVT (29.4%), neither was sufficient for use as a screening tool.
CONCLUSION: Our study did not support the role of CSGP either as a stand-alone screening tool or in conjunction with clinical risk scoring. As the evidence base for CSGP is conflicting, its accuracy should first be assessed before being incorporated into hospital algorithms as a DVT exclusion tool. However, our results support the current practice for D-Dimer use either alone or in conjunction with clinical assessment tool in the assessment of lower limb DVT."
20185746,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20185746/,"OBJECTIVE: Hypertensive patients have an increased risk of developing diabetes. Accumulating evidence suggests a close relation between metabolic disturbance and increased arterial stiffness. Here, we examined the association between pulse pressure and the risk of new-onset diabetes in high-risk Japanese hypertensive patients.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The Candesartan Antihypertensive Survival Evaluation in Japan (CASE-J) trial examined the effects of candesartan and amlodipine on the incidence of cardiovascular events in 4,728 high-risk Japanese hypertensive patients. In the present study, we analyzed the relationship between pulse pressure at baseline and new-onset diabetes in 2,685 patients without diabetes at baseline (male 1,471; mean age 63.7 years; mean BMI 24.8 kg/m(2)) as a subanalysis of the CASE-J trial.
RESULTS: During 3.3 +/- 0.8 years of follow-up, 97 patients (3.6%) developed diabetes. In multiple Cox regression analysis, pulse pressure was an independent predictor for new-onset diabetes (hazard ratio [HR] per 1 SD increase 1.44 [95% CI 1.15-1.79]) as were male sex, BMI, and additional use of diuretics, whereas age and heart rate were not. Plots of HRs for new-onset diabetes considering both systolic and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) revealed that a higher pulse pressure with a lower DBP, indicating that the increased pulse pressure was largely due to increased arterial stiffness, was strongly associated with the risk of new-onset diabetes.
CONCLUSIONS: Pulse pressure is an independent predictor of new-onset diabetes in high-risk Japanese hypertensive patients. Increased arterial stiffness may be involved in the development of diabetes."
20185780,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20185780/,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In malignant cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) patients, emergency decompressive surgery has been suggested as a life-saving procedure. We report 12 patients with malignant CVT, among whom 8 underwent operation.
METHODS: Retrospective study of 12 patients from 3 stroke units who had a malignant CVT as defined: (1) supratentorial cortical lesions attributable to superficial venous system thrombosis with or without sinus involvement; (2) with clinical (decreased consciousness and dilated pupils) or radiological signs of transtentorial herniation; (3) either at onset or after worsening despite heparin therapy. Surgery or abstention was decided individually by neurosurgeons on call.
RESULTS: There were 9 women and 3 men with a mean age of 45+/-15 years. The delay between heparin therapy and signs of malignancy ranged from 2 to 30 hours. At malignant worsening all but 1 patient had hemorrhagic lesions; the median deviation of septum pellucidum was 12 mm (interquartile range, 6.7-13); 5 patients (including 3 who underwent operation) had a unilateral dilated pupil; and 4 (2 who underwent operation) had bilateral dilated pupils. Eight patients underwent surgical decompression, external decompression in 4, both external and internal decompression in 3, and internal decompression in 1. The 4 patients who did not undergo operation died within 1 to 5 days after diagnosis. One patient who underwent operation died of a pulmonary embolism. The 7 others survived, with, at last follow-up (median, 23.1 months; interquartile range, 19.7-45.6), an excellent recovery of mRS 0 or 1 in 6 and mRS 3 in 1.
CONCLUSION: Decompressive surgery may save lives and may even allow a good functional outcome in malignant CVT, even in patients with bilateral dilated pupils."
20185920,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20185920/,"OBJECTIVE: Urinary bladder endometriosis is a severe form of endometriosis often requiring surgery. The several cases treated at our hospital in recent years has led us to evaluate the incidence of urinary bladder endometriosis in Finland.
METHODS: We performed a register-based analysis of incidence of urinary bladder endometriosis. The patients were identified according to registered diagnosis and operation codes.
RESULTS: Six urinary bladder endometriosis cases were diagnosed at Oulu University Hospital during 1991-2007. These cases have been presented. The annual incidence, as evaluated from The Finnish Care Register HILMO, increased from 3.6 to 9.4 cases/1,000,000 females aged 15-49 years per year during 1996-1999 and 2004-2007, respectively, in Finland.
CONCLUSION: There is an apparent increase in incidence of urinary bladder endometriosis in Finland. The low number of cases detected at Oulu University Hospital, and the limitations of the incidence evaluation based on the HILMO register, exclude the presentation of an accurate incidence. The results presented warrant further and careful evaluation of potential increases in urinary bladder endometriosis elsewhere."
20186033,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20186033/,"PURPOSE: MD-PhD training programs provide an integrated approach for training physician-scientists. The goal of this study was to characterize the career path taken by MD-PhD program alumni during the past 40 years and identify trends that affect their success.
METHOD: In 2007-early 2008, 24 programs enrolling 43% of current trainees and representing half of the National Institutes of Health-funded MD-PhD training programs submitted anonymous data on 5,969 current and former trainees.
RESULTS: The average program enrolled 90 trainees, required 8.0 years to complete, and had an attrition rate of 10%. Nearly all (95%) of those who graduated entered residencies. Most (81%) were employed in academia, research institutes, or industry; 16% were in private practice. Of those in academia, 82% were doing research and at least 61% had identifiable research funding. Whereas two-thirds devoted more than 50% effort to research, only 39% devoted more than 75% effort. Many with laboratory-based PhDs reported doing clinical, as well as basic and translational, research. Emerging trends include decreasing numbers of graduates who forego residencies or hold primary appointments in nonclinical departments, increasing time to graduation, and expanding residency choices that include disciplines historically associated with clinical practice rather than research.
CONCLUSIONS: Most MD-PhD program graduates follow career paths generally consistent with their training as physician-scientists. However, the range of their professional options is broad. Further thought should be given to designing their training to anticipate their career choices and maximize their likelihood of success as investigators."
20186240,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20186240/,"AIM: To determine whether use of cardiovascular medications by a sample of mid-life and older women is consistent with New Zealand cardiovascular risk guidelines.
METHOD: Retrospective analysis of risk factor data collected during the Women's Lifestyle Study involving 1089 40-74 year old women. Outcome measures included: 5-year cardiovascular (CVD) risk score calculated using the adjusted Framingham equation and self-reported use of cardiovascular medications.
RESULTS: Seven percent (76/1089) of women had established CVD, and a further 3% (33/1089) had a risk score greater than 15% (high risk). Of the 109 women at high risk (risk score = or >15% or established CVD); 36% (39/109) were taking aspirin, 55% (60/109) were taking blood pressure-lowering medication, 45% (49/109) were taking lipid-lowering medications and 17% (19/109) were taking all three medications. Triple therapy was being taken by 12% of women (4/33) for primary prevention (5-year risk score = or >15%) and only 19.7% of women for secondary prevention (15/76).
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that women at high-risk are not receiving cardiovascular medications as recommended by the guidelines, reflecting a 'treatment gap.' Modifiable barriers to the management of women at risk for CVD need to be identified and addressed to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality among women."
20186297,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20186297/,"INTRODUCTION: Gallbladder cancer, which is characterized by rapid progression and a poor prognosis, is a complex disease to treat. Unfortunately, little is known currently about its etiology or pathogenesis. A better understanding of its carcinogenesis and determining risk factors that lead to its development could help improve the available treatment options.
METHOD: Based on this better understanding, the histological alterations (such as acute cholecystitis, adenomyomatosis, xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis, polyps, pyloric metaplasia, intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, cancer and others) in gallbladders from 1,689 patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy for cholecystolithiasis were analyzed. The association of these gallbladder histological alterations with clinical data was studied.
RESULTS: Gender analysis revealed a greater incidence of inflammatory changes in males, while dysplasia and cancer were only found in women. The incidence of cholesterolosis was greater in the patients 60 years of age and under, and the incidence of adenomyomatosis and gangrene was greater in the elderly patients. A progressive increase in the average age was observed as alterations progressed through pyloric metaplasia, intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia and then cancer, suggesting that the metaplasia-dysplasia-carcinoma sequence may occur in gallbladder cancer. Gallbladder histological alterations were also observed in asymptomatic patients.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that there could be an association between some histological alterations of gallbladder and cancer, and they also suggest that the metaplasia-dysplasia-carcinoma sequence could in fact be true in the case of gallbladder cancer. Nevertheless, further studies directed towards a perfect understanding of gallbladder carcinogenesis are required."
20186433,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20186433/,"BACKGROUND: Surgery is increasingly reserved for complicated diverticulitis. The role of laparoscopy in this context is ill defined. This study aimed to evaluate the safety, feasibility, and outcomes associated with the application of laparoscopy to an unrestricted spectrum of diverticular pathologies, with an emphasis on complicated disease.
METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent elective, urgent, or emergent laparoscopic colectomy for diverticular disease from 1991 to 2007 were analyzed from a prospectively collected database. Laparoscopy was offered to all patients presenting for surgical attention, thus minimizing selection bias. Complicated cases had abscesses, perforations, fistulas, or strictures. Uncomplicated cases had chronic or recurrent diverticulitis. Summary statistics and univariate comparisons were generated.
RESULTS: A total of 183 patients were analyzed, including 39 complicated cases. The complicated cohort included 12 abscesses or perforations (31%), 18 fistulas (46%), and 11 strictures (28%). Intraoperative complications were comparable between the two groups (7.7 vs. 9.7%), although the complicated cases resulted in more conversions (23 vs. 4.2%; p = 0.0007). More than 79% of the complicated patients and 96% of the uncomplicated patients underwent unprotected primary anastomosis. Medical (23 vs. 1.4%; p < 0.0001) and surgical (28 vs. 14%; p = 0.035) complications were more frequent in the complicated group. Leak rates were acceptably low (6.5 vs. 2.2%; p = 0.23). There were no recorded deaths. Finally, the time until discharge from hospital was significantly longer in the complicated group by a median of 1 day.
CONCLUSIONS: The laparoscopic management of complicated diverticular disease is feasible and appears to be safe in the hands of experts. Despite a high rate of conversion to open surgery, laparoscopy was the sole operative intervention for the majority of patients with complicated diverticular disease. Further studies are needed to allow rigorous comparison with an open control group."
20187288,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20187288/,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Many studies have been done to determine the distribution of acetylator phenotypes among populations of different geographic origin. The goal of this study was to investigate the acetylator phenotypes of the Iranian population and compare them between tubercular patients and healthy subjects.
METHODS: The study population consisted of two groups; the first group included 100 newly diagnosed tubercular patients and the second group consisted of 100 healthy subjects. Acetylator phenotype was determined from the metabolic ratio of acetyl-isoniazid to isoniazid in the plasma samples. Metabolic ratio was used to classify subjects as slow (= or < 0.70) or fast acetylators (>0.70).
RESULTS: In the tubercular patients, the frequencies of slow and fast acetylator phenotypes were 62 and 38%, respectively. Of the healthy individuals, 45% were found to be slow acetylators and the remaining 55% were fast acetylators.
CONCLUSION: It seems that tubercular patients metabolize isoniazid more slowly than healthy individuals."
20187467,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20187467/,"BACKGROUND: The ampulla of Vater is a junction with four histologic epithelial types: ampullary, duodenal, pancreatic and biliary. The tumors of this region are named periampullary adenocarcinomas, but the histologic type of these malignancies seems to have an important significance for survival.
AIM: Our purpose is to determine whether the histologic type of the resectable vaterian adenocarcinomas is a prognostic factor.
METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 38 patients who underwent RO-R1 pancreatoduodenectomy for periampullary adenocarcinomas between 1998 and 2007 in one single surgical center. The histopathologic reports and the microscopic samples were reevaluated independently by two senior pathologists. Using our database we assessed the overall survival based on histologic type, tumor stage, lymph nodes involvement, tumor size and the level of differentiation.
RESULTS: The histologic type of the adenocarcinomas was intestinal in 23 cases (60.5%) and pancreatobiliary in 15 cases (39.5%). The median overall survival was significantly higher in patients with well differentiate intestinal-type in T1-T2 stage without nodes involvement. In a multivariable Cox regression analysis the regional lymph nodes involvement and the differentiation degree remained significant prognostic factors.
CONCLUSION: The intestinal type of periampullary adenocarcinomas has a long survival, but the lymph nodes involvement and the lower degree of differentiation are associated with a high risk of death in these malignancies."
20187495,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20187495/,"BACKGROUND: Considering recent suggestions that the same work heaviness should be made admissible for women and men, a study has been undertaken to assess to what extent does the fatigue, in terms of total index of physiological cost of work, differ in women and men performing a job of the same heaviness or at the same level of workload (%VO2 max).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group consisted of 147 women and 114 men performing jobs with dominant share of physical effort employed in a post-office, a chemical plant and a cold store. Their energy expenditure during work were determined and their maximum oxygen intake were assessed from the results of stress test. A questionnaire survey was performed to collect information about self-assessed work heaviness, work fatigue (0-100 scores) and chronic fatigue (Checklist Individual Strength--CIS20R Questionnaire), and also about frequency of abandoning, because of fatigue, some daily chore or ""just for pleasure"" activity.
RESULTS: Mean energy expenditure during a work day in the study group of women was 504 kcal, while for men the respective value was 1204 kcal; the workload (%VO2 max) being 17.8% and 20.6%, respectively. However, the distribution of self-assessed work severity, work fatigue and chronic fatigue was similar in both groups, while the increase in work fatigue and chronic fatigue with growing energy expenditure was higher in women than in men. The frequency at which women and men abandoned their pleasure-motivated activities was similar; as to the ""daily chore"" activities, women used to abandon these more frequently than men, and they did so at a lower level of fatigue.
CONCLUSIONS: Abolition of the regulations that prevent free accessibility of women to jobs requiring high physical effort is not advisable because it would result in their increased fatigue; it may also limit their ability to perform non-occupational duties as well as impair their health condition."
20187679,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20187679/,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficiency of endorectal ultrasound (ERUS) in the study of chronic idiopathic anal pain (CIAP).
MATERIAL AND METHOD: This is a prospective and descriptive study in which 40 patients, 18 men and 22 women with an average of 47 years, were included. They had chronic anal pain of at least 3 months duration. A complete colonoscopy was performed in all patients, which found no abnormalities to explain clinical symptoms. Patients with anal fissure and internal hemorrhoids of any degree, perianal suppurative processes, and pelvic surgery were excluded from the study. An ALOKA ProSound SSD-4000 ultrasound console attached to a multifrequency radial transductor ASU-67 (7.5 and 10 MHz) was used.
RESULTS: One patient could not tolerate the examination. In 8 patients (20% of cases) alterations were detected during ultrasonography: in 4 patients (10% of the cases; 1 man and 3 women) internal anal sphincter (IAS) hypertrophy, and in 5 patients (4 women and 1 man) a torn sphincter complex. A tear in the upper IAS canal and hypertrophy of the middle anal canal were observed in one patient (1 woman).
CONCLUSIONS: ERUS is a simple, economic and useful test to study anorectal pathologies. Although in most studied cases no damage to the anal canal or rectal wall was detected, in a considerable number of patients we observed a thickening of the IAS, a probable cause of anal pain. Therefore, we understand that ERUS should be included in the study of CIAP."

RESULTS: Thirty-two RCTs were identified, but only five met the inclusion criteria. Only one of the five included RCTs restricted recruitment to people with hip OA, the other four RCTs also recruiting participants with knee OA. The five included studies provided data on 204 and 187 hip OA participants for pain and physical function, respectively. Combining the results of the five included RCTs using a fixed-effects model demonstrated a small treatment effect for pain (standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.38; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.67 to -0.09). No significant benefit in terms of improved self-reported physical function was detected (SMD -0.02; 95% CI -0.31 to 0.28).
CONCLUSION: Currently there is only silver level evidence (one small RCT) supporting the benefit of land-based therapeutic exercise for people with symptomatic hip OA in terms of reduced pain and improved physical function. The limited number and small sample size of the included RCTs restricts the confidence that can be attributed to these results."
20188404,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20188404/,"OBJECTIVES: To analyze erectile dysfunction (ED) in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD).
METHODS: A consecutive series of men aged 50-65 years undergoing an echocardiography (EC) at the Danube hospital in Vienna was analyzed. All patients completed the International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5). LVSD was defined by EC as an ejection fraction (EF) below 55%.
RESULTS: A total of 85 men (age, 58.5 years; standard deviation, 4.3) entered the analysis. Mean EF was 60.9% and mean IIEF-5 score 16.8. No ED (IIEF-5, 22-25) was present in 32 men (37.6%), mild ED (IIEF-5, 17-21) in 17 (20%), and 36 (42.4%) had moderate to severe ED (IIEF-5, 5-16). An EF below 55% was seen in 26 men (30.6%). Mean IIEF-5 in men with LVSD was 13.6 compared with 18.2 in those without LVSD (P = .005); the proportion of men with ED (IIEF-5 <22) was 76% in men with LVSD compared with 56.6% in those without LVSD (relative risk, 1.37; P = .05). In a logistic regression analysis adjusted for body mass index and age a declined IIEF-5 score was independently associated with a low EF (<or=55%) (P = .02).
CONCLUSIONS: Our data, generated via standardized assessment of LVSD (EC) and ED (IIEF-5) revealed a significant effect of chronic LVSD on erectile function in middle-aged men."
8280517,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8280517/,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the activity of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) in diabetic and non-diabetic patients admitted with acute myocardial infarction and to determine whether PAI-1 activity influences reperfusion after thrombolytic therapy.
DESIGN: Prospective study of patients admitted with acute myocardial infarction.
SETTING: District general hospital.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Reperfusion assessed by time to peak release of creatine kinase-MB isoenzyme.
RESULTS: Baseline PAI-1 activity and antigen concentrations were significantly higher in diabetic patients (n = 45) than in non-diabetic patients (n = 110) (24.6 (6.9) v 18.6 (7.9) AU/ml (AU = arbitrary units) (p = 0.0001) and 58.8 (13.1-328.8) v 41.0 (10.9-125.4) ng/ml (p = 0.004). Time to peak release of creatine kinase-MB was calculated in 123 (80%) patients. In 98 who received thrombolytic therapy the median time to peak enzyme release was 15.5 h (7.5-24 h) in diabetic patients (n = 26) and 12 h (5-26 h) in non-diabetic patients (n = 72) (p = 0.005). In those with a time to peak release of < or = 12 h, indicating likely successful reperfusion, PAI-1 activity was 17.5 (7.8) AU/ml compared with 22.8 (7.7) AU/ml in those with a time to peak release of > 12 h (p = 0.001). In multiple regression analysis both diabetes (p = 0.0001) and PAI-1 activity at admission (p = 0.029) were independently related to successful reperfusion. In 13 patients with evidence of reinfarction in hospital PAI-1 activity on day 3 was 26.7 (6.4) AU/ml compared with 21.7 (6.3) AU/ml in those without evidence of reinfarction (p = 0.032).
CONCLUSION: Both raised PAI-1 activity on admission and diabetes were associated with a reduced likelihood of enzymatic evidence of reperfusion after thrombolytic therapy. Increased PAI-1 activity on day 3 was associated with an increased risk of reinfarction. Diabetic patients had higher PAI-1 activity on admission. This may partly explain their reduced likelihood of reperfusion."
8281091,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8281091/,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the extent to which variation in rates of referral among general practitioners may be explained by inappropriate referrals and to estimate the effect of implementing referral guidelines.
SETTING: Practices within Cambridge Health Authority and Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Data on practice referral rates from hospital computers, inappropriate referrals as judged by hospital consultants, and inappropriate referrals as judged against referral guidelines which had been developed locally between general practitioners and specialists. Effect of referral guidelines on referral patterns as judged by general practitioners using the guidelines in clinical practice.
RESULTS: There was 2.5-fold variation in referral rates among general practices. According to the specialists, 9.6% (95% confidence interval 6.4% to 12.9%) of referrals by general practitioners and 8.9% (2.6% to 15.2%) of referrals from other specialists were judged possibly or definitely inappropriate. Against locally determined referral guidelines 15.9% of referrals by general practitioners were judged possibly inappropriate (11.8% to 20.0%). Elimination of all possibly inappropriate referrals could reduce variation in practice referral rates only from 2.5-fold to 2.1-fold. An estimate of the effect of using referral guidelines for 60 common conditions in routine general practice suggested that application of guidelines would have been unlikely to reduce rates of referral in hospital (95% confidence interval -4.5% to 8.6% of consultations resulting in referral).
CONCLUSION: The variation in referral rates among general practitioners in Cambridge could not be explained by inappropriate referrals. Application of referral guidelines would be unlikely to reduce the number of patients referred to hospital."
8281371,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8281371/,"BACKGROUND: Left main coronary artery stenosis is a rare but life-threatening complication after aortic valve replacement because of coronary perfusion-related trauma to the vessel wall with cannulation of the coronary ostia. We investigated whether this complication still occurs in the 1990s despite the use of more advanced catheter materials and modern surgical preservation techniques.
METHODS: Four years after identification of the first two cases in 1987, five further patients had developed left main coronary artery stenosis after aortic valve replacement (incidence, 0.9%) at the cardiothoracic clinic of the J.W. Goethe University and were studied for contributing factors.
RESULTS: Severe coronary ostial stenosis developed within 1 to 6 months after aortic valve replacement. In one such case, intimal proliferation was seen in a biopsy specimen that was comparable to the restenosis induced by coronary angioplasty. The clinical characteristics of the patients developing the complication, the surgical technique, and the intraoperative course did not differ from the other patients. However, five of the seven patients (71%) had a common genetic trait concerning their apolipoprotein E genotype (the epsilon 4 allele) that is normally present in only 10% to 15% of patients screened (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: These lesions seem to result from a uniform response of the vessel wall to injury. Their incidence is probably related in part to the degree of injury after trauma to the coronary ostia during cannulation for myocardial protection. Patients with the epsilon 4 allele might be genetically predisposed for a pathologically increased response of proliferative repair mechanisms after arterial injury. The complication can be avoided by not instrumenting the coronary ostia for direct antegrade cardioplegia but using retrograde delivery as an alternative method of myocardial protection."
8281667,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8281667/,"BACKGROUND: Prior in vitro and in vivo studies have reported that external ultrasound accelerates thrombolysis at intensities too low to have a direct effect on clot dissolution in the absence of a thrombolytic agent. The present study was undertaken to examine the ultrasound effect on thrombolysis and reocclusion in a rabbit thrombosis model.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Blood clots were produced in a femoral artery segment with endothelial damage and distal stenosis. Recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rTPA) was infused at 30 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 for 60 minutes. Femoral artery flow was measured every 5 minutes for 2 hours. Rabbits were randomized to four groups with continuous wave ultrasound on or off with or without intravenous injection of 17 mg/kg aspirin (+US/-US/+Asp/-Asp). Ultrasound frequency and intensity were 1 MHz and 6.3 W/cm2. In seven of eight and five of five rabbits given rTPA and -US/-Asp or -US/+Asp, respectively, reflow was observed, persisting to the end of the observation period. In five of nine and four of five rabbits given rTPA and +US/-Asp or +US/+Asp, reflow was achieved, but persistent reocclusion was subsequently observed in five of five and two of four of these rabbits, respectively. Overall, femoral artery patency was worse and reocclusion occurred more often when ultrasound was added to rTPA (P = .002 by nonparametric ANOVA). However, initial reflow occurred more rapidly with ultrasound exposure (21 +/- 10 and 33 +/- 6 minutes for the +US/+Asp and +US/-Asp groups, respectively) compared with without ultrasound (46 +/- 13 and 74 +/- 14 minutes for the -US/+Asp and -US/-Asp groups, respectively) (P = .03 by ANOVA).
CONCLUSIONS: Although time to initial reflow was shortened by ultrasound, it was associated with less reperfusion and more reocclusion in this model. A possible explanation for these results is ultrasound-induced platelet activation counterbalancing its thrombolysis-accelerating effect."
8282658,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8282658/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the prevalence of children's behavioral/emotional problems changed significantly over a 13-year period.
METHOD: Problems and competencies reported by parents and teachers for a random sample of 7 to 16 years old assessed in 1989 were compared with those reported by parents for a 1976 sample and by teachers for a 1981 to 1982 sample. Parent reports were obtained with the Child Behavior Checklist; teacher reports were obtained with the Teacher's Report Form.
RESULTS: Problem scores were higher and competence scores were lower in 1989 than in the earlier assessments. The secular changes were small but included diverse problems, syndromes, and competencies. Changes did not differ significantly by age, gender, socioeconomic status, nor black/white ethnicity. Correlations of 0.97 to 0.99 between rankings of item scores across 7.5- and 13-year intervals support the stability of the assessment procedures. Despite increases in problem scores, the 1989 U.S. scores were not higher than those in several other cultures.
CONCLUSIONS: Viewed categorically in terms of caseness, more untreated children in the 1989 than the 1976 sample would be considered to need help. Multicohort longitudinal studies now in progress will test predictors of within- and between-cohort change."
8282660,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8282660/,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to test whether the presence of childhood onset affective disorder identifies families with increased incidence and severity of affective disorders.
METHOD: Family history information was collected on the first and second degree relatives and first cousins age > or = 15 years of 22 children with bipolar affective disorder, 54 children with major depressive disorder, and 31 psychiatrically normal children.
RESULTS: Compared with the relatives of normal children, relatives identified through children with bipolar affective disorder or major depressive disorder had elevated rates of affective disorders and increased severity of affective disorders as judged by earlier age of onset and increased suicide attempts. Segregation analyses could reject purely environmental transmission of illness.
CONCLUSION: Ascertaining families through childhood onset affective disorder probands identifies extended pedigrees with high incidence and severity of affective disorders. These families may be more appropriate for genetic analyses than are families of adult probands."
8284377,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8284377/,"PURPOSE: To determine whether color and pulsed Doppler ultrasound (US) can be used to differentiate benign from malignant ovarian masses.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-four ovarian masses identified with sonography in 40 patients were confirmed at surgery (n = 35) or followed up to resolution with US (n = 9). Color and pulsed Doppler US were used to calculate the lowest pulsatility index (PI) and resistance index (RI) for each mass.
RESULTS: Color Doppler US enabled detection of arterial flow in 24 of 36 benign masses and six of eight malignant masses. PI was lower in malignant masses than in benign masses (P = .002), as was RI (P = .001). Both indexes demonstrated overlap between benign and malignant masses; therefore, no cutoff value for either index had both high sensitivity and high specificity for malignancy: For PI cutoff of 1.0, sensitivity and specificity were 100% and 46%, respectively; for RI cutoff of 0.4, 50% and 96%.
CONCLUSIONS: While PI and RI tend to be lower in malignant ovarian masses, neither index can be used reliably to differentiate benign from malignant lesions. In addition, lack of detectable flow by means of color Doppler US does not exclude ovarian malignancy."
8284381,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8284381/,"PURPOSE: To assess the feasibility of demonstrating cardiac motion with 313.6-msec single-shot turbo-fast low-angle shot magnetic resonance imaging.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Effects of motion on single-shot images were evaluated with a phantom moving at known velocity. Single-shot images were obtained in eight healthy volunteers and four cardiac patients and compared with conventional cine images.
RESULTS: The moving phantom was visualized at the location where zero phase-encoded data were sampled. When the velocity was within the physiologic range of left ventricular wall motion (< 11 cm/sec), the full width at half maximum of the object on a 64 x 64-matrix image with a 4.9-msec repetition time was comparable with that of a stationary phantom. The left ventricular cross-sectional area determined with single-shot imaging showed good correlation with results of conventional cine imaging (r = .96) in healthy volunteers.
CONCLUSION: Single-shot imaging can be used for simple and quick assessment of cardiac function."
8284391,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8284391/,"PURPOSE: To determine the association between vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and the presence of acute pyelonephritis in children with urinary tract infections.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors studied 150 consecutive patients less than 5 years of age with their first proved urinary tract infection. All patients underwent renal cortical scintigraphy (with technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid or Tc-99m gluconate) and voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) to identify the presence of cortical defects and VUR, respectively.
RESULTS: Of 300 kidneys, 88 (29.3%) had a cortical defect at scintigraphy. Fifty-four of the 88 patients (61%) did not have VUR demonstrated at VCUG. Conversely, 72 of the 300 kidneys (24%) had VUR; of these, 38 (53%) had no cortical defect. The sensitivity of VCUG in helping predict a defect was 38.6%, and the specificity was 82.1%.
CONCLUSION: VUR (as shown by VCUG) and renal cortical scintigraphic defects frequently occur independently of each other. Renal cortical scintigraphy may be a more accurate predictor of patients at risk for scarring."
8285871,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8285871/,"PURPOSE: To determine if maintenance of residual blood flow to culprit coronary artery in acute myocardial infarction is important in preserving left ventricular systolic function.
METHODS: Prospective study of 63 consecutive survivors of acute myocardial infarction in the prethrombolytic era that were submitted to cinecoronary angiography and 30 degrees RAO left ventriculography on the 4th week. Culprit coronary artery patency and collateral circulation were correlated with global and segmental left ventricular contractility.
RESULTS: Spontaneous coronary recanalization correlated significantly with better left ventricular systolic function only in patients with anterior wall myocardial infarction. This relationship was stronger with segmental than with global contractility. Besides, it was seen that absence of recanalization of pre-septal left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion resulted in significantly worse global and segmental left ventricular systolic function than post-septal occlusion, resulting in left ventricular aneurysm in all patients (2/3 of recanalized patients versus 1/3 of post-septal occlusions). Collateral circulation to culprit coronary artery correlated significantly with better global and segmental left ventricular contractility only in patients with inferior wall myocardial infarction.
CONCLUSION: In acute anterior wall myocardial infarction spontaneous coronary artery recanalization is associated with better global and segmental left ventricular systolic function, specially if the occlusion is of pre-septal localization, while collateral circulation is not related to better contractility. In acute inferior wall myocardial infarction one sees the reverse."
8285891,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8285891/,"OBJECTIVE: To reevaluate the necessity of empiric gram-negative therapy for postoperative endophthalmitis based on the recognition of aminoglycoside-induced toxic effects.
METHODS: A review of 162 cases of culture-positive bacterial endophthalmitis to determine bacterial prevalence, antibiotic susceptibilities, and laboratory staining results of intraocular material.
RESULTS: One hundred fifty (93%) gram-positive and 12 (7%) gram-negative isolates. All the gram-positive bacteria were susceptible to vancomycin hydrochloride; and gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to gentamicin sulfate, amikacin sulfate, and ceftazidime sodium. Bacterial rods were observed on smear of intraocular material in 10 gram-negative cases submitted for examination.
CONCLUSION: Vancomycin is an appropriate single agent if laboratory studies rule out gram-negative infection. In the absence of laboratory support, an aminoglycoside (possible toxic effects) or another gram-negative antibiotic (possibly ceftazidime) should also be administered."
8285900,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8285900/,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a possible association between estrogen and lens opacities.
DESIGN: A prevalence survey of age-related eye disease.
SETTING: Beaver Dam, Wis.
PARTICIPANTS: A total community sample of persons 43 through 84 years of age at the time of a private census were recruited for examination, medical history, and photographs of the lenses of the eyes. Data from women are included in this report.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Photographs were graded by protocol for the presence and severity of age-related lens opacities.
RESULTS: Current use of postmenopausal estrogens was associated with a decreased risk of more severe nuclear sclerosis. Younger age at menarche was also associated with a protective effect regarding nuclear sclerosis. Older age at menopause was associated with a decreased risk of cortical opacities.
CONCLUSION: These data are suggestive of a modest protective effect of estrogen exposure on the lenses of women. Further evaluation of this may be possible in studies currently under way in which postmenopausal estrogens are being tested for other (protective) effects."
8287587,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8287587/,"OBJECTIVE: We determined whether the measurement of hormones in pituitary blood permits correction for dilution by non-pituitary blood during bilateral simultaneous inferior petrosal sinus blood sampling in Cushing's syndrome.
DESIGN: Bilateral simultaneous inferior petrosal sinus blood sampling was performed after combined hCRF and TRH stimulation. Peak ACTH concentrations were corrected for the TSH and PRL inter-sinus ratio, assuming uniform secretion of both hormones into each inferior petrosal sinus.
PATIENTS: Eight patients with clinical and biochemical features of Cushing's syndrome.
MEASUREMENTS: Basal and stimulated ACTH, TSH and PRL concentrations were measured after bilateral simultaneous inferior petrosal sinus blood sampling and simultaneously from a peripheral forearm vein.
RESULTS: Basal central:peripheral ACTH ratio misdiagnosed four of eight patients as having non-pituitary disease. Peak uncorrected ACTH central:peripheral ratio erroneously suggested two of eight patients had non-pituitary disease. ACTH central:peripheral ratio corrected by TSH and PRL correctly predicted pituitary-dependent disease in all eight cases and provided correct lateralization data in four of five patients with a unilateral pituitary microadenoma.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that measuring other hormones in pituitary blood after TRH stimulation can offer a simple and reliable method for correcting for dilution by non-pituitary blood during bilateral simultaneous inferior petrosal sinus blood sampling in Cushing's syndrome."
8288781,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8288781/,"BACKGROUND: Individual case reports have suggested an occasional association of lichen planus with internal malignancy.
OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to describe five patients with a neoplastic disease in whom lichen planus developed.
METHODS: Serologic and immunopathologic studies were conducted.

CONCLUSION: Lichen planus may be rarely induced by neoplasia. A cell-mediated immune reaction possibly causes this phenomenon."
8289037,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8289037/,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of the Welsh general surgery (hernia and varicose veins) treatment centre established as part of the NHS reforms, in terms of its impact upon throughput and waiting lists.
DESIGN: This was a natural experiment with two control groups--other surgical specialties without treatment centre provision, and general surgery in districts that made only minor use of the facility.
SETTING: General Surgery Treatment Centre, Bridgend General Hospital.
SUBJECTS: All patients referred between 1 April 1990 and 31 March 1991.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Main outcome measures were throughput for hernia and varicose vein operations, non-urgent inpatient waiting list lengths before and after the opening of the centre and patient satisfaction. Altogether 1097 patients were referred during the year. Of these, 160 (15%) did not attend outpatient assessment and 79 (8%) of those who did were unsuitable for surgery. A total of 750 operations were performed--448 (60%) for varicose veins and 261 (35%) hernia repairs. Among the residents of the four main districts using the centre (with valid data available), there was a significant increase in the total number of varicose vein operations performed but no significant increase in hernia repairs. In the six districts that made major use of the centre, general surgery waiting lists for non-urgent cases fell significantly (p < 0.0001) while those for ear, nose, and throat showed no significant change and gynaecology lists lengthened significantly (p < 0.0001). In the three districts that made minor use of the centre general surgery waiting lists showed no change.
CONCLUSIONS: Relations between inputs and waiting lists are often unpredictable, but after controlling for confounding trends there is sound evidence that such a centre provides an acceptable and effective approach to the waiting list problem."
8291728,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8291728/,"BACKGROUND: The principle underlying the use of the self-inflating bulb in differentiating esophageal from tracheal intubation is that the trachea is held open by rigid cartilaginous rings, whereas the esophagus collapses when a negative pressure is applied to its lumen. This investigation was designed to test the efficacy of the bulb in detecting esophageal intubation in the presence of a nasogastric tube and after tracheal tube cuff deflation.
METHODS: In anesthetized patients, the trachea and esophagus were intubated with identical tubes. The efficacy of the bulb was tested after a nasogastric tube was placed (group 1, n = 70) and after cuff deflation (group 2, n = 60) by a second anesthesiologist.
RESULTS: In patients with nasogastric tubes (group 1), the anesthesiologists reported no reinflation of the compressed bulbs connected to tubes placed in the esophagus and immediate reinflation when connected to tracheally placed tubes in every case. In group 2, the determination of tube placement was correct in every case after cuff deflation. Mean (+/- SEM) negative pressures generated when compressed bulbs were connected to esophageally placed tubes were 57.8 +/- 0.48 mmHg (group 1) and 55.3 +/- 0.52 mmHg (group 2) and remained unchanged after the introduction of nasogastric tubes or after cuff deflation.
CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm that a nasogastric tube or cuff deflation does not interfere with the reliability of the self-inflating bulb in detecting esophageal intubation and thus does not contribute to false positive results. Confirmation of tracheal tube placement by this simple method makes it ideal for use with other recognized methods both in and outside the operating rooms and enables physicians and emergency personnel to proceed with other resuscitative measures."
8292434,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8292434/,"OBJECTIVE: To assess whether hemorrhoidectomy done with the Nd:YAG laser was associated with less pain or fewer complications and sequels than with conventional surgery.
DESIGN: A prospective comparative, randomized study.
PATIENTS: Over a period of six months, a total of 35 consecutive patients, 13 females and 22 males, with symptomatic hemorrhoidal disease requiring surgery, were alternatively randomized to either laser hemorrhoidectomy (17 patients) or surgery (18 patients). The type of disease and the number of affected and treated hemorrhoids were prospectively recorded in each patient. Patients were monitored prospectively for postoperative complications, pain (assessed daily for five days using a standard 10 mm. linear analogue scale), wound healing, time until full recovery and sequelae 6 moths later.
RESULTS: These two groups were well matched. No differences were seen between laser and non-laser groups for postoperative complications. Linear analogue pain scores were not significantly different between the two groups at any stage after operation. Healing time was longer in laser group. Two few patients returned at 6 months for rectoscopy for any meaningful conclusion to be drawn.
CONCLUSIONS: This study has failed to confirm any reduction in postoperative pain, complications, or healing time laser when performing a hemorrhoidectomy."

DESIGN: A prospective study of aetiological factors in subfertile men with epididymal obstruction operated on between 1975 and 1993.
SETTING: Central London.
SUBJECTS: 274 men with obstructive azoospermia undergoing epididymovasostomy; date of birth was recorded and illness in childhood, persistent nasal or respiratory symptoms, and previous urinary or genital infection were asked about.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Site of epididymal block and association with possible aetiological factors, related to date of birth.
RESULTS: 146 men had hold up in the head of the epididymis (capital blocks): 119 (82%) had Young's syndrome, and 11 gave a definite history of pink disease (mercury intoxication) in childhood. 128 had obstruction lower down towards the tail of the epididymis (caudal blocks): 64 (50%) had a history of genital or urinary infection, and only three had Young's syndrome; none had had pink disease. The incidence of Young's syndrome fell significantly from 114 (50%) of 227 men born up to 1955 to eight (17%) of 47 men born since then.
CONCLUSIONS: The decline in incidence of Young's syndrome in those born after 1955 is similar to that observed with pink disease, suggesting that both conditions may have had a similar aetiology--mercury intoxication."

8294685,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8294685/,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the duration of radiation exposure associated with new percutaneous coronary interventional devices with that associated with conventional balloon angioplasty.
BACKGROUND: Radiation exposure levels have been documented to be higher with coronary balloon angioplasty than with routine diagnostic coronary angiography. However, the effect of new interventional devices on radiation exposure has not been studied.
METHODS: Fluoroscopic and cineangiographic data from the Mayo Clinic cardiac catheterization laboratory data base of patients having single-segment coronary intervention during a recent 46-month period were retrospectively analyzed. Of 897 patients studied, 646 underwent balloon angioplasty, 138 directional coronary atherectomy (42 with adjunctive balloon angioplasty), 76 excimer laser angioplasty (50 with adjunctive balloon angioplasty) and 37 placement of an intracoronary stent (16 emergencies).
RESULTS: Duration of fluoroscopy during balloon angioplasty was 24 +/- 18 min, which was longer than with directional atherectomy (18 +/- 8 min; p = 0.001). Fluoroscopy time was 25 +/- 17 min with laser angioplasty and 29 +/- 15 min with elective stent placement (neither time was significantly different from that with balloon angioplasty). When atherectomy or laser angioplasty was performed with adjunctive balloon angioplasty or if emergency intracoronary stent placement was performed, the duration of fluoroscopy was significantly prolonged compared with balloon angioplasty alone.
CONCLUSIONS: Fluoroscopy duration is not prolonged with the use of new interventional coronary devices compared with conventional angioplasty unless adjunctive balloon angioplasty is used or emergency stent placement is required."
8297694,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8297694/,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether smoking causes ultrastructural changes in the intima of the proximal saphenous vein.
DESIGN: Proximal saphenous veins from heavy smokers and non-smokers were examined with scanning and transmission electron microscopy to determine changes in surface ultrastructure, in the intercellular junction, and in the thickness of the basal lamina. Immunogold labelling was used to identify specific components of the endothelial basal lamina.
MATERIAL: Vein specimens were obtained from patients undergoing varicose vein surgery (12 patients) or distal bypass surgery (eight patients).
MAIN RESULTS: The only ultrastructural change that discriminated between specimens was thickening of the endothelial basal lamina. All specimens with a thickened basal lamina were from heavy smokers. Immunogold labelling studies showed that the thickened basal lamina contained specific accumulations of fibronectin but not heparan sulphate proteoglycans, type IV collagen, or laminin.
CONCLUSIONS: Two ultrastructural characteristics are associated with smoking: thickening of the endothelial basal lamina and a specific accumulation of fibronectin in the thickened basal lamina. Such abnormalities in the saphenous veins from smokers may contribute to the poorer performance of these veins as bypass conduits."

METHODS: A comparison was made of frequencies of HLA types in patients with a diagnosis of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy or (n = 98) ischaemic heart disease (n = 170) and in controls from the North Western region (n = 857).
RESULTS: Neither the patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy nor those with ischaemic heart disease showed a significant increase or decrease in any HLA frequency compared with the controls.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that there is no HLA association with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy or ischaemic heart disease. This conflicts with the results of some previous studies."
8297987,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8297987/,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and compare the reliability and validity for both normal and high glycaemia values of three models of glycaemia self-analysers: Reflolux, Glucocard and One Touch.
DESIGN: Descriptive and crossover study. Validation of a measuring appliance through its comparison with a standard appliance.
PARTICIPANTS: The sample was composed of 90 blood specimens chosen by suitability sampling.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The glycaemia in the specimens was measured simultaneously by each one of the self-analysers and the central laboratory. There was high reliability (reproducibility) among the self-analysers, with correlation coefficients of 0.98, 0.97 and 0.98, with no statistically significant differences. As to intra-instrument reliability (repeatability), tested by analysing the variances of the differences, no statistically significant differences were found, except in the Glucocard self-analyser which lost precision at high glycaemia levels. Validity or accuracy, measured by the method of taking the average of the differences, showed a systematic bias in the Reflolux model, which had a value of 22.3 mg/dl above the reference model, and in the One Touch of -16.3 mg/dl. The Glucocard was the most accurate with a value of -1.78 mg/dl.
CONCLUSIONS: Portable glycaemia dosimeters are very useful in following up diabetic patients because of their high reliability, but are not useful in the diagnosis of diabetes because of their lack of accuracy. Before beginning to use a portable dosimeter, its characteristics in terms of reliability and validity must be known, in order to evaluate correctly its findings."
8299088,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8299088/,"BACKGROUND: Axillary dissection has been a routine part of breast cancer treatment for more than 100 years. Axillary node involvement is the single most important prognostic variable in patients with breast cancer. Recently, routine node dissection has been eliminated for intraductal carcinoma because so few patients had positive nodes. With the availability of numerous histologic prognosticators and the development of new immunochemical prognostic indicators, it is time to consider eliminating routine node dissection for lesions more advanced than duct carcinoma in situ (DCIS) but with extremely low likelihood of axillary involvement.
METHODS: Axillary node positivity, disease-free survival, and breast cancer-specific survival were determined for six breast cancer subgroups by T category: Tis (DCIS), T1a, T1b, T1c, T2, and T3.
RESULTS: Nodal positivity for DCIS was 0%; for T1a lesions, 3%. A large increase in nodal positivity was seen in lesions larger than 5 mm. (T1b, 17%; T1c, 32%; T2, 44%; T3, 60%). The rate of nodal positivity was statistically different as each T category was compared with the next more advanced T category. The disease-free survival and breast cancer-specific survival decreased with every increment in T value.
CONCLUSIONS: Axillary node positivity increases as the size of the invasive component increases and is an excellent predictor of DSF and breast cancer-specific survival. Consideration should be given to eliminating axillary node dissection for T1a lesions because of the low yield of positive nodes. Axillary node dissection should be performed routinely for T1b lesions and larger."
8299439,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8299439/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the 10-yr incidence of impaired glucose tolerance and NIDDM in families with a clustering of endogenous hypertriglyceridemia.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The prospective population study, where the oral glucose tolerance test and the measurement of serum lipids and lipoproteins were performed at the baseline examination and after the 10-yr follow-up, was conducted on 56 subjects (17-60 yr of age at the baseline). The subjects were from six pedigrees with a clustering of endogenous hypertriglyceridemia, and 47 of these subjects attended the follow-up 10 yr later.
RESULTS: In the study families, the prevalence of glucose intolerance and NIDDM increased from 15 to 49% (P < 0.001) and from 2 to 21% (P < 0.001), respectively, over the 10-yr period. When grouped according to the baseline serum triglyceride tertiles, 76% (P < 0.01) of the family members with highest serum triglycerides were glucose intolerant (29% impaired glucose tolerance, 47% NIDDM) at follow-up compared with 20% of those with lowest serum triglycerides. In discriminant analysis, including age, body mass index, treatment with thiazides and beta-blocking agents, and 2-h serum insulin concentration, the baseline serum triglycerides still remained as an independent predictor of development of impaired glucose tolerance and NIDDM.
CONCLUSIONS: Families with a clustering of hypertriglyceridemia are at increased risk of NIDDM, and in these families elevation of serum triglycerides serves as a risk marker of glucose intolerance and NIDDM."

DESIGN: A prospective randomized trial of consecutively treated patients attending our infertility clinic for COH and IUI.
METHODS: Patients undergoing COH by hMG and hCG were randomized to receive either one (group A) or two (group B) IUIs. Randomization was performed using a random number table. Group A IUIs were timed 35 hours after ovulatory hCG, whereas group B IUIs were performed 19 and 43 hours after hCG.
RESULTS: A total of 120 patients during 169 cycles were randomized between group A (90 cycles) and group B (79 cycles). Data analysis demonstrated no significant differences between groups A and B with respect to age, indications for COH, duration of hMG treatment, total amount of hMG administered, peak E2 levels, number of dominant follicles recruited, or mean number of total motile sperm inseminated. Pregnancy rates for groups A and B were 0.11 and 0.14, respectively. The size of our study population permits a conclusion that a 300%, 200%, or 100% difference in PR between the two groups does not exist (power 0.97, 0.80, or 0.61, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Among patients undergoing COH and IUI, increasing the frequency of insemination does not provide a significant increase in cycle pregnancy rate."
8299915,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8299915/,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: The amino acid consumption test has been proposed as an accurate test of exocrine pancreatic function. The diagnostic accuracy of this test was determined by simultaneously measuring plasma amino acids and enzyme secretion during stimulation of the pancreas with cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-OP) in 60 consecutive patients suspected of having pancreatic insufficiency.
METHODS: All patients underwent duodenal intubation and intravenous infusion of CCK-OP (40 ng.kg-1.h-1). Pancreatic enzyme (lipase and trypsin) outputs and plasma amino acids were measured for a period of 1 hour. Total and individual plasma amino acids were quantitated by ion-exchange chromatography. The severity of pancreatic insufficiency was graded on the basis of enzyme output during CCK-OP infusion.
RESULTS: There was no relationship between pancreatic enzyme output and plasma concentrations of individual or total amino acids before or during CCK-OP stimulation. Using a total amino acid decrease of 12% as the cutoff, the amino acid consumption test was 91% sensitive, but very nonspecific (21% specificity) for detection of pancreatic insufficiency.
CONCLUSIONS: The amino acid consumption test with CCK-OP stimulation does not discriminate between patients with normal and impaired exocrine pancreatic secretion."
8300358,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8300358/,"PURPOSE: To compare the contact lens-induced corneal edema recovery dynamics of human subjects with type 1 diabetes with those of age- and sex-matched normal human subjects; to compare the human data with previously reported data from alloxan-induced diabetic rabbit.
METHODS: Corneal edema was induced by 2 hours of closed eye wear with a thick, soft contact lens. After removal of the contact lens, central corneal thickness measurements were made at 30-minute intervals for 3 hours using optical pachometry.
RESULTS: Human subjects with type 1 diabetes demonstrated a significantly slower rate of corneal edema recovery than age- and sex-matched human controls. The rate of corneal edema recovery found in this study for human subjects with type 1 diabetes is similar to that previously reported for alloxan-induced diabetic rabbits.
CONCLUSIONS: The decreased corneal edema recovery ability of the patient with type 1 diabetes suggests that care should be taken when prescribing contact lens use in these people. The similarity between corneal edema recovery rates in the human subject with type 1 diabetes and the alloxan-induced diabetic rabbit supports the use of the alloxan-induced diabetic rabbit as an animal model for studies of corneal edema recovery dynamics in diabetes."
8303626,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8303626/,"BACKGROUND: In hospital clinics exercise challenge is used as a simple, non-invasive, non-pharmacological test for asthma in childhood. Little is known of its value in a community setting. An exercise test was therefore evaluated as an adjunct to a respiratory questionnaire in the course of an asthma survey.
METHODS: From a cohort of 4003 primary school children, 607 of 799 with respiratory symptoms answered a detailed respiratory questionnaire. From the same cohort 135 of 229 randomly selected asymptomatic children were also interviewed. A stratified selection of one in four of the children interviewed was then invited to take part in a six minute cold air enhanced exercise challenge test; 128 symptomatic and 26 asymptomatic children attended.
RESULTS: Bronchial hyperreactivity, a fall of FEV1 > or = 10% at five, 10, or 15 minutes following the exercise challenge, was identified in 15 of 128 symptomatic children and in one of 26 asymptomatic children. Bronchial hyperreactivity was found in only one of three children with frequent shortness of breath and one of five with frequent wheeze. It was found in 13 of 58 children whose parents were aware of the diagnosis of asthma; in 10 of 26 children who were on regular prophylactic treatment; in only 11 of 70 children with a history of exercise induced symptoms; and seldom in children with mild symptoms. Gestational age and ventilator support in the neonatal period were significant predictors of bronchial hyperreactivity.
CONCLUSIONS: Exercise testing enhanced by cold air adds very little to a well designed respiratory questionnaire in community studies of asthma in childhood."
8303743,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8303743/,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The influence of age on benefits of stroke unit rehabilitation is largely unknown.
METHODS: A prospective controlled study was undertaken in 245 stroke survivors randomized to a stroke unit or to general wards 2 weeks after stroke. Patients were divided into older (75 years and over) and younger (under 75 years) age groups, and their characteristics, prognosis, duration, and type of therapy input and outcome were compared in different settings.
RESULTS: Younger (n = 101) and older (n = 144) stroke patients were comparable for neurological and functional deficits and were distributed equally between the stroke unit and general wards. The duration of therapy input was similar in younger patients in either setting. Older patients received more occupational therapy in both settings (10.7 +/- 2.4 versus 7.9 +/- 04.1) and more physiotherapy (18.4 +/- 9.6 versus 15.2 +/- 7.8) on general wards. Younger patients on the stroke unit showed better outcome compared with those on general wards (discharge home, 83% versus 60%; median Barthel score, 17 versus 13; median length of hospital stay, 27 versus 56 days) and with older patients on the stroke unit (discharge home, 83% versus 65%; median Barthel score, 17 versus 14). Outcome in older stroke patients was similar in both settings except for a shorter median length of hospital stay on the stroke unit (36 versus 84 days). Outcome in younger patients managed on general wards was worse than that in older patients with similar prognostic expectations (discharge home, 41% versus 61%; median Barthel score, 11 versus 13).
CONCLUSIONS: Younger stroke patients benefited more by stroke unit rehabilitation compared with older patients, not only because of their age but also because of differences in the multidisciplinary input available for elderly patients outside the stroke unit."
8304023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8304023/,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate, in a prospective manner, whether fetal heart rate (FHR) variability serves as a reliable single predictor of fetal outcome.
METHODS: We undertook a prospective study of 2,200 consecutive deliveries. Preterms < 37 weeks, twins, stillbirths and fetal malformations were excluded from the study. FHR tracings were analyzed for variability in every delivery. Three windows were evaluated: 1) early in labor (30 min); 2) in the active phase of labor - 1 h prior to complete cervical dilatation (30 min); and 3) throughout the second stage of delivery, in segments of 30 min. Using the tracings taken at admission and prior to delivery, FHR variability was scored according to five previously used evaluative methods, and was correlated to the following three fetal outcome parameters: a) arterial cord blood pH < 7.2, > 7.2; b) 5-min Apgar >6, < 7; and c) immediate outcome ('good' defined as newborn going home after 2-5 days, with no neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission).
RESULTS: 1. The majority of cases with adverse fetal outcome exhibited good FHR variability (mean, 80%). 2. Low FHR variability is not common in newborns with adverse general outcome (mean, 11.5%). 3. The predictability of FHR variability (using the five most common scoring methods) for evaluating adverse fetal outcome revealed low sensitivity (mean, 20.3%) and low predictive value (mean, 11.6%).
CONCLUSION: FHR variability by itself cannot serve as the only indicator of fetal wellbeing. The presence of low variability should alert the physician; however, good FHR variability should not be interpreted as reassuring."
8304847,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8304847/,"OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to characterize the cumulative effects of multiple strokes on cognition.
DESIGN: We conducted a prospective, longitudinal case study with neuropsychological, neurological, and radiological evaluations.
SETTING: Research was conducted at the Boston (Mass) Veterans Administration Medical Center, Neurology Service, on successive inpatient hospital admissions.
PATIENT: We followed up a 66-year-old right-handed man with multiple subcortical lacunae during a 3.5-year period during which he suffered two additional cortical infarctions.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Each evaluation included approximately 3 hours of neuropsychological testing spanning a range of cognitive domains (attention, language, memory, visuospatial functions, response inhibition, and mental flexibility), full neurological examination, and computed tomographic scan.
RESULTS: The patient's stepwise cognitive decline was characterized by unexpected exacerbation of ""frontal"" neurobehavioral features following the occurrence of two posterior cortical lesions. At initial evaluation, the computed tomographic scan showed bilateral subcortical lacunae in basal ganglia and periventricular white matter, and symptoms included dysarthria and perseveration. The second evaluation, following a left posterior parietal lesion, revealed a range of new frontal features, including impulsivity, pull-to-stimulus, and difficulty shifting set. Following a subsequent right occipital infarct, further frontal lobe impairments emerged: forced grasp reflex and incontinence.
CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesize that the cumulative effects of infarcts were synergistic. That is, the posterior cortical infarcts elicited frontal features that would not be expected from a simple sum of these lesions' effects."
8304989,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8304989/,"OBJECTIVE: Most investigators presume that schizophrenia and affective disorder are separate diseases. Others have proposed alternatives to this Kraepelinian view. These alternatives were addressed by preliminary analyses of data from a family study of psychopathology.
METHOD: The authors identified 1,895 first-degree relatives of 166 patients with DSM-III schizophrenia, 71 patients with affective disorder, and 85 medical comparison probands; 949 relatives were blindly diagnosed.
RESULTS: The risks for schizophrenia and affective disorder (unipolar melancholia and bipolar disorder combined) were significantly higher in the relatives of the schizophrenic probands and the relatives of the probands with affective disorder than in the relatives of the comparison probands. The morbid risk for nonmelancholic depressions was not significantly higher. Among the relatives of the schizophrenic probands, the risk for affective disorder was highest among the relatives of the patients with ""core"" schizophrenia, who were younger at illness onset, had chronic illness, had severe emotional blunting, and showed few affective features.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite limitations, these preliminary analyses, consistent with other studies, suggest some familial relationship between schizophrenia and severe forms of affective disorder."
8305993,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8305993/,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess critically the published literature concerning medical treatment of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), and to see whether trial methodologic quality was related to a clinically relevant outcome measure.
METHODS: We identified and reviewed the methodologic quality of 102 published randomized clinical trials (RCTs) on treatment of POAG using an explicit protocol and explored the association between selected aspects of design and conduct and the studies' clinical relevance.
RESULTS: Our analysis revealed serious methodologic problems with the trials reviewed. Areas of major concern were: use of unsatisfactory or unspecified methods of randomization (89% of the trials reported no information), exclusion of some patients from the analysis (53% of the studies), failure to provide evidence of having estimated the number of patients needed to detect a prespecified treatment difference (96% failed to provide such an estimate), and incomplete description of patient characteristics (in 39% of the RCTs information on this item was insufficient). Within this generally unsatisfactory picture we found, however, that those studies adopting a double-masked design and those not excluding patients after randomization followed patients for longer periods of time and assessed treatment effectiveness using a clinically relevant outcome (that is, visual field changes) compared to other studies.
CONCLUSIONS: For clinicians to make use of the results of clinical trials, future studies must be adequately designed and conducted. In particular, proper method of randomization, masking of the observers, and inclusion of all randomized patients in the analysis must be used. Of perhaps even greater importance is the need for trials to measure clinically relevant outcomes."
8306486,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8306486/,"OBJECTIVE: We wished to analyse the relative value and diagnostic accuracy of bilateral simultaneous inferior petrosal sinus blood sampling for plasma ACTH measurements when compared with pituitary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the preoperative localization of microadenoma (tumour diameter < 10 mm) within the pituitary fossa in patients with Cushing's disease.
DESIGN: Pituitary MRIs were assessed blind and independently. The sinus blood sampling was performed before and after administration of corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH). The ratios of the ACTH concentrations in plasma samples from the inferior petrosal sinuses to the concentrations in peripheral blood plasma samples (the IPS:P ratio) and the ratios of the ACTH concentrations in samples from both inferior petrosal sinuses (the intersinus gradient) were calculated.
PATIENTS: Twenty consecutive patients with Cushing's disease were prospectively studied. All but two patients subsequently underwent transsphenoidal exploration of the pituitary fossa.
RESULTS: In three of 20 patients (15%), positioning of catheter tips in both inferior petrosal sinuses was unsuccessful. The diagnosis of Cushing's disease was confirmed by the greater basal IPS:P ratio amounting to > or = 2.0 in 13 of 17 patients (76%), and amounting to > or = 3.0 in CRH-stimulated peak samples in 15 of 17 patients (88%). Anatomical variations of the inferior petrosal sinus, precluding reliable conclusions about lateralization of pituitary venous ACTH drainage, were observed in five of 20 patients (25%). Adding the three patients with technical failure and one patient who presented with a macroadenoma (tumour diameter 11 mm), this left interpretable data with regard to lateralization of the microadenomas in only 11 of 20 patients (55%). In 15 of 20 patients (75%) a pituitary microadenoma was found at MRI. In 14 of these 15 patients (93%) a tumour was indeed found at that position at subsequent transsphenoidal operation. Concordance between the lateralization by the intersinus gradient and microadenoma localization by MRI was observed in six of 11 cases (55%) when using basal samples and in seven of 11 cases (64%) when using peak samples obtained after stimulation with CRH. Concordance between the lateralization by the intersinus gradient and subsequent microadenoma localization at surgery was observed in seven of 11 patients (64%) before and in eight of 11 cases (73%) after CRH stimulation. Reversal of the intersinus gradient after CRH stimulation, suggesting a shift in the lateralization to the contralateral side of the gland, was found in three of 12 cases (25%).
CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral simultaneous inferior petrosal sinus blood sampling for plasma ACTH measurements before and after CRH stimulation successfully confirmed the diagnosis of pituitary dependent Cushing's disease in 15 of 17 patients (88%) in whom this diagnosis was suspected on the basis of conventional biochemical testing. Magnetic resonance imaging, however, is superior to bilateral simultaneous inferior petrosal sinus blood sampling for the localization/lateralization of pituitary microadenomas in patients with Cushing's disease. Therefore, bilateral simultaneous inferior petrosal sinus blood sampling should be reserved for the assessment of those patients with Cushing's syndrome in whom either the results of biochemical tests are equivocal and/or subsequent pituitary magnetic resonance imaging gives unconvincing results."
8308178,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8308178/,"BACKGROUND: Reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS) or irritant-induced asthma is a syndrome that leaves subjects with asthma-like symptoms after one or more exposures to a high concentration of an irritant substance. The degree of reversibility of airway obstruction in subjects with RADS is nevertheless unknown, as is the degree of associated lesions at the airway level.
METHODS: We compared the acute reversibility of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) after inhalation of albuterol (200 micrograms) in 15 subjects with RADS (12 cases caused by chlorine inhalation) with that of 30 subjects with occupational asthma (OA) caused by various agents. They were paired according to baseline airway obstruction (61% and 63% of predicted value in the RADS and OA groups), requirement for medication (bronchodilator only--7 of 15 subjects with RADS and 14 of 30 subjects with OA--as compared with bronchodilator + inhaled steroids in 8 of 15 subjects with RADS and 16 of 30 subjects with OA, respectively), and interval since removal from exposure (means of 30 and 24 months in the RADS and OA groups). In addition, five nonsmokers with RADS who had not received inhaled steroids underwent bronchoscopy with lavage and bronchial biopsies less than 2 years after the exposure.
RESULTS: The percentage increase in FEV1 over baseline after inhalation of albuterol was 10% +/- 9% in the RADS group and 19% +/- 16% in the OA group (p = 0.005). Only 2 of 15 subjects (13%) with RADS and 12 of 30 subjects (40%) with OA showed an improvement in FEV1 of 20% or greater after inhalation of albuterol. Bronchoalveolar lavage showed an increased number of cells with a predominance of lymphocytes, and biopsy specimens showed increased basement membrane thickness in the five subjects with RADS who underwent bronchoscopy.
CONCLUSION: Subjects with RADS are generally left with less airway reversibility than those with OA. We suggest that this difference is secondary to distinct pathologic changes."
8308477,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8308477/,"OBJECTIVES: To study various markers of blood coagulation and fibrinolysis in relation to the extension of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and to compare the diagnostic usefulness of these markers as screening tests for excluding DVT.
DESIGN: A clinical study of patients admitted to an emergency unit.
SETTING: Ostra Hospital, Göteborg, Sweden.
SUBJECTS: One hundred and five patients with a clinical suspicion of DVT.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Phlebography was used as the reference method for a diagnosis of DVT. Small distal thromboses as well as large proximal thromboses were included. Plasma D-dimer as well as other markers of coagulation and fibrinolysis were analysed.
RESULTS: Twenty-eight proximal and 20 distal DVTs were found. Plasma D-dimers (one ELISA and two latex assays), fibrin monomer, prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (F1+2), thrombin-antithrombin III complex (TAT) and the t-PA-PAI-1 complex were all significantly correlated to the extension of DVT, whilst fibronectin, tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (scru-PA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) were not. The sensitivity was 94% for the D-dimer ELISA and one of the latex methods (latex-B), at a specificity of 60% and 68%, respectively. The negative predictive value was 92% for ELISA and 93% for latex-B, and both assays showed a negative predictive value of 100% for proximal DVTs. Fibrin monomer, F1+2, TAT, D-dimer (latex-S) and the t-PA-PAI-1 complex all showed lower negative predictive values (88, 84, 79, 78 and 65% respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Sensitivity and negative predictive values for a latex assay (D-dimer latex-B) was similar to that of a D-dimer ELISA: With a sensitivity of 94% (100% for proximal DVTs) such a latex assay may be included in a screening strategy for DVT at an emergency unit. However, the safety of such an approach has to be tested in other prospective studies."
8309371,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8309371/,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the adequacy of control of asthma in patients attending a general practice; and to examine the validity of peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) as an index of asthma severity in the context of general practice.
DESIGN: Short-term cohort study using indices derived from two weeks of peak flow monitoring to evaluate asthma control.
PARTICIPANTS: Known and newly diagnosed asthmatics aged six years or more who presented during the study period for any reason. They were enrolled if baseline forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) increased by 10% or more after the administration of nebulised salbutamol. Children under the age of 12 years with no initial response to bronchodilator were included if an exercise test performed on another day was positive.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Peak flow criteria for ""mild asthma"" in the Asthma Management Plan, 1989 (Med J Aust 1989; 151: 650-653) were used as the initial definition of ""adequate control"". The definition of ""adequate control"" was modified to variability less than 20% and a minimum PEFR of 50% or more of mean predicted value.
RESULTS: There was no association between variability and maximum PEFR, but variability was strongly correlated with minimum PEFR (R = -0.60; P < 0.0005). Asthma was adequately controlled in 68% of the participants.
CONCLUSION: Current guidelines with respect to the peak flow indices used in the classification of the severity of asthma need to be re-evaluated and probably changed for application in general practice."
8310405,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8310405/,"BACKGROUND: Postoperative choledochoscopy-related infection has been reported in the literature. We performed a prospective randomized trial to investigate the value of antibiotic prophylaxis for the prevention of such endoscopy-related infection.
METHODS: In a 2-year period from 1990 to 1991, 84 patients with biliary lithiasis were included in the study and randomized. Forty-four patients received antibiotic prophylaxis (1 gm cephalothin intravenously 30 minutes before the procedure and 500 mg cephalexin orally every 6 hours for 3 days afterward). Forty patients in the control group did not receive any antibiotics.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the groups in age, sex, preprocedure liver function, serum amylase level, white cell count, and duration of the procedure. The results of bacteriologic studies of the bile were also comparable in the two groups. One patient in the control group had transient chill and fever after the procedure. Two patients in the antibiotic group and one patient in the control group had mild abdominal pain. Mild hemobilia was noted in one patient in the antibiotic group. These complications were treated conservatively without any event. No difference was evident in the complications and the success of postoperative choledochoscopy between the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: This prospective randomized study showed that routine antibiotic prophylaxis for postoperative choledochoscopy may be not necessary in selected conditions."

A secondary objective was to review our therapeutic regimens and the need for reoperation with regard to outcome.
DESIGN: Prospective observational study.
SETTING: University hospital, secondary referral center.
PATIENTS: From 1992 to 1995, 92 patients with secondary peritonitis were examined at the University Surgical Clinic, Vienna, Austria. the populations as a whole consisted of 56 men and 36 women with an average age of 56 +/- 19 years. Forty-four percent of patients had postoperative peritonitis.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Mortality, multiple organ system failure (MOSF), relaparotomy.
RESULTS: The mortality rate in patients with an APACHE II (Adult Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation) score of less than 15 was 4.8%, while mortality rose to 46.7% in those with a score of 15 or higher (P = .001). The average total mortality rate was 18.5%. The prognosis for patients without organ failure or with failure of one organ system was excellent (mortality rate, 0%); quadruple organ failure, however, had a mortality rate of 90%. Initial thrombocytopenia ( < 60 x 10(9)/L), four-quadrant peritonitis, and diabetes mellitus were associated with significantly higher mortality. Leukopenia (white blood cells, < 6 x 10(9)/L) and inappropriate antibiotic therapy as determined by the antibiogram were mildly significant for higher mortality. The need for relaparotomy resulted in substantially higher mortality (P < .001). The impossibility of definitive operative resolution of the intra-abdominal pathologic findings at initial operation had no significant effect on mortality, possibly because planned reoperations were always carried out in those cases. For patients with definitive resolution at initial operation, it was possible to reduce the traditionally high mortality rate associated with relaparotomy on demand by making the decision for reexploration promptly, within the first 48 hours. Nevertheless, the 52.4% mortality rate observed in those cases was still much higher than the 33% found in patients who were not free of disease after the initial operation.
CONCLUSION: The prognosis in peritonitis is decisively influenced by the health status of the patient at the beginning of treatment and by any concomitant risk factors. As a result, a fairly accurate prediction of the outcome of the disease can initially be made on the basis of the APACHE II score and the MOSF score according to Goris. However, the certainty that severely ill patients with high scores often die has little clinical relevance, since it does not provide any therapeutic alternatives to the attending physician. The decision to perform a relaparotomy must be made as soon as possible, at least before MOSF emerges. Already existing MOSF will lead to the ""point of no return."""
8611971,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8611971/,"BACKGROUND AND AIM OF STUDY: Classification of the components of the right atrioventricular valve by its anatomical configuration is problematic and needs clarification.
METHODS: Fifty hearts were studied so as to analyze carefully the structure of the right atrioventricular valve and to define its component parts. Cross-sectional echocardiograms were reviewed to demonstrate the valve in closed position, and reconstructed in three-dimensional fashion.
RESULTS: The majority of specimens (62%) had three readily identifiable leaflets, but some (30%) could be described as having two leaflets while (8%) had four leaflets. The cross-sectional echocardiograms reviewed showed three definite lines of closure in all cases.
CONCLUSIONS: The eccentric placement of the anterior papillary muscle causes the leaflets to close with three lines of apposition, and this makes the valve readily distinguishable from its mitral partner. When present, extra ""scallops"" in the structure of the right atrioventricular valve merely allow better coaption of the leaflets. So, although the term ""cusp"" is less than adequate as the descriptive basis for the structure of an atrioventricular valve, the right atrioventricular valve should still be considered to be tricuspid."
8612253,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8612253/,"OBJECTIVES: To determine (a) whether the risk of a potentially inappropriate drug combination (PIDC) increases with the number of physicians involved in the medical management of an elderly patient and (b) whether the risk of a PIDC is reduced if a patient has a single primary care physician or a single dispensing pharmacy, or both.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional retrospective provincial database study.
PARTICIPANTS: A regionally stratified random sample of 51,587 elderly medicare registrants in Quebec who (a) visited at least one physician in 1990, (b) were not living in a health care institution for the entire year and (c) had been dispensed at least one prescription for a cardiovascular drug, a psychotropic drug or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).
OUTCOME MEASURES: Information on all physician visits and drugs dispensed during 1990. Physician claims were used to identify the number of physicians involved in a patient's management and whether the patient had one primary care physician. Prescription claims were used to identify the number of PIDCs, prescribing physicians and dispensing pharmacies.
RESULTS: The prevalence of PIDCs ranged from 4.0% (among those in the NSAID group) to 20.3% (among those in the psychotropic drug group). Of the PIDCs identified, 17.6% to 25.8% resulted from contemporaneous prescribing by different physicians. The number of prescribing physicians was the most important risk factor for a PIDC in all drug groups (odds ratio [OR] 1.44 to 1.71). The presence of a single primary care physician lowered the risk for cardiovascular and psychotropic PIDCs (OR 0.70 and 0.79 respectively) but not for NSAID PIDCs (OR 0.94). The use of a single dispensing pharmacy lowered the risk of a PIDC in all drug groups (OR 0.68 to 0.79).
CONCLUSION: The greater the number of physicians prescribing medications for an elderly patient, the greater is the risk that the patient will receive a PIDC. A single primary care physician and a single dispensing pharmacy may be ""protective"" factors in preventing PIDCs."
8612854,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8612854/,"OBJECTIVE: To examine whether metformin is able to reduce insulin resistance in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
DESIGN: Single-blind study comprising two successive periods of treatment: 8 weeks of placebo and 10 weeks of metformin (orally, 850 mg twice daily).
SETTING: Clinic of endocrinology and metabolism of Cerrahpaşa Medical Faculty at Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.
PATIENTS: Sixteen insulin-resistant women with PCOS.
INTERVENTIONS: Insulin sensitivity (with an IV insulin tolerance test), plasma glucose and insulin levels during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), serum androgens, and lipids were measured at baseline and after each treatment period.
RESULTS: Insulin sensitivity, the mean fasting serum levels of glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total T, free T, androstenedione, DHEAS, and LH:FSH ratio, and the areas under the curve for plasma glucose and insulin during OGTT were not changed by either placebo or metformin treatment.
CONCLUSION: Metformin does not decrease insulin resistance in PCOS. This finding suggests that cellular mechanism of insulin resistance in PCOS is different from other common insulin-resistant states such as non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and obesity."
8614037,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8614037/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine if immediate decompression is required for all high voltage injuries to the upper extremity.
DESIGN: Retrospective review.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Charts reviewed of 62 patients who had upper extremity contact with >1,000 volts of electricity over a 10-year period.
MAIN RESULTS: One hundred upper extremities were treated. Twenty-two percent were decompressed within 24 hours because of progressive nerve dysfunction, clinical compartment syndrome, or failure of resuscitation. This group required a mean of 4.2 operations with an amputation rate of 45%, similar to other series. Thirty-five percent of burned extremities had their first operative procedure delayed until resuscitation was complete. This group required a mean of 2.1 operations with no amputations. Forty-three percent of extremities did not require operations to achieve healing. Overall results show a 10.0% amputation rate and mean hospital stay of 27 days.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the need for amputation and multiple operations is determined by the injury itself and that immediate decompression is only required for the usual clinical signs of compartment syndrome. Selective decompression may actually preserve tissue and decrease the need for eventual amputation because fasciotomy can lead to soft tissue dessication by exposing viable tissue."
8615273,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8615273/,"OBJECTIVE: Periodontal disease may be a frequently unrecognized cause of maxillary sinus disease. The purposes of this study were to determine if maxillary sinus disease is more prevalent in patients with periodontal disease than in an age-and-sex-matched control group and to show radiographically an association of focal maxillary sinus disease with periodontal disease.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Maxillary DentaScans (General Electric Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI) of 84 patients (168 maxillary sinuses) with periodontal disease were retrospectively evaluated for the simple presence or absence of maxillary sinus disease. This group was compared with an age-and-sex-matched control population of 84 patients who were referred for head or neck CT scans in which the maxillary sinuses (including their inferior aspects) were visualized. For the likelihood of sinus disease in patients compared with controls, an odds ratio and a 95% confidence interval were calculated using the SYSTAT version 5.2 (SYSTAT, Evanston, IL). In the second portion of the study, the subject population alone was graded in the following fashion to establish a causal relationship: grade 0, no sinus disease; grade 1, focal sinus disease not adjacent to periodontal disease (unlikely to be caused by periodontal disease); grade 2, nonfocal sinus disease (complete opacification, air-fluid levels, or diffuse mucoperiosteal thickening; indeterminate cause), and grade 3, focal sinus disease adjacent to periodontal disease (likely to be caused by periodontal disease).
RESULTS: In the subject population--patients with periodontal disease who were referred for DentaScans--100 of 168 (60%) sinuses had sinus disease; in the control population, only 49 of 168 (29%) sinuses had sinus disease. The odds ratio for maxillary sinus disease in the patient population compared with controls was 3.6 (95% confidence interval, 2.3-5.6; p<.0001). The grading results of the subject population in the second portion of the study were grade 0, 68 sinuses (41%); grade 1, four sinuses (2%); grade 2, 32 sinuses (19%); and grade 3, 64 sinuses (38%).
CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated a twofold increase in maxillary sinus disease in patients with periodontal disease and have shown a causal relationship. Recognition of this relationship may have an impact on the clinical management of patients, particularly those planning implant surgery."
8615729,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8615729/,"OBJECTIVE: To compare three analgesic regimens in patients undergoing colon resection: patient-controlled morphine sulfate analgesia (PCA), intramuscular (IM) morphine, and IM ketorolac tromethamine.
DESIGN: Prospective randomized case series.
SETTING: Rural, private teaching hospital.
PATIENTS: All patients (307) scheduled to undergo a major colon resection between January 1, 1992, and December 31, 1993, were eligible to participate. Of these, 10 (3%) were missed in the screening process, 132 (43%) declined participation, 73 (24%) were excluded, and 92 (30%) were enrolled and randomly assigned to a treatment group.
INTERVENTIONS: Ninety-two patients were enrolled in the study. Two patients never received the medication to which they were assigned, owing to administrative error; their data was not analyzed. Of the remaining patients, 31 were randomized to the PCA morphine group, 31 were randomized to the IM morphine group, and 28 were randomized to the IM ketorolac group. The randomly assigned drug was first administered in the post-anesthesia care unit. On arrival on the postoperative ward, the patient was asked to rate his or her pain using both a numerical rating scale and a visual analog scale at 30 minutes; 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 hours after arrival on the ward; and every 4 hours throughout the first 5 postoperative days. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was administered the day before surgery and then daily for the first 5 postoperative days. The first day the patient passed flatus after surgery was also recorded.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The end points analyzed were adverse effects, duration of postoperative ileus, degree of pain control, length of hospitalization, and development of postoperative confusion as measured on serial MMSEs.
RESULTS: Only two patients, both in the PCA group, reported adverse effects; neither required a change in analgesia group. Significantly more patients assigned to IM ketorolac broke protocol and required alternative analgesia than did patients in the morphine groups (32% ketorolac vs 16% IM morphine and 0% PCA). The ketorolac group had a significantly shorter duration of ileus than either morphine group (P<.0l). The ketorolac group also had significantly lower pain scores (P<.04) and less postoperative confusion than the morphine groups (P<.03), although these results are limited by missing values. The ketorolac group had a significantly shorter length of stay than either morphine group (P<.01), while there was no significant difference between the morphine groups (P=.75).
CONCLUSIONS: While it appears that ketorolac provides a better postoperative course than either IM or PCA morphine in terms of pain control, postoperative confusion, length of stay, and duration of ileus, 18% of our patients assigned to ketorolac required additional analgesia, and there was a strong patient preference for PCA. Most patients should probably be managed with PCA narcotics, but the addition of ketorolac might reduce narcotic dose and resultant adverse effects. Those patients particularly prone to adverse effects should receive primarily ketorolac."
8615961,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8615961/,"OBJECTIVE: To study the influence of surgery in patients who achieve a response to induction chemotherapy.
DESIGN: Nonrandomized retrospective study.
SETTING: Comprehensive cancer center.
PATIENTS: The records of all patients with state III and stage IV squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx, and hypopharynx were reviewed at the Queensland Radium Institute, South Brisbane, Australia, in the years 1970 through 1990.
INTERVENTIONS: There were 314 patients where induction chemotherapy was used as part of a curative treatment. Complete response occurred in 20 patients, partial response in 110 patients, nonresponse in 162 patients, and unknown response in 22 patients. To assess the impact of surgery, the responders were divided into two treatment groups: one group (n = 57) received chemotherapy surgery, and radiotherapy (C/S/XRT), and a second group (n = 73) received chemotherapy and radiotherapy (C/XRT).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Five-year survival, local failure, nodal failure, and distant failure.
RESULTS: The 5-year actuarial survival for the chemotherapy responders and nonresponders was 58% and 43%, respectively (P < .05). When analyzed by treatment group, those receiving C/S/XRT had a 65% 5-year survival (95%) confidence intervals [CIs], 53 to 78) and those receiving C/XRT had a 56% 5-year survival (95% CI, 44 to 70). However, when the complete responders were assessed, those receiving C/S/XRT had a 90% 5-year survival (95% CI, 72 to 99) vs a 51% survival (95% CI, 18 to 89) for those treated with C/XRT. For the partial responders, the survival for the groups C/S/XRT and C/XRT were 59% (95% CI, 45 to 79) and 53% (95% CI, 41 to 67), respectively. Chemotherapy responders were less likely to fail locally if they were treated with C/S/XRT than with C/XRT (21% vs 43%, P < .01).
CONCLUSION: The results suggest that surgery still has a role to play in patients who achieve a response with chemotherapy, even when the response is complete."

DESIGN: An observational study.
SETTING: A teaching hospital in South Wales.
PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Serum selenium, albumin and total protein concentration were measured in 40 women admitted with first trimester nonrecurrent miscarriage. The results were compared with an equal number of age-matched nonpregnant healthy volunteers, and also from 40 pregnant women attending the antenatal clinic for booking in the first trimester.
RESULTS: A reduction in serum selenium normally occurs in the first trimester of pregnancies that progress to term. However, a further statistically highly significant decrease in serum selenium was observed in those women who miscarried.
CONCLUSION: Further studies are required to assess the potential benefits of selenium supplements."
8617387,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8617387/,"OBJECTIVES: To measure the degree to which dentists can accurately identify radiographic features and use their findings in the diagnosis of three lesions.
METHODS: Fourteen radiographic examples were used in this study and five features derived from the literature: border sharpness, border radiopacity, lesion shape, lesion radiopacity and root contact. A 'silver standard' for the presence of the features in the radiographic images of the lesions was established by expert observers; and a diagnostic 'gold standard' based on the histopathology of the lesions was available. Dentists scored each image according to these features and gave their diagnosis.
RESULTS: When dentists made different subjective diagnoses for a case, significant differences were found in the extent to which features were reported to be present. The degrees of presence of border sharpness (21%) and border radiopacity (46%) measured using the 'silver standard' were significantly related to the diagnosis of osteosarcoma.
CONCLUSIONS: Radiographic information is not used to its full extent and improvement in the recognition of features and the cognitive use of this radiographic information in the diagnostic process could improve diagnostic accuracy."
8617903,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8617903/,"OBJECTIVES: To compare the differences in outcomes of Medicare patients discharged from hospital to two types of nursing homes, rehabilitative and regular, and to rehabilitative facilities.
DESIGN: Criteria for distinguishing rehabilitative nursing homes (RNHs) from ordinary nursing homes (NH), based on staffing criteria, were developed by an expert panel and validated on a national sample of nursing homes. Those criteria that significantly discriminated the two types of NHs were then applied to a sample of nursing homes from a study of the outcomes of care for more than 2500 Medicare patients to classify the nursing homes in which patients were discharged. Actual discharge outcomes were compared with optimal outcomes based of predictive equations for different types of treatment (ordinary NH care, RNH care, and formal rehabilitative care).
PARTICIPANTS: Medicare patients with strokes an hip fractures discharged from 52 hospitals in three cities.
MEASUREMENTS: A disability scale that weights components of ADL measures was used as the primary outcome indicator. Nursing homes were classified as rehabilitative on the basis of the extent of staffing in rehabilitative areas.
RESULTS: Patients discharged to various types of care varied on several parameters. After adjusting for these differences, stroke patients fared better when treated in rehabilitative facilities; there was no substantial benefit for RNH care over NH care. Healthier hip fracture patients who received RNH care fared better, but functional change for sicker hip fracture patients was not different among the three groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that at least a preliminary distinction among NHs can be made on the basis of staffing patterns and that the benefits of the additional staffing may vary with the problem under consideration. More work is needed to establish just what sorts of patients are most likely to benefit from the higher level of NH care."
8618299,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8618299/,"PURPOSE: The American Urological Association (AUA) benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) guidelines committee established criteria for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with BPH. In a prospective study we determined the usefulness of these guidelines in 145 previously untreated patients with BPH symptoms.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were evaluated initially by AUA symptom score, digital rectal examination, urinalysis, serum creatinine and prostate specific antigen. Based on symptom score, patients with mild symptoms were treated with watchful waiting, while those with moderate and severe symptoms were offered watchful waiting, finasteride alpha-blockers, or laser or transurethral prostatectomy. Minimum followup was 2 years. Patients were offered a change in therapy if they had an intolerable adverse event or no improvement. Analysis included maintenance of therapy at 1 and 2 years, number of office visits and diagnostic tests performed. In addition, all patients were queried regarding which factors influenced their therapeutic choice.
RESULTS: Of 37 patients with mild symptoms 31 (81%) remained on watchful waiting at 2 years and 6 advanced to medical therapy. Among 71 patients with moderate symptoms 9 of 15 (60%) remained on watchful waiting, 27 of 36 (75%) remained on alpha-blockers and 12 of 20 (60%) remained on finasteride at 2 years. Of the 37 patients with severe symptoms 1 of 5 (20%) remained on watchful waiting, 1 of 6 (17%) remained on finasteride and 9 of 15 (60%) remained on alpha-blockers, while 3 of 5 (60%) who underwent laser prostatectomy and all 6 (100%) who underwent transurethral prostatectomy received no further treatment. At 2 years 83% of the men who selected either finasteride or alpha-blockers as either the primary or secondary therapeutic choice were still on medications. Most patients with mild (61%) or moderate (51%) symptoms cited adverse events as the predominant concern when selecting therapeutic options. In contrast, efficacy was the overriding concern (70%) in patients with more severe symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, with these guidelines and the AUA symptom score 110 men (76%) were still on original therapy at 1 year and 99 (68%) at 2 years. Additionally, 31 patients (21%) changed to an alternative, nonoperative therapy. These results suggest that the AUA BPH guidelines provide a rational and balanced approach for evaluation and management of patients with symptomatic BPH. Patients can reasonably expect to remain on the initial therapeutic option for at least 2 years."
8618334,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8618334/,"PURPOSE: Sexual differentiation in gonadal dysgenesis is commonly asymmetrical. In patients with true hermaphroditism there may be an ovary and müllerian duct on 1 side, and a testis and wolffian duct on the other side. Such asymmetry suggests that testicular hormones only act locally at this early stage of sexual differentiation. We tested the hypothesis that testosterone reaches the wolffian duct by transport down the duct rather than by simple diffusion.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mouse 14-day urogenital ridges were placed in organ culture and microinjected with testosterone-albumin-fluorescein isothiocyanate.
RESULTS: At 17 hours fluorescence was found throughout the wolffian duct and by 48 hours it was maximal in the dilated caudal end.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the hypothesis that androgens may be transported along the wolffian duct. Secretion of testicular hormones into the wolffian duct may maintain hormone levels in the biologically active range."
8618584,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8618584/,"BACKGROUND: For chronically ill patients, readmission to the hospital can be frequent and costly. We studied the effect of an intervention designed to increase access to primary care after discharge from the hospital, with the goals of reducing readmissions and emergency department visits and increasing patients' quality of life and satisfaction with care.
METHODS: In a multicenter randomized, controlled trial at nine Veterans Affairs Medical Centers, we randomly assigned 1396 veterans hospitalized with diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or congestive heart failure to receive either usual care or an intensive primary care intervention. The intervention involved close follow-up by a nurse and a primary care physician, beginning before discharge and continuing for the next six months.
RESULTS: The patients were severely ill. Half of those with congestive heart failure (504 patients) had disease in New York Heart Association class III or IV; 30 percent of those with diabetes (751 patients) had end-organ damage; and a quarter of those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (583 patients) required home oxygen treatment or oral corticosteroids. The patients had extremely poor quality-of-life scores. Although they received more intensive primary care than the controls, the patients in the intervention group had significantly higher rates of readmission (0.19 vs 0.14 per month, P = 0.005) and more days of rehospitalization (10.2 vs 8.8, P = 0.041). The patients in the intervention group were more satisfied with their care (P < 0.001), but there was no difference between the study groups in quality-of-life scores, which remained very low (P = 0.53).
CONCLUSIONS: For veterans discharged from Veterans Affairs hospitals, the primary care intervention we studied increased rather than decreased the rate of rehospitalization, although patients in the intervention group were more satisfied with their care."
8619184,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8619184/,"BACKGROUND: Sympathetic dysfunction in reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) has been purported to consist of an afferently-induced increase in efferent sympathetic nerve impulses (somato-sympathetic reflex) and/or denervation-induced supersensitivity to catecholamines. In addition, both the central and peripheral nervous systems have been claimed to be involved. It was the aim of this study to obtain more insights into these underlying mechanisms.
METHODS: In the affected extremeties of 42 patients with RSD we investigated as indirect measures of sympathetic (dys)function: (1) skin blood flow and the vasoconstrictive response to dependency of skin microvessels by means of laser Doppler flowmetry (distal to the site of trauma), (2) relative distention of the brachial artery and changes in relative distention consequent to a cold pressor test by means of ultrasonic vessel wall tracking (proximal to the site of trauma), and (3) arterial blood pressures by means of the Finapres technique. Both provocation tests induce a sympathetically mediated response. Patients were divided into three categories according to their perception of skin temperature in their injured limb (stage I, stationary warmth sensation; stage II, intermittent warmth and cold sensation; or stage III, stationary cold sensation).
RESULTS: Distal to the site of trauma, when compared with controls, skin blood flow was increased at stage I and decreased at stages II and III, whereas the vasoconstrictive response to dependency was impaired at all three stages. Proximally, when compared with controls, relative distention of the brachial artery and its response to the cold pressor test were decreased at all three stages. No differences were observed in pulse pressure between patient groups and controls.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that sympathetic dysfunction in extremities of patients with RSD distal to the site of trauma consists of hypersensitivity to catecholamines at stages II and III as a result of autonomic denervation at stage I, whereas proximal to the site of trauma sympathetic nerve impulses may be increased at all three stages."
8619185,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8619185/,"BACKGROUND: This study was undertaken to determine whether the choice of material influences the early morbidity of patients undergoing carotid patch angioplasty.
METHODS: Before undergoing carotid endarterectomy, 190 patients were randomized to receive 207 patch closures with either Dacron (USCI Sauvage knitted velour) or saphenous vein harvested from the thigh.
RESULTS: One hundred seven Dacron and 100 vein patch angioplasties were performed. No significant difference was seen between the two groups in patient age, sex preoperative risk factors, or indication for operation (p > 0.25 for each variable). Among the patients undergoing Dacron patch angioplasty three strokes (two temporary and one permanent), seven episodes of bleeding requiring reoperation, and two neck wound infections requiring rehospitalization occurred. The final 32 patients with Dacron patch closures had their anticoagulation reversed and had no bleeding complications. Complications inpatients undergoing vein patch closure included one fatal perioperative stroke, two episodes of bleeding requiring reoperation including one patch rupture, and three groin infections requiring hospitalization. No significant difference was seen between the two groups in the rate of perioperative stroke (p = 0.62), episodes of bleeding (p = 0.17), or infection (p = >0.67).
CONCLUSIONS: Carotid patch angioplasty can be performed with an acceptably low complication rate with either Dacron or vein, and the choice of patch material does not clinically affect patient morbidity. However, reversal of anticoagulation is recommended to minimize bleeding complications in patients undergoing Dacron patch angioplasty."
8619205,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8619205/,"BACKGROUND: A prospective evaluation of the liver by preoperative ultrasonography, conventional computed tomography (CT), and continuous CT angiography (CCTA) was performed in 60 patients with primary or secondary colorectal carcinoma.
METHODS: The standards of reference were palpation of the liver and intraoperative ultrasonography. The imaging techniques were assessed independently of each other.
RESULTS: In 37 patients 105 liver metastases were identified; 23 patients had no metastases. CCTA and a high sensitivity of 94% (99 lesions identified) in contrast to ultrasonography (48%) and conventional CT (52%). The superiority of CCTA was also manifest in lesions less than 1 cm in diameter. However, the high sensitivity was accompanied by a high false-positive rate, particularly because of variations in the perfusion of normal liver parenchyma. Overall, CCTA had the highest accuracy (74%) compared with ultrasonography and CT (both 57%). The data indicate that preoperative ultrasonography and conventional CT have low sensitivity in the detection of liver metastases.
CONCLUSIONS: Although CCTA seems to be superior to other preoperative imaging techniques, the too low specificity will hamper its routine application in patients with hepatic metastases from colorectal carcinoma."
8619707,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8619707/,"BACKGROUND: Early reports indicate that transmyocardial laser revascularization improves symptoms in patients with refractory angina. However, there is little experimental evidence of whether blood flow through channels is the mechanism of action.
METHODS: Endocardial channels were made in the distribution of the left anterior descending coronary artery in canine hearts (n = 5) using a holmium:yttrium-aluminum garnet laser. Hearts were excised acutely while perfused in a retrograde fashion from a second dog so that the aortic valve always remained closed. The proximal left anterior descending coronary artery was ligated. To measure direct transmyocardial blood flow, colored microspheres were injected into the left ventricular chamber.
RESULTS: The number of spheres per gram of tissue in the channel region was significantly higher than in the control region (low load, 302.5 +/- 169.0 versus 41.8 +/- 59.4; high load, 208.4 +/- 138.3 versus 5.8 +/- 11.7; both, p < 0.05). However, the estimated regional blood flow through the channels was extremely low (<0.01 mL/g/min. In the chronic setting (n = 4) (2-week survival), no flow as detected through the channels, and the endocardial entry points were closed.
CONCLUSIONS: Transmyocardial blood flow does not appear to occur through channels made with the holmium:yttrium-aluminum garnet laser. It remains to be determined whether this is the case with other types of lasers."
8619719,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8619719/,"BACKGROUND: Senescent myocardium differs from adult myocardium at both functional and cellular levels. To adjudicate the efficacy of ischemic preconditioning as an alternative or adjuvant myoprotective strategy a reproducible, age-independent, intact laboratory model is necessary.
METHODS: Adult (0.5 to 1.0 years) and senescent (5.7 to 8.0 years) sheep underwent 60 minutes of normothermic regional ischemia with 150 minutes of reperfusion. Group II (adult-ischemic preconditioning) and group IV (aged-ischemic preconditioning) underwent preconditioning with three 5-minute episodes of normothermic regional ischemia. Group I (adult-control) and group III (aged-control) were not preconditioned.
RESULTS: Risk size and infarct size weights were delineated by monastryl blue pigment infusion and buffered tetrazolium solution. Ischemic preconditioning was evidenced by an infarct size reduction of 54% for adult sheep and 47% for senescent sheep (p < 0.01 versus age-matched controls; p = not significant for adult versus senescent).
CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that the cellular pathways involved with the preconditioning response are well preserved in senescent myocardium and support the utility of the ovine heart model to investigate the clinical relevance of ischemic preconditioning for the increasingly aged population presently undergoing cardiac operations."
8620796,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8620796/,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of eversion of the anorectum during restorative proctocolectomy (RP) for ulcerative colitis on functional outcome.
METHODS: One hundred seventeen patients underwent RP with stapled end-to-end ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (EEA), without resection of the anal mucosa. Sixty-four underwent EEA with eversion of the anorectum, and 53 underwent EEA without eversion. Each patient underwent paired studies of anorectal function before and a median of 12 months after RP.
RESULTS: One year after RP, median (interquartile range) maximum resting pressure was 69 (range, 51-88) cmH2O in those patients who underwent eversion vs. 80 (range, 64-90) cmH2O in patients without eversion (P < 0.04). Threshold sensation in the upper, middle, and lower thirds of the anal canal were 9.1, 7.4, and 6.8 mA after eversion vs. 6.9, 4.9, and 3.8 mA without eversion (P = 0.003, P < 0.001, P < 0.001, respectively). Before operation, all patients had a rectoanal inhibitory reflex; however, after RP, 54 of 64 patients in the eversion group and 50 of 53 patients with a stapled EEA without eversion had an inhibitory reflex (P = not significant). Leakage of mucus was experienced by 11 patients who underwent eversion, compared with 9 patients without eversion. Fifty-six of 64 patients with eversion could defer defecation for more than 30 min compared with 43 of 53 patients without eversion. Twenty-two of 64 patients in the eversion group retained perfect discrimination between flatus and feces compared with 38 of 54 without eversion (P < 0.001). Level of the anastomosis was 1 (range, 0.5-3) cm above dentate line after eversion compared with 1.5 (range, 0-6) cm without eversion.
CONCLUSION: Clinical outcome after RP with eversion was not as good as outcome after stapled EEA without eversion. Such a conclusion requires confirmation in a prospective control trial."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between March 1976 and December 1993, 97 infants with previously untreated neuroblastoma diagnosed in 21 Italian institutions were classified as having stage IV-S disease. Seventy percent were younger than 4 months. Adrenal was the primary tumor site in 64 of 85 patients with a recognizable primary tumor. Liver was the organ most often infiltrated by the tumor (82 patients), followed by bone marrow and skin.
RESULTS: The overall survival (OS) rate at 5 years in 80% and event-free survival (EFS) rate 68%. In 24 infants, the effect of resection of primary tumor could not be evaluated because of rapidly fatal disease progression (n = 8), absence of a primary tumor (n = 12), or partial resection (n = 4). Of 73 assessable patients, 26 underwent primary tumor resection at diagnosis: one died of surgical complications, one relapsed locally and died, and two others relapsed (one of these two locally) and survived, for a 5-year OS rate of 92% and EFS rate of 84%. Of the remaining 47 patients who did not undergo primary tumor resection at diagnosis 11 suffered unfavorable events, of whom five died, for an OS rate of 89% and EFS rate of 75% (no significant difference from previous group). Disease recurred at the primary tumor site in only one five who died, and in only one of six survivors of progression or relapse; in these patients, the primary tumor, located in the mediastinum, was successfully resected.
CONCLUSION: Infants who underwent resection of the primary tumor at diagnosis had no better outcome than those in whom the decision was made not to operate."
8623111,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8623111/,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Silent brain infarctions (SBI) are common findings in advanced age, but their relationship to dementia is still uncertain. The present study was designed to evaluate whether SBI predict the development of dementia after first clinical ischemic stroke.
METHODS: We blindly studied admission CT scans of 175 consecutive nondemented patients presenting with ischemic stroke that clinically was their first stroke episode. SBI were defined as CT evidence of infarcts not compatible with the acute event. The patients were subsequently followed for their mental state for 5 years. Survival analysis, wherein onset of dementia was the end point, was performed on the total sample population and conducted separately on those with and without SBI at admission.
RESULTS: Dementia developed in 56 patients (32%), including 22 of the 63 (35%) with SBI and 34 of the 112 (30%) without SBI. Thus, dementia was not related to SBI.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that SBI do not predict the development of dementia after stroke."
8623795,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8623795/,"OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to assess the physical signs and clinical symptoms associated with endometriosis in infertile women.
STUDY DESIGN: This case-control study was carried out in an academic tertiary hospital. There were 174 infertile women with endometriosis and 174 infertile women without endometriosis, all of them studied by laparoscopy. Before laparoscopy a standard interview and a standard physical examination were performed.
RESULTS: Cul-de-sac nodularity was more frequent in infertile women with endometriosis than in infertile women without endometriosis (6.3% vs 0%). Although uterosacral tenderness was also more frequent in infertile women with endometriosis (7.5% vs 1.7%), uterosacral tenderness without nodularity was similar in both populations. Uterine retroversion and cul-de-sac obstruction frequencies were somewhat higher in the endometriosis group (p<0.10). The remaining signs and symptoms analyzed, including pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea, were similarly frequent in both populations. Symptoms were similarly frequent in all American Fertility Society stages, although adnexal mass was higher in stage IV.
CONCLUSION: Uterosacral nodularity was pathognomonic of endometriosis in infertile women. Uterosacral nodularity and uterosacral tenderness (associated with uterosacral nodularity) were the only symptoms or signs of value to indicate endometriosis in infertile patients. The remaining clinical signs, as well as clinical symptoms, were of no value in diagnosing endometriosis in infertile women."
8623845,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8623845/,"OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to determine whether pregnancy and increasing parity in women with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (1) increases the risk for diabetic nephropathy and (2) accelerates the progression of diabetic nephropathy.
STUDY DESIGN: The study included women with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus who enrolled in our diabetes-in-pregnancy trial with a pregnancy that continued beyond 20 weeks' gestation and who were delivered between 1978 and December 31, 1991, to allow for a minimum of 3 years' follow-up. Pregnancy and follow-up information was obtained from the medical records and from our computerized database. For patients followed up elsewhere, information was obtained from their current physicians. Life-table analysis was used to determine (1) the risk for nephropathy developing de novo as a function of duration of disease and the association of this risk with parity and (2) the risk of renal failure developing in women with preexisting nephropathy and its association with parity.
RESULTS: The study population included 182 pregnant women with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus: 46 with overt nephropathy (group F) and 136 without nephropathy (group NF). Pregnancy and increasing parity did not increase the overall risk for nephropathy (44% after 27 years of diabetes). In group NF 10% had nephropathy within 10.1 +/- 4.2 years of the pregnancy. Proteinuria appearing during pregnancy and glycemic control during pregnancy were significantly associated with the subsequent development of nephropathy. In group F 26% had end-stage renal disease after a median period of 6 years from the pregnancy. Pregnancy or increasing parity did not increase the risk for renal failure in women with nephropathy.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the premise that pregnancy in women with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus does not increase the risk of subsequent nephropathy and does not accelerate progression of renal disease in women with preexisting nephropathy."
8623873,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8623873/,"OBJECTIVE: We wanted to establish whether prenatal ultrasonography predicts postnatal outcome in congenital diaphragmatic hernia.
STUDY DESIGN: We designed a retrospective multicenter cohort study of 135 patients with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (122 left, 10 right, 2 bilateral, 1 anterior). In isolated left congenital diaphragmatic hernia five potential prenatal prognostic factors were studied: diagnosis at < or = 25 weeks' gestation, polyhydramnios, intrathoracic stomach, small abdomen, and major mediastinal shift.
RESULTS: None of the 44 fetuses or infants who had multiple malformations survived. Of the 91 cases of isolated congenital diaphragmatic hernia, there were 82 live births; 76 of these infants had a left congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Of these, 51 (67%) died postnatally. A statistically significant relation was found between mortality and polyhydramnios, intrathoracic stomach, and major mediastinal shift. Mortality increased as a function of the number of these prognostic factors from 20% when none was present to 94% when all three were present.
CONCLUSION: In the majority of cases of isolated left congenital diaphragmatic hernia the prognostic value of fetal ultrasonography is too low to alter perinatal management."
8624831,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8624831/,"BACKGROUND: With the current interest in toric intraocular lenses (IOLs), it is critical to establish whether these implants rotate following cataract surgery. If there is continual rotation of the implant with capsular bag contraction, then the orientation of the astigmatic correction would be unstable and thus not clinically useful.
METHODS: Twenty-eight eyes were followed for up to 6 months postoperatively. These consecutive eyes were selected on the basis of demonstrating adequate dilation following surgery, such that the points of haptic to optic insertion could be visualized with the slit-lamp microscope. Sequential photographs and comparisons of the orientation of the lenses postoperatively were performed.
RESULTS: With the exception of one lens implant, none of the 28 IOLs demonstrated significant rotation. Of the 16 eyes followed for 6 months, none demonstrated rotation of greater than 4 degrees, which was within experimental error.
CONCLUSIONS: Continued rotation of PMMA IOLs following implantation in the capsular bag seldom occurs. Thus, the concept of toric IOLs appears to be quite usable."
8628604,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8628604/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether children presenting with epidural hemorrhage (EDH) are as likely to have been abused as are children presenting with subdural hemorrhage (SDH).
DESIGN: Retrospective chart review.
SETTING: Level I regional trauma center and a regional children's hospital.
PATIENTS: All children at both institutions 3 years old or younger with a diagnosis of EDH or SDH identified by a search of the computerized trauma registry and hospital medical records from 1985 through 1991.
MEASUREMENT AND RESULTS: Complete records were found for 93 of 94 eligible subjects. The diagnosis of accidental or inflicted injury was ascertained from the patient's hospital medical record or the records of Child Protective Services. Of all subjects (n = 93), 52% (48/93) were male and the median age was 15 months. Abuse was diagnosed in 47% (28/59) of children with SDH and 6% (2/34) of those with EDH. Other significant injuries were found in 47% of children with SDH and 18% of children with EDH. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups with respect to the likelihood of identifying a skull fracture, the need for surgical evacuation of the hemorrhage, or mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data are consistent with current biomechanical concepts of intracranial injury. EDHs results from brief linear contact forces that commonly occur in unintentional falls. SDHs are caused by global high-energy rotational acceleration/deceleration forces that are commonly generated in episodes of abuse. Compared with SDH, EDH rarely results from abuse."
8628606,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8628606/,"OBJECTIVES: To examine the degree of agreement between parental reporting of the development of high-risk infants and professional assessment by a multidisciplinary team.
METHODS: The developmental status of 196 infants discharged from neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) was assessed by their parents using the Infant Monitoring Questionnaire (IMQ) at 4, 8, or 12 months' corrected age. On the same day, a clinical assessment was done by a multidisciplinary team consisting of a developmental pediatrician, physical therapist, and psychologist. The kappa statistic was used to measure agreement between the assessments. Logistic regression was used to investigate factors that might influence agreement.
RESULTS: Both the IMQ and the multidisciplinary team classified infants as developing normally (""normal""), being at risk for abnormal development (""suspect""), or developing abnormally (""abnormal""). Although the same proportion of children fell into the three categories by both assessments, parents and the multidisciplinary team showed poor agreement with respect to the classification of individual infants (kappa = 0.276). No infant or family characteristic was found to have an influence on agreement.
CONCLUSIONS: For a group of high-risk infants discharged from NICUs, the agreement between parental assessment of developmental status using the IMQ and the professional assessment by a multidisciplinary team is poor in the first year of life. We do not recommend the use of this questionnaire as a substitute for clinical assessment of biologically at-risk infants discharged from NICUs. However, it may be useful for those groups of infants for whom no other information is available or as an adjunct to clinical assessment when infants are not behaving typically because of an unfamiliar setting or concurrent illness."
8628882,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8628882/,"PURPOSE: To determine if altered weight bearing causes the appearance of marrow edema on magnetic resonance (MR) images.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve volunteers underwent MR imaging with a short inversion time inversion-recovery (STIR) sequence at 1.5 T. The hips, knees, ankles, and feet were evaluated before and 2 weeks after altered weight bearing achieved with overpronation of one foot. Three volunteers underwent imaging a third time, 2 weeks after overpronation was stopped. Two observers assessed the images for evidence of marrow edema.
RESULTS: Changes were seen on images in 11 volunteers; the overpronated side only was affected in 10. Most changes occurred in the foot followed by the tibia and the femur. Most changes were a diffuse increase in marrow edema. In two volunteers, the changes resembled those of stress fractures.
CONCLUSION: Altered weight bearing should be added to the list of causes of increased medullary signal intensity (ie, marrow edema) on MR images."
8629649,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8629649/,"PURPOSE: New methods of measuring and controlling glycemia in diabetes mellitus have been developed and implemented in the past 10 years. We examined whether glycemia, as measured by glycosylated hemoglobin, changed in outpatient insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) populations between 1985 and 1993 and whether contemporaneous changes in therapy could account for observed changes in glycemia.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Outpatients were selected based on having glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) measured in the Massachusetts General Hospital laboratory during March 1985 (IDDM n = 94 and NIDDM n = 137) or during March 1993 (IDDM n = 89 and NIDDM n = 118). Chart reviews established demographic and clinical characteristics, including frequency of blood glucose self-monitoring, insulin injections, office visits, and HbA1c measurements during the year prior to the HbA1c result.
RESULTS: Mean HbA1c level was significantly lower in the 1993 IDDM cohort compared with the 1985 cohort (8.77% +/- 1.7% versus 9.47% +/- 2.1%, P = 0.014). In the NIDDM cohorts, the difference in mean HbA1c did not achieve statistical significance (8.35% +/- 1.6% in 1993 versus 8.75% +/- 2.1% in 1985, P = 0.09); however, when adjusted for differences in NIDDM duration, HbA1c in the 1993 cohort was significantly lower than that in the 1985 cohort. The largest decrease in HbA1c in NIDDM was in patients treated with insulin (9.53% +/- 2.0% versus 8.54% +/- 1.5% in 1985 and 1993, respectively, P = 0.004). Multiple linear regression analyses demonstrated that increased frequency of self-monitoring and of insulin injections were associated with lower HbA1c in IDDM.
CONCLUSIONS: The level of average glycemia has decreased in IDDM patients over the past 8 years, attributable, at least in part, to an increased frequency of monitoring and of insulin injections. Glycemia decreased in NIDDM, especially in the subset of patients treated with insulin. This temporal shift in glycemic control should have a salutary effect on the development of long-term microvascular and neurologic complications."
8629754,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8629754/,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To define the contribution of domestic violence (DV) to homicides in women in New Mexico and to examine differences in ethnicity, mechanism, previous documented injuries, incidence of sexual assault, and use of alcohol or illicit drugs between DV- and non-DV-related homicides.
METHODS: We carried out a retrospective analysis of reports of the state office of the medical investigator (OMI) reports from all female homicides from 1990 to 1993 in New Mexico. A homicide was defined as being related to DV if the perpetrator was a current or former male intimate partner. The chi-squared and Mann-Whitney tests were used to analyze data.
RESULTS: The OMI investigated 134 homicides in women for an overall fatality rate of 4.3 per 100,000. A male intimate partner was the perpetrator in 62 cases (46%). The rate of DV homicide among American Indians (4.9 per 100,000) was significantly higher than that among Hispanics (1.7) and non-Hispanic whites (1.8)(RR=2.8; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.5 to 5.1). Firearms were almost two times as likely to be used in DV homicides as in non-DV homicides (RR=1.8; 95% CI, 1.2 to 2.6). Evidence of old injuries was found more often in DV homicide cases (35.5%) than in non-DV cases (83%) (RR=4.3; 95% CI, 1.8 to 9.8). The presence of alcohol or other drugs was higher among non-DV homicide victims (69%) than DV homicide victims (54.3%) (P=.03).
CONCLUSION: American Indian women are at particularly high risk of homicide, including DV homicide. Firearms were overrepresented in DV homicides, suggesting that removing firearms from the homes of previous DV perpetrators would be a useful public health strategy. Alcohol or illicit drugs were found in approximately two thirds of New Mexico women who were victims of homicide. The high prevalence of history of previous injuries among DV homicide victims indicates that early identification of DV victims in the emergency department and other health care settings is an important point of intervention."
8629975,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8629975/,"BACKGROUND: Ten Vietnamese boat people with septicaemic shock or pneumoperitoneum were admitted between April and July 1993.
METHODS: In order to investigate the cause of unexplained septicaemic shock and spontaneous pneumoperitoneum in Vietnamese boat people, an audit was carried out. Attention was paid to the mode of presentation, abnormal physical signs, presence of injection marks, radiological signs, subsequent progress outcome.
RESULTS: The clinical and radiological findings were all in favour of self-inflicted conditions. A retrospective review from the hospital record revealed that the emergency admission rate and disappearance rate of the Vietnamese boat people was higher than those of other patients (P<0.001).
CONCLUSION: It is concluded that self-inflicted conditions are a serious problem among the Vietnamese boat people, who may use a hospital admission to avoid the detention centre."
8629981,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8629981/,"BACKGROUND: An accurate guide to the common femoral artery (CFA) is important in vascular patients as the CFA pulse may not me palpable. At least four different descriptions of the surface anatomy of the CFA are given in standard anatomic texts. This study was undertaken to determine the accuracy of the mid-inguinal point as a guide to the CFA in patients undergoing femoral arteriography.
METHODS: The surface anatomy of the CFA was determined using true anteroposterior arteriograms of 30 patients [20 men, 10 women, age (mean +/- s.d.) 67 +/- 6.8 years, range 56-82].
RESULTS: The distance between the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) and the symphysis pubis was measured with callipers and defined as the inguinal distance [(mean +/- s.d.) 16.03 +/- 1.06 cm, range 14.00-18.50]. The midpoint of this line defined the mid-inguinal point. Similarly, the distance was measured from the symphysis pubis to the midpoint of the CFA where it crossed the inguinal line on the arteriogram, and was defined as the femoral distance [(mean +/- s.d.) 7.99 +/- 0.51 cm, range 6.80-9.00]. The location of the CFA coincided with the mid-inguinal point in only six (10%) of the 60 measurements. The difference between the CFA and mid-inguinal point varied from 1.25 to 1.50 cm either side of the mid-inguinal point, and in six (10%), the difference was 1 cm more, and therefore of clinical significance.
CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of these findings we conclude that the relationship between the mid-inguinal point, found using bony landmarks, is an appropriate guide to the CFA as it can be expected to lie within 1.5 cm either side of the mid-inguinal point. The natural variability observed could account for the different anatomical descriptions of the surface anatomy of the CFA. No exact definition may be possible."
8630116,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8630116/,"OBJECTIVE: Cumulative damage to tissues, mediated by reactive oxygen species, has been implicated as a pathway that leads to many of the degenerative changes associated with aging. We hypothesized that increased intake of antioxidant micronutrients might be associated with decreased rates of osteoarthritis (OA) in the knees, a common age-related disorder.
METHODS: Participants in the Framingham Osteoarthritis Cohort Study underwent knee evaluations by radiography at examinations 18 (1983-1985) and 22 (1992-1993). Usual dietary intake was assessed using the Food Frequency Questionnaire, administered at examination 20 (1988-1989). Knees without OA at baseline (Kellgren and Lawrence [K&L] grade < or = 1) were classified as having incident OA if they had a K&L grade > or = 2 at followup. Knees with OA at baseline were classified as having progressive OA if their score increased by > or = 1 at followup. Knees were also classified as having cartilage loss or osteophyte growth if their maximal joint space narrowing or osteophyte growth score increased by > or = 1 (range 0-3). The association of vitamin C, beta carotene, and vitamin E intake, ranked in sex-specific tertiles, with incidence and progression of OA was compared with that of a panel of nonantioxidant vitamins, Bl, B6, niacin, and folate, using logistic regression and generalized estimation equations to adjust for correlation between fellow knees. The lowest tertile for each dietary exposure was used as the referent category. Odds ratios (OR) were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, weight change, knee injury, physical activity, energy intake, and health status.
RESULTS: Six hundred forty participants received complete assessments. Incident and progressive OA occurred in 81 and 68 knees, respectively. We found no significant association of incident OA with any nutrient. A 3-fold reduction in risk of OA progression was found for both the middle tertile (adjusted OR = 0.3, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.1-0.8) and highest tertile (adjusted OR = 0.3, 95% CI 0.1-0.6) of vitamin C intake. This related predominantly to a reduced risk of cartilage loss (adjusted OR = 0.3, 95% CI 0.1-0.8). Those with high vitamin C intake also had a reduced risk of developing knee pain (adjusted OR = 0.3, 95% CI 0.1-0.8). A reduction in risk of OA progression was seen for beta carotene (adjusted OR = 0.4, 95% CI 0.2-0.9) and vitamin E intake (adjusted OR = 0.7, 95% CI 0.3-1.6), but was less consistent. No significant associations were observed for the nonantioxidant nutrients.
CONCLUSION: High intake of antioxidant micronutrients, especially vitamin C, may reduce the risk of cartilage loss and disease progression in people with OA. We found no effect of antioxidant nutrients on incident OA. These preliminary findings warrant confirmation."
8631243,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8631243/,"OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of pentamidine aerosol inhalation, known to be effective and well tolerated in the primary prevention of HIV-associated Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), on the severity, on clinical and radiological findings and prognosis of break-through PCP.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data were obtained from the case notes of 17 men (mean age 36 [23-55] years) with HIV-associated PCP, treated between 1989 and 1994, who had received primary prophylaxis with pentamidine aerosol. During the same period 42 patients with HIV-associated PCP but no pentamidine prophylaxis (39 men, three women; mean age 36 [21-67] years) were also treated. Bronchoalveolar lavage of the most affected segment was performed. Diagnostic measures and treatment remained constant during the period of observation.
RESULTS: The clinical presentation was the same in the two groups. There was also no difference between them regarding sensitivity to the lavage (94 and 98%). However, infiltration of the upper segments was significantly more common in the prophylaxis group (90 and 43%; P < 0.02). There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in death rate (13 and 7%) and the long-term prognosis after PCP (survival time 18 and 24 months, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Primary prophylaxis of PCP had no significant effect other than altering the distribution pattern of the pneumonic infiltrates towards the apical segments."
8632928,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8632928/,"OBJECTIVE: Markers currently used to identify infants at highest risk for perinatal hypoxic-ischemic cerebral injury are insensitive in predicting the subsequent occurrence of neonatal seizures and/or neurodevelopmental sequelae, ie, cerebral palsy. To facilitate therapeutic strategies, early identification of the infant at highest risk for developing seizures secondary to hypoxia ischemia or asphyxia is critical, particularly if novel but potentially toxic therapies currently under experimental investigation become available for clinical use.
METHODS: Ninety-six inborn term infants considered at high risk for having neonatal seizures secondary to hypoxia ischemia or asphyxia and admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit directly after labor and delivery were prospectively evaluated. Markers of high risk included the presence of moderate to thick meconium-stained amniotic fluid (MSAF), fetal heart rate (FHRT) abnormalities abruptio placentae, intubation and positive pressure ventilation in the delivery room (DR), chest compressions and epinephrine administration as part of resuscitation, a 5-minute Apgar score of 5 or less, umbilical cord arterial pH of 7.00 or less, and/or a base deficit of -14 mEq/L or more negative.
RESULTS: Seizures developed in 5 (5.2%) of the 96 infants. High-risk markers included FHRT abnormalities only (n=36), FHRT abnormalities and MSAF (n=20), MSAF only (n=23), abruptio placentae (n=6), intubation in the DR (n=44), intubation in the neonatal intensive care unit (n=22), chest compressions (n=2), 5-minute Apgar scores of 5 or less (n=21), umbilical cord arterial pH of 7.00 or less (n=21), and base deficits of -14 mEq/L or more negative (n=19). By univariate analysis, significant relationships with seizures were found with Apgar scores, the need for intubation in the DR, umbilical cord arterial pH, and base deficit. Combinations of the identified risk markers showed a strong relationship with seizures with the following odds rations (ORs), 95% confidence limits, sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive values (PPVs): (1) low cord pH and intubation, OR, 163 (confidence limits, 7.9 and 3343.7); sensitivity, 100%; specificity 94%; and PPV, 50%; (2) low cord pH and low 5-minute Apgar score, OR, 39 (confidence limits, 3.9 and 392.5); sensitivity, 80%; specificity, 91%; and PPV, 33.3%; and (3) low pH, intubation, and low 5-minute Apgar score, OR, 340 (confidence limits, 17.8 and 6480.6); sensitivity, 80%; specificity, 98.8%; and PPV, 80%.
CONCLUSIONS: A combination of high-risk postnatal markers, specifically, a low 5-minute Apgar score and intubation in the DR in association with severe fetal acidemia, facilitates the identification within the first hour of life of term infants at highest risk for developing seizures secondary to perinatal asphyxia."
8633151,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8633151/,"PURPOSE: To describe the clinical, radiologic, and pathologic findings in patients with uremic leontiasis ossea (ULO).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five patients with renal osteodystrophy developed marked hyperostosis of the facial and cranial bones. Radiologic studies included plain radiography of the skull (n = 5), computed tomography with three-dimensional reconstruction (n = 4), magnetic resonance imaging (n = 3), and fluorine-18 sodium fluoride positron emission tomography (PET) (n = 1). Specimens from bone biopsies (three patients) were examined.
RESULTS: Skull and facial alterations were remarkably similar. Numerous nodules of varying attenuation and signal intensity in the widened diploic space suggested brown tumors in different stages of evolution. Biochemical data and PET findings enabled confirmation of markedly increased bone turnover. Bone specimens demonstrated severe osteitis fibrosa. After parathyroidectomy, facial changes in all patients stabilized or improved mildly.
CONCLUSION: A similar entity in animals, ""bighead"" disease, which results from nutritional and uremic secondary hyperparathyroidism, may provide a useful animal model for ULO in humans. Mild forms of this entity may be more common than the scarcity of previous reports suggests."
8633171,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8633171/,"PURPOSE: To determine if the ultrasound (US) survey of the lower extremity for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) can be curtailed without compromising diagnostic efficacy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors performed 755 US examinations in 721 patients (1,024 lower extremities) referred for suspicion of lower extremity DVT. The full lengths of the deep veins were studied, and findings were categorized at five locations: common femoral vein (CFV), proximal superficial femoral vein (CFV), mid-SFV, distal SFV, and popliteal vein (PV).
RESULTS: Acute thrombus was seen in one or more veins in 131 (17.4%) of the 755 examinations. DVT isolated to a single vein was seen in 28 (21.4%) of the 131 positive examinations: DVT was limited to the CFV in eight studies (61%), to the SFV in six studies (4.6%), and to the PV in 14 studies (10.7%).
CONCLUSIONS: DVT limited to a single vein occurs with sufficient frequency that the US screening survey cannot be abbreviated without loss of diagnostic efficacy."
8633177,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8633177/,"PURPOSE: To determine to usefulness of barium enema examination in detecting dysplasia in patients with ulcerative colitis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Radiographic findings of 22 areas of dysplasia in 10 patients (seven men, three women; aged 34-81 years at diagnosis) were reviewed. Serial changes in radiographic features of four areas of dysplasia in three patients were retrospectively investigated.
RESULTS: Fourteen of 22 areas of dysplasia were shown on radiographs. Dysplasia in the rectum or sigmoid colon was depicted less frequently than that in other segments of the colon. Radiographic features were classified as obvious nodular protrusions (seven lesions), irregular mucosa (five lesions), or nodular protrusions with irregular mucosa (two lesions). Six of the seven areas of dysplasia shown as irregular mucosa were accompanied by minute spiculations in the margin of the colonic lumen. There was no correlation between radiologic features and histologic grade of dysplasia.
CONCLUSION: Barium enema examination may be used as a complementary method of cancer surveillance with endoscopy. These methods show about two-thirds of lesions associated with dysplasia."
8633257,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8633257/,"PURPOSE: A 53-year-old female patient was treated with combined radiochemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) because of adenocarcinoma of the lung. She died after the 2nd day of the first course on fatal myocardial infarction. The histological evaluation of the heart revealed no severe chronic fibrosis. In our opinion the myocardial infarction was partly 5-fluorouracil-related in this case.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Published case reports on this theme were reviewed and discussed.
RESULTS: The review of the literature showed a 5-FU associated cardiotoxicity in 98 cases. Most of the patients were without evidence of pre-existing myocardial disorders. The discussion about the reasons of the 5-FU-associated cardiotoxicity is still going on. Cardiotoxicity will rise up in 1.1% to 4.5% of the patients treated with 5-FU. Patients with a history of cardiac disease were at significantly increased risk for 5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity.
CONCLUSION: In high-risk-patients 5-FU should not be given without electrocardiographic monitoring. The continuous infusion is better than a bolus treatment."

METHODS: One hundred five patients (52 with tumors confined to the bladder and 53 with extravesical spread) were evaluated for cystectomy. The presence of nodal metastasis at surgery or biopsy was correlated with preoperative CT findings.
RESULTS: The CT scan was abnormal (nodes > 1.5 cm in size) in 32% and normal (nodes < 1.5 cm) in 68% of 28 patients with positive nodes. Of 52 cases with T2 tumors, CT scan was abnormal in 6, 14% (1 of 7) with positive and 11% (5 of 45) with negative nodes, whereas of 53 with T3-4 tumors, 15 had abnormal scans, 38% (8 of 21) with positive and 22% (7 of 32) with negative nodes. CT scan changed management (a biopsy deferred surgery) in 2 (2%) of the 105 cases.
CONCLUSIONS: A routine CT scan was not helpful in management of operable T2 tumors but might change therapy in selected patients with T3-4 tumors who are considered for cystectomy."
8633397,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8633397/,"OBJECTIVES: Individual differences in proportion of stroma, epithelium, and luminal space components prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) may explain the differences in clinical outcome of the patients treated with alpha-reductase inhibitors or alpha-blocking agents and other alternative treatments. Knowledge of the individual proportions of these elements may orient the clinician toward different therapeutic approaches. To determine whether a single prostate biopsy is representative of the whole adenoma, using quantitative morphometry, we have compared the percentage of smooth muscle cells and glandular cells in one prostate needle biopsy and in the corresponding prostate adenoma removed by open surgery.
METHODS: Quantification was made using a computerized image analysis system and immunohistochemical staining (actin antiactin for the smooth muscle cells and anti-prostate-specific antigen (PSA) for the epithelial cells) in 14 patients who underwent retropubic prostatectomy.
RESULTS: Mean percentage of smooth muscle fibers, glandular epithelium, and glandular lumina in the prostate biopsy were, respectively, 34% (range, 20% to 42%, SD 5.9), 29% (range, 13% to 42%, SD 7.2), and 20% (range, 13% to 30%, SD 4.8). In the corresponding prostate adenoma, they were, respectively, 38% (range, 28% to 45%, SD 4.7), 32% (range, 25% to 40%, SD 4.5), and 19% (range, 13% to 34%, SD 6.1). The mean percentages of epithelial or glandular cells in the prostate biopsy and the corresponding adenoma were not statistically different (P > 0.05), whereas those for the smooth muscle cell percentage were different (P = 0.02). However, a statistically significant correlation between the whole adenoma and the needle biopsy sample was found in the percentage of smooth muscle cells (P = 0.028). Analyzing the morphometric data in conjunction with the serum PSA level and the volume of the adenoma, we found a statistically significant positive correlation between the volume of the adenoma and the ratio (percentage of epithelial cells/serum PSA level) (P = 0.009, r = 0.67).
CONCLUSIONS: Major differences are found in the primary tissue composition of different hyperplastic prostates. Computerized histologic quantification of the different components of BPH in the entire adenoma and a needle biopsy demonstrate that a single prostate biopsy is representative of the entire prostate adenoma. Morphometric data from a single biopsy of the prostate adenoma in combination with the serum PSA level and the volume of the prostate adenoma could therefore help to orient medical treatment of BPH by patient selection based on the knowledge of the distribution of the various components of BPH."
8633508,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8633508/,"OBJECTIVES: The gastric mucosa of patients with portal hypertension frequently manifests changes in its appearance that are readily identifiable by endoscopy. Many of these can be sources of bleeding, and some imply the presence of systemic disease. Although portal hypertension is critical in development of portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG), the role that other factors might play in its pathogenesis is uncertain.
METHODS: Four groups of subjects were studied prospectively: 37 with portal hypertension due to cirrhosis, 26 noncirrhotic subjects with portal hypertension due to extrahepatic portal vein obstruction (PVO), nine cirrhotic patients with extrahepatic PVO, and 57 control subjects. The diagnosis in each case was based on a combination of clinical data, needle liver biopsy, ultrasonography, splenoportography, and upper GI endoscopy.
RESULTS: Snake skin, scarlatina rash, diffuse hyperemia, and diffuse bleeding were frequent endoscopic gastric findings in cirrhotic patients. These findings were seen less frequently in noncirrhotic patients with portal hypertension due to PVO than in cirrhotic patients (p< 0.0001). The highest incidence was seen in cirrhotic patients with PVO (P< 0.001). Positive correlations existed among the endoscopic findings, the clinical estimate of the cirrhosis severity (Child-Pugh grade), and the size and appearance of esophageal varices (Beppu score). No endoscopic findings of the gastric mucosa enabled one to distinguish between groups. Hypergastrinemia was present in cirrhotics with and without PVO but not in noncirrhotic patients with portal hypertension resulting from isolated PVO.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the endoscopic findings of PHG are affected by the severity of the underlying liver disease and the presence or absence of coexisting PVO. There is no association between PHG and the presence of gastric varices. Thus, the development of the gastric lesions characteristic of PHG requires not only portal hypertension but also some other consequence of parenchymal liver disease."
8633577,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8633577/,"BACKGROUND: Rectal motor activity is incompletely understood. The aim of this study was to characterize the patterns of rectal motor activity and to examine their diurnal variation and their relationships to proximal colonic activity and to meals.
METHODS: We performed a 30-h ambulatory motility study by recording pressure activity at multiple sites in the colon in 18 normal subjects.
RESULTS: During 288 h of recording, discrete bursts of tonic and phasic activity were seen in the rectum of all subjects at night and during the day lasting > or = 3 min, with a predominant frequency of 3 waves/min: periodic rectal motor activity (PRMA). Nocturnally, the number of cycles and the proportion of time occupied by this activity were greater (p < 0.001) and the inter-cycle interval was shorter (p < 0.008) compared with daytime, but the cycle duration was similar. Only 4 versus 5% (nocturnal vs daytime) of cycles propagated aborad, whereas 36 versus 14% (p < 0.01) propagated retrogradely, 16 versus 47% (p < 0.01) occurred simultaneously, and 44 versus 34% were confined to the rectum. There was considerable intra- and intersubject variability. PRMA was not related to meals or to anal motor activity, but 81% of nocturnal and 94% of daytime cycles occurred within 5 min of a motor event in the more proximal colon.
CONCLUSIONS: PRMA is a characteristic feature of the normal rectum and is more frequent at night. The temporal association with motor events in the proximal colon suggests that PRMA is triggered by the arrival of stool or gas in the rectum. Because most cycles are either segmental or are propagated retrogradely, PRMA may serve as an intrinsic braking mechanism that prevents untimely flow of colonic contents, particularly during sleep."
8633651,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8633651/,"OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine whether the Ballard score, a maturity score for neonatal neuromuscular and physical development, is more advanced in preterm infants of preeclamptic women than in controls.
STUDY DESIGN: A matched cohort study design was used. One hundred women with strictly defined preeclampsia (new-onset hypertension, proteinuria, and hyperuricemia) were matched for gestational age, race, and gender to 100 normotensive women with preterm delivery. All patients had an assigned antenatal gestational age based on ultrasonography before 24 weeks. The gestational age, based on antenatal ultrasonography and last menstrual period, was compared with the Ballard score given at the time of neonatal physical examination within the first 12 hours after delivery. The difference in gestational age between the Ballard score and antenatal ultrasonography (Ballard score - ultrasonography) was calculated for each patient. Results are expressed as median and range and are compared with a Student t test.
RESULTS: The mean gestational age at delivery by antenatal ultrasonography in patients with severe preeclampsia was 32.06 +/- 2.74 and 32.03 +/- 2.70 weeks, respectively. The median difference between scores in patients with severe preeclampsia and normal patient were 1.3 +/- 1.8 and 1.5 +/- 1.6 weeks, respectively (p = 0.41).
CONCLUSION: On the basis of criteria defined by the Ballard score, preeclampsia was not associated with accelerated fetal neurologic and physical development."
8633670,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8633670/,"OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to determine the feasibility of providing a cervical screening facility to the underprivileged communities through an educational program and a mobile clinic in which cytologic smears could be taken, screened immediately, and, when appropriate, the patients treated on site with minimal delay.
STUDY DESIGN: A prospective study was conducted in two parts on 5045 patients living in squatter areas around Cape Town, South Africa. The patients were educated about cervical cancer and its prevention and were offered a free Papanicolaou smear taken in a fully equipped mobile clinic. These were immediately stained and processed. Patients diagnosed cytologically as having high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions were assessed colposcopically and, when indicated, immediately treated by large loop excision of the transformation zone under local anesthesia.
RESULTS: In phase 1, colposcopy was done in the nearest colposcopy clinic, 20 km from the screening site. The defaulter rate was 66%. In phase 2, colposcopy and treatment were offered on site. A total of 97% of patients referred for colposcopy attended the clinic, and all patients requiring treatment have been adequately treated.
CONCLUSION: With a rapid turnaround time for the reporting of cytologic results and given a colposcopy and treatment facility available located at the screening site at the time women receive their results, the majority of women will undergo colposcopy and treatment."
8633681,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8633681/,"OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to test the hypothesis that wedging of the cervical internal os determined by transvaginal ultrasonography is associated with premature labor and delivery.
STUDY DESIGN: Seventy patients admitted to the hospital for threatened preterm labor were evaluated by transvaginal ultrasonography before institution of therapy. Bivariate and logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the variables that made a significant contribution to the prediction of preterm delivery.
RESULTS: Preterm delivery was significantly associated with the presence of cervical wedging, as noted on cervical scan, and with short cervical length. A history of previous preterm delivery was of marginal significance as a predictor of preterm delivery (p=0.09). Preterm delivery was not significantly correlated with age, previous voluntary termination of pregnancy, gestational age at the time of study, previous normal spontaneous vaginal delivery, or tocolytic therapy. Use of wedging as a diagnostic test for the prediction of preterm delivery yielded a sensitivity of 100% a specificity of 74.5%, a positive predictive value of 59.4%, and a negative predictive value of 100%.
CONCLUSION: The presence of wedging and shorter cervical length was suggestive of true preterm labor requiring aggressive management. A transvaginal ultrasonographic ""snapshot"" view of the cervix seems to be a more reliable method to evaluate the cervix in patients with threatened premature labor than are uterine contractions alone."
8633740,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8633740/,"OBJECTIVES: An association of smoking with depression and anxiety has been documented in adult smokers. This study examines this association in a representative group of teenage smokers.
METHODS: A two-stage cluster sample of secondary school students in Victoria, Australia, were surveyed by using a computerized questionnaire, which included a 7-day retrospective diary for tobacco use and a structured psychiatric interview.
RESULTS: Subjects reporting high levels of depression and anxiety were twice as likely to be smokers after the potential confounders of year level, sex, alcohol use, and parental smoking were controlled for. Regular smokers were almost twice as likely as occasional smokers to report high levels of depression and anxiety. In a stratified analysis, an association between regular smoking and psychiatric morbidity was found in girls of all ages but for boys only in the youngest group.
CONCLUSIONS: The cross-sectional association is consistent with the use of smoking by teenage girls as self-medication for depression and anxiety. Therefore, future health promotional campaigns might consider strategies that attend to perceived psychological benefits of smoking."
8634041,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8634041/,"BACKGROUND: Reported recurrence rates for incompletely excised basal cell cancers (BCC) vary widely (30-67%), and the destructive potential of recurrent BCC is well known. When surgically treated BCC are reported by the pathologist as incompletely excised the surgeon is placed in the dilemma of whether to perform an immediate wider excision, or to reserve further treatment until there is clinical evidence of recurrence. The aim of the present study is to determine if there are any clinical or morphological features which may help in this management dilemma.
METHODS: Middlemore Hospital histology records were reviewed. In 1986, 82 out of a total of 723 BCC excised were reported to be incompletely excised. The management and recurrence rates of the incompletely excised BCC were determined from the patient records and telephone follow up where necessary. The clinical and morphological features were correlated with the recurrence rates, with the aim of developing a management strategy.
RESULTS: The overall recurrence rate was 30.0%. Median time to recurrence was 18.5 months (range 1.5-55 months). Neither the margin of incomplete resection (deep, lateral or both margins), the site of tumour, the histological variant, the sex of the patient, nor prior treatment had any discernible effect on recurrence rates.
CONCLUSIONS: Observation is an acceptable management option in most situations, as only one-third of incompletely excised lesions needed further treatment. Most recurrences occurred early and careful follow up of these patients was indicated for at least 3 years."
8634398,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8634398/,"PURPOSE: To analyse how far dose calculations for the CT examination of the thorax and abdomen can lead to faulty estimations of organ doses and effective dose due to differences in the topographic anatomy between mathematical phantom and man.
METHODS: For the CT examination of the thorax, upper abdomen, pancreas, pelvis and the entire abdomen, organ doses were calculated with conversion factors, first with regard to the topographic relation within the phantom, then with additional regard to the real anatomy of the man.
RESULTS: In the phantom, the abdomen lies outside the scan volume in case of CT-examination of the thorax and the whole intestine outside the scan volume in case of CT-examination of the upper abdomen and the pancreas, whereas the entire intestine is directly exposed in case of CT-examination of the pelvis. Dependent on whether dose calculations take real anatomy into account, doses of special organs can differ by a factor greater than 15. The calculated effective doses differ by a factor less than 1.5.
CONCLUSIONS: Calculations of organ doses for the CT examination of the thorax and abdomen can lead to considerable errors due to different topographic relations between phantom and man. In contrast the calculated effective dose is realistic. Hence, dose calculations with the help of mathematical phantom is an efficient method to estimate the total radiogenic risk."
8634406,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8634406/,"PURPOSE: To evaluate whether meglumine-sodium-ioxaglate (Hexabrix) and iopromide (Ultravist) are identically appropriate for peripheral angiography. Outcome variables were pain, image quality and adverse events.
METHODS: Sixty patients were included in a randomised double-blind study. In all patients an intraarterial digital subtraction angiography (i.a. DSA) of iliac and peripheral arteries was performed.
RESULTS: Analysis of the study revealed no significant difference between both contrast media in terms of the main and additional outcome variables. In comparison to iopromide, ioxaglate caused milder pain sensations (VAS 4.70 vs. 7.76, p = 0.25). Mild adverse events were observed more frequently in ioxaglate angiography (11% vs. 0%, p = 0.1).
CONCLUSION: Both contrast media seem to be appropriate for peripheral angiography using DSA technique. Ioxaglate causes a cost reduction of about 20-35%. However, an increase of mild adverse reactions up to 11% to 15% has to be accepted."
8634986,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8634986/,"BACKGROUND: The authors' aim was to assess whether there is a difference in biologic behavior and survival in comparing adenocarcinoma (AdCA), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and adenosquamous carcinoma (Ad/SC) of the cervix.
METHODS: Cancer registrars at 703 hospitals submitted anonymous data on 11,157 patients with cervical cancer diagnosed and/or treated in 1984 and 1990 for a Patient Care Evaluation Study of the American College of Surgeons. Among these patients, 9351 (83.8%) had SCC; 1405 (12.6%), AdCA; and 401 (3.6%), Ad/SC cancers. There were no significant changes in percentages of the different histologic types between the study years 1984 and 1990, nor was the patient distribution different regarding age, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic background for each histologic group. Furthermore, the distribution of patients who had had a hysterectomy did not change between 1984 and 1990.
RESULTS: A larger percent of patients with SCC (63.8%) than those with Ad/SC (59.8%) or AdCA (50.2%) had tumors larger than 3 cm at greatest dimension. Early stage patients (IA, IB, IIA) often were treated by hysterectomy alone (45.5%) or combined with radiation (21.1%). The remaining patients (21.9%) received radiation alone. Of the patients with clinical stage I disease, 7.6% of Ad/CA patients, 15.5% of Ad/SC patients and 12.6% of SCC patients had positive nodes. Although patients with SCC had higher survival rates for all four clinical stages (I-IV), the differences were only significant for Stage II patients. Patients with clinical stage IB SCC and AdCA treated by surgery alone were found to have significantly better survival rates (93.1% and 94.6% at 5 years, respectively) than women treated by either radiation alone or a combination of surgery and radiation (P < 0.001, both histologic comparisons). For women with Ad/SC tumors, however, the 5-year survival rate was 87.3% for those receiving combined treatment compared with those receiving surgery alone (69.2%) or radiation alone (79.2%). However, these survival curves were not significantly different (P = 0.496). One hundred six patients with positive nodes were available for analysis. The 5-year survival rate of patients with SCC and positive nodes was 76.1%. Surprisingly, patients with Ad/SC and positive nodes had the highest 5-year survival rate (85.7%), whereas, women with AdCA and positive nodes had a sharply reduced 5-year survival rate (33.3%). The curves were significantly different (P < 0.01). For patients with clinical stage I, the risk factors for age, tumor size, nodal status, histologic features, and treatment were analyzed with Cox's multivariate regression. In this analysis, subset IB, greater tumor size, age 80 or older, and positive nodal status were each independently significant for poorer survival. Patients who were treated by surgery alone had a significantly better survival than patients who had other types of treatment or no treatment. Histologic characteristics had no significant effect on survival. In the analysis of patients with pathologic stage I disease, those with SCC had significantly poorer survival and those with Ad/SC had significantly better survival than patients with Ad/CA. Positive nodes had no significant independent effect on survival. In another analysis, tissue type was not found to be an important factor in recurrence time.
CONCLUSIONS: 1. Ad/CA and Ad/SC tumors were found to represent 12.6% and 3.6%, respectively, of a large series (N = 11,157) of cervical cancers diagnosed in 1984 and 1990 and reported to the Commission on Cancer of the American College of Surgeons. 2. Two thirds of women with early clinical stage disease (IA, IB, IIA) had hysterectomy as all or part of their primary therapy. 3. No significant differences were found in 5-year survival among the three tissue types in any clinical stage except American Joint Committee on Cancer stage II."
8635086,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8635086/,"BACKGROUND: There is considerable evidence that blood returning from different abdominal organs does not mix completely but maintains streamline flow in the portal vein. This study tested the hypothesis that the location of primary colorectal carcinoma affects the intrahepatic distribution of liver metastases according to streamline flow in the portal vein.
METHODS: Eighty-five patients with histologically verified liver metastases from colorectal carcinoma underwent potentially curative hepatectomy. Primary tumor location was the right-sided colon in 18 patients and the left-sided colon in 67. The liver was divided into two lobes by Cantlie's line.
RESULTS: A total of 195 metastatic deposits were resected: 135 in the right lobe and 60 in the left. In the right-sided colon carcinoma group, 29 deposits were in the right lobe and 3 in the left. In the left-sided colon carcinoma group, 106 deposits were in the right lobe and 57 in the left. The pattern of lobar distribution was significantly different in the two groups (P = 0.003).
CONCLUSIONS: Right-sided colon cancers selectively involve the right lobe, while left-sided tumors involve the entire liver, considering the ratio of weights of the right to left lobe is 2:1. This difference suggests that primary tumor location affects the pattern of lobar distribution of colorectal carcinoma liver metastases according to streamline flow in the portal vein."
8635399,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8635399/,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate prospectively the extent of potentially harmful interference of cardiac pacemakers by mobile phones in the C (analog) and D (digital) networks in use in Germany.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: 104 patients (54 men, 50 women; mean age 75.8 [40-100] years) with 58 different implanted pacemaker models (43 one-chamber and 15 two-chamber systems) underwent uniform tests at various functional states with three different telephones (D1 portable 8 Watt, D1 Handy model 2 Watt, C Handy model 0.5 Watt). The distances between telephone aerial and pacemaker, as well as reception sensitivity and polarity of the pacemaker were varied. All tests were done during continuous ECG monitoring.
RESULTS: 28 different pacemaker types (48.3%) in 43 patients (41.3%) showed interference in the form of pacemaker inhibition and switching to interference frequencies as well as triggering of pacemaker-mediated tachycardias in the DDD mode, as well as in the temperature-regulated frequency-adaptive function. D portables influenced pacemaker function more often and at greater distance than the D Handy model, which was little different from the c network hand phone. Reduction in pacemaker sensitivity as well as switching to bipolar reception only partly eliminated the interference.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with implanted pacemakers should if possible not use mobile phones in the C and D networks. Individual testing with suitable programming of pacemaker sensitivity and polarity can reduce the risk of interference."
8636494,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8636494/,"OBJECTIVES: There is no clear evidence to support the recommendation that rings and watches should be removed prior to operative dental procedures. The aim of this study was to measure and identify the bacteria isolated from the skin under rings and watches worn by a group of dental surgeons and to compare the results with a group of non-clinical staff.
METHODS: Forty volunteers participated in the study; of these 20 were dental surgeons and 20 were non-clinical staff. Four skin sites were sampled for each volunteer; the skin directly under the ring and on the same finger of the other hand and the skin under the watch face and wrist of the control hand. Bacteria on the swabs were dispersed and inoculated onto plates, which were incubated aerobically for 24 h at 37 degrees C.
RESULTS: In both groups of volunteers there was a significantly greater number of bacteria isolated from under rings and watches compared with control sites. Few qualitative differences were found between the microflora found on the skin under rings and watches in the two volunteer groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The bacterial flora isolated from volunteers do not commonly cause oral infections but could pose a threat to the immunocompromised patient, particularly in the event of gloves becoming torn or perforated. Effective hand disinfection is difficult to achieve if ring and watches are not removed; they should therefore be removed prior to hand disinfection and donning of gloves."
8637141,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8637141/,"OBJECTIVE: To understand how medical savings account (MSA) legislation for the nonelderly would affect health care costs.
DESIGN: Economic policy evaluation based on the RAND Health Expenditures Simulation Model.
SETTING: National probability sample of nonelderly noninstitutionalized households.
PARTICIPANTS: Persons in 23 157 sampled households from the 1993 Current Population Survey.
INTERVENTIONS: Medical savings account legislation would allow all Americans who are covered only by a catastrophic health care plan to set up a tax-exempt account that they can use to pay medical bills not covered by their health insurance. The interventions we evaluate differ in the deductibles of the catastrophic plan and in whether the employee or employer funds the MSA.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in national health expenditures and net societal benefits of health care.
RESULTS: If all insured nonelderly Americans switched to MSAs, their health care expenditures would decline by between 0% and 13%, depending on how the MSAs are designed. However, not all nonelderly Americans would choose MSAs; taking into account selection patterns, health spending would change by + 1% to -2%.
CONCLUSIONS: Medical savings account legislation would have little impact on health care costs of Americans with employer-provided insurance. However, depending on the size of the catastrophic limit, waste from the excessive use of generously insured care could be reduced, and MSAs would be attractive to both sick and healthy people."
8637275,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8637275/,"OBJECTIVE: In cardiac surgery, patients might receive unnecessary blood transfusions, due to the lack of a uniform criteria for blood replacement. We set out to evaluate the effect of a transfusion education program on the homologous blood requirements of subjects undergoing cardiac surgery.
METHODS: In June of 1993 a transfusion education program based on international criteria was designed and put into effect in the intensive care unit. Since that date, 133 patients (group 1), on whom we attempted to evaluate the effects of the program, were included, comparing them with 150 control patients (group 2) from the previous year. Multiple variables were analyzed, in order to confirm that the factors that could affect the use of blood did not differ between the two groups. The impact of these variables and the program on the homologous blood expenditures was measured with uni and multivariant analyses.
RESULTS: Blood requirements of the patients during the first day of the postoperative period were 0.9 +/- 0.1 U in group 1 versus 1.8 +/- 0.1 U in group 2 (p < 0.001) and the requirements during their entire stay in ICU were 1.8 +/- 0.1 versus 2.6 +/- 0.1 (p < 0.005). There were significant differences between both groups: Hemoglobin level at the admission in ICU, anoxia time, extracorporal circulation time, and blood losses in the first 24 hours of their stay in ICU. However, the analysis of covariance showed that the transfusion program exerted an independent influence, apart from other variables, over the decrease of blood transfusions. Morbidity and mortality were similar in both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Transfusion habits can be modified, permitting a lesser consumption of homologous blood through the adoption of education programs adapted to the diseases in which they will be applied."
8637769,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8637769/,"OBJECTIVE: Comparison between the usefulness of immunological markers and intestinal biopsy in the diagnosis and follow-up of coeliac disease.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serum antibodies to gliadin, several dietary proteins and endomysium were appraised in 27 patients with biopsy proven coeliac disease, both while untreated and 6-8 months after gluten withdrawal, when an intestinal biopsy was repeated. Forty-six healthy volunteers entered the study as controls. Antibodies to gliadin and dietary proteins were assessed by ELISA, antibodies to endomysium by indirect immunofluorescence using monkey oesophagus as antigen.
RESULTS: Mean antibody levels to dietary proteins were significantly higher in untreated patients as compared to controls. Their titers decreased after gluten withdrawal, but a significant difference was found, except for casein, for the IgA class only. However, because of their unlinear and unpredictable behaviour, they showed a poor reliability. Antigliadin antibodies showed higher diagnostic accuracy, although they also produced false-positive and false-negative results. Anti-endomysium antibodies, albeit the more expensive, proved the more reliable, due to their 100% specificity.
CONCLUSION: To date, anti-endomysium antibodies are the most reliable marker for coeliac disease: a positivity warrants an intestinal biopsy. The actual role of antibodies to gliadin, cheaper than endomysium, is during follow-up when many determinations are needed. Antibodies to dietary proteins, useful in the pre-endomysium era, only have a historical role."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-eight consecutive women (age range, 60-76 years) underwent coronary angiography for chest pain evaluation, as well as double-helical CT. Thirty women (mean age, 65 years +/- 5) had coronary artery disease (CAD), defined as any angiographic disease, and 18 women (mean age, 66 years +/- 4) had angiographically normal coronary arteries.
RESULTS: Women with angiographically normal coronary arteries had lower coronary calcification scores than those of patients with CAD: 5.7 +/- 11 versus 580 +/- 634, respectively (P = .0004). Seven women with angiographically normal coronary arteries demonstrated mild coronary calcification (score < 50). Of the 11 women without coronary calcification, none had CAD. Thus, the absence of coronary calcification on double-helical CT scans in elderly women was predictive of angiographically normal coronary arteries with 61% sensitivity, 100% specificity, and 85% accuracy.
CONCLUSION: Double-helical CT is an accurate, noninvasive modality for diagnosing angiographically normal coronary arteries in elderly symptomatic women."
8638018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8638018/,"PURPOSE: To evaluate intraluminal brachytherapy (ILBT) in patients with extrahepatic bile duct or pancreatic cancers.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-one patients (aged 33-87 years) with unresectable extrahepatic bile duct (n = 18) or pancreatic (n = 13) cancer received ILBT exclusively or as part of a definitive treatment regimen. ILBT was performed with transhepatic percutaneous drainage in four patients and with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in 27. Fourteen patients with no metastases, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score of < or = 2, and good hematologic parameters received combined modality treatment: 30-Gy ILBT and 45-Gy external-beam radiation therapy with continuous infusion of fluorouracil. Seventeen patients underwent 50-Gy ILBT alone for palliation.
RESULTS: No direct treatment-related acute toxic reactions were seen. Three patients had cholangitis early in the study. Three patients had late gastrointestinal bleeding. Jaundice was palliated in all patients (n = 29); pain, in 11 of 13 patients. The survival rate in patients with extrahepatic bile duct cancer was 62% (five of eight) at 2 years for combined modality treatment. No patient with pancreatic cancer lived for longer than 2 years.
CONCLUSION: ILBT is an effective palliative treatment of unresectable extrahepatic bile duct and pancreatic cancers. Results suggest a possible ""curative"" role in specific clinical settings when properly integrated with other treatments."
8638240,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8638240/,"BACKGROUND: It is generally accepted that excellent development of collateral circulation can be achieved through indirect nonanastomotic bypass procedures for pediatric patients with moyamoya disease. However, there are no definitive conclusions about the effect of indirect revascularization for adult patients. To clarify the value of indirect bypass surgery for adult moyamoya disease, we have analyzed their follow-up angiographic results in comparison with those of the pediatric patients.
METHODS: Between 1989 and 1993, 23 patients underwent combined direct and indirect bypass surgery. They consisted of 16 adults (mean age, 35; range, 20-59) and seven children (mean age, 10; range, 3-16). The main symptoms were those due to cerebral ischemia in all but 1 of 23 patients. Preoperative cerebral blood flow studies showed all patients to have decreased vascular reserve (misery perfusion). Postoperative follow-up angiography was done in all patients at a median of 6 months after the surgery.
RESULTS: All pediatric patients showed good or moderate development of collaterals through the indirect bypass. Among the adult group, seven patients aged 20 to 29 had angiographic results similar to those of the pediatric group . On the other hand, nine patients older than 30 had results contrary to those of pediatric patients: (1) the degree of indirect revascularization declined to moderate or poor grades (especially in patients older than 40) and (2) the degree of direct bypass filling improved to high or medium grades.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that advancing age apparently affects the development of collateral formation through the indirect bypass. Consequently, direct bypass is thought to be the main treatment option for patients older than 40."
8639300,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8639300/,"OBJECTIVE: To compare computed tomography (CT) with open neck exploration in determining prevertebral invasion by squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx or hypopharynx.
DESIGN: Retrospective analysis using the findings at open neck exploration and results of histopathologic studies as the criterion standards.
SETTING: Tertiary care referral center.
PATIENTS: Twenty-nine of 40 patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx or hypopharynx treated between January 1, 1986, and December 31, 1994, were selected for analysis based on CT findings of posterolateral extension of the primary tumor placing the prevertebral muscle (PVM) at risk. All study patients had no previous therapy and underwent neck exploration to determine resectability.
RESULTS: Overall accuracy of CT in predicting PVM status was 55.2%. The sensitivity of preoperative CT for PVM invasion was 50%; the specificity was 61%. Using an estimate of 21% for the prevalence of PVM invasion, the predictive value of a positive CT scan was 0.254 and the predictive value of a negative CT scan was 0.821. Open neck exploration correctly predicted PVM status in all cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Open neck exploration is superior to CT to evaluate possible PVM invasion by squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx or hypopharynx. The predictive value of a negative CT scan for PVM invasion is high, so it may be useful in treatment planning. Patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx or hypopharynx at risk for PVM invasion who are otherwise surgical candidates should be considered for open neck exploration to determine resectability most accurately."
8639350,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8639350/,"BACKGROUND: The development of primary care led commissioning will increase the need for practice-based information on health and morbidity, and the NHS information strategy recommends that routinely collected health and morbidity information held on general practice computer systems should be use to inform local health needs assessment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the quality of information in six computerized practices.
METHODS: A comparison was carried out of the recording of registration and social information, health risk factors, medication and record on consultations on the computer and in the manual records for a sample of patients, with an audit of morbidity coding by computer. A comparison was made of computerized disease registers with prescribing for diseases.
RESULTS: Computer disease registers identified over 90 percent of diabetic patients on medication, 67 percent of asthmatics, 61 percent of epileptics, and 48 percent of patients with angina. Computer recording of problems was inconsistent; practices which recorded clinical information from every consultation did not have substantially more complete disease registers. Over 90 percent of encounters and prescriptions were computerized, but there was bias in recording consultation problems. Blood pressure, smoking, alcohol, weight and height were recorded for over 50 percent of patients aged 15-74, and computerized for 79 percent (291/370) for height, but only 56 percent (274/488) for the most recent blood pressure recorded. Limited social information was recorded about patients: 45 percent (410/915) had occupation or employment status and 35 percent (230/915) ethnic group; computerized for 26 percent and 18 percent, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: At present, the routine collection of information from practices would not provide reliable information for health care planning. Greater use of information in practices would improve data quality, and practice data could be used to address specific issues, if augmented by additional data, and for practice-based needs assessment."
15584987,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15584987/,"BACKGROUND: Topical application of serum eye drops has been reported to accelerate healing of persistent ocular surface defects. It is supposed that growth factors in serum support the wound healing process. Platelets (PLTs) are rich in growth factors and easily available as PLT concentrates (PCs) from blood banks. Therefore, growth factor preparations from PCs may serve as a new and superior therapeutic agent for such defects.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: After thrombin stimulation for growth factor release, the cell-free supernatant (PLT releasate) of washed PCs (n = 8) was analyzed for epitheliotrophic factors and its wound healing capacity in comparison to serum (n = 8). Human corneal epithelial cells were used as a model to investigate cell growth, migration, and differentiation in response to both blood products.
RESULTS: PLT releasate contains more epithelial growth factor, PLT-derived growth factor, and transforming growth factor-beta, but less hepatocyte growth factor, fibronectin, and vitamins. Cell growth was significantly better in response to PLT releasate. Migration and differentiation were slightly better supported by serum.
CONCLUSION: Possibly owing to its high content of growth factors, PLT releasate has a distinct superior effect on cell growth. Stimulation of migration and differentiation was slightly inferior but still acceptable. PLT releasate could therefore be a novel treatment option for ocular surface defects."
15585042,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15585042/,"AIMS: Guided by the literature on alcohol subtypes, cluster analytical solutions ranging from two to five were evaluated for a large (n = 802), ethnically diverse sample of alcoholic in-patients.
DESIGN: Personal interview data were collected from in-patients regarding their substance abuse and psychiatric disorder status, risk factors for psychopathology and health outcomes.
SETTING: The data were collected at five alcohol in-patient treatment settings in New York; three settings were in New York City, one in Rochester and one in Buffalo.
PARTICIPANTS: The sample included 802 participants (481 males and 321 females) with racial/ethnic group diversity (418 blacks, 180 whites, 187 Hispanics, 17 of other ethnic origin).
MEASUREMENTS: Subjects were assessed with standardized measures of substance abuse and psychiatric disorders, family history of alcoholism, psychopathy, temperament, alcohol expectancies and clinical health variables.
FINDINGS: Based on internal and external criteria and compatibility with the existing literature, four subtypes were identified: mild course, polydrug, negative affect and chronic/antisocial. On external criteria, the polydrug subtype had the highest rate of family criminality, high-risk sexual behavior and intravenous drug use; the negative affect subtype had the highest rate of childhood sexual abuse, attempted suicide and childhood homelessness; the chronic/antisocial personality (ASP) subtype had the most severe pattern of drinking and antisocial behavior.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings are discussed with regard to the etiological and clinical utility of the four-subtype formulation, and consistency with recent studies in molecular genetics and pharmacology."
15585480,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15585480/,"UNLABELLED: Rising serum tumor markers may be associated with negative imaging in the presence of cancer. CT and (18)F-FDG PET may yield incongruent results in the assessment of tumor recurrence. The present study evaluates the incremental role of (18)F-FDG PET/CT for the diagnosis and management of cancer patients with increasing levels of tumor markers as the sole indicator of potential recurrence after initial successful treatment.
METHODS: Thirty-six cancer patients with increasing levels of tumor markers during follow-up and negative CT underwent (18)F-FDG PET/CT, which showed 111 sites of increased tracer uptake. PET/CT was compared with PET results on a site-based analysis for characterization of (18)F-FDG foci and on a patient-based analysis for diagnosis of recurrence. The clinical impact of PET/CT on further patient management was evaluated.
RESULTS: Thirty patients (83%) had recurrence in 85 malignant sites (77%). For the site-based analysis, PET had a sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 96%, 50%, 85%, 85%, and 82%, respectively, as compared with the performance indices of PET/CT of 100%, 89%, 97%, 97%, and 100%, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference between the specificity (P < 0.05) and accuracy (P < 0.001) of PET and PET/CT for precise characterization of suspected lesions. For the patient-based analysis, PET had a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 93%, 50%, and 86%, respectively, as compared with PET/CT with values of 93%, 67%, and 89%, respectively (P = not significant). PET/CT was the single modality that directed further management and treatment planning in 12 patients (33%).
CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that PET/CT may improve the accuracy of occult cancer detection and further lead to management changes in patients with increasing levels of tumor markers as the sole suspicion of recurrent malignancy."
15585986,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15585986/,"OBJECTIVE: Coronary artery plaque rupture is a sudden, unpredictable event leading to acute coronary syndrome. Thus far, there is no clinical characteristic to distinguish the patients at risk for acute myocardial infarction from those with more stable coronary artery disease. The purpose of this study was to identify clinical predictors of first ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).
METHODS: We retrospectively compared 116 consecutive patients presenting with their first STEMI for primary angioplasty and 216 ambulatory patients with stable angina requiring their first coronary intervention.
RESULTS: Patients with STEMI were younger, more likely to be smokers, but less likely to have hypertension or hypercholesterolemia. Diabetes was present equally between the two groups. Cardioprotective medication usage, such as aspirin and statin, was much lower among patients presenting with their first STEMI.
CONCLUSIONS: Thus, patients with STEMI presumably from plaque rupture have fewer traditional risk factors compared with patients with stable angina. Identifying these vulnerable patients at risk for plaque rupture may enable early institution of cardioprotective pharmacotherapy to prevent their first acute coronary syndrome occurrence."
15586216,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15586216/,"AIM: Renal function is usually determined by means of creatinine-clearance, and of serum Cystatin C, the latter with increasing frequency. The present study analyses, whether the diagnostic accuracy of (99m)Tc-MAG(3) clearance is comparable to that of these modern serologic methods.
PATIENTS, METHODS: 71 consecutive adult Caucasian patients (42 female, 29 male; age 50 +/- 16 yrs., range 20-83) who were referred to a nuclear medicine department for determination of bilateral renal function with (99m)Tc-MAG(3) were included. Following sufficient hydration, 10 ml of blood were taken for determination of Cystatin C and creatinine in serum prior to i.v. injection of the radiotracer. According to the recommendations of the National Kidney Foundation, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was calculated from serum creatinine using either Cockcroft & Gault and Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study equation. These estimates of GFR served as reference. Cystatin C is a low molecular protein produced by all nuclear cells and is eliminated to 85 % by glomerular filtration. Analysis of (99m)Tc-MAG(3) clearance was performed by means of Bubeck's formula.
RESULTS: Linear regression analysis produced Pearson's correlation coefficients of r = 0.68 and r = -0.69 for the comparison of either Cystatin C and (99m)Tc-MAG(3) clearance with the Cockcroft & Gault equation. The comparison of Cystatin C and (99m)Tc-MAG(3) clearance with MDRD study equation resulted in correlation coefficients of r = 0.755 and r = -0.77. None of these differences were significant. The exclusion of renal impairment or the detection of an at least moderate renal impairment revealed again no significant differences between Cystatin C and (99m)Tc-MAG(3) clearance.
CONCLUSIONS: Cystatin C and (99m)Tc-MAG(3) clearance are equally suited to exclude renal impairment or to detect a relevant renal impairment. Differences between both procedures are more likely a result of the applied reference method."
15586831,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15586831/,"BACKGROUND: Patients' trust in their health care providers may affect their satisfaction and health outcomes. Despite the potential importance of trust, there are few studies of its correlates using objective measures of physician behavior during encounters with patients.
METHODS: We assessed physician behavior and length of visit using audio tapes of encounters of 2 unannounced standardized patients (SPs) with 100 community-based primary care physicians participating in a large managed care organization. Physician behavior was assessed via 3 components of the Measure of Patient-Centered Communication (MPCC) scale. The Primary Care Assessment Survey (PCAS) trust subscale was administered to 50 patients from each physician's practice and to SPs. We used multilevel modeling to examine the associations between physicians' Patient-Centered Communication during the SP visits and ratings of trust by both patients and SPs.
RESULTS: Component 1 of the MPCC, which explored the patient's experience of the disease and illness, was independently associated with patient's rating of trust in their physician. A I SD increase in this score was associated with 0.08 SD increase in trust (95% confidence interval 0.02-0.14). Each additional minute spent in SP visits was also independently associated with 0.01 SD increase in patient trust. (95% confidence interval 0.0001-0.02). Component 1 and visit length were also positively associated with SP trust ratings.
CONCLUSIONS: Physician verbal behavior during an SP encounter is associated with trust reported by SPs and patients. Research is needed to determine whether interventions designed to enhance physicians' exploration patients' experiences of disease and illness improves trust. Key Words: physician-patient relationship, patient-centered care, trust, physician behavior"
15588069,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15588069/,"BACKGROUND: The faecal elastase-1 test (FE-1) is considered easy to perform and sensitive to detect severe and moderate exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. However, little information is available on the specificity of this test in the analysis of steatorrhoea. Our aim was to evaluate the clinical value of FE-1 in the analysis of patients sent in for faecal fat determination.
METHODS: Stool samples were collected over 24 hours in 40 healthy controls and 119 patients: 58 patients with chronic pancreatitis and 61 nonpancreatic disease patients with chronic diarrhoea. Faecal fat excretion was determined and FE-1 was measured using a commercially available ELISA kit, which employs two monoclonal antibodies to bind to two distinct epitopes of human pancreatic elastase-1.
RESULTS: Faecal elastase-1 test shows good reproducibility. The test lacks sensitivity in detecting exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and chronic pancreatitis (68 and 59%, respectively). However, it is specific with respect to differentiating pancreatic from nonpancreatic causes in patients with steatorrhoea.
CONCLUSION: FE-1 lacks sensitivity to detect chronic pancreatitis. It can serve as a simple, noninvasive method to determine the aetiology of steatorrhoea."

DESIGN: Comparison of the number of advertisers who smoke with survey data on national smoking status.
SETTING: ""RSVP"", Australia's largest web-based dating site (455,196 members on 12 October 2004).
PARTICIPANTS: 132,176 advertisements accessed on 10 February 2004.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Smoking status; and ""votes"" for advertisers' attractiveness based on how often visitors to the site accessed individual advertisements.
RESULTS: In every age group, there were higher proportions of women smokers among the advertisers than in the general population (P < 0.05), and this was also the case for men aged 50 years and over. There was a higher proportion of non-smokers in the ""Top 100"" men or women advertisers aged 20-29 years (82%) compared with total RSVP advertisers in this age group (67%) (P < 0.001). 85% of the men and 78% of the women in the two ""Top 100"" groups were non-smokers, with only 2% of both sexes claiming to be regular smokers.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the general population, a higher proportion of women and older men who advertise themselves on a dating website are smokers. Smokers may be perceived as less attractive."
15588243,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15588243/,"OBJECTIVE: Calcium supplements can reduce bone resorption and slow bone loss after the menopause, but these effects may be limited by poor intestinal absorption. Since the increase in blood ionised calcium and decrease in serum parathyroid hormone after a calcium load are diminished in patients with poor calcium absorption, we aimed to see whether the response of bone mineral content (BMC) to calcium is related to initial calcium absorption.
DESIGN: We retrospectively examined the changes in forearm BMC in 164 patients (139 women and 25 men) receiving calcium therapy alone for low bone density in a university hospital.
METHODS: BMC was measured in a Molsgaard single energy absorptiometer and calcium absorption in a single blood sample 1 h after a dose of 5 microCi (45)Ca in 20 mg calcium carrier. Results were analysed by simple and multiple regression analysis.
RESULTS: Mean forearm BMC did not change significantly over the mean 43 (S.D., 33) months of treatment (1.023 (0.247) to 1.017 (0.246) g/cm). The annual percentage of change was positively related to both body weight (r=0.180; P=0.020) and radiocalcium absorption (r=0.185; P=0.017). Multiple linear regression confirmed that both variables contributed to the change in BMC (P=0.023 and 0.019 respectively). The mean annual percentage of change in BMC on calcium therapy was not related to age, initial BMC, serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D or fasting urinary calcium/creatinine ratio.
CONCLUSIONS: These results support our earlier studies which suggest that poor calcium absorption limits the response of bone to calcium supplements."

15588754,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15588754/,"PURPOSE: The diagnostic validity of agitated depression (AD, a major depressive episode (MDE) with psychomotor agitation) is unclear. It is not classified in DSM-IV and ICD-10 classification of mental and behavioural disorder (ICD-10). Some data support its subtyping. This study aims to test the subtyping of AD.
METHODS: Consecutive 245 bipolar-II (BP-II) and 189 major depressive disorder (MDD) non-tertiary-care MDE outpatients were interviewed (off psychoactive drugs) with Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders--Clinician Version (SCID-CV), Hypomania Interview Guide (HIGH-C), and Family History Screen. Intra-MDE hypomanic symptoms were systematically assessed. AD was defined as an MDE with psychomotor agitation. Mixed AD was defined as an MDE with four or more hypomanic symptoms (including agitation).
FINDINGS: AD was present in 34.7% of patients. AD was mixed in 70.1% of AD patients. AD, vs. non-AD, had significantly (at alpha = 0.05) lower age at onset, more BP-II, females, atypical depressions, bipolar-I (BP-I) and BP-II family history, and was more mixed; racing/crowded thoughts, irritability, more talkativeness, and risky behaviour were significantly more common. Mixed AD, vs. non-AD, had significantly (at alpha = 0.01) lower age at onset, more intra-MDE hypomanic symptoms, BP-II, females, atypical depressions, BP-II family history, and specific hypomanic symptoms (distractibility, racing thoughts, irritable mood, more talkativeness, risky activities). Mixed AD, vs. non-mixed AD, had significantly more intra-MDE hypomanic symptoms (by definition), more recurrences, and more specific hypomanic symptoms (by definition). Non-mixed AD, vs. non-AD, had significantly more intra-MDE hypomanic symptoms and more talkativeness.
CONCLUSIONS: AD was common in non-tertiary-care depression outpatients, supporting its diagnostic utility. AD and many bipolar diagnostic validators were associated, supporting its link with the bipolar spectrum. Mixed AD, but not non-mixed AD, had differences vs. non-AD similar to those of AD, suggesting that psychomotor agitation by itself may not be enough to identify AD as a subtype. Findings seem to support the subtyping of mixed AD. This subtyping may have important treatment impact, as antidepressants alone might increase agitation."
15588870,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15588870/,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To determine the additional value of FDG-positron emission tomography (PET) to optimize delineation of the clinical target volume (CTV) in patients with advanced esophageal carcinoma.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: The imaging and radiotherapy data from 30 patients with an advanced esophageal carcinoma were analysed. The lymph node classification for esophageal cancer was modified and translated into anatomical volumes on computed tomography (CT). The so defined 14 different regions were scored individually for lymph node involvement on CT, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and FDG-PET. The influence of discordant findings between conventional and functional imaging on the decision as to what should be irradiated was assessed.
RESULTS: In 14 of the 30 patients (47%) discordances were found in detection of the pathological lymph nodes between CT/EUS and FDG-PET. In 8 patients, 9 lymph node regions were found with pathologic nodes on conventional imaging only. In three of these patients the influence of FDG-PET findings would have led to a decrease of the irradiated volume. In 6 patients, 8 lymph node regions were found with a normal CT/EUS and pathologic nodes on FDG-PET. In three of these patients (10%) the influence of the FDG-PET would have led to enlargement of the irradiated volume.
CONCLUSIONS: The chance of a false negative result on FGD-PET is not negligible; therefore, the irradiated volume should not be reduced based on a negative FDG-PET in a region with suspect nodes on other investigations. However, due to the high specificity of FDG-PET enlarging the irradiated volume based on a positive FDG-PET in a region without suspected lymph nodes on CT and/or EUS should be considered. This indicates a role for FDG-PET in radiotherapy planning for esophageal cancer."
15589487,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15589487/,"PURPOSE: To determine whether use of regular aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is a risk factor for a false-positive fecal occult blood test result.
METHODS: Consecutive patients referred for colonoscopy for a positive fecal occult blood test result at a Veterans Affairs hospital were eligible. Patients with hematochezia, peptic ulcer disease, or unevaluated dyspepsia requiring antacids, or who used warfarin, were excluded. Regular aspirin and NSAID use was defined as at least one daily dose for at least 3 days per week. Colonoscopic findings unlikely to explain a positive test result alone were defined a priori as diverticulosis, hemorrhoids, or polyps <1.0 cm with no villous histology. Findings likely to explain a positive test result included cancer and advanced polyps.
RESULTS: The sample comprised 193 veterans with a mean (+/- SD) age of 66 +/- 10 years; 98% were male and 86% were white. No colonoscopic findings explained the positive fecal occult blood test result in 153 patients (79%). One hundred and thirty-five patients (70%) were regular aspirin or NSAID users, of whom 21% (n = 29) had findings to explain the positive test results, compared with 19% (11/58) of nonusers (P = 0.7). There was no relation between aspirin dose and colonoscopic findings unlikely to explain a positive test result. Multivariate analysis found no association between regular aspirin or NSAID use and a false-positive test result (odds ratio = 0.85; 95% confidence interval: 0.39 to 1.84).
CONCLUSION: Aspirin and NSAID use were not risk factors for a false-positive fecal occult blood test result in this study."

One in ten medical personnel is left-handed. The perceptions of left-handed surgeons regarding their laterality related inconveniences are unknown.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the perceptions of left-handed surgeons and the way it has affected their surgical training and career.
DESIGN AND SETTING: Web-based survey of left-handed surgeons.
PARTICIPANTS: Left-handed surgeons in 2 boroughs of New York City, Manhattan and Brooklyn.
METHODS: Distribution and completion of the survey.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Career-oriented concerns of left-handed surgeons.
RESULTS: Three percent of left-handed surgeons received laterality related mentoring during medical school. Ten percent of the programs mentored left-handed surgical residents, and 13% of the programs provided left-handed instruments during surgical residency. Laparoscopy and laparoscopic instruments did not eliminate the problems associated with instrument handling to left-handed surgeons. Ten percent of the left-handed surgeons expressed concerns when asked whether they would be comfortable being treated by another left-handed surgeon when they are the patients themselves.
CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals the perceptions of left-handed surgeons in adapting to a right-handed world. Early laterality related mentoring in medical school and during surgical residency with provision of left-handed instruments might reduce the inconveniences of left-handed surgeons learning."

Our goal was to measure the impact that work-hour restrictions have on operative volumes and to evaluate the potential benefit of a night rotation to minimize the number of ""lost operations.""
DESIGN: Categorical surgical residents (PGY I-IV) recorded missed surgical procedures on post-call days from September 1, 2002 to March 31, 2004. The data collection is split between the pre-night rotation (September 1, 2002 to March 31, 2003) and post-night rotation (April 1, 2003 to March 31, 2004) periods. The post-night rotation period is further divided to account for the end of the academic year. Previous graduate operative logs were reviewed for comparison.
SETTING: Mount Carmel Health System is a tertiary referral, community-based hospital in Columbus, Ohio.
PARTICIPANTS: Categorical general surgery residents (Postgraduate Years I to V).
RESULTS: In the 7-month period, extending from September 1, 2002 to March 31, 2003, the average number of missed cases for successive levels was PGY I: 21, PGY II: 31, PGY III: 26, and PGY IV: 40. From April 1, 2003 to June 30, 2003, the average number of missed cases for successive levels was PGY I: 3, PGY II: 7, PGY III: 5, and PGY IV: 6. From July 1, 2003 to March 31, 2004, the average number of missed cases for successive levels was PGY I: 34, PGY II: 8, PGY III: 14, and PGY IV: 30. Before the implementation of a night rotation, residents were projected to miss an average of 202 operations over 4 years. After implementation of a night rotation, the projected loss would drop to 107 operations over 4 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Work-hour restrictions result in a significant decrease in operative experience. This detriment can be partially alleviated with the institution of a night rotation to better regulate in-house call."
15590037,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15590037/,"OBJECTIVE: To test a 360-degree resident evaluation tool on our trauma/critical care services to determine if multiple raters yielded equivalent information compared with traditional faculty evaluations.
DESIGN: Prospective evaluation.
PARTICIPANTS: Residents, nurses, faculty, and staff at an academic medical center.
METHODS: The evaluation tool was developed based on extensive qualitative analysis of 13 major medical specialties' Residency Review Committee (RRC) criteria relative to the ACGME competencies and then revised with content specific to surgery. The evaluation contained 19 items divided into ACGME competency areas. Each item was scored on a 1 to 9 Likert scale: 1 = not meeting expectations and 9 = exceeding expectations. Residents on the trauma and surgical intensive care unit rotations evaluated themselves, and they were also evaluated by chief residents, surgical intensive care unit fellows, faculty, surgical intensive care unit nurses, trauma nurse clinicians, and nurse practitioners. Multiple analyses of variance were used to compare ratings by rater groups.
RESULTS: Ten residents were evaluated on the trauma service from April to August 2003. Between 74 and 106 evaluations were obtained per resident per competency area. Average scores across the competencies were remarkably similar, ranging from 6.18 for practice-based learning and systems-based practice to 6.54 for professionalism. Although there was variability within rater groups, ratings were not statistically different between groups for any ACGME competency.
CONCLUSIONS: The 360-degree evaluation provide limited new information compared with traditional faculty ratings. Follow-up studies are required to confirm this finding with larger samples of residents and surgical specialties."

DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was used to determine the symptoms of UI experienced by Arabian Gulf women.
SETTING: Primary Health Care (PHC) Centres and community-based study in Qatar.
SUBJECTS: A multistage sampling design was used and a representative sample of 1000 Qatari women aged 45 years and above were included from January to June 2003.
MEASUREMENTS: Participants completed a questionnaire assessing UI in the previous 12 months and health care-seeking behavior for urinary symptoms.
RESULTS: Of 1000 women living in urban and semiurban areas who were asked, 798 (79.8%), representing the study sample, agreed to participate and completed the questionnaire. Of these, 164 (20.6%) were found to have UI. Overall, the reason for not seeking medical attention was mainly embarrassment (40.6%) at having to speak with doctor. Of the total study sample, 562 subjects (70.4%) believed that UI was abnormal and worth reporting to a doctor. Coping mechanisms among incontinent women included frequent washing (58.3%) and wearing a protective perennial pad (42.4%), changing underwear frequently (41.3%), decreasing fluid intake (19.8%) and stopping all work (4.9%). Sufferers were most troubled by their inability to pray (64%) and their marital relationship (47%), limitation of their social activities (20%), difficulty in doing housework (14%) and inconvenience during shopping (13%). Most (71.9%) of the incontinent subjects were self-conscious, ashamed of themselves and troubled by guilt (P < 0.001); 56% found it most embarrassing to discuss UI with their husbands. The majority of women (51.9%) believed child birth to be the major cause of UI, followed by ageing (49.5%), menopause (34.2%) and paralysis (25.3%). Most of the subjects (62.3%) believe that UI can cause infection, some (20.5%) believe that it can cause skin allergy and very few think that it can cause cancer or other disorders.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that although UI is relatively common in the community, it is underreported by Qatari women because of social and cultural attitudes and-most importantly-lack of information. This findings suggest that strategies to promote care-seeking for incontinence must be developed and employed in the community."
15590230,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15590230/,"OBJECTIVES: When a physician believes that the troubles of caring for a patient outweigh the rewards, he or she can move--""turf"", the unwanted patient from his or her own to another physician's territory. Physicians receiving such patients can feel burdened by, and resentful about, caring for those who are ""turfed"" to them by other physicians, yet little is known about the effects such ""turf battles"" have on patient care. This study aims to discover if ""turfed"" patients (TPs) experience their hospitalizations differently from patients whose admissions are perceived more favorably by their physicians.
DESIGN: Semi-structured, in-depth interviews.
POPULATION: Twenty Six English-speaking patients on a medical service in a tertiary care university hospital.
OUTCOMES: Hospitalization experiences based on qualitative thematic analysis of interview audiotapes and transcripts.
RESULTS: The experience of patients perceived as ""turfs"" differed from patients deemed more appropriately admitted in two areas: mode of admission and tone of interview themes. TPs were admitted via the emergency department or intra-hospital transfer; unlike the ""appropriate"" patients (APs), none came from outside hospitals. Although patients in both groups voiced many similar themes, nearly all TP interview themes were unfavorable. AP interviewees, by comparison expressed both favorable and unfavorable themes. TPs were direct and explicit about their anger and frustration, while APs mixed humor with complaints.
CONCLUSIONS: ""Turfed"" patients may have different care experiences from those of patients deemed appropriate for a medical service. Inter-specialty barriers to collegiality and relationship-centered care shape physicians' perceptions of patient appropriateness and desirability and merit further large-scale exploration."
15590581,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15590581/,"OBJECTIVES: In Ontario, Canada, in a cohort of all people initially aged 50-54 years, modeling whether the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) antioxidant supplementation for stage 3 and 4 AMD would decrease the costs of photodynamic treatment with Visudyne.
PERSPECTIVE: Third party payer, the Ontario Health Insurance Plan.
METHODS: Using reported risk reductions, prevalence data by age and sex from the Beaver Dam studies, and yearly costs: AREDS 182.50 Canadian dollars, potential savings were calculated as the difference or incremental cost between the estimated medical costs for the untreated cohort of 17,000 Canadian dollars for Visudyne treatment of individuals with neovascularization and the same cohort if stage 3 and 4 AMD patients were treated with antioxidants, decreasing progression to neovascularization. Different scenarios were explored for sensitivity analysis of direct cost savings.
RESULTS: For the Ontario cohort of approximately 788,000 aged 51-55 years in 2001, for photodynamic therapy of the untreated cohort, modeled costs were 1.7 billion Canadian dollars. AREDS treatment costs would be 513 million Canadian dollars. AREDS would reduce photodynamic therapy costs, a net saving of 431 million Canadian dollars, a saving of 547 Canadian dollars per person in the total cohort, or 6,753 Canadian dollars per stage 3 and 4 patient treated. To explore the sensitivity of this model to AMD incidence rather than prevalence data, Framingham incidence data were incorporated in the model: net savings of 70.3 million Canadian dollars were modeled using Framingham incidence data.
CONCLUSION: Under reasonable assumptions, if the case progresses to wet AMD (1) AREDS with Visudyne is less expensive than Visudyne alone in every five-year time period for the cohort that is age 50-54 right now until they become 75-79; thus, the lifetime cost is lower; (2) AREDS with Visudyne yields more QALYs than Visudyne alone in every five-year interval; (3) under all but the most extreme assumptions, the conclusions reached are robust. Even when AREDS costs a little more, it yields more QALYs at a reasonable cost per QALY. Thus, AREDS antioxidant supplementation appears to be a dominant strategy for macular degeneration. Applied to the whole Canadian population, the potential medical cost savings for Visudyne treatment of neovascular AMD are 5.6 billion Canadian dollars in direct costs. These values would be tenfold higher for the USA, because of the currency and population size differences."
15590710,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15590710/,"BACKGROUND: Accident and Emergency (A and E) is the first port of call for most people who have experienced an injurious fall. This provides the potential for identifying patients who may benefit from preventative interventions. This study aims to estimate the percentage of falls attendances that are not recorded on computerised A and E records.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study design was used to study patients attending A and E with falls related injuries.
RESULTS: The survey revealed poor recording of falls with 38 per cent (95 per cent CI +/- 8.82 per cent) of patient reported falls not recorded on computerised A and E records. More than half of those reporting a fall as the reason for attendance at A and E, reported previous falls, with 21 per cent reporting subsequent falls.
CONCLUSIONS: A and E could play an important role in secondary falls prevention. Improving recording of falls in A and E is an essential prerequisite."
15591211,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15591211/,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recently, 3 clinical trials revealed encouraging results in recanalization and clinical outcome in acute stroke patients when 2-MHz transcranial Doppler monitoring was applied. This study investigated whether a 1.8-MHz commercial diagnostic ultrasound device has the potential to facilitate thrombolysis using an in vitro stroke model.
METHODS: Duplex-Doppler, continuous wave-Doppler, and pulsed wave (PW)-Doppler were compared on their impact on recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA)-mediated thrombolysis. Blood clots were transtemporally sonicated in a human stroke model. Furthermore, ultrasound attenuation of 5 temporal bones of different thickness was determined.
RESULTS: In comparison, only PW-Doppler accelerated rtPA-mediated thrombolysis significantly. Without temporal bone, PW-Doppler plus rtPA showed a significant enhancement in relative clot weight loss of 23.7% when compared with clots treated with rtPA only (33.9+/-5.5% versus 27.4+/-5.2%; P<0.0005). Ultrasound attenuation measurements revealed decreases of the output intensity of 86.8% (8.8 dB) up to 99.2% (21.2 dB), depending on temporal bone thickness (1.91 to 5.01 mm).
CONCLUSIONS: Without temporal bone, PW-Doppler significantly enhanced thrombolysis. However, because of a high attenuation of ultrasound by temporal bone, no thrombolytic effect was observed in our in vitro model, although Doppler imaging through the same temporal bone was still possible."
15591483,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15591483/,"BACKGROUND: In the elderly, acute coronary syndromes (ACS) without ST elevation are a frequent and important cause of admission. In the UK, practice patterns and outcomes in these patients need to be assessed.
METHODS: We enrolled 1,046 patients admitted with ACS without ST elevation to 56 UK centres (20 consecutive patients per centre) and followed them for 6 months. We compared baseline characteristics, outcomes and treatments in those aged 80 and over (n = 119, 11%), from 70 to 79 (n = 301, 29%), from 60 to 69 (n = 283, 27%) with those below 60 (n = 343, 33%).
RESULTS: The proportions of males were 40, 52, 67 and 70%, respectively (P < 0.001). There were no differences in the proportion of patients with diabetes (17% overall), treated hypertension (38%) or prior myocardial infarction (MI) (48%). The proportions with ST depression or bundle branch block on admission ECG were 40, 39%, and 28, 18% (P < 0.001), respectively. The rates of the composite endpoint of death or new MI at 6 months were 20, 18, 12 and 6% (P < 0.001), respectively. Heparin, beta blockers and statins were used in significantly higher proportions in younger patients compared with older patients. Similarly, older patients had significantly lower rates of angiography and revascularisation compared with younger patients.
CONCLUSION: In this large population-based registry of UK patients admitted to hospital with ACS without ST elevation, those aged over 70 are at substantially higher risk of adverse events than younger patients. However, they are less likely to receive treatments of proven benefit or to be investigated with a view to revascularisation. A more aggressive approach to these patients may be more appropriate and is likely to result in substantial benefits."
15591742,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15591742/,"BACKGROUND: Peripheral resistance (R) is measured by flow (Q) and a pressure difference (P1-P2), where R equals (P1-P2)/Q. The pulsatility index (PI) has been used to assess peripheral vascular resistance by measuring flow velocities. Alternatively, PI can be expressed by the ratio of the flow volume amplitude and mean flow volume which both are quantified by a flowmeter. While reflected flow due to a distally located stenosis will considerably influence PI, this parameter theoretically could provide a good estimation of resistance. The appropriateness of this presumption has not been evaluated in this setting though, why the correlation of PI in flow recordings was examined by comparing PI with the true R using the stenosis of the internal carotid artery (ICA) as a clinical model.
METHODS: The volume flow in the ICA was measured by a transit-time flowmeter in 400 patients undergoing carotid endarteriectomy. The pressure in the common carotid artery (CCA) proximal to and in the ICA distal to the stenosis was determined by direct puncture allowing the calculation of a pressure gradient (PG) and R in analogy to Ohm's law. R and PI were then correlated using Spearman's correlation.
RESULTS: The blood flow in the ICA ranged from 2 to 478 ml/min with a median value of 165. The median PG was 14 mm Hg (0 to 88). Median R was 0.08 mm Hg x min / ml (0-26.5). PI varied between 0.8 and 114.1 with a mean of 1.9. Since a concentration of R and PI values in the lower ranges was observed, a logarithmic transformation was performed. Log PI showed only weak correlation to log R (r = 0.426, p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Log PI was intermediately correlated to log R in carotid artery stenosis, with a low discriminating power in the lower ranges due to the close distribution of measurements. Further studies are required to clarify the role of PI in hemodynamic questions and its general usefulness in other fields of vascular surgery like in peripheral bypass surgery."
15592040,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15592040/,"PURPOSE: We compared urine markers, bladder biopsy findings and clinical features of patients with symptoms of interstitial cystitis (IC) who did or did not meet the cystoscopic criteria defined by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Urine markers and symptom questionnaires were measured before and 1 month after bladder distention for IC. Bladder biopsies were taken at the time of distention. At distention patients were defined as meeting or not meeting the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases established cystoscopic criteria for IC. The 2 patient groups were compared.
RESULTS: Urine marker levels were similar for the 2 groups, including antiproliferative factor, epidermal growth factor, heparin binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor, cyclic guanosine monophosphate, interleukins 6 and 8, and methylhistamine. Bladder biopsy features were similar for the 2 groups. Bladder capacity with the patients under anesthesia was higher in those who did not meet the criteria (median 750 vs 1,000 ml, p = 0.005). Median age at symptom onset was 26 years in both groups. On the University of Wisconsin symptom scale patients who met the criteria had higher scores for daytime frequency (p = 0.002) and nocturia (p = 0.01). Symptom characteristics and symptom response after bladder distention were similar for the 2 groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients who met the cystoscopic criteria had worse daytime frequency and nocturia, and lower bladder capacity under anesthesia. However, the 2 groups had similar urine markers and bladder biopsy findings. The cystoscopic criteria do not appear to identify a distinct pathophysiological subset of patients with IC symptoms."
15592044,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15592044/,"PURPOSE: Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a genetic angiodysplasia affecting multiple organs. Clinical manifestations include spontaneous and recurrent epistaxis, mucocutaneous telangiectases that bleed easily and arteriovenous malformations in many organs. Despite the anecdotal recommendations of some groups, to our knowledge information regarding the prevalence of microscopic hematuria (MH) in patients with HHT has not been reported to date. We evaluated the prevalence of MH in patients with HHT.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between January 2002 and June 2003, 116 consecutive patients with HHT were studied, of whom 20 were excluded because of a possible false-positive MH bias. Therefore, 53 males and 43 females with a mean age +/- SD of 45.8 +/- 15.8 years who had HHT underwent urine dipstick testing for heme and microscopic urinary examination. A control group of 192 males and 148 females with a mean age of 46.5 +/- 14.2 years and no statistical age or sex differences without HHT who were hospitalized in the same period at the same medical unit for gastrointestinal disorders was compared to the HHT cohort.
RESULTS: MH was detected in 45 of 96 patients with HHT (47%) compared to 41 of 340 controls (12%) (p <0.0005). None of the patients with HHT showed abnormal renal function, proteinuria, hypercalciuria or hyperuricosuria. MH was due to glomerular hematuria in 29 of 45 patients (65%), postglomerular hematuria in 13 (29%) and mixed hematuria in 3 (6%). No gross hematuria was detected.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that MH is common in patients with HHT. This might indicate the possibility of weak urinary tract bleeding due to telangiectases and/or small arteriovenous fistulas, which are typical HHT lesions. Therefore, HHT should be considered among the causes of MH. Urinalysis should always be performed when there is severe anemia in HHT patients with HHT, particularly those without other apparent bleeding sites."
15592093,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15592093/,"PURPOSE: We tested whether valve regulated, intermittent flow of urine from catheterized bladders decreases catheter encrustation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Laboratory models of the catheterized bladder were infected with Proteus mirabilis. Urine was allowed to drain continuously through the catheters or regulated by valves to drain intermittently at predetermined intervals. The time that catheters required to become blocked was recorded and encrustation was visualized by scanning electron microscopy.
RESULTS: When a manual valve was used to drain urine from the bladder at 2-hour intervals 4 times during the day, catheters required significantly longer to become blocked than those on continuous drainage (mean 62.6 vs 35.9 hours, p = 0.039). A similar 1.7-fold increase occurred when urine was drained at 4-hour intervals 3 times daily. Experiments with an automatic valve in which urine was released at 2 or 4-hour intervals through the day and night also showed a significant increase in mean time to blockage compared with continuous drainage (p = 0.001). Scanning electron microscopy confirmed that crystalline biofilm was less extensive on valve regulated catheters.
CONCLUSIONS: Valve regulated, intermittent flow of urine through catheters increases the time that catheters require to become blocked with crystalline biofilm. The most beneficial effect was recorded when urine was released from the bladder at 4-hour intervals throughout the day and night by an automatic valve."
15592284,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15592284/,"OBJECTIVE: Perinatal infection increases the risk of neonatal neurologic injury. Our objective is to determine whether histologically confirmed chorioamnionitis and funisitis is associated with fetal metabolic acidosis.
STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective cohort study of all infants 34 weeks or less born at a single tertiary hospital admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) between April 1999 and September 2002. Maternal and neonatal records and placental pathology reports were reviewed.
RESULTS: There were 392 infants at 23 to 34 weeks' gestational age admitted to the NICU during this period of whom 354 had placental pathology reported; 259 infants had umbilical cord gases available. These neonates were placed into 3 groups: group 1 (208 infants) had no signs of placental infection, group 2 (59 infants) had isolated chorioamnionitis, and group 3 (87 infants) had both chorioamnionitis and funisitis. The gestational age (30.2 +/- 2.8, 28.3 +/- 3.4, 27.8 +/- 2.8 weeks, P < .01) and birth weight (1358 +/- 520, 1242 +/- 547, 1103 +/- 381 g, P < .01) were significantly higher in group 1. There was an increase in neurologic morbidity in groups 2 and 3 (25.2%, 34.4%, 43.7%), which was not significant when corrected for gestational age. Groups 2 and 3 had a small but significant increase in umbilical arterial pH (7.25 +/- 0.10, 7.29 +/- 0.10, 7.30 +/- 0.08, P < .01) and base excess (-3.5 +/- 3.6, -2.2 +/- 3.6, -2.3 +/- 2.7 mmol/L, P = .02). When a single pathologist reviewed all placentas with any inflammation and staged them on the basis of the degree of the fetal inflammatory response, no relationship was found between the degree of fetal inflammation and umbilical arterial pH (stage 1, 7.27 +/- 0.09; stage 2, 7.30 +/- 0.09; stage 3, 7.30 +/- 0.08; P = .41) or base excess (stage 1, -2.82 +/- 3.47 mmol/L; stage 2, -1.95 +/- 3.17 mmol/L; stage 3, -2.23 +/- 3.07 mmol/L; P = .62). When stepwise multiple linear regression was performed, neither histologic chorioamnionitis nor histologic funisitis were associated with a change in umbilical cord pH or base excess.
CONCLUSION: Intrauterine infection, as confirmed by histologic chorioamnionitis and funisitis, is not associated with fetal metabolic acidosis. Intrauterine infection may represent a nonhypoxic form of encephalopathy that produces neurologic morbidity by a mechanism independent of hypoxia-ischemia leading to metabolic acidosis."

Late effects by high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy have been believed severer than low-dose-rate (LDR) provided tumor control was constant. Local control of oropharyngeal carcinoma with HDR at Osaka Medical Center was comparable to LDR series from Centre Alexis Vautrin (82%, 79.5%, respectively). To assess the feasibility of HDR brachytherapy, the late effects were compared.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: . The data of 29 HDR and 24 LDR patients (median follow-up of 27 and 29.5 months, respectively; p = 0.89) were collected. The HDR schedule was 21 Gy/3.5 fractions/2 days following 46 Gy/23 fractions external beam, while 25 Gy/3 days following 50 Gy/25 fractions external beam was for LDR. Late changes were evaluated using RTOG/EORTC late morbidity scoring scheme. For subclinical late changes, mucosa chapter of Dische score was modified for brachytherapy. Scores were discussed through photos and were agreed on by authors. Late sequelae were estimated, by reviewing charts, concerning frequency, severity, and duration of mucosal damages (erosion and ulcer).
RESULTS: . Late changes were of no difference (p = 0.12 for EORTC/RTOG, and p = 0.45, 0.47, 1.00, 0.12, 0.16, 0.95, 0.27, 0.21 for erythema, ulceration, edema, thinning, pallor, telangiectasia, mobility impairment of tongue/faucial pillars, respectively, of the modified Dische score). Late sequelae showed no differences (p = 0.90, 0.12, 0.40 for frequency, severity, duration, respectively, of mucosal damages).
CONCLUSION: . The late effects by HDR were not severer than by LDR. HDR oropharyngeal brachytherapy is as safe as LDR."
15593034,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15593034/,"BACKGROUND: Cystatin C is increasingly used to estimate renal function, but its large intraindividual variability limits its practical value. This study aimed at verifying whether the clinical practice of associating cystatin C determination with serum creatinine (Cr) improved the ability of the Cockcroft and Gault formula to estimate creatinine clearance (CrCl).
METHODS: It was an observational cross-sectional study of 134 in-patients with mildly impaired renal function. Using the Hoek et al formula (glomerular filtration rate (GFR)/1.73m2 = - 4.32 + 80.35/cystatin C mg/L), multivariate linear regressions (LREG) and artificial neural networks (ANN), we integrated cystatin C in the Cockcroft and Gault formula and analyzed the potential superiority of this procedure by comparing its performance with that of the two algorithms taken separately.
RESULTS: The inclusion of cystatin C in the Cockcroft and Gault formula using the data of an LREG (CrCl = 0.371 x (Hoek et al) + 0.589 x Cockcroft and Gault), a simple mean between the two algorithms or ANN ameliorated the CrCl estimation precision allowing an absolute error reduction of approximately 4, 4 and 6%, respectively (relative values 12, 12 and 17%).
CONCLUSIONS: Although the combination of the Hoek et al and Cockcroft and Gault formulae using both linear and non-linear mathematical methods allowed a statistically significant reduction in the estimation error generated by Cockcroft and Gault, considering the small impact on the estimation precision and the large intraindividual variation of both cystatin C and Cr, this procedure probably has no clinical relevance."
15595197,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15595197/,"BACKGROUND: Some professional categories are at risk for burnout due to job-related stressors. Burnout is characterized by physical and emotional exhaustion, apathy, cynical attitude, low personal accomplishment and reduced self-control. Several studies on occupational stress have demonstrated that burnout has a strong impact on certain professions and in particular on teachers.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the study was to highlight and compare differences among clinical disorders diagnosed in four different classes of workers in the Public Administration sector, with particular focus on job-related and mental disorders.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Based on the data collected in 3,447 medical examinations, performed by the Milan Health District from January 1992 to December 2003, in order to assess work fitness, researchers compared four categories of state employees (teachers, clerks, health care professionals and blue collars).
RESULTS: The findings revealed that the risk of teachers to develop psychiatric disorders is 2-, 2.5-, and 3-fold higher than that of clerks, health care professionals and blue collars, respectively. Age or sex did not represent a confounding factor for increased rate of psychiatric disorders. Interestingly, teachers also presented an approximately 1.5-2 fold higher risk of developing neoplasms, compared with clerks and blue collars.
CONCLUSIONS: The increased prevalence of psychiatric disorders among teachers that was detected in this cohort of state employees applying for a disability pension is striking and warrants further investigation. This finding points to the need for job-related interventions aimed at preventing teachers' psychiatric disorders, a multidimensional issue which requires active debate among institutions, unions, school authorities, the scientific community, professional associations and, last but not least, students and their families."
15595704,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15595704/,"BACKGROUND: Bone grafts are frequently used to enable the placement of dental implants in atrophied jaws. The biomechanical properties of bone grafts used in one- or two-stage implant procedures (in comparison with the use of nongrafted bone) are not well known.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was (1) to measure cutting torques during the placement of self-tapping dental implants in nongrafted bone and in bone grafts, either as blocks or in a milled particulate form, in patients undergoing implant treatment in an edentulous maxilla and (2) to identify implants with reduced initial stability and to correlate these findings with a clinical classification of jawbone quality.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 40 consecutive patients with edentulous maxillas, 27 of whom were subjected to bone grafting prior to or in conjunction with implant placement (grafting group) and 13 of whom received implants without grafting (nongrafted group). Grafted bone from the iliac crest bone was used (1) as onlay blocks, (2) as maxillary sinus inlay blocks, or (3) in particulate form in the maxillary sinus. Implants were placed after 6 to 7 months of healing, except in the maxillary sinus inlay blocks, where implants were placed simultaneously. Cutting torque values were obtained from 113 grafted implant sites and from 109 nongrafted implant sites.
RESULTS: Significantly lower cutting torque values were assessed in grafted regions than in nongrafted regions, irrespective of grafting technique. Lower values were also seen for implants placed in block grafts after 6 months when compared to other grafting techniques used. The cutting torque values revealed an inverse linear relation to the Lekholm and Zarb bone quality index.
CONCLUSION: The cutting torque values correlated well with the Lekholm and Zarb index of bone quality. Significantly lower cutting torque values were seen in grafted bone than in nongrafted bone."

Usefulness of discharge communications to patients' GPs also was ascertained.
METHODS: Pre- and post-operative self-administered questionnaires to 133 patients and a follow-up telephone survey of GPs providing primary care to 118 of these patients.
RESULTS: Pre-operatively, the majority (84.2%) of patients recalled being told how many days they were likely to be hospitalised. Univariate analysis did not demonstrate any factors predicting positive recall. The majority (87.0%) of patients perceived themselves 'ready to go home' at discharge. Twenty-eight GPs (23.7%) had received both a discharge summary from the hospital and a personalized letter from the patient's surgeon. GP's rated the surgeons' letters as significantly more useful than discharge summaries (P = 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Although hospitals are required by NSW Health's Effective Discharge Policy to inform patients about their likely length of stay in hospital, not all patients recalled whether they were so informed pre-operatively. Barriers impeding realisation of the NSW Health policy remain."

15596181,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15596181/,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether alpha1-blockers have any impact on stone clearance in patients with lower ureteral stones who underwent either shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) or were followed up with standard hydration, analgesics, and anti-inflammatory treatment.
METHODS: A total of 78 patients (56 men and 22 women) who had lower ureteral stones located at the distal 5 cm of the ureter were divided into four groups. The first group consisted of 30 patients (38.5%) with stones less than 5 mm (range 3 to 5) who were randomly divided into two subgroups. Group 1 consisted of 15 patients (19.2%) who were followed up with oral hydration and diclofenac sodium. Group 2 consisted of 15 patients (19.2%) who received tamsulosin 0.4 mg daily in addition to the standard regimens. The second two groups consisted of 48 patients (61.5%) with stones greater than 5 mm (range 6 to 15) who underwent SWL. These patients were also randomly divided between those who did not (group 3, n = 24) and those who did (group 4, n = 24) receive tamsulosin 0.4 mg daily. All patients were re-evaluated with plain abdominal x-rays and helical computed tomography 15 days after the beginning of treatment.
RESULTS: Of the 78 patients, 36 (46.2%) became stone free. The stone-free rate was 20%, 53.3%, 33.3%, and 70.8% for group 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. The best results were achieved in those who underwent SWL plus tamsulosin treatment (group 4). The differences between the stone-free rates for groups 3 versus 4 (P = 0.019) and the tamsulosin versus control groups (P = 0.0015) were statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: The addition of tamsulosin to conventional treatment seemed beneficial in terms of stone clearance of lower ureteral stones, and this effect was more evident for larger stones, especially when combined with SWL."
15596619,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15596619/,"BACKGROUND: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is an inherited recessive disorder of adrenal steroidogenesis, generally caused by a total or partial deficiency in 21-hydroxylase, due to a deletion of or mutations in the CYP21 gene (the gene that codes for 21-hydroxylase). Impaired cortisol biosynthesis results in corticotropin hypersecretion, which leads to overproduction of intermediate metabolites and androgens.
OBJECTIVE: To describe for the first time, to our knowledge, a patient with CAH and multiple sclerosis (MS).
DESIGN: Case report.
PATIENT: A 22-year-old woman, diagnosed at birth as having a salt-losing 21-hydroxylase deficiency, had sudden visual loss in the right eye and pyramidal, sensory, and cerebellar signs. Repeated brain magnetic resonance images showed focal white matter lesions in periventricular areas, the corpus callosum, the cerebellum, and the brainstem. A cerebrospinal fluid examination revealed several oligoclonal bands. Thereafter, she had 2 relapses, characterized by ataxia and diplopia, and recovered after corticosteroid treatment.
RESULTS: The reported case fulfills the diagnostic criteria for CAH and MS.
CONCLUSIONS: Some clues suggest that the association between CAH and MS could be nonincidental: a possible MS susceptibility locus is on chromosome 6p21, on which the CYP21 gene is located; the CYP21 gene and the CYP21P pseudogene alternate in tandem with the C4 genes (the genes that code for the homonym complement protein) (C4AQ0 is particularly frequent in patients with relapsing-remitting MS); and, in previous studies, brain magnetic resonance imaging showed T2-hyperintense focal areas in the white matter of CAH patients. Our observation should alert neurologists to the presence of signs and symptoms suggestive of late-onset CAH in MS patients and, in turn, endocrinologists to the appearance of neurological signs and symptoms in CAH patients."

DESIGN: Retrospective evaluation of large stress-testing database.
SETTING: Multispecialty tertiary care center.
PATIENTS: A total of 5,069 consecutive patients who were referred for exercise stress testing.
MEASUREMENTS: We compared levels of fitness in 641 African-Americans (52% male) with 4,428 whites (73% male), and performed univariate and multivariate analyses to determine the predictors of fitness (including race).
RESULTS: Compared with African-American men (mean [+/- SD] age, 60 +/- 11 years), white men (mean age, 63 +/- 11 years) have significantly higher exercise capacity (10.7 +/- 3.5 vs 11.4 +/- 3.4 metabolic equivalents [METs], respectively; p < 0.001). The exercise capacity in African-American and white women was similar (8.5 +/- 2.9 vs 8.7 +/- 3.0 METs, respectively). However, body mass indexes (BMIs) were significantly higher in both African-American men (29.1 +/- 4.3 vs 28.2 +/- 4.3 kg/m(2), respectively; p < 0.001) and women (30.2 +/- 5.7 vs 27.9 +/- 5.5 kg/m(2), respectively; p < 0.0001) compared to their white counterparts, as was the prevalence of obesity (men, 44% vs 33%, respectively; women, 37% vs 27%, respectively; both p < 0.001). Although a model containing age, gender, BMI, and race only accounted for 32% of exercise capacity, all independently (p < 0.0001) predicted higher exercise capacity, as follows: younger age (r(2) = 0.14); male gender (r(2) = 0.12); BMI (r(2) = 0.06); and white race (r(2) = 0.004).
CONCLUSIONS: In an adult population of individuals who were referred for exercise stress testing, African-Americans were more obese and had significantly lower exercise capacity than their white counterparts. Emphasis on weight reduction and increasing physical fitness is particularly needed for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases in African-Americans."
15597291,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15597291/,"BACKGROUND: Prompt treatment of acute rejection and pulmonary infection reduces morbidity and mortality in lung transplant recipients. Symptoms, spirometry, and bronchoscopy are used to detect these complications. Of these, symptom reporting is the least invasive, yet has received little critical examination.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the potential for using reports of symptoms, such as cough and shortness of breath, to recognize clinically significant acute rejection and pulmonary infection after lung transplantation.
METHODS: Symptoms reported during routine follow-up visits were compared between lung transplant recipients (LTR) with clinically significant acute rejection (grade >or= A2) and those without (grade A0 or A1) and between LTR with rejection (grade >or= A2) and those with pulmonary infection.
RESULTS: LTR with rejection (grade >or= A2) reported more symptoms (P < .01) than did those without (grade A0, A1); however, the magnitude of difference was minimal. LTR with clinically significant acute rejection (grade >or= A2) reported symptoms at a rate comparable with those having pulmonary infection.
CONCLUSIONS: Although symptoms may alert LTR to changes in their condition, no symptoms (respiratory, general, or activities of daily living [ADL]) differentiate between grades of rejection or pulmonary infection."
15597580,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15597580/,"BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: Late reoperation for failed aortic homograft is widely regarded as a high-risk procedure. A review is presented of the authors' experience of redo-aortic valve replacement (re-do AVR) examining factors which affect, and whether a previous aortic homograft replacement influences, operative outcome.
METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of consecutive re-do AVR performed at the authors' institution between 1998 and 2002.
RESULTS: During the study period, 178 patients (125 males, 53 females; mean age 52.4 years; range: 16-85 years) underwent re-do AVR. The group included first-time (72%), second-time (20%), and more than third-time re-do AVR (8%). Forty-six patients (26%) received a homograft (group I), and 132 (74%) a stented biological/mechanical valve (group II). The two groups were matched for baseline clinical characteristics and operative variables. The type of explanted valve, and preoperative and operative variables, were analyzed using univariate and multivariate models. Primary outcome was defined as 30-day mortality, and secondary outcome as postoperative complications. The overall 30-day mortality was 12.3%, but was much lower (4.5%) for elective isolated and multiple re-do AVR. Univariate analysis showed significant predictors of 30-day mortality to be: age >65 years (p = 0.02); renal dysfunction (p = 0.005); preoperative unstable status (p = 0.03); preoperative NYHA class III/IV dyspnea (p = 0.02); non-elective operation (p = 0.01); preoperative arrhythmia (p = 0.005); history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (p = 0.002); preoperative cardiogenic shock (p = 0.03); impaired left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <50% (p = 0.04); and other valvular procedure(s) performed simultaneously (p = 0.01). In a multivariate analysis, the only significant predictors of 30-day mortality were impaired LVEF (p = 0.03) and a history of COPD (p = 0.007). Group I patients had a significantly shorter mean hospital stay (10.2+/-5.9 versus 14.1+/-12.5 days; p = 0.009), but there were no significant differences between groups in terms of postoperative complications.
CONCLUSION: A previous aortic homograft replacement was not associated with an increased operative risk at the time of re-do AVR. A history was COPD was an important predictor of 30-day mortality, and this finding requires further investigation."
15598198,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15598198/,"AIMS: To evaluate the effect on quitting smoking at 18 months postpartum of smoking cessation interventions based on the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) delivered in pregnancy compared to current standard care. It has been claimed that TTM-based interventions will continue to create quitters after the end of the intervention period.
DESIGN: Cluster randomized trial.
SETTING: Antenatal clinics in general practices in the West Midlands, UK.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 918 pregnant smokers originally enrolled in the trial, of which 393 women were followed-up at 18 months postpartum.
INTERVENTIONS: One hundred general practices were randomized into the three trial arms. Midwives in these practices delivered three interventions: A (standard care), B (TTM-based self-help manuals) and C (TTM-based self-help manuals plus sessions with an interactive computer program giving individualized smoking cessation advice).
MEASUREMENTS: Self-reported continuous and point prevalence abstinence since pregnancy.
FINDINGS: When combined together, there was a slight and not significant benefit for both TTM arms compared to the control, with an odds ratio (OR) 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.20 (0.29-4.88) for continuous abstinence. For point prevalence abstinence, the OR (95%CI) was 1.15 (0.66-2.03). Seven of the 54 (13%) women who had quit at the end of pregnancy were still quit 18 months later, and there was no evidence that the TTM-based interventions were superior in preventing relapse.
CONCLUSIONS: The TTM-based interventions may have shown some evidence of a short-term benefit for quitting in pregnancy but no benefit relative to standard care when followed-up in the longer-term."
15598288,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15598288/,"BACKGROUND: It is generally accepted that parity is a strong predictor of pelvic organ prolapse and incontinence. However, controversy persists as to whether this effect is due to pregnancy itself or parturition.
AIMS: To define the contribution of early and late pregnancy to bladder mobility.
METHODS: Case control series, using 88 non-pregnant control subjects recruited for a heritability study on urinary incontinence and prolapse, matched for age and ethnicity with 28 pregnant women seen at 10-17 weeks and again at 32-39 weeks' gestation. Main outcome parameters were ultrasound measures of anterior, central and posterior compartment descent as well as joint mobility measurements.
RESULTS: Patients in early pregnancy showed higher values for bladder mobility in comparison with non-pregnant controls, although this did not reach significance for all parameters. However, when late pregnancy data were tested against non-pregnant controls, this difference reached significance for all tested parameters. Uterine and rectal descent did not show any significant differences between groups. Results for joint mobility were inconsistent.
CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the hypothesis that bladder and urethral mobility increase in pregnancy. This effect is already noticeable at 6-18 weeks. As similar changes are also seen in elbow hyperextension, a generalised effect on connective tissue biomechanics, likely hormonal, can be hypothesised."
15598324,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15598324/,"BACKGROUND: A patient with a failed renal graft is generally approached conservatively, especially when graft failure occurs more than 1 month after transplantation. This approach was the cause of extensive morbidity in our institution and therefore we evaluated the correctness of our approach towards transplanted children.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Case histories of 182 renal transplants in 145 patients, performed between 1977 and 1999 were reviewed.
RESULTS: A total of 63 renal grafts failed: 19 between 0-1 month (group 1), 22 between 1 month and 1 yr (group 2) and 22 later than 1 yr after transplantation (group 3). Fifty-three grafts (84%) were removed: 100% of group 1, 86% of group 2 and 68% of group 3. The symptoms that indicated the need for graft removal were fever without a clear infection focus (n = 12), abdominal pain in the transplant area (n = 14), macroscopic hematuria (n = 10) and severe hypertension (n = 22). After transplant nephrectomy pain, fever and macroscopic hematuria completely resolved in all and hypertension resolved in 36% of patients. Transplant nephrectomy-associated morbidity was observed in 38% of the patients with 100% recovery.
CONCLUSION: The clinical outcome confirmed the indications for transplant nephrectomy. Our future approach will be more aggressive: as soon as symptoms such as unexplained fever, local pain or macroscopic hematuria appear, graft removal will be performed without delay."
15598706,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15598706/,"OBJECTIVES: We report a female patient suffering from Takayasu arteritis (TA) who underwent surgical revascularization.
METHODS: By studying specimens obtained at surgery, we evaluated the cell composition of the arterial wall, along with the maturation pattern of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) during the active phase of TA. Using TUNEL, we detected apoptotic cells within the tunica media.
RESULTS: The highest percentage of apoptotic cells was found in areas where inflammatory infiltrate was present and the medial structure was more or less damaged. Apoptotic cells were also found in structurally preserved areas, where VSMC but not inflammatory cells were present.
CONCLUSIONS: Apoptosis involved not only inflammatory cells but also VSMC, particularly those of the immature type. We hypothesize a role for VSMC apoptosis in the development of TA."
15598853,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15598853/,"BACKGROUND: This study reports data from a survey carried out in the Iranian Center for Breast Cancer (ICBC) to examine whether women read poster displays in waiting rooms and whether they would have any suggestions to improve posters and thus meet their informational needs.
METHODS: Five specially designed posters were displayed in waiting rooms in the ICBC. The content of posters was related to risk factors, early detection, signs and symptoms, and prevention of breast cancer. During a 3 month period a self-administered questionnaire was distributed to all attendees and they were asked to complete the questionnaire.
RESULTS: Overall, 850 women were given the questionnaire and 777 completed questionnaires (91 per cent) were returned. The mean age of the women was 37.0 years (SD = 10.7) and they mostly had secondary education (47 per cent). In all, 691 women (86 per cent) reported that they had seen the posters and 620 (80 per cent) said that they had read the displays. The vast majority of the women reported that posters were readable (89 per cent) and understandable (80 per cent). However, 25 per cent of the respondents indicated that materials on the displays created more questions rather than answering their questions and some reported that they became upset (26 per cent) or felt anxiety (42 per cent) while reading the posters. Finally, 218 women (28 per cent) had suggestions to improve posters, of whom 110 (50 per cent) believed that the posters should be simpler.
CONCLUSION: The study findings suggest that despite the limitations of posters as a means of health communication, their use in public places may be useful but consideration should be given to the content of the poster displays to prevent anxiety."
15598855,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15598855/,"BACKGROUND: Registration on a primary care disease register is a necessary first step for the provision of systematic care for ischaemic heart disease (IHD). We examined whether there is any potential bias in IHD registration based upon the ethnic origin of the patient.
METHODS: 'Observed' rates of ischaemic heart disease registration from 12 general practices in Bristol were contrasted with national 'expected' rates derived from the Health Survey for England, 1999, with the aim of comparing rates of registration between patients whose countries of origin were South Asian and non-South Asian. Ethnicity was classified by the patients' surname. Data were stratified by age, sex and ethnicity.
RESULTS: Overall, no major differences in 'observed' and 'expected' rates of registration between South Asian and non-South Asians were observed. In general, however, 'observed' rates were lower than the 'expected' rates for both groups.
CONCLUSION: We found no overall bias in IHD registration based upon the patient's ethnic origin but we did observe generally low rates of IHD registration overall."
15598859,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15598859/,"BACKGROUND: Self-administered questionnaires are commonly used in experimental studies to elicit quality of life or other outcomes. Hence, achieving an acceptable level of follow-up from patients is critical to minimizing bias. Many methods for maximizing follow-up remain untested. It is also unclear what level of follow-up is required to prevent bias being introduced.
METHODS: We recruited 246 men from general practice surgeries in Sydney, Australia. These 246 men were randomized to receive a covering letter with their follow-up questionnaire either advising of a deadline to reply (Deadline, n = 126) or a standard letter without a deadline (No Deadline, n = 120). Four standardized reminder prompts subsequently were administered. We calculated interim response rates and the final proportion of follow-up questionnaires received according to group. We also compared scores on two main outcomes, namely, knowledge and decisional conflict at each time when reminder prompts were administered.
RESULTS: One hundred and twelve (88.9%) men in the Deadline group returned their follow-up questionnaires compared with 102 (85.0%) men in the No Deadline group. This difference was not statistically significant [odds ratio = 1.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.67-2.99; p = 0.36]. Time to response also was not significantly affected by cover letter received (hazard ratio = 0.96; 95% CI = 0.73-1.25; p = 0.76). Results of the original RCT were similar in terms of direction and effect size at all times irrespective of when reminder prompts were administered.
CONCLUSION: The addition of a deadline adds no further impact in improving response rates from male patients compared with an unspecified letter. Despite the accepted wisdom that higher response protects against bias, differences in outcomes were consistent throughout the post-test data collection period."
15599137,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15599137/,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to assess whether coadministration of S(+) ketamine or ketorolac would enhance or prolong local analgesic effect of bupivacaine after inguinal hernia repair.
DESIGN: Prospective double-blind randomized study evaluating pain intensity after surgery under general anesthesia.
SETTING: Outpatient facilities of the University Hospital of Lausanne.
PATIENT: Thirty-six ASA I-II outpatients scheduled for elective day-case inguinal herniorraphy.
INTERVENTION: Analgesia strategy consisted of a wound infiltration and an inguinal field block either with 30 mL bupivacaine (0.5%) or with the same volume of a mixture of 27 mL bupivacaine (0.5%) + 3 mL S(+) ketamine (75 mg) or a 28 mL bupivacaine (0.5%) + 2 mL ketorolac (60 mg). Postoperative analgesic regimen was standardized.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Pain intensity was assessed with a Visual Analog Scale, a verbal rating score, and by pressure algometry 2, 4, 6, 24, and 48 hours after surgery.
RESULTS: The 3 groups of patients experienced the highest Visual Analog Scale pain score at 24 hours, which was different from those at 6 and 48 hours (P < 0.05). Apart from a significantly lower pain sensation (verbal rating score) in the ketorolac group at 24 and 48 hours and only at 48 hours with ketamine, there were no other differences in pain scores, pain pressure thresholds, or rescue analgesic consumption between groups throughout the 48-hour study period.
CONCLUSION: The addition of S(+)-ketamine or ketorolac only minimally improves the analgesic effect of bupivacaine. This may be related to the tension-free hernia repair technique associated with low postoperative pain."
15599503,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15599503/,"OBJECTIVE: An important information source for pharmacotherapy in populations at risk is drug labelling. We compared the recommendations for patients with renal insufficiency included in German drug labellings with evidence from the literature.
METHODS: From the 120 drugs with the highest turnover in a large university hospital, all drugs with pharmacokinetics independent of renal function (n=48) and those with substantial accumulation in renal failure (n=28) were identified. For both groups of compounds, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic aspects relevant for dose individualisation in those with renal insufficiency were extracted from the literature and compared with the information given in the German drug labelling.
RESULTS: Over half of the labellings (15 of 26) of non-accumulating drugs without renal adverse drug reactions contained no dose recommendation for patients with renal insufficiency. The labelling of nephrotoxic compounds that do not accumulate included more frequently a recommendation to adapt the dose or to monitor than the labelling of drugs without nephrotoxic potential (15 of 22 versus 5 of 26, P=0.002). For over half of accumulating drugs (16 of 28), the dose given in the labelling depends primarily on creatinine clearance. The ratio between the labelling dose and the dose based on the pharmacokinetic concept to achieve identical plasma concentrations (Q0 concept) differed widely (0.4-2).
CONCLUSIONS: When renal failure had no impact on dosing, information was often missing. Such information is however important to differentiate, whether no dose adaptation is necessary or no information is available. If dose adjustment is required, application of a uniform concept is desirable."
15599681,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15599681/,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hyperalgesia induced by pelvic colon distension has been demonstrated in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). In this study the authors analyzed whether colonoscopy of patients with IBS is more painful and technically more demanding as compared to non-IBS patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a prospective study 639 patients (132 with IBS, 507 without IBS) who underwent colonoscopy were evaluated for sex, age, body mass index, administration of sedatives and analgesics, time for cecal intubation, intensity of pain during examination (intensity graduated 1-5), diagnosis and degree of diverticulosis, spasticity, loop formation, elongation and distortion, respectively. A statistical comparison of both patient groups was performed.
RESULTS: Patients of the IBS group were significantly younger compared with patients in the control group (p < 0.001). In an age-matched comparison of both groups low pain (intensity 1) was noted in 29 (22%) of IBS patients and 82 patients (31%) in the control group. Severe pain (intensity 4 and 5) occurred in 17 (12.9%) and six (4.5%), respectively, of IBS patients and in 21 (8%) and five patients (2%), respectively, of the control group. The differences were statistically not significant (p = 0.1). Administration of analgesics occurred significantly more frequently in the IBS group (p = 0.01), however, only nine IBS patients (6.8%) and four patients without IBS (1.5%) received analgesics. All other parameters analyzed did not show significant differences between the groups.
CONCLUSION: Regarding perception of procedure-related pain and technical problems in colonoscopy, patients with IBS do not show significant differences compared to patients without IBS."
15599731,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15599731/,"PURPOSE: To avoid dependence on body weight, the standardised uptake value (SUV) in positron emission tomography (PET) can instead be normalised to the lean body mass (LBM), which can be determined from body volume and mass. This study was designed to answer the following questions: Firstly, can the total body volume in principle be determined using PET? Secondly, is the precision of this measurement comparable to that achieved using an established standard method.
METHODS: Ten patients were examined during oncological whole-body PET examinations. The whole-body volume of the patients was determined from the transmission scan in PET. Air displacement plethysmography with BOD POD was used for comparison as the standard method of volume determination.
RESULTS: In all patients, the whole-body volumes could be determined using PET and the standard method. Bland and Altman [23] analysis for agreement between the volumes determined by the two methods (presentation of differences vs means) revealed a very small difference of -0.14 l. With a mean patient volume of 71.81+/-15.93 l, the relative systematic error is only <0.1%. On this basis, equality of the volume values determined by the two methods can be assumed.
CONCLUSION: PET can be used as a supplementary method for experimental determination of whole-body volume and total body fat in tumour patients. The fat content can be used to calculate the LBM and to determine body weight-independent SUVs (SUV(LBM))."
15601892,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15601892/,"PURPOSE: To prospectively compare unenhanced power Doppler sonographic findings of arterial vascularization of invasive breast carcinoma with histopathologic and immunohistochemical parameters and to determine whether tumor arterial vascularization contributes to prediction of axillary node status.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ethics committee approval and informed consent were obtained. A total of 97 invasive breast carcinomas were prospectively studied with unenhanced power Doppler sonography before surgery. Lumpectomy or mastectomy with full axillary nodal dissection was performed. Sonographic tumor size and number of tumor arteries were correlated with axillary nodal status by means of logistic regression analysis. Tumor microvascularization was immunohistochemically assessed in a subset of 55 carcinomas. Sonographic variables were correlated with tumor arteries with a diameter larger than 300 mum and with the density and area of microvascularization. The kappa statistic and Bland-Altman agreement limits were used to measure agreement between techniques.
RESULTS: Good agreement of sonographic and histologic findings regarding number of tumor arteries (kappa= 0.66, P < .001) and tumor size (P = .012) was observed. Multivariate analysis showed an independent relationship between probability of axillary metastasis, number of tumor arteries (P = .016), and sonographic tumor size (P = .035). A predictive model of axillary status was developed. The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to determine 0.2324 as the score to classify axillary nodal status. This score indicated high sensitivity (96.1%), low specificity (53.0%), and high negative predictive value (96.1%).
CONCLUSION: The number of arteries in invasive breast carcinoma detected with unenhanced power Doppler sonography and sonographic tumor size are independent predictors of axillary nodal status; these variables could contribute to reliable prediction of absence of axillary involvement on the basis of a mathematic model."
