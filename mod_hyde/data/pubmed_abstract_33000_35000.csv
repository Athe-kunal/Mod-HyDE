23315904,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23315904/,"AIMS: The purpose of this pre-specified analysis of the PROlonging Dual antiplatelet treatment after Grading stent-induced Intimal hyperplasia studY (PRODIGY) was to assess device-specific outcomes relative to different duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after Everolimus- (EES), Paclitaxel (PES), Zotarolimus- (ZES-S) eluting, or bare metal stents (BMS).
METHODS AND RESULTS: We randomized 2013 patients to BMS, ZES-S, PES, or EES implantation. At 30 days, each stent group underwent up to 6 or 24 months clopidogrel therapy. The primary endpoint, which was a composite of death, myocardial infarction, or cerebrovascular accident, did not differ in patients receiving BMS [HR: 0.89 (95% CI: 0.54-1.45)], PES [HR: 0.74 (95% CI: 0.43-1.25)], or EES [HR: 0.63 (95% CI: 0.33-1.21)] implantation across DAPT groups, whereas it was significantly higher in ZES-S patients undergoing long when compared with short-term DAPT therapy (HR: 2.85, P = 0.0018), with positive interaction testing (P-value = 0.004). At the 6-month landmark analysis, heterogeneity across stent types persisted for the primary study endpoint and other secondary clinical outcomes, whereas patients receiving PES showed a significantly higher rate of definite, probable and definite, probable, possible stent thrombosis in the short DAPT regimen. No association in absolute or relative terms was noted between stent potency in inhibiting intimal hyperplasia and greater vulnerability to shorter DAPT therapy.
CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that optimal duration of DAPT may be stent-specific and it does not support a clear association between stent potency and vulnerability to shorter DAPT therapy.

23316073,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23316073/,"AIMS: This study compared the level of alcohol mortality in tsarist and contemporary Russia.
METHODS: Cross-sectional and annual time-series data from 1870 to 1894, 2008 and 2009 on the mortality rate from deaths due to 'drunkenness' were compared for men in the 50 provinces of tsarist 'European Russia': an area that today corresponds with the territory occupied by the Baltic countries, Belarus, Moldova, Ukraine and the Russian provinces to the west of the Ural Mountains.
RESULTS: In 1870-1894, the male death rate from 'drunkenness' in the Russian provinces (15.9 per 100,000) was much higher than in the non-Russian provinces. However, the rate recorded in Russia in the contemporary period was even higher--23.3.
CONCLUSIONS: Russia has had high levels of alcohol mortality from at least the late 19th century onwards. While a dangerous drinking pattern and spirits consumption may underpin high alcohol mortality across time, the seemingly much higher levels in the contemporary period seem to be also driven by an unprecedented level of consumption, and also possibly, surrogate alcohol use. This study highlights the urgent need to reduce the level of alcohol consumption among the population in order to reduce high levels of alcohol mortality in contemporary Russia."
23317204,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23317204/,"BACKGROUND: Although nicotine dependence plays a role as a main barrier for smoking cessation, there is still a lack of solid evidence on the validity of biomarkers to determine nicotine dependence in clinical settings. This study aimed to investigate whether urinary cotinine levels could reflect the severity of nicotine dependence in active smokers.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data regarding general characteristics and smoking status was collected using a self-administered smoking questionnaire. The Fagerstrom test for nicotine dependence (FTND) was used to determine nicotine dependence of the participants, and a total of 381 participants were classified into 3 groups of nicotine dependence: low (n=205, 53.8%), moderate (n=127, 33.3%), and high dependence groups (n=49, 12.9%). Stepwise multiple linear regression model and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves analyses were used to determine the validity of urinary cotinine for high nicotine dependence.
RESULTS: In correlation analysis, urinary cotinine levels increased with FTND score (r=0.567, P<0.001). ROC curves analysis showed that urinary cotinine levels predicted the high-dependence group with reasonable accuracy (optimal cut-off value=1,000 ng/mL; AUC=0.82; P<0.001; sensitivity=71.4%; specificity=74.4%). In stepwise multiple regression analysis, the total smoking period (β=0.042, P=0.001) and urinary cotinine levels (β=0.234, P<0.001) were positively associated with nicotine dependence, whereas an inverse association was observed between highest education levels (>16 years) and nicotine dependence (β=-0.573, P=0.034).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study support the validity of using urinary cotinine levels for assessment of nicotine dependence in active smokers."
23317261,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23317261/,"BACKGROUND: Non-invasive oral verrucous carcinoma (OVC) and invasive well-differentiated oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) have similar histopathologic findings but different biological behavior. These two malignancies must be correctly differentiated by pathologists. The aim of this study was to determine immunohistochemical (IHC) expression of Ki67 in OVC and well-differentiated OSCC.
METHODS: Expression of Ki67 was evaluated by IHC in 15 cases of epithelial hyperplasia with no dysplasia (A group), 15 cases of OVC (B group), 12 cases of microinvasive OSCC(C group) and 15 cases of well-differentiated OSCC (D group).
RESULTS: There was a significant difference in Ki67 expression based on pattern distribution of immunostaining positive cells, with quantitative and semi-quantitative analyses, among the four groups ; also, between A group and each of the other three groups (P=0.0001). But there was no significant difference between B and C, C and D, and B and D groups (P>0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The three evaluation methods of Ki67 expression showed Ki67 (Mib-1) is not a good immunohistochemical marker to assess invasion status and differentiate OVC from well-differentiated OSCC; also, it cannot be used as a diagnostic tool to distinguish between variants of OSCC with similar grade."
23317287,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23317287/,"BACKGROUND: Women who have been through gynaecological cancer, experience challenges on many levels after diagnosis and treatment. Studies show that, in order to help women in their rehabilitation process, there is a need for holistic care and follow-up.
AIM: The aim of this qualitative study is to provide insight into women's own lived experiences of participating in an education and counselling group intervention after curative treatment for gynaecological cancer.
METHOD: A qualitative study based on data from three focus groups with 17 women who had participated in a nurse-led education and counselling group intervention after treatment for gynaecological cancer.
RESULTS: The main findings show that participation in the rehabilitation group was described as a special community of mutual understanding and belonging. Education and the sharing of knowledge provided a clearer vocabulary for, and understanding of, the women's own lived experiences. The presence of dedicated and professional care workers was reported to be essential for the outcome of the group intervention.
CONCLUSION: Attending a nurse-led education and counselling group intervention had a positive impact on various aspects of the women's lived experiences. The programme also provided professionals with important insights into the patients' views and feelings regarding cancer treatment, trajectories and rehabilitation. This knowledge has already proven itself useful in clinical practice for improving staff communication skills and psycho-social support related to gynaecological cancer care."
23317347,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23317347/,"BACKGROUND: Palliative Care (PC) is an approach that improves the Quality of Life (QoL). A number of QoL assessment tools have been developed and validated in PC. It is not clear how QoL should be measured in PC practice. A procedure of QoL assessment in clinical practice can be defined as a clinical intervention focused on QoL assessment. This is a typical complex intervention that should be appropriately developed and described in all its components and assessed for its effectiveness. The aim of this study is to define a framework to help researchers to develop and evaluate clinical interventions focused on QoL assessment in PC.
METHODS: A study group of experts in PC and in research methodology was set up to define a framework that would describe the principles of clinical interventions focused on QoL assessment in PC. The study group discussed the WHO Population Screening Principles as a possible useful framework. The new principles had to be developed taking into account the following criteria: 1) specific to PC practice; 2) address a single underlying characteristic; 3) anchored to relevant literature; 4) consistent with the WHO PC definition.With regard to contents and the format of the principles, discussions occurred among the study group members through a cognitive process.
RESULTS: We reviewed each of the WHO Population Screening Principles and adapted them to QoL assessment, taking into account the defined criteria. As a result, a new framework, the QoL Assessment Principles in Palliative Care was developed. It consisted of 4 sections, for a total of 11 principles.
CONCLUSIONS: The WHO Screening Principles framework was used to outline the eleven essential principles to be considered in developing and/or evaluating clinical interventions focused on QoL assessment in PC. The QoL Assessment Principles in Palliative Care identified could represent a methodological and ethical standard to be considered when developing and evaluating a clinical intervention focused on QoL assessment in PC."
23317437,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23317437/,"BACKGROUND: Recurrence following endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysm is attributed to either coil compaction or aneurysm growth but these processes have not been studied as distinct processes.
METHODS: The pixel size of the coil mass and aneurysm sac, and the adjacent parent artery were measured and expressed as a ratio to the pixel size of the parent vessel diameter on immediate post-procedure and follow-up angiograms. Increase of aneurysm area or decrease in coil mass of 30% or greater on follow-up angiogram was used to define ""significant"" aneurysm growth and coil compaction, respectively.
RESULTS: Eleven patients had coil compaction, 14 patients had significant aneurysm growth and 4 patients had small aneurysm regrowth. Retreatment was performed in the 14 patients with ""significant"" aneurysm regrowth and 8 of the 11 patients with coil compaction at mean follow of 11 months (range 5-20 months) following the initial procedure. There were no events of new aneurysmal rupture in either 11 patients with coil compaction or 14 patients with significant aneurysm regrowth over a mean follow-up period of 22 months (range of 9-42 months).
CONCLUSION: This is one of the first studies to differentiate coil compaction and aneurysm growth as distinct etiologies for aneurysm recurrence."
23317726,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23317726/,"INTRODUCTION: The current mainstream practice in otolaryngology departments relating to the use of prophylactic antibiotics in epistaxis patients requiring nasal packing is highly variable. This is due primarily to the lack of any validated guidelines. As such, we introduced a new treatment algorithm resulting in significant reduction of use in the systemic antibiotics, with emphasis instead on the use of topical antibiotics. The results were validated through a complete audit cycle.
METHODS: A total of 57 patients undergoing nasal packing for spontaneous epistaxis were studied. Reaudit occurred after the implementation of new guidelines. Telephone surveys were conducted six weeks after hospital discharge, assessing infective nasal symptoms as well as rebleeding and readmission rates.
RESULTS: Systemic antibiotic prescribing in anterior nasal packing fell by 58.2% between audit cycles with no statistically significant associated increase in infective nasal symptoms, rebleeding or readmission rates six weeks following hospital discharge.
CONCLUSIONS: Systemic prophylactic antibiotics are unnecessary in the majority of epistaxis patients with nasal packs. The use of topical antibiotics such as Naseptin may be more appropriate, cheaper and as effective. Implementation of this treatment algorithm will help standardise systemic antibiotic usage in epistaxis patients with nasal packing and should reduce costs associated with unnecessary use of such medication."
23317731,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23317731/,"INTRODUCTION: The 2010 British Thoracic Society guidelines recommend that a weighted decision be made by clinicians with regard to surgical intervention for pneumothorax as the video assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) approach is better tolerated by patients but carries a higher rate of recurrence (5% vs 1%).
METHODS: Overall, 163 patients underwent surgical intervention for pneumothorax at our institution and data were collected prospectively for almost 7 years. Of these, 86 patients underwent VATS under a single surgeon with extensive VATS experience to compensate for the associated learning curve while 79 patients underwent an open procedure.
RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in the recurrence rate between the open and the VATS group (1% vs 3.5%, p=1.0). The VATS group was superior to the open group in terms of reduced postoperative bleeding (7.5% vs 0%, p=0.01), reduced number of intensive care unit admissions (16% vs 0%, p<0.01) and a reduced adjusted length of stay (3 vs 5.5 days, p<0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: A comparable recurrence rate is attainable with a VATS approach once the learning curve is surpassed and a reduction in morbidity is an additional merit."
23317917,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23317917/,"OBJECTIVE: The debate on HCV discordant couples requiring assisted reproduction is still open today, and specific guidelines have not yet been established on whether or not physicians should treat HCV discordant couples who require ART. We studied the results of our reproductive assistance with sperm washing in HCV discordant couples, all treated in a single center, including the serological status of mothers and babies, and the outcome of the pregnancies.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study conducted between January 2008 and December 2010 in our Reproductive Center in Sacco Hospital, University of Milan. Thirty-five HCV serodiscordant infertile couples with an HCV viremic positive male partner were enrolled. All of them completed the immuno-virological and fertility triage, and were treated according to our clinical protocols.
RESULTS: Forty-seven superovulation and IUI and 38 second-level ART procedures are reported. The pregnancy rates for IUI and ICSI are similar to those reported by the Italian ART register. All the 85 sperm samples were treated with sperm washing technique to reduce HCV in semen and the possible risk of transmission. We did not observe any preterm delivery or negative perinatal outcome. No mothers or babies are infected by HCV.
CONCLUSION: This is the biggest prospective study conducted in a single center involving HCV discordant infertile couples in an ART program. Although sexual transmission of HCV is very low, in subfertile or infertile couples sperm washing should be used to treat HCV positive semen before ART. We suggest that it is not necessary to perform nested PCR to detect HCV RNA in the final swim-up. Since the presence of HCV in semen implies a possible risk of nosocomial contamination, safety regulations must be strictly applied in assisted reproduction laboratories."
23318002,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23318002/,"BACKGROUND: Population surveys report that anxiety and depressive disorders are less common in older people. It has been suggested this may be accounted for by measurement errors. We analysed 2007 English Psychiatric Morbidity Survey data to explore whether the reduced prevalences of anxiety and depression in older people might be explained by the Revised Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS-R) items functioning differently across age groups.
METHODS: 7403 people, 57% of those approached, took part. A multiple indicators multiple causes ('MIMIC') model explored the factor structure of the CIS-R and the relationship between covariates (age, sex and IQ) and the factor structure.
RESULTS: A model with one latent factor ""neuroticism"", measured by 14 dichotomised individual symptom scores, was the most parsimonious (factor loadings 0.57-0.92). Younger respondents (<65 years), women and those with lower IQs, had significantly higher neuroticism factor scores. Older respondents (>65 years) were less likely than younger adults to experience irritability, phobia, and worry, but more likely to experience fatigue, worry specifically about physical health and sleep difficulties. Model factor loadings remained strong and statistically significant (0.53-0.92) after including age, sex and IQ as covariates.
LIMITATIONS: We analysed age dichotomously, defining older as aged 65 or above. We could not identify which of the participants had dementia, a potentially important covariate.
CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that the CIS-R can reliably identify people with anxiety and depressive symptoms across the population, suggesting that specialist instruments may not always be required to accurately measure anxiety and depressive symptoms in older people."
23318528,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23318528/,"BACKGROUND: Active surveillance (AS) is an appropriate management strategy for men with low-risk prostate cancer. Most protocols recommend repeated prostate biopsy every 12-24 months. The purpose of this paper is to describe histological inflammation patterns in men on AS who underwent serial prostate biopsy for disease monitoring.
METHODS: We reviewed records of men on AS from January 1999 through February 2011 who had a diagnostic plus ≥1 repeat transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsies performed at our institution. The type and degree of inflammatory infiltrate were grossly reviewed and scored for each patient's biopsy by a single pathologist. Relationship of inflammation severity and number of serial biopsies was assessed using a repeated measures mixed model. Unpaired t-test and χ(2)-square analysis assessed variance in degree of inflammation and location of inflammation relative to cancer grade progression defined as Gleason sum increase.
RESULTS: Fifty-six men met study inclusion criteria. Mean age was 62.1 (6.5) years, 71% were stage cT1c, 79% had a PSA level <10 ng ml(-1), and 98% had diagnostic Gleason sum ≤6. A small, statistically significant increase in maximum chronic inflammation (CI) scores with greater number of repeat biopsies was observed. CI scores were not associated with number of biopsies based on upgrade status. The main limitation to our study is our small sample size. Potential unmeasured confounders, such as unreported antibiotic use or symptomatic prostatitis, may have also affected our findings.
CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study of 56 men on AS for localized prostate cancer, degree of chronic histological inflammation increased with greater number of prostate biopsies, but was not associated with subsequent risk of grade progression."
23318622,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23318622/,"BACKGROUND: Health insurance status and access to care are recurring topics of discussion and concern. The purpose of this investigation was to examine access to care on the basis of insurance status for patients with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in South Florida.
METHODS: From March 2010 to March 2011, eighty patients with ACL injuries were identified at a county hospital sports medicine clinic and a university-based sports medicine practice. Demographic and injury-specific data were obtained with attention to the date of injury, the date of diagnosis, and the number of medical visits. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated from multivariable Cox proportional-hazards regression models to determine the effect of insurance type on the time to diagnosis of an ACL tear.
RESULTS: Patients with private insurance were diagnosed at a median fourteen days after the injury, whereas those receiving Medicaid and those without insurance were diagnosed a median of fifty-six and 121 days after the injury, respectively (p < 0.001). Patients without insurance and those receiving Medicaid had more medical visits prior to diagnosis (median, four; range two to six) than those with private insurance (median, three; range, one to five) (p = 0.006). Differences for patient delays due to not seeking care were not significant among the three groups (p = 0.484).
CONCLUSIONS: When grouped according to insurance status, subjects receiving Medicaid in South Florida faced greater system-related delays in obtaining care than did subjects with private insurance. System-related factors such as lack of access to specialized care result in an increased number of medical encounters. These regional findings are consistent with those of other regional studies on access to orthopaedic care."
23318715,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23318715/,"OBJECTIVE: Rapid growth, possibly occurring in critical periods in early life, may be important for the development of obesity. It is unknown whether this is influenced by postnatal exposures such as age-relevant sources of stress. Frequent house moves may be one such stressor. We aimed to examine if there is a period of growth in early life critical for the development of child obesity by age 9 years and assess the role of house moves in modifying any relationships between early life growth and obesity at age 9 years.
DESIGN: Prospective Australian birth cohort study.
SUBJECTS: In all, 392 children with serial body size measurements from birth to age 9 years.
METHODS: Standardized body mass index (z-BMI) was available for six time points (spanning birth to 3½ years), and the total number of house moves between birth and 3½ years. The outcomes considered were z-BMI and % body fat (%BF) at age 9 years. Linear regression models were used to estimate the effects of serial measurements of z-BMI and number of house moves on the outcomes.
RESULTS: Life-course plots showed that z-BMI at 3½ years was a statistically significant predictor of z-BMI at 9 years (β=0.80; standard error (s.e.), 0.04), whereas z-BMI at 9 months (β=-1.13; s.e., 0.40) and 3½ years (β=4.82; s.e., 0.42) were significant predictors of %BF at age 9 years. There were statistically significant interactions between the number of house moves and change in z-BMI between 9 and 12 months, such that ≥ 3 house moves in early life amplified the detrimental effects of earlier rapid growth on both body size and composition at age 9 years.
CONCLUSION: In the absence of evidence for a single critical period, efforts to prevent overweight and obesity are required throughout childhood. In addition, modifiable postnatal stressors may exacerbate effects of early growth on obesity in later childhood."
23318920,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23318920/,"OBJECTIVE: A previous study of recovery-oriented assertive community treatment (PACT) found large differences over three years in use of state psychiatric hospitals between PACT participants and consumers in a matched control group, especially for PACT participants with significant previous psychiatric hospitalization. This study extended these findings by examining the timing of PACT effects.
METHODS: Generalized estimating equation models of monthly cost data for state, local, and crisis hospital use estimated the time-varying effects of participation in one of ten PACT teams in Washington State. Data from PACT participants (N=450) and propensity score-matched consumers (N=450) were included. Additional analyses determined whether effects differed by prior state hospital use.
RESULTS: Differences in costs between PACT and control participants were largest immediately after PACT enrollment and tapered off. During the first quarter after enrollment, monthly per-person costs for state hospital use were $3,458 lower for PACT enrollees than for control participants. A composite measure of psychiatric hospital costs (state and local hospitals and local crisis stabilization units) declined by $3,539 monthly during the first quarter after PACT enrollment (p<.01). Differences were noted up to 27 months after enrollment, when the difference in the composite costs measure became insignificant compared with the prior quarter (months 25-27) (p>.05). Differences were larger for PACT enrollees with greater baseline state hospital use.
CONCLUSIONS: The time-varying estimates may have implications for the length and intensity of ACT enrollment. However, the optimum time for receipt of ACT services needs to be considered in the context of outcomes other than hospitalization alone."
23319324,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23319324/,"BACKGROUND: Recently, a method of infrared spectroscopy analysis to identify melamine-contained stone was established by examining melamine powders mixed with true urinary stones. However, several studies demonstrated melamine could be interacted with cyanuric acid or uric acid in water through hydrogen bonds. It presents a hypothesis that the infrared spectrum of melamine-contained stone formed in urine is probably different from melamine-contained dry mixtures. This study is to testify is it true.
METHODS: The melamine-related mixtures were, respectively, prepared by mixing powders of melamine with cyanuric acid or uric acid in equimolar ratio. The melamine-related precipitates mimicking its related stone formation were, respectively, prepared by mixing melamine with cyanuric acid or uric acid in water at the given conditions. Subsequently, the melamine-related mixtures and precipitates were analyzed by infrared spectroscopy.
RESULTS: The wave-number positions of powder mixtures of melamine-cyanuric acid and melamine-uric acid were a combination of these of their individual ingredients. The typical wave-number positions of melamine were showed in two melamine-contained mixtures. In contrast, these positions were disappeared or shifted greatly in the two melamine-related precipitates. In total, the spectrum of precipitates of melamine with cyanuric acid and uric acid had significantly differences with their powder mixtures.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate the identification of melamine-related stone by infrared spectroscopy could not use the infrared spectrum of melamine-contained mixtures as a reference."
23319429,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23319429/,"BACKGROUND: Certain foods may increase or decrease the risk of developing asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis and eczema. We explored the impact of the intake of types of food on these diseases in Phase Three of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood.
METHODS: Written questionnaires on the symptom prevalence of asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis and eczema and types and frequency of food intake over the past 12 months were completed by 13-14-year-old adolescents and by the parents/guardians of 6-7-year-old children. Prevalence ORs were estimated using logistic regression, adjusting for confounders, and using a random (mixed) effects model.
RESULTS: For adolescents and children, a potential protective effect on severe asthma was associated with consumption of fruit ≥3 times per week (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.97; OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.97, respectively). An increased risk of severe asthma in adolescents and children was associated with the consumption of fast food ≥3 times per week (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.30 to 1.49; OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.42, respectively), as well as an increased risk of severe rhinoconjunctivitis and severe eczema. Similar patterns for both ages were observed for regional analyses, and were consistent with gender and affluence categories and with current symptoms of all three conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: If the association between fast foods and the symptom prevalence of asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis and eczema is causal, then the findings have major public health significance owing to the rising consumption of fast foods globally."
23320546,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23320546/,"BACKGROUND: Trauma and its complications contribute to morbidity and mortality in the general population. Trauma victims are susceptible to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis. Polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMNs) are activated after trauma and there is substantial evidence of their involvement in the development of ARDS. Activated PMNs release heparin-binding protein (HBP), a granule protein previously shown to be involved in acute inflammatory reactions. We hypothesised that there is an increase in plasma HBP content after trauma and that the increased levels are related to the severity of the trauma or later development of severe sepsis and organ failure (ARDS).
METHODS AND MATERIAL: We investigated HBP in plasma samples within 36 h from trauma in 47 patients admitted to a level one trauma centre with a mean injury severity score (ISS) of 26 (21-34). ISS, admission sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores were recorded at admission. ARDS and presence of severe sepsis were determined daily during intensive care.
RESULTS: We found no correlation between individual maximal plasma HBP levels at admission and ISS, admission SOFA or APACHE II. We found, however, a correlation between HBP levels and development of ARDS (P = 0.026, n = 47), but not to severe sepsis.
CONCLUSION: HBP is a potential biomarker candidate for early detection of ARDS development after trauma. Further research is required to confirm a casual relationship between plasma HBP and the development of ARDS."
23320598,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23320598/,"AIM: To investigate the effects of prolonging hang time of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) fluid on central line-associated blood stream infection (CLABSI), TPN-related cost and nursing workload.
METHODS: A before-after observational study comparing the practice of hanging TPN bags for 48 h (6 February 2009-5 February 2010) versus 24 h (6 February 2008-5 February 2009) in a tertiary neonatal intensive care unit was conducted. The main outcome measures were CLABSI, TPN-related expenses and nursing workload.
RESULTS: One hundred thirty-six infants received 24-h TPN bags and 124 received 48-h TPN bags. Median (inter-quartile range) gestation (37 weeks (33,39) vs. 36 weeks (33,39)), mean (±standard deviation) admission weight of 2442 g (±101) versus 2476 g (±104) and TPN duration (9.7 days (±12.7) vs. 9.9 days (±13.4)) were similar (P > 0.05) between the 24- and 48-h TPN groups. There was no increase in CLABSI with longer hang time (0.8 vs. 0.4 per 1000 line days in the 24-h vs. 48-h group; P < 0.05). Annual cost saving using 48-h TPN was AUD 97,603.00. By using 48-h TPN, 68.3% of nurses indicated that their workload decreased and 80.5% indicated that time spent changing TPN reduced.
CONCLUSION: Extending TPN hang time from 24 to 48 h did not alter CLABSI rate and was associated with a reduced TPN-related cost and perceived nursing workload. Larger randomised controlled trials are needed to more clearly delineate these effects."
23320780,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23320780/,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies comparing unipolar and bipolar hemiarthroplasty for treatment of displaced intracapsular femoral neck fractures in elderly patients have often lacked methodological power and yielded conflicting clinical results. The objective of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes from each implant in a randomized cohort of elderly patients with intracapsular fracture of the femoral neck treated with a cemented hemiprosthesis.
METHODS: This study is a clinical trial of 261 patients (82.0 ± 7.9 years) who were randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups: group 1 (n = 133) received a cemented bipolar implant and group 2 (n = 128) received a unipolar head with the same stem. At 12 months post-surgery, pain and functional abilities were quantified by blinded assessors using the Oxford and Harris Hip Scores, Verbal Numerical Rating Score and Six-Minute Walk. The Mann-Whitney U-test and t-test for independent samples were used to compare results between the groups (P < 0.05).
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in any clinical scores between the groups. Results from the Six-Minute Walk indicated no difference in functional walking ability or endurance (P = 0.446) between the groups. Self-selected pain ratings also did not differ between groups (P = 0.236). Patients receiving the unipolar prosthesis had significantly reduced abduction (P = 0.0001) and internal rotation (P = 0.047) in the operated hip compared to the non-operated hip.
CONCLUSION: These short-term results suggest that unipolar implants share many of the advantages of the bipolar prosthesis but can be manufactured at substantially lower cost. These implants may be appropriate for the less-active elderly patient, particularly when used with bone cement."
23320798,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23320798/,"UNLABELLED: WHAT'S KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT? AND WHAT DOES THE STUDY ADD?: Urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB) is more prevalent in men than women; however, in women the tumour stage is generally more advanced at the time of the diagnosis and the prognosis is worse. Possible explanations include anatomical, genetic and socio-economic factors. The study shows that clinical symptoms before the first-time diagnosis of UCB did not differ between the sexes, while primary care and referral patterns did. Women were more likely to receive symptomatic treatment or therapies for alleged UTIs without further investigation or referral to urological evaluation. The study highlights the fact that there may be a diagnostic delay in women which could contribute to the gender-dependent disparities in stage distribution and prognosis of UCB.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate gender-dependent disparities regarding clinical symptoms, referral patterns or treatments before diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A consecutive series of patients with newly diagnosed UCB completed a questionnaire at the time of admission for elective transurethral resection of a bladder tumour (TURBT). The questionnaire surveyed the presence of haematuria, dysuria, urgency and bladder pain as well as the number of consultations and treatments before urological evaluation. Tumour characteristics, clinical symptoms, treatments and referrals were compared between men and women in the patient series.
RESULTS: In men (n = 130) the distribution of tumour stages was pTa 62.3%, pT1 23.1% and pT ≥ 2 12.3%. The respective percentages in women (n = 38) were pTa 57.9%, pT1 23.7% and pT ≥ 2 18.4% (P > 0.05). The prevalence of clinical symptoms in men vs women was as follows: gross haematuria 65 vs 68%, dysuria 32 vs 44%, urgency 61 vs 47%, and nocturia 57 vs 66%, respectively (P > 0.05). A total of 78% of men vs 55% of women directly consulted a urologist (P < 0.05). Symptomatic treatment for voiding disorders/pain was given without further evaluation to 19% of men vs 47% of women 1 year before the diagnosis of UCB (P < 0.05). A total of 3.8% of men vs 15.8% of women received three or more treatments for urinary tract infections (UTIs) within the same time period (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: In the present study there were no gender-related differences in clinical symptoms of UCB, but women were more likely to be treated for voiding complaints or alleged UTIs without further evaluation or referral to urology than men. Gender-dependent disparities in referral patterns exist and might delay definitive diagnosis of UCB in women."
23320829,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23320829/,"BACKGROUND: Several aspects linked to social are involved in the onset of depressive feelings. We aimed to find out if social adaptability and substance abuse predict depression among end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD).
METHODS: We included 145 ESRD patients undergoing HD. Social adaptability was estimated by the Social Adaptability Index (SAI). Substance abuse was defined according to SAI. We screened for depression by applying the 20-item version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. A score ≥ 24 classified the patients as depressed. Comparisons between depressed and non-depressed patients were carried out and logistic regression was performed to test gender, age, total SAI, SAI without the substance abuse item, only the substance abuse score and substance abuse as a categorical variable (yes/no) as predictors of depression.
RESULTS: There were 36 (24.8%) depressed patients. There were no differences regarding demographic and laboratory data between the depressed and non-depressed patients. Mean SAI among depressed and non-depressed patients was, respectively, 6.1 ± 1.6 vs. 6.2 ± 1.9 (p=0.901). The percentage of patients with or without substance abuse among depressed patients was, respectively, 13.8% vs. 13.9% (p=1.000). Gender, age, total SAI, SAI without the substance abuse item, only the substance abuse score and substance abuse as a categorical variable did not predict depression.
CONCLUSIONS: Social adaptability and substance abuse did not predict depression in HD patients. We propose that aspects related to socioeconomic status not comprised in SAI items should be ruled out as predictors of depression."
23320892,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23320892/,"BACKGROUND: Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic inflammatory and debilitating disease of the skin. No biomarkers for this disease exist.
OBJECTIVES: We set out to test whether angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), lysozyme, soluble interleukin 2 receptor (sIL-2R) and S100A8/A9 (calprotectin) are elevated in patients with HS.
METHODS: Serum was collected from 29 patients with HS at different stages of the disease, and from 51 controls. ACE, lysozyme, sIL-2R and S100A8/A9 levels were measured. Clinical observation of disease activity was scored according to the Hurley grading system and by a physician global score (PGS) of disease severity.
RESULTS: Serum levels of lysozyme and ACE were not increased above the normal reference values in controls or patients with HS. Levels of sIL-2R and S100A8/A9 were significantly higher in patients with HS than in controls (P<0·001 for both sIL-2R and S100A8/A9). Based on the receiver operating characteristic curves, the optimum sIL-2R and S100A8/A9 cut-off values were 375 U mL(-1) and 680 ng mL(-1), respectively, with a sensitivity of 0·79 and specificity of 0·78 for sIL-2R, and 0·86 and 0·88, respectively, for S100A8/A9. No correlations with Hurley classification scores were found. However, when using PGS of disease activity to categorize patients, levels of S100A8/A9, but not sIL-2R, tended to be higher in patients with more active disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Levels of S100A8/A9 and sIL-2R, but not ACE or lysozyme, are elevated in the serum of patients with HS. However, there is no correlation between S100A8/A9 or sIL-2R levels and disease stage according to the Hurley classification system. Further research is needed to study the potential of S100A8/A9 to score disease activity in larger cohorts of patients and to predict disease flares."
23321129,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23321129/,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the results of bidirectional Glenn when performed with or without pulsatile pulmonary blood flow in a cohort of patients with a single ventricle.
METHODS: Records of 212 patients undergoing staged single ventricle palliation during a 10-year period were retrospectively reviewed. Of those, 103 (33 in pulsatile group A and 70 in nonpulsatile group B) were selected.
RESULTS: Demographics and pre- and intraoperative variables were comparable for both groups. There was no difference in oxygen saturations immediately after the bidirectional Glenn in the 2 groups. The duration and output of chest tube drainage, incidence of chylothorax, and total length of stay was higher in group A. There was no difference in the number of diuretics or oxygen requirement upon discharge between groups. Pre-Glenn measurements showed a mean McGoon ratio in group A of 1.5 (1.46-1.57) and in group B of 1.59 (1.53-1.7) (P = .11); however, there was a significant difference in the ratio between groups at pre-Fontan measurements: group A, 1.76 (1.73-1.79) and group B, 1.6 (1.53-1.66) (P < .05). At pre-Fontan measurements there was a significant difference in mean pulmonary artery pressure between group A (14 mm [12.8-15.2]) and group B (10 mm [9.7-11]) (P < .05) and a trend toward higher incidence of venovenous collaterals in group A. There was no perioperative or interstage mortality in either group.
CONCLUSIONS: Pulsatile bidirectional Glenn is associated with better pulmonary artery growth, which might improve long-term outcomes after Fontan. However, it was associated with a higher postoperative complication rate."
23321342,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23321342/,"OBJECTIVE: Previous few studies have shown that resistin is significantly elevated in breast cancer (BC) patients. Therefore, we investigated whether serum resistin could be used as a potential diagnostic and prognostic tool for postmenopausal BC (PBC), taking into account clinicopathological features, serum tumor markers, anthropometric, metabolic, and, for the first time, inflammatory parameters.
METHODS: Serum resistin, tumor markers (CA 15-3 and CEA), metabolic, anthropometric and inflammatory parameters (TNF-α, IL-6, hsCRP) were determined in 103 postmenopausal women with incident, pathologically confirmed, invasive BC, 103 controls matched on age and time of diagnosis, and 51 patients with benign breast lesions (BBL).
RESULTS: Mean serum resistin was significantly higher in cases than in controls and patients with BBL (p<0.001). In patients, resistin was significantly associated with tumor and inflammatory markers, cancer stage, tumor size, grade and lymph node invasion but not with anthropometric, metabolic parameters and hormone receptor status. Multivariable regression analysis revealed that serum IL-6 (p=0.02) and cancer stage (p=0.048) were the strongest determinants of serum resistin in cases adjusting for demographic, metabolic and clinicopathological features. Although resistin's diagnostic performance was low based on ROC curve analysis [0.72, 95% CI: 0.64-0.79], it could, however, represent a BC biomarker reflecting advanced disease stage and inflammatory state.
CONCLUSION: Further prospective and longitudinal studies are needed to evaluate whether serum resistin could be used as a prognostic tool in BC monitoring and management. More research is essential to elucidate resistin's ontological role in the association between obesity, representing a chronic low-grade subclinical inflammation, and PBC."
23321652,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23321652/,"OBJECTIVES: It is unknown how many women presenting for primary care can appropriately contract their pelvic floor muscle (PFM) or whether this ability differs between women with or without pelvic floor disorders. We sought to describe the proportion of women who initially incorrectly contract the PFM and how many can learn after basic instruction.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study enrolled 779 women presenting to community-based primary care practices. During PFM assessment, research nurses recorded whether women could correctly contract their PFM after a brief verbal cue. We defined pelvic organ prolapse (POP) as prolapse to or beyond the hymen and stress urinary incontinence (SUI) as a score of greater than equal 3 on the Incontinence Severity Index.
RESULTS: Pelvic floor muscle contraction was done correctly on first attempt in 85.5%, 83.4%, 68.6%, and 85.8% of women with POP, SUI, both POP and SUI, and neither POP nor SUI, respectively (P=0.01 for difference between POP and SUI versus neither POP nor SUI). Of 120 women who initially incorrectly contracted the PFM, 94 women (78%) learned after brief instruction. Women with POP were less likely to learn than women with neither POP nor SUI (54.3% vs 85.7%, P=0.001). Increasing vaginal delivery and decreasing caffeine intake (but not age or other demographic factors) were associated with incorrect PFM contraction; only decreased caffeine intake remained significant on multivariable analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Most women with no or mild pelvic floor disorders can correctly contract their PFM after a simple verbal cue, suggesting that population-based prevention interventions can be initiated without clinical confirmation of correct PFM technique."
23322029,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23322029/,"UNLABELLED: Given limited information available regarding associations between lung function and bone mineral density among healthy subjects, we undertook these analyses in the Hertfordshire Cohort Study. Forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)), forced vital capacity (FVC) and FEV(1)/FVC were not associated with bone mineral density at any site; associations with bone mineral content were removed by adjustment for body size.
PURPOSE: There is limited information available regarding the association between lung function and bone mineral density among healthy elderly subjects. We addressed this issue in the Hertfordshire Cohort Study.
METHODS: From the above cohort, 985 subjects (496 men and 489 women) aged 60-72 years were recruited. All subjects underwent bone density measurements using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry and lung function tests using standardised spirometry. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was defined as a FEV(1)/FVC ratio <lower limit of normal, calculated using separate equations for men and women.
RESULTS: Measures of lung function (FEV(1), FVC and FEV(1)/FVC) were not associated with bone mineral density at the lumbar spine, femoral neck and total hip in men or women; associations with bone mineral content and bone area were removed by adjustment for body size and lifestyle confounders. In this cohort, there were no associations observed between COPD and any measure of bone mass.
CONCLUSIONS: There was no association between lung function and bone mass in this community dwelling cohort after adjustment for body size and other confounders."
23322187,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23322187/,"BACKGROUND: Avascular necrosis (AVN) of the femoral head is a potential complication in patients with slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE), radiographically occurring in 3-60%. This may lead to early hip fusion or hip arthroplasty. Free vascularized fibular grafting (FVFG) may provide a reasonable means to preserve the femoral head.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked: (1) What percentage of patients with AVN after SCFE treated with FVFG underwent subsequent THA or hip fusion and what was the lifespan of the FVFG? (2) Did the graft survival rate of FVFG for AVN after SCFE coincide with historically reported rates of FVFG for idiopathic AVN? And (3) did hip function improve after FVFG?
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 52 patients who underwent FVFG for SCFE. We calculated the longevity of the graft and factors associated with graft survival. Harris hip scores (HHS) were recorded pre- and postoperatively. Minimum followup was 1 month (median, 19 months; range, 1-136 months).
RESULTS: Five of the 52 patients (10%) underwent conversion to THA (four) or hip fusion (one). Mean age was greater in these patients than in those not requiring further procedures: 16 versus 13 years. Median graft survival time before arthroplasty/fusion was 12 years (range, 2-16 years) while it is currently 8 years (range, 2-16 years) in patients not undergoing subsequent procedures. HHSs improved 35 points on average (38 points preoperatively to 73 points postoperatively).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing FVFG for AVN secondary to SCFE, 90% have maintained their native hips for 8 years with improved hip function, similar to other published reports of FVFG. Further followup is needed of patients currently retaining their FVFGs as to eventual conversion to THA or fusion.

23322390,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23322390/,"OBJECTIVES: To describe the trend and factors associated with the autopsy over the past decade at a level III neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) where all patients are presented with an option.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study of the autopsy in a cohort of infants who died in the NICU from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2010.
RESULTS: Of 446 deaths, 33.9% received the autopsy and rates decreased from the 2 years prior to the study. The autopsy was associated with gestational age at birth and chronologic age at death. On multivariable logistic regression analyses, the odds of an autopsy increased with gestational age (p = 0.001), death in the postneonatal period (odds ratio [OR] = 2.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.28, 3.16), and absence of a major congenital anomaly (OR = 1.96, 95% CI = 1.22, 3.23).
CONCLUSION: Autopsy rates continue to decline despite ensuring that all parents are presented with the option. Infants born at term and those who die after 1 month without known congenital anomalies are most likely to receive the autopsy. The persistently low rates may highlight the importance of helping families understand that the autopsy has utility even when the cause of death may appear to be obvious."
23322656,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23322656/,"RATIONALE: Clenbuterol (4-amino-α-[(tert-butylamino)methyl]-3,5-dichlorobenzyl alcohol) is approved for human and veterinary use primarily for the treatment of pulmonary afflictions. Despite the authorized administration in cases of medical indications, the misuse of clenbuterol in animal husbandry as well as elite and amateur sport has frequently been reported, arguably due to growth-promoting properties. Due to various recent incidences of doping control specimens containing clenbuterol, strategies towards the discrimination of a surreptitious application from unintended intake via animal-derived edibles or dietary supplements were required.
METHODS: The enantiomeric compositions of clenbuterol in human urine samples derived from administration studies with therapeutic amounts of the β(2)-agonist and authentic doping control specimens were determined. Due to the facts that therapeutic clenbuterol consists of a racemic mixture of (+)- and (-)-stereoisomers and that the first mentioned (dextrorotatory) stereoisomer is retained to a greater extent in edible animal tissue, the differentiation of a recent administration of therapeutic (and thus racemic) clenbuterol from food contamination (stereoisomerically depleted clenbuterol) was considered. Employing deuterated clenbuterol as internal standard, the target analytes were extracted from human urine by means of concerted liquid-liquid and solid-phase extractions and subjected to chiral liquid chromatography hyphenated to high resolution/high accuracy mass spectrometry with electrospray ionization.
RESULTS: Both enantiomers of clenbuterol were baseline separated and relative abundances of corresponding labeled and unlabeled stereoisomers were determined, demonstrating that the therapeutic use of clenbuterol results in racemic mixtures in urine for at least 24 h while adverse analytical findings presumably originating from food contaminations can yield (-)-clenbuterol-depleted pairs of analytes.
CONCLUSIONS: The determination of relative abundances of clenbuterol enantiomers can indicate the ingestion of clenbuterol via contaminated food; however, depletion of (-)-clenbuterol in edible animal tissue is time-dependent and thus results can still be inconclusive as to the inadvertent ingestion of clenbuterol when clenbuterol administration to animals was conducted until slaughter."
23322914,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23322914/,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Obliterative bronchiolitis (OB) is a rare disease with a small number of established occupational aetiologies. We describe a case series of severe OB in workers making glass-reinforced plastics.
METHODS: Workplace exposures were the likely cause after the independent diagnosis of OB in two workers laying up the fibreglass hulls of yachts; the second worker took over the job of the first after he left following a lung transplant. Presentation of these two cases at international meetings led to others identifying similar workers.
MAIN RESULTS: We identified six workers with good evidence of OB. All were involved in preparing fibreglass with styrene resins, five as boat builders laying up fibreglass hulls and one during cooling-tower fabrication. The disease came on rapidly without unusual acute exposures. Two patients had lung transplants, while another died while waiting for one. Histology confirmed OB in the four with biopsies/post-mortem examinations or explanted lungs.
CONCLUSIONS: A rare, potentially fatal disease occurring in six workers laying up fibreglass with styrene resins from five different worksites suggests that work exposures were the cause of their OB. The precise agent responsible awaits identification."
23322919,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23322919/,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether a refined assessment of exposure to bitumen fume among workers in the European asphalt industry within a nested case-control study resulted in a different interpretation pertaining to risk of lung cancer mortality compared with the cohort study.
METHODS: Pearson correlation coefficients between refined and original estimates were calculated. Logistic regression and generalised additive models (penalised splines) were fitted to estimate ORs for exposure to bitumen fume using the refined and original exposure estimates, respectively, while adjusting for potential confounding.
RESULTS: 1555 subjects included in the nested case-control study had both refined and original estimates for exposure to bitumen fume. Exposure assessment in the nested case-control study (compared with the cohort phase) increased the number of subjects never-exposed to bitumen fume from 18% to 32%. From the 1282 subjects originally considered exposed in the cohort phase, 309 (24%) became unexposed after the nested case-control exposure assessment. From the 273 subjects originally considered non-exposed in the cohort phase, 87 (32%) became exposed in the nested case-control study. The majority (75%) of subjects however did not change exposure status and changes were similar among cases and controls. Correlation coefficients between refined and original exposure estimates were moderate overall (range 0.42-0.46), but varied considerably among countries. The ORs and exposure-response curves for exposure to bitumen fume were not meaningfully different between analyses that used refined and original exposure estimates. Adjustment for tobacco smoking and exposure to coal tar did not change these patterns.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that more detailed data collection and exposure assessment in the nested case-control study compared with the cohort study did change exposure status of many subjects, but did not alter results of the exposure-response analysis. Adjustment for tobacco smoking did not have a noticeable effect on risk estimates either."
23323651,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23323651/,"CONTEXT: There is increasing interest in establishing the medical humanities as core integrated provision in undergraduate medicine curricula, but sceptics point to the lack of evidence for their impact upon patient care. Further, the medical humanities culture has often failed to provide a convincing theoretical rationale for the inclusion of the arts and humanities in medical education.
DISCUSSION: Poor communication with colleagues and patients is the main factor in creating the conditions for medical error; this is grounded in a historically determined refusal of democracy within medical work. The medical humanities may play a critical role in educating for democracy in medical culture generally, and in improving communication in medical students specifically, as both demand high levels of empathy. Studies in the science of communication can provide a valuable evidence base justifying the inclusion of the medical humanities in the core curriculum. A case is made for the potential of the medical humanities--as a form of 'adult play'--to educate for collaboration and tolerance of ambiguity or uncertainty, providing a key element of the longer-term democratising force necessary to change medical culture and promote safer practice.
CONCLUSION: The arts and humanities can provide important contextual media through which the lessons learned from the science of communication in medicine can be translated and promoted as forms of medical education."
23324126,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23324126/,"OBJECTIVES: Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute self-limited panvasculitis, primarily affecting young children, with an outstanding risk of cardiovascular complications. Fibroblast Growth Factor-23 (FGF23) is the latest member of the FGF family, acting on phosphate metabolism, which has been shown to display a potential role in the vascular remodelling. The aim of our study was to test the hypothesis that circulating serum levels of FGF23 might be related to the occurrence of coronary artery abnormalities (CAA) in children with KD.
METHODS: Serum of 109 consecutive KD patients (median age 30.5 months) were collected for the evaluation of intact FGF23 by ELISA test. Sixty sex/age-matched healthy children were studied as controls, after having excluded rheumatic, endocrinological and chronic renal diseases. In all these subjects a familiar predisposition to atherosclerosis was excluded.
RESULTS: FGF23 levels resulted significantly higher in patients with KD than in controls (72±40 pg/ml vs. 12.3±3.2 pg/ml; p=0.01). Twenty-eight/109 KD patients having developed CAA (aneurysms or dilatations) presented significantly higher FGF23 levels than those without any coronary artery damage (120±40 pg/ml vs. 38.2±5 pg/ml; p<0.0001). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that only serum FGF23 levels, among different general clinical and biochemical variables, were suggestive of coronary artery damage (OR=4.86).
CONCLUSIONS: Based on this preliminary investigation, high serum FGF23 levels would seem suggestive of the potential occurrence of cardiac vascular complications in children with KD."
23324253,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23324253/,"BACKGROUND: Midwives and obstetricians are the key providers of care during pregnancy and postpartum. Information about the consultations with a general practitioner (GP) during this period is generally lacking.The aim of this study is to compare consultation rates, diagnoses and GP management of pregnant women with those of non-pregnant women.
METHODS: Data were retrieved from the Netherlands Information Network of General Practice (LINH), a nationally representative register. This register holds longitudinal data on consultations, prescriptions and the referrals of all patients listed at 84 practices in the Netherlands in 2007-2009, including 15,123 pregnant women and 102,564 non-pregnant women in the same age-range (15 to 45 years). We compared consultation rates (including all contacts with the practice), diagnoses (ICPC-1 coded), medication prescriptions (coded according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system), and rate and type of referrals from the start of the pregnancy until six weeks postpartum (336 days).
RESULTS: Pregnant women contacted their GP on average 3.6 times, compared to 2.2 times for non-pregnant women. The most frequently recorded diagnoses for pregnant women were 'pregnancy' and 'cystitis/urinary infection', and 'cystitis/urinary infection' and 'general disease not otherwise specified' for non-pregnant women. The mean number of prescribed medications was lower in pregnant women (2.1 against 4.4). For pregnant women, the most frequent referral indication concerned obstetric care, for non-pregnant women this concerned physiotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS: GP consultation rates in pregnancy and postpartum shows that GPs are important providers of care for pregnant women. Therefore, the involvement of GPs in collaborative care during pregnancy and postpartum should be reinforced."
23324439,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23324439/,"BACKGROUND: The glycoprotein MFG-E8 mediates phagocytic clearance of apoptotic cells and influences the pathogenesis and progression of inflammatory diseases. MFG-E8 was shown to attenuate the progression of inflammation and to improve survival in septic rats. Accumulating evidence suggests an immunomodulatory link between MFG-E8 and the pro-inflammatory chemokine fractalkine, which may determine the severity of pain, fibrosis, and inflammation in chronic pancreatitis (CP).
METHODS: The expression and localization of MFG-E8 was investigated in CP (n=62), and normal pancreas (NP; n=34) by QRT-PCR, Western-blot and immunohistochemistry analyses. Results were correlated with mRNA expression of fractalkine, CX3CR1, and with the presence and degree of pain and fibrosis. Human pancreatic stellate cells (hPSCs) were isolated from CP tissues and evaluated for MFG-E8 mRNA expression after fractalkine stimulation.
RESULTS: MFG-E8-mRNA was significantly overexpressed in CP and isolated hPSCs when compared to NP. Western-blot and immunohistochemistry analysis confirmed accumulation of MFG-E8 in CP, with noticeably increased MFG-E8 immunoreactivity in tubular complexes. MFG-E8 expression correlated significantly with fractalkine expression, severe fibrosis, and the presence of pain in CP patients. Stimulation of hPSCs with fractalkine led to a significant increase in MFG-E8 expression.
CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, we demonstrated for the first time that MFG-E8 is significantly up-regulated in CP patients and together with fractalkine correlated noticeably with severe fibrosis and the presence of pain. hPSCs overexpress MFG-E8 upon fractalkine stimulation in vitro, which underlines the suggested immunmodulatory link in CP and may be a key mechanism in CP fibrogenesis and pain generation. Taken together, these novel findings suggest that MFG-E8 blockade may be a promising tool for future immunotherapy in CP to attenuate both fibrosis and pain sensation."
23324474,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23324474/,"BACKGROUND: Low back pain (LBP) is common among office workers. A number of studies have established a relationship between Christianity and physical and mental health outcomes among chronic pain patients. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between the religious beliefs and practices of Buddhism and disability and psychological stress in office workers with chronic LBP.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted with a self-administered questionnaire delivered by hand to 463 office workers with chronic LBP. Saliva samples were collected from a randomly selected sub-sample of respondents (n=96). Disability due to LBP was assessed using the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire and psychological stress was assessed based on salivary cortisol. Two hierarchical regression models were built to determine how much variance in disability and psychological stress could be explained by religious beliefs and practices of Buddhism variables after controlling for potential confounder variables.
RESULTS: Only 6% of variance in psychological stress was accounted for by the religious beliefs and practices of Buddhism. Those with high religiousness experienced lower psychological stress. No association between the religious beliefs and practices of Buddhism and disability level was found. Depressive symptoms were attributed to both psychological stress and disability status in our study population.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that, although being religious may improve the psychological condition in workers with chronic LBP, its effect is insufficient to reduce disability due to illness. Further research should examine the role of depression as a mediator of the effect of psychological stress on disability in patients with chronic LBP."
23324856,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23324856/,"OBJECTIVE AND BACKGROUND: Self-expanding metallic stent (SEMS) insertion has been suggested as a promising alternative to emergency surgery for left-sided malignant colonic obstruction (LMCO). However, the literature on the long-term impact of SEMS as ""a bridge to surgery"" is limited and contradictory.
METHODS: From January 1998 to June 2011, we retrospectively identified patients operated on for LMCO with curative intent. The primary outcome criterion was overall survival. Short-term secondary endpoints included the technical success rate and overall success rate and long-term secondary endpoints included 5-year overall survival, 5-year cancer-specific mortality, 5-year disease-free survival, the recurrence rate, and mean time to recurrence. Patients treated with SEMS were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. Overall survival was analyzed after using a propensity score to correct for selection bias.
RESULTS: There were 48 patients in the SEMS group and 39 in the surgery-only group. In the overall population, overall survival (P = 0.001) and 5-year overall survival (P = 0.0003) were significantly lower in the SEMS group than in the surgery-only group, and 5-year cancer-specific mortality was significantly higher in the SEMS group (48% vs 21%, respectively (P = 0.02)). Five-year disease-free survival, the recurrence rate, and the mean time to recurrence were better in the surgery-only group (not significant). For patients with no metastases or perforations at hospital admission, overall survival (P = 0.003) and 5-year overall survival (30% vs 67%, respectively, P = 0.001) were significantly lower in the SEMS group than in the surgery-only group.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study results suggest worse overall survival of patients with LMCO with SEMS insertion compared with immediate surgery."

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine if an upright positional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocol could produce reliable spinal curvature images and measurements compared with traditional radiograph.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Concerns about the oncological potential from cumulative doses of ionizing radiation in children and adolescents being monitored for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) initiated a search for radiation-free diagnostic imaging modalities, including MRI. We submit that upright, positional MRI (uMRI) produces reliable spinal curvature images compared with traditional radiograph.
METHODS: Twenty-five consecutive patients (16 female; 9 male; average age, 14.6 yr; range, 12-18 yr) with a diagnosis of AIS were enrolled. Average major curve magnitude was 30° (range, 6°-70°). Subjects received anterior-posterior and lateral plain radiographical scoliosis imaging followed within 1 week by uMRI. MRI data acquisition was performed in less than 7 minutes. Two independent observers performed all Cobb angle, T5-T12 kyphosis, and vertebral rotation measurements for comparison. The Pearson correlation method was performed to compare radiograph to uMRI measurements, while inter-rater and intrarater correlations were performed to assess reliability.
RESULTS: We found outstanding correlation between all plain film radiography and uMRI measurements (P = 0.01); major Cobb angles (R = 0.901), minor Cobb angles (R = 0.838), and kyphosis (R = 0.943). Inter-rater reliability for both radiographical and MRI measurements of major Cobb angles (R = 0.959, 0.896, respectively), minor Cobb angles (R = 0.951, 0.857, respectively), and vertebral rotation (R = 0.945) were outstanding. Intrarater reliability for both radiographical and MRI measurements of major Cobb angles (R = 0.966, 0.966, respectively) and minor Cobb angles (R = 0.945, 0.943, respectively) were also outstanding.
CONCLUSION: Our results show that uMRI is capable of producing coronal and sagittal plane measurements that highly correlate with traditional plain film radiographical measurements. This, in addition to reliable vertebral rotation measurements, makes uMRI a valuable, radiation-free alternative/substitute for diagnostic evaluation in AIS."

OBJECTIVE: To compare the pattern of distribution of radicular pain with published dermatome charts.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Dermatomal charts vary and previous studies have demonstrated significant individual subject variation.
METHODS: Patients with radiologically and surgically proven nerve root compression (NRC) caused by prolapsed intervertebral disc completed computerized diagrams of the distribution of pain and pins and needles. Ninety-eight patients had L5 compressions and 83 had S1 compressions.
RESULTS: The distribution of pain and pins and needles did not correspond well with dermatomal patterns. Of those patients with L5 NRC, only 22 (22.4%) recorded any hits on the L5 dermatome on the front, and only 60 (61.2%) on the back with only 13 (13.3%) on both. Only 1 (1.0%) patient placed more than 50% of their hits within the L5 dermatome. Of those patients with S1 NRC, only 3 (3.6%) recorded any hits on the S1 dermatome on the front, and only 64 (77.1%) on the back with only 15 (18.1%) on both. No patients placed more than 50% of their hits within the S1 dermatome. Regarding pins and needles, 27 (29.7%) patients with L5 NRC recorded hits on the front alone, 27 (29.7%) on the back alone, and 14 (15.4%) on both. Nineteen (20.9%) recorded more than 50% of hits within the L5 dermatome. Three (3.6%) patients with S1 NRC recorded hits on the front alone, 44 (53.0%) on the back alone, and 18 (21.7%) on both. Twelve (14.5%) recorded more than 50% of hits within the S1 dermatome.
CONCLUSION: Patient report is an unreliable method of identifying the anatomical source of pain or paresthesia caused by nerve root compression.

23324952,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23324952/,"OBJECTIVES: To assess whether the use of iodinated contrast medium increases the incidence of acute kidney injury in ICU patients, compared with patients not receiving iodinated contrast medium.
DESIGN: Prospective observational matched cohort study.
SETTING: Two ICUs in two tertiary teaching hospitals.
PATIENTS: A total of 380 adults were included (20% more than once), before an iodinated contrast medium infusion (contrast inclusions, n=307) or before an intrahospital transfer without iodinated contrast medium infusion (control inclusions, n=170).
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Among contrast inclusions, iodinated contrast medium-associated acute kidney injury occurred after 23 administrations (7.5%) according to the Acute Kidney Injury Network definition (stage≥1, over 48 hr). As expected, a broader definition (≥25% increase in serum creatinine over 72 hr) yielded a greater incidence (16%). In 146 pairs of contrast and control inclusions, matched on propensity for iodinated contrast medium infusion, the incidence of acute kidney injury was similar (absolute difference in incidence, 0%; 95% confidence interval, -5.2; 5.2%), Acute Kidney Injury Network definition). Hospital mortality was also similar in 71 contrast and 71 control patients included only once and matched the same way. Contrary to iodinated contrast medium infusion (odds ratio, 1.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.69-3.53), the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score at inclusion (odds ratio, 1.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-1.31) and the number of other nephrotoxic agents (odds ratio, 1.38; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.85) were independent risk factors for acute kidney injury.
CONCLUSIONS: The specific toxic effect of monomeric nonionic low-osmolar iodinated contrast medium in ICU patients with multiple renal aggressions seemed minimal. Severity of disease and the global nephrotoxic burden were risk factors for acute kidney injury, regardless of iodinated contrast medium infusion."
23325063,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23325063/,"OBJECTIVES: Concomitant ablation is an established therapy in cardiac surgical patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Post-discharge care seems to be an essential factor for clinical outcome. We analysed the influence of event recorder (ER) implantation and therapy guidance by the results of continuous rhythm monitoring of consecutive postoperative follow-up by our department of electrophysiology.
METHODS: Between July 2003 and August 2010, 401 cardiac surgical patients underwent concomitant surgical AF ablation therapy. Since August 2009, an ER (REVEAL XT, Medtronic, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) was implanted in 98 patients intraoperatively. ER interrogation was performed by our department of electrophysiology 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively. Results and outcomes were compared with a matched cohort of patients with ablation and no ER implantation. In those patients, rhythm follow-up was obtained by 24-h Holter ECG. Primary end-point of the study was sinus rhythm rate after 12 months.
RESULTS: Mean patient's age was 67.0 ± 9.7 years, and 68.4% were male. No major ablation-related complications occurred. The overall sinus rhythm rate was 65.3% after 1-year follow-up. The sinus rhythm rate off antiarrhythmic drugs was 60.3%. The conversion rate tended to be higher in patients with an implanted ER (69.3 vs 60.1%, respectively; P = 0.098). Also, the sinus rhythm rate of anti-arrhythmic drugs was higher in the ER group (64.3 vs 56.2). Patients with ER were seen more often by a cardiologist in the first postoperative year (3.1 ± 0.8 vs 1.5 ± 0.9; P < 0.05) and received significantly more additional procedures, like electrical cardioversion or additional catheter-based ablation (16.1 vs 4.3%; P < 0.001; 11.2 vs 3.1%; P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Implantation of an ER with link-up to a cardiology and/or electrophysiology provides optimized anti-arrhythmic drug management and higher rates of consecutive procedures like cardioversion or additional catheter-based ablation. As a result, a trend to higher sinus rhythm conversion rate was observed after 1-year follow-up."
23325286,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23325286/,"AIMS: We aimed to determine whether mean platelet volume (MPV) is one of the variables that determine the severity of liver fibrosis and inflammation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection were divided into two groups: patients with fibrosis scores of 0-3 and 4-6 and patients with histologic activity index scores of 0-9 and 10-18 (according to the Ishak Scoring System). The independent variables determining the severity of liver fibrosis and inflammation were investigated.
RESULTS: Two hundred and thirty-eight patients were included in this retrospective study. The fibrosis scores of 29 patients (12.2%) were higher than 3. The independent variables that determined the severity of the fibrosis score were a high level of serum γ-glutamyl transferase and a low blood platelet count (odds ratio and P values were 1.016 and 0.004 for γ-glutamyl transferase, and 0.986 and 0.002 for blood platelet count). The histologic activity indexes of 38 patients (16%) were higher than 9. The independent variables determining the severity of liver inflammation were serum HBV DNA, γ-glutamyl transferase, and globulin levels and the MPV [odds ratio and P values were, respectively, 0.1001 and 0.046 for HBV DNA (×10); 1.016 and 0.004 for γ-glutamyl transferase; 2.247 and 0.039 for globulin; and 1.488 and 0.004 for the MPV]. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the model predicting the severity of liver inflammation were 60.5, 83, 40.3, and 91.7%, respectively (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve=0.775, P=0.0001).
CONCLUSION: MPV may provide useful information to predict the degree of liver inflammation along with other markers."
23325287,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23325287/,"BACKGROUND: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is common and many affected individuals have normal-range alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. There is a need for a robust screening tool to triage individuals with advanced fibrosis for specialist care.
AIM: The aim of this study was to assess the performance of noninvasive fibrosis tests in patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD and normal levels of ALT.
METHODS: Patients presenting at a fatty liver clinic between 1999 and 2009 were included in the study. Liver biopsies were assessed using the Kleiner score. The aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/ALT ratio, BARD, FIB-4 and NAFLD fibrosis scores were calculated.
RESULTS: A total of 305 patients were included [70 with normal ALT levels (women: ALT≤30 IU/l, men: ALT≤45 IU/l) and 235 with elevated levels]. In total, 24% of patients with normal ALT levels and 17% of those with elevated ALT levels had advanced fibrosis (Kleiner stage 3-4). The FIB-4 performed best in identifying advanced fibrosis in patients with normal ALT (area under receiver operating characteristic curve=0.86, 82% sensitivity, 77% specificity and 92% negative predictive value). The sensitivity of the AST/ALT ratio and BARD and NAFLD fibrosis scores for advanced fibrosis was good in patients with normal ALT levels (94, 94 and 82%, respectively), but the specificity was low (44, 26 and 51%, respectively). The FIB-4 yielded best results in patients with elevated ALT levels. Using the FIB-4, 61% of patients with normal ALT levels and 63% of those with elevated ALT levels could avoid liver biopsy to exclude advanced fibrosis. In contrast, AST/ALT ratio and BARD and NAFLD scores would have led to a high proportion of patients with mild disease having to undergo a biopsy.
CONCLUSION: The FIB-4 yielded good results in patients with normal or elevated ALT levels, reliably excluding advanced fibrosis and reducing the need for liver biopsy."
23325439,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23325439/,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: We reviewed our institution's experience with Peutz-Jegher syndrome (PJS) in children to determine whether current recommendations on timing of screening and follow-up should be modified.
METHODS: We reviewed the charts of all of the children with a diagnosis of PJS at our institution from 2000 to 2011 abstracting data on intussusceptions events, polyp characteristics, Sertoli cell (SC) tumors, family history, imaging, and interventions.
RESULTS: Of 14 children identified, 10 were boys. Median age at first clinical evaluation was 4.5 years, and family history and/or mucocutaneous pigmentation were the 2 most common factors stimulating screening. Median age at first screening test was 5 years (range 1-16), and at first polyp identification, 5 years (range 1 to 18). There were 7 intussusception events in 5 children, with median age of 10 and range 5 to 16 for first event. Two boys had SC tumors at 8 and 11 years. Polyps were identified during initial screening in 9 of 14 patients. Polyps were found in the stomach or duodenum in 5 (36%), small bowel in 7, (50%) and colon in 3 (21%) children. Large polyps were identified in 9 children at median age of 7 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Polyps causing significant clinical consequences can occur frequently in children with PJS younger than 8 years. Revised guidelines should consider initial screening at age 4 to 5 with capsule endoscopy and upper and lower endoscopy as well as evaluation for SC tumors and re-evaluation whenever symptoms suggest polyp-associated complications."
23325440,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23325440/,"OBJECTIVES: Discordance exists between outcomes of endoscopy, multichannel intraluminal impedance monitoring (pH-MII), MII baselines, and gastroesophageal reflux symptoms. The aim of the present study was to determine the association between endoscopy, pH-MII and MII baselines, in children with gastroesophageal reflux symptoms.
METHODS: Endoscopies were graded for reflux esophagitis (RE). Biopsies of the distal esophagus were assessed for signs suggestive of esophagitis. Reflux index (RI), symptom association probability (SAP), number of reflux episodes, and mean baseline values were calculated. pH-MII was considered positive in children when RI was ≥ 3% and/or SAP was ≥ 95% and for infants when RI was ≥ 10% and/or SAP was ≥ 95%. Baselines were manually calculated and compared with an automated analysis. For MII baselines, patients were divided in 3 groups: normal endoscopy and negative overall pH-MII; normal endoscopy and an overall positive pH-MII; and RE.
RESULTS: A total of 26 children and 14 infants were included, median age: 26.5 months (2 months-16.2 years). Thirteen (32.5%) had RE. A significant negative association was found for RI and MII baselines (P = 0.009) and between SAP and RE (P = 0.039, odds ratio 1.018). MII baseline values were predictive for neither conventional pH-MII parameters nor RE. Manual analysis and automated calculation of MII baselines showed a perfect correlation. Distal MII baselines were significantly lower in children with a positive overall pH-MII outcome compared with the proximal esophagus (P = 0.049). No significant changes were found in baselines among the different groups 1 to 3.
CONCLUSIONS: Acid-related parameters are significantly related to MII baselines. A perfect correlation between manual- and automated analysis of MII baselines was found. Large prospective studies are needed to confirm the exact role of endoscopy and MII baselines."
23325745,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23325745/,"BACKGROUND: Both immunoassays and chromatographic methods are available for therapeutic drug monitoring of mycophenolic acid (MPA), an immunosuppressant. We studied the suitability of cloned enzyme donor immunoassay (CEDIA) assay for routine monitoring of MPA by comparing values obtained by the CEDIA assay with corresponding values obtained by using a high-performance liquid chromatography combined with ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV) method.
METHODS: We compared MPA concentrations obtained by a reference HPLC-UV method and CEDIA assay on Hitachi 917 analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) using 60 patient specimens (18 liver transplant recipient and 42 kidney transplant recipients).
RESULTS: When MPA concentrations in all 60 transplant recipients obtained by the HPLC-UV (x-axis) method were compared with corresponding values obtained by the CEDIA method (y-axis), the following regression equation was obtained: y = 1.1558x + 0.2876 (r = 0.97). Interestingly, much lower bias was observed in 42 renal transplant recipients as revealed by the following regression equation; y = 1.1181x + 0.2745 (r = 0.98). However, more significant positive bias was observed in 18 liver transplant recipients as following regression equation as observed: y = 1.3337x + 0.1493 (r = 0.94).
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that MPA concentrations determined by the CEDIA assay showed significant positive bias compared to HPLC-UV method. Therefore, caution must be exercised in interpreting therapeutic drug monitoring result of MPA if CEDIA assay is used."

OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of difficult encounters on patient health outcomes and the role of physician dissatisfaction and burnout as mediators of this effect.
DESIGN: A total of 422 physicians were sorted into 3 clusters based on perceived frequency of difficult patient encounters in their practices. Patient charts were audited to assess the quality of hypertension and diabetes management and preventive care based on national guidelines. Summary measures of quality and errors were compared among the 3 physician clusters.
RESULTS: Of the 1384 patients, 359 were cared for by high-cluster physicians (those who had a high frequency of difficult encounters), 871 by medium-cluster physicians, and 154 by low-cluster physicians. Dissatisfaction and burnout were higher among physicians reporting higher frequencies of difficult encounters. However, quality of patient care and management errors were similar across all 3 groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Physician perception of frequent difficult encounters was not associated with worse patient care quality or more medical errors. Future studies should investigate whether other patient outcomes, including acute care and patient satisfaction, are affected by difficult encounters."
23327051,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23327051/,"INTRODUCTION: The human papillomavirus (HPV) prevalence recognized a geographic distribution of genotypes but, in the last years, the change of sexual behaviours, the increase number of sex partners, and the reduction of geographic distances have changed its prevalence and distribution.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of HPV types among females in the Molise region and its evolution in 24 months.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors, from February to August 2008, used a representative sample of a female population (n = 299) aged 17 to 64 years who were interviewed and submitted cervico-vaginal swab specimens. Swabs were analyzed for cytologic screening and HPV detection and typing. The patients with a positive cytology were submitted to colposcopy and eventually biopsy. Cytological and colposcopic follow up was performed in 24 months.
RESULTS: The overall HPV prevalence was 30.1% and the prevalence of high- and low-risk HPV types was 22.41% and 18.06%, respectively. The prevalence of HPV vaccine types was relatively low for HPV-6-11-18. Only HPV-16 is well-represented in Molise, but recognizes a strictly geographic distribution.
CONCLUSION: This study is one of the largest assessments of HPV genotypes to date in Italy. It is clear that several HPV-types are involved in cervical lesions, therefore the vaccine is profitable but limited by great number of types implicated in the pathogenesis of cancer and by their dishomogeneous distribution. Currently, a good campaign of screening is still necessary. In the future, second generation polyvalent HPV vaccines my be proposed for a wider and complete vaccine coverage."
23327068,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23327068/,"PURPOSE OF INVESTIGATION: The study aimed to determine whether malignant transformation of mature cystic teratoma (MCT) can be preoperatively predicted by presenting two cases of MCT with malignant transformation and comparing their clinical factors with those of benign MCT encountered at around the same time.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Age, maximum tumor diameter, tumor marker levels (serum squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9, the presence of solid tumor masses, and the presence or absence of contrast enhancement in pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were investigated in two cases of MCT with malignant transformation and 76 cases of benign MCT in which surgery was performed and a pathological diagnosis given by the department from 2004 to 2010.
RESULTS: The mean ages of the two cases with malignant transformation and the cases of benign MCT were 42.5 years and 34.2 years, respectively. The mean maximum diameter of the two tumors with malignant transformation and the cases of benign MCT were 130 mm and 73.6 mm, respectively. The mean serum levels of SCC in the two cases with malignant transformation and the cases of benign MCT were 31.5 ng/ml and 0.92 ng/ml, respectively. Contrast enhancement and the presence of solid masses in images of MCT with malignant transformation were apparent.
CONCLUSION: In order to accurately detect malignant transformation of MCT, the authors found it to be important to determine whether tumors larger than 100 mm in diameter were present and to check for the presence of solid masses enhanced in pelvic MRI examination, as well as to measure at least serum SCC and CA19-9 even in relatively young patients."
23327567,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23327567/,"BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies typically employ either a single expert or multiple readers in collaboration to evaluate (read) the image results. However, no study has examined whether evaluations from multiple readers provide more reliable results than a single reader. We examined whether consistency in image interpretation by a single expert might be equal to the consistency of combined readings, defined as independent interpretations by two readers, where cases of disagreement were reconciled by consensus.
METHODS: One expert neuroradiologist and one trained radiology resident independently evaluated 102 MRIs of the upper neck. The signal intensities of the alar and transverse ligaments were scored 0, 1, 2, or 3. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. They repeated the grading process after 3-8 months (second evaluation). We used kappa statistics and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) to assess agreement between the initial and second evaluations for each radiologist and for combined determinations. Disagreements on score prevalence were evaluated with McNemar's test.
RESULTS: Higher consistency between the initial and second evaluations was obtained with the combined readings than with individual readings for signal intensity scores of ligaments on both the right and left sides of the spine. The weighted kappa ranges were 0.65-0.71 vs. 0.48-0.62 for combined vs. individual scoring, respectively. The combined scores also showed better agreement between evaluations than individual scores for the presence of grade 2-3 signal intensities on any side in a given subject (unweighted kappa 0.69-0.74 vs. 0.52-0.63, respectively). Disagreement between the initial and second evaluations on the prevalence of grades 2-3 was less marked for combined scores than for individual scores (P ≥ 0.039 vs. P ≤ 0.004, respectively). ICCs indicated a more reliable sum score per patient for combined scores (0.74) and both readers' average scores (0.78) than for individual scores (0.55-0.69).
CONCLUSIONS: This study was the first to provide empirical support for the principle that an additional reader can improve the reproducibility of MRI interpretations compared to one expert alone. Furthermore, even a moderately experienced second reader improved the reliability compared to a single expert reader. The implications of this for clinical work require further study."
23327719,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23327719/,"BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a hormonal disorder of females of reproductive age that impacts their oral and systemic health. The aim of this study is to evaluate interleukin-17A (IL-17A), IL-17F, IL-17A/F, and IL-17E (IL-25) levels in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF), saliva, and serum of non-obese females with PCOS and with either a clinically healthy periodontium or gingivitis.
METHODS: Thirty-one females with PCOS, 30 females with PCOS and gingivitis, and 12 systemically and periodontally healthy females participated in the study. Clinical periodontal measurements, body mass index, and Ferriman-Gallwey score (FGS) (a measure of hirsutism in females) were recorded. Circulating levels of sex hormones, cortisol, and insulin were also determined. Levels of IL-17 cytokines were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: The general linear model multivariate analysis, adjusting for age or plaque index, showed that the two groups with PCOS had higher concentrations of IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-17A/F in serum and higher levels of IL-17A and IL-17F in GCF and saliva but lower serum IL-17E than systemically healthy females. Levels of IL-17E were lowest in females with PCOS and gingivitis who also had the highest FGS. Serum IL-17A and IL-17F levels correlated positively with FGS and periodontal probing depth (all ρ >0.33; P <0.005). Serum IL-17E showed the reverse relationship and also correlated negatively with IL-17A (ρ >-0.28; P <0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: IL-17 levels are altered in non-obese females with PCOS and may influence gingival inflammation. Additional studies are warranted to clarify the relationship between PCOS and gingivitis."
23327723,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23327723/,"INTRODUCTION: Radiographic damage is one of the core outcomes in axial SpA and is usually assessed with the modified Stoke Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) Spine Score (mSASSS). Alternatively, the Radiographic AS Spinal Score (RASSS) is proposed, which includes the lower thoracic vertebrae, under the hypothesis that most progression occurs in these segments. We aimed to compare the mSASSS and RASSS with regard to performance.
METHODS: Two-yearly spinal radiographs from patients followed in the Outcome in AS International Study (OASIS) were used (scored independently by two readers). A total of 195 patients had at least one radiograph (12-year follow-up) to be included. We assessed the accessibility of vertebral corners (VCs) for scoring, as well as status and 2-year progression scores of both scoring methods. To assess the potential additional value of including the thoracic segment in the score, the relative contribution (in %) to the 2-year total RASSS progression of each spinal segment (cervical, thoracic and lumbar) was determined, and compared to the expected contribution, under the assumption that a balanced segmental progression would occur, proportional to the number of sites per segment.
RESULTS: The mSASSS could be scored in a total of 809 radiographs and the RASSS in 78% of these. In 58% of the latter, the score was based on one to two available thoracic VCs scores, and the remaining two to three were imputed because they were missing. There were 520 two-year mSASSS intervals available, and in 63% of them RASSS progression could be assessed. The mean (SD) 2-year interval progression score (330 intervals) was 2.0 (3.6) for the mSASSS and 2.4 (4.4) for the RASSS, yielding a similar effect size (mSASSS 0.57 and RASSS 0.55). Exclusive progression of the thoracic segment occurred in only 5% of the cases. There was no significant difference between the observed (14%) and expected (16%) contribution to progression of the thoracic segment (P=0.70).
CONCLUSIONS: The determination of RASSS for radiographic damage of the spine is frequently impossible or strongly influenced by non-contributory imputation. In comparison to the mSASSS, the contribution of thoracic VCs in the RASSS method is negligible, and does not justify the additional scoring efforts."
23328390,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23328390/,"OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to assess FDG-PET/CT as a surrogate biomarker of the pathological complete response in locally advanced rectal cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation.
METHODS: T3-4 and/or N+ rectal cancer patients were treated prospectively with capecitabine-based chemoradiation and total mesorectal excision 7-8 weeks later. FDG-PET/CT uptake was obtained at baseline, after 2 weeks, and 6 weeks following treatment completion, calculating the maximum standardized uptake value (SUV) and percentage difference to identify the early and late metabolic 'response index'.
RESULTS: Thirty-one patients were treated from January 2009 to January 2012 at the Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori of Milan. One patient was excluded due to surgery refusal. The pathological complete response rate was 30%. Early FDG-PET/CT was performed in 24 consenting patients and failed to show predictive utility. On the contrary, significant differences in late SUV value and response index were observed between complete and noncomplete pathological responders (p = 0.0006 and 0.03). In multivariate analysis including most relevant SUV parameters, none of them was independently associated with a pathological complete response. With receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, a late SUV threshold <5.4 had 81% sensitivity and 100% specificity, with 90% overall accuracy.
CONCLUSIONS: We evidenced a possible predictive role of late FDG-PET/CT for the assessment of pathological response in locally advanced rectal cancer following neoadjuvant chemoradiation."
23328868,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23328868/,"PURPOSE: Because little is known about morbidity and symptoms among sexual minority women with breast cancer, that is, lesbian or bisexual-identified women, and women with a preference for a woman partner, we examined differences by sexual orientation in long-term survivors' symptoms and morbidity, considering arm morbidity, systemic therapy side effects, hypertension, and number of comorbidities.
METHODS: From a state cancer registry, we recruited 257 heterosexual and 69 sexual minority women (SMW) with a diagnosis of primary, nonmetastatic breast cancer. To increase the number of SMW, we used convenience recruitment methods and obtained an additional 112 SMW who fit the same eligibility criteria as the registry-derived sample. Using a telephone survey, we collected demographic and self-reported data on arm morbidity and systematic therapy side effects, using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life scale, QLQ-BR23 and a comorbidity measure developed for breast cancer survivors.
RESULTS: Sexual orientation was more strongly associated with arm morbidity and systemic side effects than with high blood pressure and comorbidities. Sexual orientation related indirectly to systemic side effects and arm morbidity through cancer treatments and some demographic factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Our finding that SMW respond more negatively to certain cancer treatments compared to heterosexual women suggests an opportunity to intervene with education and support for SMW breast cancer survivors for whom these life-saving treatments are necessary.
IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Because breast cancer survivors are at risk for multiple severe and persistent symptoms, assessing such symptoms is an important aspect of survivorship care. Cultural differences in perception of symptoms, communication issues, cultural barriers to reporting of symptoms, and different cultural norms about expressing pain or impairments have been established by studies. Knowledge about differences in impairment and symptoms by sexual orientation will help providers' efforts to provide high quality care to breast cancer survivors and may enhance cancer survivorship."
23329427,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23329427/,"BACKGROUND: The generic health-related quality-of-life (HR-QOL) utility measures the EQ-5D and SF-6D are both commonly used to inform healthcare policy developments. However, their application to pharmacy practice is limited and the optimal method to inform policy developments is unknown.
OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to test the sensitivity of the EQ-5D and SF-6D within pharmacy when measuring whether changes in health status or other co-variates at baseline affect the effectiveness of the intervention at follow-up. A further objective was to consider the implications of the findings for pharmacy research and policy.
METHODS: The EQ-5D and SF-6D utility measures were employed within a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of community pharmacy-led medicines management for patients with coronary heart disease. The intervention covered a baseline visit with the potential for follow-up. Simultaneous quantile regression assessed the impact of the intervention on both EQ-5D and SF-6D measures at follow-up, controlling for baseline health, appropriateness of treatment, personal characteristics and self-reported satisfaction.
RESULTS: No statistically significant difference in HR-QOL across the intervention and control groups at follow-up was reported for either measure. Increased health gain was however associated with the baseline utility score (with the EQ-5D more sensitive for those in worse health) and the appropriateness of treatment, but not patient characteristics or self-reported satisfaction.
CONCLUSION: Neither generic measure detected a gain in HR-QOL as a result of the introduction of an innovative pharmacy-based service. This finding supports other work in the area of pharmacy, where health gains have not changed following interventions. Disease-specific utility measures should be investigated as an alternative to generic approaches such as the EQ-5D and SF-6D. Given that the RCT found an increase in self-reported satisfaction, broader measures of benefit that value patient experiences, such as contingent valuation and discrete-choice experiments, should also be considered in pharmacy."
23329532,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23329532/,"AIM: Our aim is to investigate how the chronic intraprostatic inflammation affect the course of the BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between the dates of 2007-2011, the files of the patients who had TUR-P (transurethral resection of the prostate) and underwent open surgery were retrospectively reviewed because of BPH, and the patients were divided into two groups who were operated due to AUR (acute urinary retention) or LUTS (lower urinary tract symptoms) and the clinical data and pathology results of the two groups were compared in terms of chronic intraprostatic inflammation.
RESULTS: There were evaluable data of 130 of 150 patients. The age range of the patients was 50-88. 52 of the 130 patients due to AUR and 78 of them due to LUTS underwent surgery. While there was chronic inflammation in 59 of the 130 patients, there was not in 71. The volume of the prostate and the average age of those who had chronic prostatitis with the combination of AUR were greater compared to the LUTS.
CONCLUSIONS: It seems that chronic prostatitis is a factor which is often accompanied by BPH and affects the progression and pathology of the disease. The risk of acute urinary retention is more frequent in patients with chronic inflammation than in those who lack. In the future, related clinical trials with the relationship between the intraprostatic inflammation and BPH treatment are necessary and should include more cases and longer period of follow-up for these studies."
23329535,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23329535/,"BACKGROUND: Mean platelet volume [MPV] is an important predictor for many diseases and larger platelets are more reactive and associated with shortened bleeding time. Although elevated MPV values are related to respiratory distress syndrome [RDS] in neonates, there are, to our knowledge, no data investigating the relationship between MPV and other diseases of preterm infants.
AIM: To assess the correlation between MPV and the occurrence of various morbidities of prematurity such as necrotizing enterocolitis [NEC], bronchopulmonary dysplasia [BPD], sepsis, retinopathy of prematurity [ROP], and intraventricular hemorrhage [IVH] in a cohort of very preterm infants.
SUBJECTS: We studied infants with a gestational age of < 34 weeks and a birth weight of < 1500 g admitted to a third level Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Enrolled infants were divided into NEC and non-NEC, sepsis and non-sepsis, ROP and non-ROP, BPD and non-BPD and IVH and non-IVH groups. MPV was evaluated at birth [cord blood] and repeated at 48-72 hours of life.
RESULTS: Two hundred and seventy two infants were studied. MPV measured at birth was similar between sepsis and non-sepsis, and ROP and non-ROP groups. MPV values were higher in infants with BPD [9.08±1.3 fl], IVH [8.4±1.1fl] and NEC [8.6±0.7 f] when compared to the control group [7.6±0.6 fl] in the first day of life.
CONCLUSIONS: High MPV in the first hours of life may reflect the presence of a risk factor for the development of NEC, BPD and IVH in extremely preterm infants. This might be associated with inflammatory and oxidative process. However, our data indicate that higher MPV values are not associated with the development of sepsis or ROP in this study population."
23330571,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23330571/,"OBJECTIVE: Although cannabis use among individuals with psychotic disorder is considerable, little is known about patterns of use and factors contributing to continuation of use. Therefore, we investigated craving in relation to cannabis use in patients with psychotic disorder and healthy controls.
METHOD: The study included 58 patients with non-affective psychotic disorder and 63 healthy controls; all were frequent cannabis users. Craving was assessed with the Obsessive Compulsive Drug Use Scale (OCDUS) for cannabis, as well as in daily life using the Experience Sampling Method (ESM).
RESULTS: Patients scored higher on the OCDUS (B = 1.18, P = 0.022), but did not differ from controls in ESM indices of craving (all P > 0.05). In daily life, ESM craving predicted cannabis use and this was stronger in controls (χ(2) = 4.5, P = 0.033; Bcontrols = 0.08, P < 0.001; Bpatients = 0.06, P < 0.001). In both groups ESM craving was predicted by negative affect, paranoia, and hallucinations (Bnegativeaffect = 0.12, P = 0.009; Bparanoia = 0.13, P = 0.013; Bhallucinations = 0.13, P = 0.028), and followed by an increase in negative affect at non-cannabis-using moments (B = 0.03, P = 0.002).
CONCLUSION: The temporal dynamics of craving as well as craving intensity in daily life appear to be similar in patients and controls. Further research is needed to elucidate the inconsistencies between cross-sectional and daily-life measures of craving in psychosis."

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional mixed-methods study conducted from 1 May 2004 to 30 April 2005 of 293 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men aged 18 years and over from urban, rural and remote communities in the Northern Territory and Queensland.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Subscale of the International Index of Erectile Function, self-reported help-seeking behaviours for erectile dysfunction (ED) and prostate disease, thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews and focus groups.
RESULTS: The prevalence of moderate-to-severe ED increased across age groups, from about 10% in younger men (under 35 years) to 28% in men aged 55-74 years. Moderate-to-severe ED was strongly associated with reporting a chronic condition (odds ratio [OR], 3.67) and residing in a remote area (OR, 2.94). Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men aged 40-59 years showed similar low levels of help-seeking behaviours compared with non-Indigenous men from a comparable population-based study. About half of the men with ED saw a doctor or received treatment for ED in each population. While prostate cancer rates were low in both studies, testing for prostate problems was less frequent in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men (11.4%) than in non-Indigenous men (34.1%, P < 0.001), despite similar levels of concern about prostate cancer. Barriers to help-seeking included shame, culturally inappropriate services and lack of awareness.
CONCLUSION: This study, the first to investigate reproductive health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men, found low levels of help-seeking behaviours for reproductive health disorders, with implications for missing a predictor of chronic disease and late diagnosis of prostate disease."
23330895,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23330895/,"BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of research on whether application essays are a valid indicator of medical students' future performance.
PURPOSE: The goal is to score medical school application essays systematically and examine the correlations between these essay scores and several indicators of student performance during medical school and internship.
METHODS: A journalist created a scoring rubric based on the journalism literature and scored 2 required essays of students admitted to our university in 1 year (N = 145). We picked 7 indicators of medical school and internship performance and correlated these measures with overall essay scores: preclinical medical school grade point average (GPA), clinical medical school GPA, cumulative medical school GPA, U.S. Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE) Step 1 and 2 scores, and scores on a program director's evaluation measuring intern professionalism and expertise. We then examined the Pearson and Spearman correlations between essay scores and the outcomes.
RESULTS: Essay scores did not vary widely. American Medical College Application Service essay scores ranged from 3.3 to 4.5 (M = 4.11, SD = 0.15), and Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences essay scores ranged from 2.9 to 4.5 (M = 4.09, SD = 0.17). None of the medical school or internship performance indicators was significantly correlated with the essay scores.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings raise questions about the utility of matriculation essays, a resource-intensive admission requirement."
23331066,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23331066/,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the DSM's distinction between uncomplicated (normal) vs. complicated (disordered) bereavement-related depressive episodes can be validly extended to non-bereavement stressor-related depression (SRD). Previous findings supporting the uncomplicated/complicated SRD distinction's discriminant validity were criticized as tautological because of definitional biases (e.g., 'uncomplicated' requires brief duration, yet duration was a validator). We tested whether uncomplicated/complicated SRD validator differences are tautological or real.
METHOD: Using National Comorbidity Survey data, we compared uncomplicated SRDs, complicated SRDs, and endogenous/psychotic MDD on levels of eight pathology validators. We identified definitional biases affecting six validators, and corrected them by deleting the biasing definitional components and recalculating validator levels.
RESULTS: After correction of biases, uncomplicated SRDs had significantly lower pathology levels than both complicated SRDs and endogenous/psychotic MDD on seven of eight validators, disconfirming the tautology hypothesis. Regression analysis revealed that 'uncomplicated' cannot be equated with 'mild'. Extending the 'uncomplicated' durational threshold from 2 to 6 months yielded equal or stronger discriminant validity, suggesting the arbitrariness of the current durational criterion.
CONCLUSION: Uncomplicated SRDs' lower pathology levels are because of real syndromal differences, not definitional tautologies. The uncomplicated/complicated distinction has discriminant validity when extended to non-bereavement SRDs as an indicator of normality vs. disorder."
23331377,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23331377/,"BACKGROUND: Capturing a well-focused image using an autofocus camera can be difficult in oral cavity and on a hairy scalp. Light-field digital cameras capture data regarding the color, intensity, and direction of rays of light. Having information regarding direction of rays of light, computer software can be used to focus on different subjects in the field after the image data have been captured.
METHODS: A light-field camera was used to capture the images of the scalp and oral cavity. The related computer software was used to focus on scalp or different parts of oral cavity. The final pictures were compared with pictures taken with conventional, compact, digital cameras.
RESULTS: The camera worked well for oral cavity. It also captured the pictures of scalp easily; however, we had to repeat clicking between the hairs on different points to choose the scalp for focusing. A major drawback of the system was the resolution of the resulting pictures that was lower than conventional digital cameras.
CONCLUSION: Light-field digital cameras are fast and easy to use. They can capture more information on the full depth of field compared with conventional cameras. However, the resolution of the pictures is relatively low."
23331537,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23331537/,"BACKGROUND: This study aims to determine whether tricuspid regurgitation (TR) ≥ 2+ requires attention during mitral valve surgery.
METHODS: From April 1999 to 2009, 161 patients undergoing primary, isolated mitral valve procedures were assessed. Preoperative moderate TR (≥2+) was present in 56 of 161 patients and tricuspid valve repair (TVR: ring annuloplasty) was carried out on 22 of 56 patients with TR ≥ 2+. Baseline echocardiogram included TR severity (ASE criteria), TR velocity, estimated right atrial pressure, visual assessment of right ventricular failure and strain. Follow-up was 47 ± 33 months (96% complete); 91 of 161 patients overall (57%) and 44 of 45 patients with TR ≥ 2+ had follow-up echocardiogram.
RESULTS: Patients with moderate TR had worse baseline functional class and operative risks, both worst in the non-TVR group. Overall mortality was 15% (n = 23), comprising 2.5% (4/161) 30-day mortality and 12% (9/157) late death. Poorer preoperative TR was associated with worse survival by univariate analysis (P = 0.046), after correction for right ventricular function and pulmonary artery pressure (P = 0.049), age and diabetes (P = 0.041). Despite lower risk of TR ≥ 2+ with TVR, 5-year survival was 42%, which was less than TR < 2+ and that of non-TVR group (90%, P = 0.003). Improvement in overall functional class (NYHA) was better in the non-TVR group (TVR: preoperative 2.1 ± 1.5; post-operative 1.2 ± 1.1 (P = 0.02) versus non-TVR: preoperative 1.8 ± 1.4, post-operative 1.2 ± 0.9 (P < 0.0001)). There was no difference in quality of life (QOL) indices (SF-36 questionnaire) at follow-up between patients with TR < 2+ and TR ≥ 2+ preoperatively, or across all levels of TR before or after surgical repair.
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative TR ≥ 2+, non-TVR group had more favourable functional class and mid-term survival with comparable QOL and echocardiographic parameters to the TVR group."
23331613,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23331613/,"BACKGROUND: The comparative sensitivity of liquid-based cytology (LBC) test and conventional Papanicolaou (Pap) smears is controversial.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study analyses the distribution of cytology, histology, colposcopy and large loop excision of the transformation zone among women screened in Iceland with LBC at the Cancer Detection Clinic in Reykjavik and with a conventional Pap smear outside the Detection Clinic in 2007-2011. The study material included 42 654 LBC tests from 20 439 women and 103 909 Pap smears from 61 574 women. The period 2000-2004 is used to correct for potential bias as a result of unequal distribution of the studied parameters between the study sites before the introduction of LBC.
RESULTS: The observed results indicated that women screened with an LBC sample had significantly decreased detection rates of inadequate smears, increased detection of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL)/atypical cytology and referrals to colposcopy, and an increased detection rate of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN2+) irrespective of age. LBC increased significantly the detection rates of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or worse (HSIL+) cytology and CIN3+ histology only in women under 40 years of age. Taking into consideration the unequal prevalence of the studied parameters between the study sites in 2000-2004 indicated, however, that LBC only affected the rate of inadequate and low-grade cytology tests under the age of 40 years. Positive predictive values for CIN2+ were not significantly different between the tests.
CONCLUSIONS: The study results support the view that LBC is no more sensitive than Pap smears for the detection of HSIL+ and CIN2+ irrespective of age. LBC decreased the rate of inadequate smears, but increased the rate of low-grade cytology under the age of 40 years and decreased the total rate of abnormal smears over the age of 40 years."

METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive analysis was performed using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) and Kids' Inpatient Database (KID) data from 1998 to 2009. Pediatric discharges involving surgical repair of pectus excavatum were selected. Patients were sub-grouped by age at operation and calendar year of repair for further comparison.
RESULTS: A total of 5830 elective admissions were identified that met inclusion criteria. Mean age at operation was 13.5 years, and this increased from 11.8 years to 14.4 years over the period studied and was accompanied by narrowing of the interquartile range. Examined over groups of four calendar years, patient age at the time of repair was significantly higher in more recent years in both unadjusted and multivariate analyses (P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: The age at operation in this sample has steadily increased, with an accompanying decrease in variability. This is consistent with previous findings and with overall trends in patient selection reported in the literature. This selection pattern may reflect evolving consensus regarding optimal management of pectus excavatum and provide clinical guidance regarding appropriate referral and intervention."
23331871,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23331871/,"AIM: Our aim was to determine the frequency and economic impact of anastomotic leakage (AL) at local and national levels in England.
METHOD: All patients who underwent AR in Oxford between 2007 and 2009 were evaluated for AL. Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data were used to determine reoperation rates after elective AR (n = 23 388) in England between 2000 and 2008. Hospital episode remuneration costs were calculated by the local commissioning department and compared with Department of Health (DH) reference index costs.
RESULTS: The frequency of AL following anterior resection was 10.9% (31 out of 285) in Oxford. Laparotomy for leakage was performed in 5.6% of cases. The 30-day hospital mortality rate for all ARs was 2.1%, compared with 3.2% after AL. The national relaparotomy rate (within 28 days) and 30-day hospital mortality in English National Health Service (NHS) trusts following AR were 5.9% and 2.9%, respectively. Institutional remunerated tariffs (£6233 (SD ± 965)) were similar to DH reference costs (£6319 (SD ± 1830)) after uncomplicated AR. However, there was a significant (P = 0.008) discrepancy between the remunerated tariff for AL (£9605 (SD ± 6908)) and the actual cost (£17 220 (SD ± 9642)). AL resulted in an additional annual cost of approximately £1.1 million to £3.5 million when extrapolated nationally.
CONCLUSION: The estimated economic burden of anastomotic leakage following AR is approximately double that of the remunerated tariff."
23331952,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23331952/,"BACKGROUND: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is lifesaving for HIV-infected tuberculosis (TB) patients. ART-use by these patients lag behind compared to HIV-testing and co-trimoxazole preventive therapy. TB programmes provide the data on ART-use by HIV-infected TB patients, however often the HIV services provide the ART. We evaluated whether the data on ART-use in the TB register were complete and correct. The timing of ART initiation was evaluated to assess whether reporting on ART-use could have happened with the TB case finding reporting. We collected data on TB treatment, HIV testing and ART for adult TB cases in 2007 from three TB clinics in Manica Province, Mozambique. These data on use of ART from TB registers were compared with those from the HIV services.
FINDINGS: Of 628 patients included, 504 (81%) were tested and of these 356 (71%) were HIV-infected. Of the co-infected patients, 81% registered with the HIV services in the same facility. The TB register was correct on ART-use in 73% of co-infected cases and complete in 74%. Information on ART-use could have been reported with the TB case finding reports in 56% of co-infected patients.
CONCLUSION: The TB register is reasonably correct and complete on ART-use. However, the HIV patient record seems a much better source to provide this information. Reporting on ART-use at the end of the quarter in which TB treatment starts provides the programme with timely but incomplete information. A more complete but less timely picture is available after a year."

DESIGN: A nested case-control study of change in maternal plasma soluble Flt-1 (sFlt-1), soluble endoglin (sEng) and placenta growth factor (PlGF). We studied 158 pregnancies complicated by pre-eclampsia and 468 normotensive nonproteinuric controls.
SETTING: A multicentre study in 16 academic medical centres in the USA.
POPULATION: Low-risk nulliparous women.
METHODS: Luminex assays for PlGF, sFlt-1 and sEng performed on maternal EDTA plasma collected at 9-12, 15-18 and 23-26 weeks of gestation. Rate of change of analyte between first and either early or late second trimester was calculated with and without adjustment for baseline clinical characteristics.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Change in PlGF, sFlt-1 and sEng.
RESULTS: Rates of change of PlGF, sEng and sFlt-1 between first and either early or late second trimesters were significantly different in women who developed pre-eclampsia, severe pre-eclampsia or early-onset pre-eclampsia compared with women who remained normotensive. Inclusion of clinical characteristics (race, body mass index and blood pressure at entry) increased sensitivity for detecting severe and particularly early-onset pre-eclampsia but not pre-eclampsia overall. Receiver operating characteristics curves for change from first to early second trimester in sEng, PlGF and sFlt-1 with clinical characteristics had areas under the curve of 0.88, 0.84 and 0.86, respectively, and for early-onset pre-eclampsia with sensitivities of 88% (95% CI 64-99), 77% (95% CI 50-93) and 77% (95% CI 50-93) for 80% specificity, respectively. Similar results were seen in the change from first to late second trimester.
CONCLUSION: Change in angiogenic biomarkers between first and early second trimester combined with clinical characteristics has strong utility for predicting early-onset pre-eclampsia."
23332022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23332022/,"OBJECTIVE: Several studies have already shown the superiority of chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) compared with conventional karyotyping for prenatal investigation of fetal ultrasound abnormality. This study used very high-resolution single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays to determine the impact on detection rates of all clinical categories of copy number variations (CNVs), and address the issue of interpreting and communicating findings of uncertain or unknown clinical significance, which are to be expected at higher frequency when using very high-resolution CMA.
DESIGN: Prospective validation study.
SETTING: Tertiary clinical genetics centre.
POPULATION: Women referred for further investigation of fetal ultrasound anomaly.
METHODS: We prospectively tested 104 prenatal samples using both conventional karyotyping and high-resolution arrays.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The detection rates for each clinical category of CNV.
RESULTS: Unequivocal pathogenic CNVs were found in six cases, including one with uniparental disomy (paternal UPD 14). A further four cases had a 'likely pathogenic' finding. Overall, CMA improved the detection of 'pathogenic' and 'likely pathogenic' abnormalities from 2.9% (3/104) to 9.6% (10/104). CNVs of 'unknown' clinical significance that presented interpretational difficulties beyond results from parental investigations were detected in 6.7% (7/104) of samples.
CONCLUSIONS: Increased detection sensitivity appears to be the main benefit of high-resolution CMA. Despite this, in this cohort there was no significant benefit in terms of improving detection of small pathogenic CNVs. A potential disadvantage is the high detection rate of CNVs of 'unknown' clinical significance. These findings emphasise the importance of establishing an evidence-based policy for the interpretation and reporting of CNVs, and the need to provide appropriate pre- and post-test counselling."
23332037,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23332037/,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: The Self Assessment of Treatment (SAT) questionnaire was developed to reflect key patient reported outcomes of Neuropathic Pain (NP) treatments. This study aimed to understand how patients perceived the relevance and ease of understanding of the questions in the SAT and to recommend modifications based on patient and clinician interviews.
METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with clinicians and NP patients to provide information regarding treatment attributes and the impact of pain. Patients were debriefed on the SAT, a 5-item scale evaluating pain, activity level, quality of life (QoL) and satisfaction with treatment (recommend treatment and undergo treatment again). The SAT has a recall period reflecting back to the start of treatment. The qualitative analysis software ATLAS.ti 5.0 was used to analyze patient transcripts. Changes to the SAT were integrated into the questionnaire for a second round of debriefing interviews.
RESULTS: Three NP clinicians and 44 patients (20 painful diabetic neuropathy, 16 HIV-associated neuropathy and 8 post herpetic neuralgia) with a mean age of 60.3 (12.3) years and an even gender distribution were interviewed. Patient treatment experience included anticonvulsants (73%), antidepressants (34%), opioids (25%), and topical medications (41%). Pain descriptors and treatment attributes were similar across the three NP groups. Pain relief was judged the most important treatment attribute, followed by ability to undertake activities. Sleep improvement was another important attribute. Activity limitations and QOL were perceived as too broad and non-specific, and were split into 3 concepts each (activity limitations was split into self care, daily and physical activities and QOL was split into sleep, emotions, and social function). A 7-day recall period was introduced. The item stem and response options were made consistent, and a baseline and follow-up questionnaires were developed (except for the satisfaction items) to enable monitoring onset of treatment benefit and change over time.
CONCLUSIONS: The content validity of the revised SAT was improved by the qualitative research, and NP treatment benefits are reflected in a more consistent fashion by the changes. Baseline and follow-up versions make it possible to perform assessments of change over time."
23332112,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23332112/,"BACKGROUND: Stable bearing devices are often utilized by prehospital first responders in modern management of severely injured patients. It is not known whether these devices influence radiation exposure or image quality in whole-body computed tomography (WBCT). Additionally, manufacturers currently provide no specifications concerning these criteria. This investigation analyzed the influence of nine different bearing devices on these specified criteria.
METHODS: The influence of nine different bearing devices on radiation exposure and image quality in WBCT was investigated. The dose-length-product (DLP100) was obtained through use of a CT-ionisation chamber placed in the centre of a 32 cm CT-phantom and compared with a reference value. Moreover, the results were calculated as effective dose data E (mSv). The image quality was assessed by three expert radiologists using the following scoring scale (0=no artefacts; 1=minor artefacts; 2=clearly artefacts; 3=massive artefacts).
RESULTS: Out of nine bearing devices examined, four showed significantly higher (2.5-4.5%, p<0.05) DLP100 and five showed no significant difference between DLP100 and the reference value. The image quality was classified in the categories ""0"", ""1"", ""2"" and ""3"" in 4, 3, 1 and 1 case, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: In diagnostic producers using WBCT, bearing devices may be associated with relevant increases in radiation dose and can affect the image assessability. Some bearing devices are associated with no significant influence on radiation dose and reduction of image quality. Considering all results to get the best balance between image quality and radiation dose, aluminium and metal-free devices should be preferred."
23332188,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23332188/,"OBJECTIVE: In patients with pulmonary dysfunction, it is unclear whether a less-invasive approach for aortic valve replacement is well tolerated or even beneficial. We investigated whether a partial upper J-incision for aortic valve replacement leads to more favorable outcomes than a full sternotomy in patients with chronic lung disease by using forced expiratory volume in 1 second as a surrogate.
METHODS: From January 1995 to July 2010, 6931 patients underwent primary isolated aortic valve replacement; 655 had forced expiratory volume in 1 second measured and expressed as percent of predicted (FEV1%; 368 via J-incision, 287 via full sternotomy). Postoperative outcomes were compared among 223 propensity-matched pairs.
RESULTS: Patients diagnosed with chronic lung disease had longer median intensive care unit (41 vs 27 hours, P = .001) and postoperative (7.1 vs 6.1 days, P < .0001) lengths of stay than those without chronic lung disease. At normal values of FEV1%, little difference was observed in either of these times for J-incision versus full sternotomy; however, at progressively lower FEV1%, these times lengthened, with increasing benefit for J-incision. Among propensity-matched patients, other postoperative complications were similar. Early survival (93% vs 89% at 1 year, P = .07) was possibly higher in matched patients with J-incision, but late survival was similar (P = .9). Patients with FEV1% less than 50 who underwent J-incision had the greatest survival advantage, which persisted for 5 years.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with preoperative respiratory dysfunction, a less-invasive partial upper J-incision for aortic valve replacement can lead to more favorable outcomes than a full sternotomy, including shorter intensive care unit and postoperative lengths of stay and better early survival, which are amplified with decreasing pulmonary function."
23332198,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23332198/,"BACKGROUND: Ovarian dysgerminoma is a rare tumor that affects adolescent girls and young women. Due to its high radio-chemosensitivity, prognosis is normally excellent. Relapses occur in less than 20% of early stage disease, but are more frequent in advanced disease. It is known that some benign mediastinal processes may mimic tumor relapse, particularly in young patients. This is the case of physiologic thymic hyperplasia, which occurs as a rebound phenomenon after chemotherapy in young women with ovarian dysgerminoma. Until now, no cases of dysgerminoma with benign mediastinal mass have been published.
CASE: A young woman with bulky ovarian dysgerminoma, who obtained complete disease remission after chemotherapy, subsequently developed a mediastinal mass which was initially confused with a mediastinal relapse. CT scan features (close thymic location, homogeneous hypodensity, absence of infiltration of mediastinal structures) and subsequent PET/CT scan (homogeneous glucose uptake and a typical inverted V morphology) supported the diagnosis of thymic hyperplasia. No further invasive procedures were performed. 34 months from the diagnosis the patient is in good physical condition with no signs of relapse.
CONCLUSIONS: Our case underlines the importance of knowing the age- and treatment-related incidence of physiologic thymic hyperplasia in young women with ovarian dysgerminoma in order to reduce the potential pitfalls and to avoid unnecessary invasive diagnostic procedures."
19835472,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19835472/,"OBJECT: Endoscopic approaches to pituitary tumors have become an effective alternative to traditional microscopic transsphenoidal approaches. Despite a proven potential to decrease unexpected residual tumor, intraoperative MR (iMR) imaging is infrequently used even in the few operating environments in which such technology is available. Its use is prohibitive because of its cost, increased complexity, and longer operative times. The authors assessed the potential of intrasellar endoscopy to replace the need for iMR imaging without sacrificing the maximum extent of resection.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, 27 consecutive patients underwent fully endoscopic resection of pituitary macroadenomas. Intrasellar endoscopy was used to determine the presence of residual tumor within the sella turcica and tumor cavity. Intraoperative MR imaging was used to identify rates of unexpected residual tumor and the need for further tumor resection.
RESULTS: Intraoperative estimates of the extent of tumor resection were correct in 23 patients (85%). Of 4 patients with unacceptable tumor residuals, 3 underwent further tumor resection. After iMR imaging, the rate of successful completion of the planned extent of resection increased to 26 patients (96%). Rates of both endocrinopathy reversal and postoperative complications were consistent with previously published results for microscopic and endoscopic resection techniques.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings in this study provided quantitative evidence that intrasellar endoscopy has significant promise for maximizing the extent of tumor resection and is a useful adjunct to surgical approaches to pituitary tumors, particularly when iMR imaging is unavailable. A larger prospective study on the extent of resection following endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery would strengthen these findings."
19835706,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19835706/,"OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether adults aged 65 years or older living in rural areas who are without depressive symptoms have a lower risk of developing depressive symptoms over 5 years than their urban counterparts, and to determine the factors that predict the development of depressive symptoms in older adults in rural and urban areas.
METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of an existing data set, the Manitoba Study of Health and Aging (MSHA.) We studied a population-based random sample of 807 people without depressive symptoms or cognitive impairment who were residing in Manitoba communities in 1991/92 and 5 years later in 1996/97. We defined ""rural"" as a census subdivision with a population of less than 20,000, and ""urban"" as a population of 20,000 or greater. The MSHA investigators measured depressive symptoms using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale, using the standard cut-point of 16 or more. Participants reported their age, sex, education, self-rated health, and functional status at the time of their first interview.
RESULTS: Of adults aged 65 years or older living in urban areas, 13.3% developed depressive symptoms, versus 8.9% of those living in rural regions (p = 0.047). In multivariate analyses, a rural residence was not associated with the development of depressive symptoms. In rural areas, factors predicting depressive symptoms were female sex and poor self-rated health at the time of the first interview.
CONCLUSION: A rural residence is only weakly protective for the development of depressive symptoms over 5 years, and this association was not seen after we accounted for potential confounding variables. As well, these results underscore the strong association between poor health and depressive symptoms."
19836257,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19836257/,"BACKGROUND: The objective of this investigation was to compare postoperative morbidity and early and late mortality in patients after pneumonectomy for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with or without induction neo-adjuvant therapy.
METHODS: This is an observational study performed on prospectively collected data at four tertiary referral centres (2000-2007). Of 225 pneumonectomies for NSCLC, 81 patients underwent neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. Several perioperative variables were used in identifying propensity score-matched pairs of patients with and without induction treatment. The matched groups were then compared in terms of morbidity, early (30-day or in-hospital) and 90-day mortality.
RESULTS: The overall cardiopulmonary morbidity, early mortality and 90-day mortality rates were 30% (67 patients), 7.1% (16 patients) and 9.8% (22 patients), respectively. Propensity score analysis yielded 56 well-matched pairs of patients with and without induction chemotherapy. The two groups had similar early and late mortality rates: four versus four (p=1) and seven versus seven (p=1), respectively. Moreover, the incidence of cardiopulmonary morbidity and bronchopleural fistula were also similar in both the groups: 19 versus 17 patients (Fisher's exact test p=0.7) and two versus three patients (Fisher's exact test, p=0.7), respectively. Twenty-one patients with induction chemo-radiotherapy were analysed separately and compared with well-matched counterparts without any induction treatment. No significant differences were identified in terms of early mortality (1 vs 0, p=1), 90-day mortality (1 vs 0, p=1), cardiopulmonary complications (5 vs 5, p=1) and bronchopleural fistula (1 vs 1, p=1).
CONCLUSIONS: Current regimens of induction treatment do not seem to increase the risk of morbidity, early mortality and late mortality after pneumonectomy in properly selected patients. This study warrants confirmation from future multicentre prospective randomised trials powered on early outcomes."
19836268,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19836268/,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Introduce radiology residents to evidence-based radiology (EBR) using a journal club format based on the Radiology Alliance for Health Services Research/American Alliance of Academic Chief Residents in Radiology (RAHSR/A3CR2) Critical Thinking Skills sessions and EBR series of articles published in Radiology in 2007.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The club began with a presentation outlining the process that would occur in an alternating format, with topics and articles chosen by residents. In session A, questions were rephrased in a Patient/Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome format, and a literature search was performed. Articles were discussed in session B, with residents assigned by year to the tasks of article summary, technology assessment, and comparison to checklists (Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy, Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials, or Quality of Reporting of Meta-analysis). The residents collectively assigned a level of evidence to each article, and a scribe provided a summary.
RESULTS: Twenty-two residents participated, with 12/22 (55%) of residents submitting any question, 6/22 (27.3%) submitting more than one question, and 4 residents submitting questions in more than one session. Topics included radiation risk, emergency radiology, screening examinations, modality comparisons, and technology assessment. Of the 31 articles submitted for review, 15 were in radiology journals and 5 were published before 2000. For 2/9 topics searched, no single article that the residents selected was available through our library's subscription service. The maximum level of evidence assigned by residents was level III, ""limited evidence."" In each session, the residents concluded that they became less confident in the ""right answer."" They proposed that future reading recommendations come from attendings rather than literature searches.
CONCLUSION: A journal club format is an effective tool to teach radiology residents EBR principles. Resistance comes from the difficulty in accessing good literature for review and in constructing good review questions."
19836799,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19836799/,"PURPOSE: Fuhrman grade represents a key determinant of the natural history of small renal masses that represent renal cell carcinoma. We tested whether renal mass biopsy prediction of Fuhrman grade in the nephrectomy specimen could be safely substituted for by an accurate statistical model. To date the best available model has shown poor accuracy (55.6%), which is close to flipping a coin (50%) and clearly inadequate for use in clinical practice.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified 1,139 patients with T1aN0M0 renal cell carcinoma treated with partial or radical nephrectomy at 11 participating institutions from 1989 to 2004. This cohort was used in univariate and multivariate logistic regression models predicting high Fuhrman grade (III-IV) at nephrectomy. Predictors included age at diagnosis, gender, tumor size and symptom classification. Multivariate logistic regression coefficients were used to generate a nomogram.
RESULTS: The rate of Fuhrman grade III-IV in patients with T1aN0M0 renal cell carcinoma was 12.3%. Stratifying patients with Fuhrman grade III-IV by age, gender, histological subtypes and sample size failed to reveal statistically significant differences. On univariate analysis predicting Fuhrman grade III-IV at nephrectomy only tumor size was a statistically significant predictor (p = 0.05). The most accurate multivariate nomogram for Fuhrman grade III-IV prediction was 58.3% (95% CI 57.8-58.9) accurate. Of all tested predictors only tumor size achieved independent predictor status (p = 0.009).
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis derived in European patients shows that statistical models cannot safely replace renal mass biopsy based prediction of Fuhrman grade III-IV at nephrectomy. Our findings corroborate a report from the United States in which a similar model had 55.6% accuracy. Jointly the studies indicate that statistical models are unreliable and cannot safely be substituted for renal mass biopsy in North American or European patients."
19836963,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19836963/,"INTRODUCTION: The time point of Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) delivery on matrices in vivo may play an important role. Delayed application could be advantageous as this would allow soft tissue (ST) ingrowth and vascularisation of scaffolds prior to BMP-loading. The aim of this study was to compare the application of BMP injected simultaneously during matrix implantation with delayed application four weeks after matrix implantation for endocultivation in a rat model.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Bovine hydroxyapatite blocks were placed in pouches in the Musculus latissimus dorsi in 6 Lewis rats unilaterally to allow for soft tissue ingrowth. Four weeks later, a second block was inserted on the contralateral side of each rat. At that time point, 100microg rhBMP-2 in 2ml sodium chloride was injected on both sides to induce bone formation. For eight weeks, bone regeneration was monitored by computed tomography (CT) and fluorescent labelling.
RESULTS: The simultaneous and delayed BMP application groups were significantly different (p=0.01). Slightly lower bone densities were seen for the delayed BMP application with a mean of 588 Hounsfield Units (HU) (standard deviation (SD) 30HU). Simultaneous BMP application revealed slightly higher densities with a mean of 633HU (SD 30HU). The largest differences were observed when comparing bone density directly after implantation or at the end of the observation period (p<0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Bone density was slightly lower in the case of delayed application of BMP-2. The increase of bone density after application of BMP-2 was similar for both groups. Thus, delayed application of BMP had no advantageous effect in this particular study design. Further studies are needed to explore if varying delays, different material designs or special BMP application devices may alter these results."
19836976,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19836976/,"HYPOTHESIS: Functional outcome after conservative management is predicted by changes in angulation of the fractured humeral head and can be used for individual patients to predict functional outcome.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Standard anteroposterior (AP) and transscapular (Y) radiographs were used to evaluate 55 patients with minimally displaced proximal humeral fractures during the first week of conservative treatment. Functional outcome was determined by the Constant-Murley and Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) scores. The relationship between the variables and the radiographic evaluation was assessed by the Pearson correlation coefficient. Receiver operator curve (ROC) analysis and logistic regression analysis defined the optimal value for abnormalities on radiographic evaluation as an outcome predictor.
RESULTS: Mean (SD) angulations at time of the fracture were 53 degrees (19 degrees ) on AP view and 59 degrees (21 degrees ) on Y-view. After 1 week, these angulations were 47 degrees (20 degrees ) and 62 degrees (21 degrees ), respectively. Significant correlations between Constant-Murley (R(2)=0.43, P=.007) and DASH (R(2)=0.43, P=.04) outcome scores and the angulation of the humeral head fragment on the Y view, and not with AP angulation were found. The optimum predictive angulation at the Y view at time of fracture was 55 degrees or less for predicting adverse functional outcome with an area under the ROC curve of 0.78 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.64-0.93; P=.006). Regression analysis showed that angulations on the initial Y view and after 1 week were the most important predictors of the functional outcome at a median of 2.2 years of follow-up.
CONCLUSION: This study indicated that radiographic evaluation in patients with minimally displaced proximal humeral fractures is helpful in prediction functional outcome during conservative treatment."
19837206,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19837206/,"OBJECTIVE: Multidisciplinary treatments (MTs) are usually recommended for reducing fibromyalgia (FM) symptoms and include physical exercise, drug management, education, and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). However, there is no evidence that CBT adds efficacy to the other therapeutic components. This randomized controlled trial analyzed the response of FM patients to two MTs, with and without CBT, according to the presence of concurrent symptoms.
METHODS: Eighty-three women with FM were randomly assigned to MT or combined MT and CBT. The MT included medical intervention, physical training, education, and discussion of the syndrome. The CBT focused on coping with stress, modifying lifestyles, and changing pain behaviors. Demographic and clinical data, information regarding tender points, and questionnaire responses about functional capability [Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ)], health status [36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36)], and mental health [Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R)] were obtained at the beginning, at the end of the 15-week treatment, and at 6-month follow-up. Subgroups are identified in relation to treatment response.
RESULTS: Sixty-six women (80%) completed treatment. Although the variance of the total sample had changed at posttreatment (F=2.67, P=.031), there was no significant effect for the TimexTreatment interaction (F=1.65, P=.16). Univariate tests detected a significant fall in the FIQ score. The subgroup of patients with fatigue showed a better response with MT+CBT than with MT. At 6-month follow-up, the statistical differences had been maintained. Intention-to-treat analysis ratified these results.
CONCLUSIONS: MT improves functional capability and reduces symptom impact. CBT increases mildly the effect of MT in patients with fatigue."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Of the 526 individuals diagnosed with carcinoma of the oral cavity between 1998 and 2005, 52 had undergone primary tumor resection and lymph node dissection of the neck for stage I or II disease. With a mean count of 27 examined negative nodes, these 52 patients were separated into groups with fewer than 27 or > or = 27 uninvolved lymph nodes and compared for disease-free survival.
RESULTS: The tumor recurred or progressed in 10 patients (19%) during a median follow-up of 27 months. The 2-year disease-free survival rates were 75% and 78% in individuals with fewer than 27 and > or = 27 uninvolved node counts, respectively (P > .78).
CONCLUSION: The removal of a greater number of regional, uninvolved cervical lymph nodes does not correlate with disease-free survival in this particular cohort of patients."
19837509,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19837509/,"UNLABELLED: Modafinil is sometimes used in the clinical setting for treating multiple sclerosis (MS) fatigue, despite conflicting and disappointing results from clinical trials.
OBJECTIVE: We audited the patient perceived effectiveness of modafinil when used in clinical practice in a carefully selected group of patients with typical MS fatigue.
METHODS: All MS patients commenced on modafinil for fatigue in the Oxford MS clinic were identified retrospectively, and the patient perceived benefit, side effects and decision on continuation of therapy at 1 month was obtained from the medical notes. Additionally all patients were subsequently interviewed, up to 5 years after treatment initiation.
RESULTS: Surprisingly, 69% patients with fatigue also suffered excessive daytime sleepiness, and this subgroup found modafinil more beneficial. There was a better response against excessive daytime sleepiness than fatigue. The benefit against fatigue or sleepiness was generally sustained (median 1 year).
CONCLUSION: This suggests that modafinil may be useful, particularly when MS fatigue is associated with sleepiness. The relationship between fatigue and excessive daytime sleepiness is poorly understood and needs to be better defined before appropriate measures of the most clinically relevant outcomes can be selected for clinical trials. Outcome measures used in previous clinical trials have not properly evaluated the effects of modafinil."
19837634,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19837634/,"OBJECTIVE: There is a paucity of literature on a definition or set criteria evaluating urethral plate (UP) quality. We sought to determine whether pediatric urologists are in agreement in their assessment of UP quality.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cohort of 21 pediatric urologists attending a national annual meeting were surveyed with a questionnaire inquiring about practice patterns and perceived impressions of UP quality. Nineteen sequentially projected, standardized, digital photographs, depicting plates with variable meatal locations, were presented. Intra- and inter-rater agreement among pediatric urologists was estimated by calculating the Kappa statistic (kappa).
RESULTS: Thirty percent of respondents had more than 15years of practice and one-third repair 10 or more hypospadias per month. Measurement of level of agreement in the impression of UP quality of the 18 projected photographs revealed poor inter-rater agreement (kappa=0.06, P=0.0003), which was not improved by focusing on particular meatal locations or surgeon experience.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the inherent shortcomings of digital photography, this study highlights the potential subjectivity and lack of agreement on UP quality. Disagreement seems to be present irrespective of level of the defect or surgeon experience. Setting standards and improving agreement is likely to enhance reporting and interpretation of data in hypospadias studies."
19837684,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19837684/,"BACKGROUND: Pregnancy rates cannot be used reliably for comparison of IVF clinic performance because of differences in patients between clinics. We investigate if differences in pregnancy chance between IVF centres remain after adjustment for patient mix.
METHODS: We prospectively collected IVF and ICSI treatment data from 11 out of 13 IVF centres in the Netherlands, between 2002 and 2004. Adjustment for sampling variation was made using a random effects model. A prognostic index for subfertility-related factors was used to adjust for differences in patient mix. The remaining variability between centres was split into random variation and true differences.
RESULTS: The crude 1-year ongoing pregnancy chance per centre differed by nearly a factor 3 between centres, with hazard ratios (HRs) of 0.48 (95% CI: 0.34-0.69) to 1.34 (95% CI: 1.18-1.51) compared with the mean 1-year ongoing pregnancy chance of all centres. After accounting for sampling variation, the difference shrank since HRs became 0.66 (95% CI: 0.51-0.85) to 1.28 (95% CI: 1.13-1.44). After adjustment for patient mix, the difference narrowed somewhat further to HRs of 0.74 (95% CI: 0.57-0.94) to 1.33 (95% CI: 1.20-1.48) and 17% of the variation between centres could be explained by patient mix. The 1-year cumulative ongoing pregnancy rate in the two most extreme centres was 36% and 55%.
CONCLUSIONS: Only a minor part of the differences in pregnancy chance between IVF centres is explained by patient mix. Further research is needed to elucidate the causes of the remaining differences."
19837790,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19837790/,"OBJECTIVE: To compare recent U.S. and U.K. guidelines on gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The guidelines from the American Diabetes Association, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the U.K. were collated and compared using a general inductive approach.
RESULTS: There are substantial differences in the recommendations between the U.K. and the U.S. guidelines. Of particular note are the reduced sensitivities of the early and later antenatal and postnatal screening and diagnostic criteria. NICE undertook a cost-effectiveness analysis using lower prevalence estimates and limited outcomes and still showed screening for GDM to be cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: The latest NICE recommendations appear to reduce access to proven, cost-effective management of GDM, an issue relevant in the current U.S. health care policy debate."

METHODS: A retrospective chart analysis of venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) results among pregnant women at the UMTH, Maiduguri, Nigeria, during a 10-year period (from 1st January 1999 to 31st December 2008) was undertaken.
RESULTS: A total of 18,712 women registered for antenatal care during the study period. Of these, 18,101 had serological screening for syphilis. Only 12 of the 18,101 screened were seropositive by VDRL, 9 (75%) were confirmed by Treponema pallidum hemagglutination assay (TPHA), giving a seroprevalence rate of 0.05%. Three (25%) were biological false-positive. The peak age-specific incidence of 0.02% was in the 20-24 year-age group. There was zero prevalence in the age groups 15-19 and >40 years. There was no case of congenital syphilis seen. The cost for VDRL testing per patient in UMTH is US$2. The total amount of money spent on VDRL tests over the study period was US$37,424.
CONCLUSION: The seroprevalence rate of syphilis is extremely low in this study. This calls for a review of the policy of routine antenatal serology screening for syphilis in Maiduguri, Nigeria."
19838742,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19838742/,"PURPOSE: Most patients with advanced cancer experience negative emotion. When patients express emotions, oncologists rarely respond empathically. Oncologists may respond more empathically to some patients, and patients may perceive different levels of empathy and trust given past documentation of disparities in cancer care.
METHODS: We audio-recorded 264 outpatient encounters between oncologists and patients with advanced cancer at three sites. We examined whether patient gender, age, race, marital status, education, economic security, and length of relationship with oncologist were related to oncologist empathic responses to patient's negative emotion and patient's perceptions of oncologist empathy and trust.
RESULTS: Half (51%) of the patients expressed a negative emotion. Oncologists sometimes responded with empathy (29%). Oncologists were equally empathic with all patients, except they were more empathic with patients with low economic security compared with those reporting high economic security (p = .002). Patients with low economic security viewed oncologists as more empathic (p = .06) compared with those with moderate security. Married patients also viewed oncologists as more empathic (p = .04). Patients who knew their oncologist for more than a year had more trust than patients who knew their oncologists for less time (p = .02).
CONCLUSIONS: Oncologists, in general, did not respond empathically to patient's negative emotion, and did this equally for most patients. Oncologists responded more empathically to patients who were less economically advantaged. In turn, patients with lower economic security perceived more empathy. Although oncologists need more education in responding empathically, they may not need to correct many biases in care."
19838758,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19838758/,"BACKGROUND: Vaccination against seasonal influenza is far from universal among groups specifically recommended for vaccine. There is little research to guide communication with patients about vaccination.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the utility of the self-reported intention to be vaccinated against seasonal influenza in predicting vaccine uptake, reasons for being unvaccinated, and willingness to be vaccinated based on a doctor's recommendation.
METHODS: We analyzed data from a subset of respondents (n = 1,527) specifically recommended by the ACIP for vaccination against seasonal influenza who participated in two national surveys of adults age 18 and older conducted in November 2008 and March 2009.
RESULTS: Over half who intended to be vaccinated had been vaccinated. Compared to those without intentions, those with intentions were one-fifth as likely (p < 0.01) to cite lack of need and five times more likely (p < 0.01) to cite ""not getting around to being vaccinated"" as main reasons for not being vaccinated. Roughly two-fifths of those without the intention to be vaccinated indicated a willingness to be vaccinated based on a doctor's recommendation.
CONCLUSIONS: Asking simple questions about the intention to be vaccinated against seasonal influenza may be an efficient means of identifying patients with whom extended discussion of vaccine benefits is warranted."
19838950,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19838950/,"BACKGROUND: Heat shock protein (Hsp) 27 expression in cardiomyocytes increases in response to ischaemia. The extracellular release of Hsp27 from cardiomyocytes is proportional to its intracellular levels.
AIM: To assess the influence of significant coronary artery disease (CAD), which by definition results in chronic myocardial ischaemia, on blood serum levels of Hsp27.
METHODS: Blood serum levels of Hsp27 in 62 patients with at least 50% lumen diameter narrowing in at least one main epicardial coronary artery on angiography and in 21 controls with normal coronaries were measured.
RESULTS: Patients with CAD tended to have higher serum level of Hsp27 than controls [0.463 (0.158-0.809) vs. 0.184 (0.099-0.337) ng/ml, p = 0.084]. Serum Hsp27 level in patients with CAD affecting more than a single vessel was significantly increased [0.529 (0.192-1.004) ng/ml] compared with controls (p = 0.035) and with one artery narrowed [0.276 (0.087-0.549) ng/ml, p = 0.041]. No correlation between Hsp27 serum levels and severity of coronary narrowings assessed by Gensini score was found (r = 0.21, p = 0.11).

Often these complications arise suddenly and without warning. Identifying patients at risk for intracranial abscesses may help with early diagnosis and allow for early interventions.
OBJECTIVE: We report on 2 patients with traumatic pneumocephalus who developed intracranial abscesses. Our objective was to evaluate these cases and investigate the relationship between the presence of pneumocephalus and the formation of intracranial infection.
METHODS: Data was reviewed on the cases of 2 patients who developed intracranial abscesses after pneumocephalus in the context of skull base defects.
RESULTS: Two patients presented to our institution separately with the presence of intracranial abscesses. Both patients had violation of their anterior skull base--one from endoscopic sinus surgery, one from blunt trauma. Both patients had massive pneumocephalus prior to their abscess formation.
CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial abscess formation, traumatic skull base defects, and massive pneumocephalus are uncommon entities, which may be associated. It may be prudent to have heightened suspicion for the presence of intracranial abscess formation in patients with massive pneumocephalus secondary to anterior skull base trauma."
19839289,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19839289/,"OBJECTIVES: The development, implementation, and evaluation of policies may play an important role in promoting health behaviours such as physical activity. The Ontario Ministry of Education (OME) recently mandated Memorandum No. 138 requiring daily physical activity (DPA) for Ontario elementary students in grades one through eight. The purpose of this paper is to examine implementation strategies.
METHODS: Hogwood and Gunn's 10 preconditions for ""perfect implementation"" are used to examine publicly available Ministry DPA policy documents to assess whether these implementation strategies have been considered in the policy documents.
RESULTS: Several preconditions (e.g., allocation of resources, task specification) appear to have been considered, however a number of preconditions (e.g., the sustainability of resources, extent to which the policy is valued, and evaluation plans) thought to be important require additional attention to ensure optimal DPA implementation.
CONCLUSIONS: Additional reflection upon Hogwood and Gunn's implementation preconditions would, in our opinion, assist in facilitating optimal DPA implementation as per Memorandum No. 138."
19839739,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19839739/,"INTRODUCTION: Malignant pleural effusions (MPEs) complicate many advanced malignancies and the median prognosis for those who develop MPEs is 6 months. These effusions lead patients to suffer from significant dyspnea, which may consequently impair mobility and lead to reduced quality of life. There are several treatment options for those with MPE. Thoracentesis may be quick and relatively easy to perform, but has a high recurrence rate; chest tube placement with talc slurry is quite effective at achieving pleurodesis, but this procedure can be quite painful and requires hospitalization. An alternative option is outpatient placement of the Pleurx catheter (Denver Biomedical Inc., Denver, CO) for home-based drainage of effusions.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the incremental cost effectiveness of treating MPE with talc pleurodesis versus placement of Pleurx catheter.
METHODS: We used decision analysis to compare treatments for the management of MPE. Cost data for Pleurx and talc treatments were obtained using Medicare reimbursement data for 2008, and outcome data (probability of treatment success and/or complication, and utility of health states) were obtained through literature review.
RESULTS: Under our base-case analysis, treatment with talc was less costly than Pleurx (talc, $8170.80; Pleurx, $9011.60) with similar effectiveness (talc, 0.281 quality adjusted life years [QALYs]; Pleurx, 0.276 QALYs). Pleurx became more cost effective (<$100K/QALY) when life expectancy was 6 weeks or less.
CONCLUSION: The treatment choice (talc pleurodesis or Pleurx catheter) for those with an MPE and a prognosis of 6 months should be based on the clinical situation and patient preferences, as well as local expertise and success rates of the procedures. A prospective study specific to the palliative care population might help to clarify which treatment is more cost effective in this population in which optimizing quality of life is essential."
19839821,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19839821/,"BACKGROUND: Thin basement membrane nephropathy (TBMN) patients with additional inflammatory diseases and IgA nephropathy (IgAN) have not been reported before. It was unclear that if the prognosis of these patients is better or worse than patients with IgAN and TBMN, or IgAN patients with normal glomerular basement membrane (GBM).
METHODS: We first reported five TBMN patients with additional inflammatory diseases and IgAN: three were with rheumatoid arthritis, and two had Crohn's disease. Clinical and laboratory features were analyzed between this group (group 3), IgAN patients with normal GBM (group 1), and patients with TBMN and IgAN (group 2).
RESULTS: Significant differences were observed in serum levels of IgG, IgA, and IgM between groups 1 and 3, p < 0.001, and between groups 2 and 3, p < 0.001. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in group 3 was significantly lower than that of groups 1 and 2, p < 0.01, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The prognosis of these patients is worse than patients with IgAN and TBMN or IgAN patients with normal GBM. Serum immunoglobulin levels and GFR in these patients were different from patients with IgAN and TBMN, or IgAN patients with normal GBM."

We conducted this study to evaluate the significance of serum cystatin C as a more sensitive marker of GFR for early detection of renal impairment in special groups of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM).
METHODS: The present study included 40 patients with type 2 DM divided into four equal groups based on their urinary albumin excretion and renal function: group 1 was normoalbuminuric, group 2 was microalbuminuric, group 3 was macroalbuminuric, and group 4 was macroalbuminuric with renal dysfunction. All patients underwent a thorough history, full clinical examination, fasting, and renal function tests. Post-prandial blood glucose levels, glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), proteins, albumin in 24 hr urine, and serum cystatin C were collected.
RESULTS: Serum cystatin C and creatinine were significantly higher in macrolbuminuric type 2 diabetic patients with renal dysfunction (group 4: 2.26 +/- 1.28, 4.21 +/- 2.38 mg/dl, respectively; p < 0.001) than macrolbuminuric type 2 diabetic patients with normal renal function (group 3: 1.04 +/- 0.24, 0.96 +/- 0.20 mg/dl, respectively), the microalbuminuric group (0.87 +/- 0.28, 0.71 +/- 0.12 mg/dl, respectively), as well as the normoalbuminuric group (0.55 +/- 0.41, 0.60 +/- 0.18 mg/dl, respectively). ROC plots demonstrated that area under the curve (AUC) of cystatin C (0.74) was greater than that for creatinine clearance (cr.cl) (0.67) and serum creatinine (s-cr) (0.74); therefore, the sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy of cystatin c was better than cr. cl., and both were better than s-cr. Serum cystatin C showed significant correlation in groups 2-4 with s-cr, cr.cl, and 24 hr urine albumin, but no correlation was found in group 1.
CONCLUSION: Serum cystatin C is a reliable and easily performed marker for GFR to detect renal impairment in patients with type 2 DM."
19839895,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19839895/,"AIMS: To investigate whether the timing of silicone tube removal after external dacryocystorhinostomy (EXT-DCR) for lacrimal outflow obstruction affects outcome.
METHODS: Retrospective chart review and follow-up by telephone survey of 205 consecutive patients undergoing EXT- DCR. Long-term success was evaluated by telephone survey.
RESULTS: Full data was collected in 180 out of 205 DCRs. Ninety four tubes (52.3%) were removed routinely between 2 and 4 months after surgery, 24 tubes (13.3%) were removed before the planned 2-month period and 62 tubes (34.4%) were removed after the planned 4-month period. The three groups (early, routine and late) were comparable in terms of age, gender distribution, mode of anaesthesia, proportion of repeat EXT-DCRs and seniority of surgeon. The mean follow-up period was 3 years and 10 months. One hundred and twenty-eight of the 155 patients (82.5%) were contactable by phone. In the routine tube removal group, at the time of follow-up, 65.1% experienced complete symptom resolution, 25.4% experienced partial symptom resolution, 6.3% experienced no symptom resolution and 3.2% experienced worse symptoms. In the early tube removal group, at the time of follow-up, 63% experienced complete symptom resolution, 32% experienced partial symptom resolution and 5% experienced no change in symptoms. In the late tube removal group, at the time of follow-up, 70% experienced complete symptom resolution, 21.5% experienced partial symptom resolution and 8.5% experienced no symptom resolution. There was no statistically significant difference in the outcome of the three groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Our experience and this study suggest that timing of silicone tube removal does not influence surgical success in EXT-DCR regardless of the cause of early or late tube removal."
19840132,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19840132/,"OBJECTIVE: We examine the financial impact of major illnesses on the near-elderly and how this impact is affected by health insurance.
DATA SOURCES: We use RAND Corporation extracts from the Health and Retirement Study from 1992 to 2006.(1)
STUDY DESIGN: Our dependent variable is the change in household assets, excluding the value of the primary home. We use triple difference median regressions on a sample of newly ill/uninsured near elderly (under age 65) matched to newly ill/insured near elderly. We also include a matched control group of households whose members are not ill.
RESULTS: Controlling for the effects of insurance status and illness, we find that the median household with a newly ill, uninsured individual suffers a statistically significant decline in household assets of between 30 and 50 percent relative to households with matched insured individuals. Newly ill, insured individuals do not experience a decline in wealth.
CONCLUSIONS: Newly ill/uninsured households appear to be one illness away from financial catastrophe. Newly ill insured households who are matched to uninsured households appear to be protected against financial loss, at least in the near term."
19840303,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19840303/,"OBJECTIVE: To study the common features of the young girls with vulvar ulcerations, and to help guide physicians caring for girls with this unusual condition.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, ten patients who developed vulvar ulcerations and denied any kind of sexual contact or sexual abuse were identified. Patient information was collated from detailed history, physical, and laboratory examinations including age, menarchal status, type of clothing worn, whether history of oral aphthosis or previous vulvar ulcers had occurred, symptoms at the time of presentation, description of ulcer, laboratory studies including serologies, blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and biopsy results.
RESULTS: Despite multiple evaluations, no patient had a specific medical cause identified to account for their vulvar ulcerations. None were diagnosed with Behcet's syndrome. Seven had bilateral vulvar ulcerations, which we attribute to the practice of wearing tightly fitted pants or polyester underwear frequently. No recurrences were documented in 6 months follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Girls with vulvar ulcerations who have deny being sexually active should be thoroughly evaluated for infections, Behcet's disease, and other health problems, but, in addition, should be questioned about use of tight-fitting clothing in the perineal area. We hypothesize that chronic irritation because of tight clothing may play a role in causing vulvar ulcerations in this setting."
19840534,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19840534/,"OBJECTIVE: To report 3 cases of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) focussing on the time course of clinical symptoms after exposure to gadolinium based contrast agents (GBCA) and to discuss pharmacokinetic aspects of commercially available GBCA. PATIENTS' DETAILS: All 3 patients (2 men, 1 woman, aged 51 - 54 years) suffered from end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and were on long-term dialysis. Linear GBCA compounds were given to all patients and NSF symptoms started 6 months, 1 and 4 years after the last GBCA exposure. In 2 patients, GBCA was administered after the occurrence of (unrecognized) NSF symptoms leading to worsening of clinical courses. 1 of the patients received multiple therapies (e.g. UV-A1 treatment, physical therapy) without significant improvement, 2 patients died from cardiac complications shortly after the diagnosis of NSF.
CONCLUSION: NSF may develop after a longer period of time than generally reported and GBCA administration may aggravate or accelerate chronic, subclinical NSF symptoms."
19840585,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19840585/,"BACKGROUND: The impact of personality disorders (PD) on the course of depression has been gaining interest among clinical researchers over the past decade. Recent observational studies have found that PD was associated with impaired social functioning and reduced likelihood of depression recovery. Elevated rates of PD have been noted in early-onset and chronic forms subtypes of depression. However, scant data exist regarding the link between PD and outcome for this depression subtype.
METHODS: The National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions database was analyzed. This survey included 43 093 respondents, 18 years and older, conducted in 2001 through 2002. Logistic regression was used to identify demographic and clinical predictors of remission in early-onset chronic depression.
RESULTS: The absence of PD, having more years of education, and being married considerably improved the likelihood of remission. Paranoid personality disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder were the only specific PD found to be associated with a reduced probability of remission.
LIMITATIONS: Depression remission status may have biased the recollection of PD symptoms. Borderline personality disorder, narcissistic personality disorder, and schizotypal personality disorder were not assessed.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that PD are significant predictors of remission in early-onset chronic depression."
19840593,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19840593/,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies found that depression is associated with a broad impairment in quality of life (QOL). This finding might be associated to a measurement overlap.
METHODS: The objective of this study was to verify whether the items of the World Health Organization Quality of Life Instrument-Abbreviated version (WHOQOL-BREF), a measure of generic QOL, are invariant among patients having a current major depressive episode who come from primary care services. We investigated data from primary care services from the 6 countries (Australia, Brazil, Israel, Russia, Spain, and the United States) involved in the baseline sample of the Longitudinal Investigation of Depression Outcomes. The Rasch model was used to analyze items exhibiting differential item functioning (DIF) as a way of assessing invariance in relation to a depression factor defined by the diagnosis of depression using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. In addition, the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) score was correlated with the item and domain scores of the WHOQOL-BREF using the Pearson coefficient.
RESULTS: The sample consisted of 2359 subjects, of which 1193 had a confirmed diagnosis of a current major depressive episode. Of the 26 items of the WHOQOL-BREF, 11 showed DIF due to the depression factor, and the physical domain presented more items displaying DIF. All Pearson coefficients between the WHOQOL-BREF item and domain scores and the CES-D score were weak and moderate (r = -0.13 to r = 0.43).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that most WHOQOL-BREF items do not exhibit DIF for a current major depressive episode and the variance associated with depression in this generic QOL measure is restricted to some facets of this construct. Thus, we recommend this restricted adjustment for depression in future analyses of this measure. Furthermore, our study indicates that researchers must measure QOL regardless of depression severity."
19841004,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19841004/,"BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined factors associated with the actual use of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine since licensure in 2006. The aims of this study were to assess HPV vaccination rates and to examine whether knowledge and risk perceptions regarding HPV were associated with the reported use of the HPV vaccine among female college students.
METHODS: Using a cross-sectional design, 406 women aged 18-26 years were recruited at two public universities and completed a self-administered survey. Respondents who reported having received at least one dose of HPV vaccine were classified as 'vaccinated' (n=177, 43.6%). Responses, stratified by the receipt of HPV vaccine, were compared using descriptive statistics and multivariate models.
RESULTS: Based on multivariate logistic regression modelling, 18-year-old women were approximately four times more likely to report use of the HPV vaccine compared with respondents aged 19-26 years. Respondents who correctly indicated that HPV caused genital warts were 1.85 times more likely (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.85, 95% CI 1.20 to 2.93) to have received at least one HPV vaccine. African American and Asian women were each less likely to be vaccinated compared with white women. Risk perception was not significantly associated with vaccine uptake, however, the majority of respondents failed accurately to recognise their high risk of both acquiring and transmitting HPV.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest knowledge deficits and misperceptions about HPV risk as potential themes for educational campaigns encouraging the greater use of the preventive HPV vaccine among this subgroup."
19841100,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19841100/,"OBJECTIVE: Patients with T1G3 bladder cancer are at high risk of progression to muscle-invasive cancer, and early cystectomy is considered as a treatment option in this particular situation. On the other hand, understaging of T1G3 bladder cancer has been gradually proven as second or repeat transurethral resection (TUR) has been widely applied. To evaluate the real rate of progression, we investigated the prognosis of T1G3 bladder cancer in which a muscle layer was histologically confirmed in the TUR specimens.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 48 patients with primary T1G3 bladder cancer in which a muscle layer in the TUR specimens was confirmed between 1990 and 2006 in our institute. We investigated recurrence and progression in 45 patients, excluding 3 who were immediately treated with radical cystectomy. Fifteen and 12 patients received intravesical treatment with bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) and anticancer agents just after TUR, respectively. The remaining 18 did not have any such treatment.
RESULTS: Recurrence and progression were observed in 21 (47%) and 3 patients (6.7%), respectively, during a median follow-up period of 42.1 months. The 3-year recurrence-free and progression-free survival rates were 54% and 91%, respectively. No significant differences were observed in the rates between the patients with and without BCG treatment in the study.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a possibility that the progression rate in patients with T1G3 bladder cancer is not as high as previously reported when only patients whose muscle layer was histologically confirmed were analyzed. An adequate technique for TUR that unmistakably collects the muscle layer may be important to predict the outcome accurately."
19841112,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19841112/,"OBJECTIVE: We examined whether an association between preterm birth and risk of autistic disorders could be explained by pregnancy complications or neonatal morbidity.
METHODS: This Swedish, population-based, case-control study included 1216 case subjects with autistic disorders who were born between 1987 and 2002 and 6080 control subjects who were matched with respect to gender, birth year, and birth hospital. We assessed associations between gestational age and autistic disorders and adjusted for maternal, birth, and neonatal characteristics. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: Compared with infants born at term, the unadjusted ORs for autistic disorders among very and moderately preterm infants were 2.05 [95% CI: 1.26-3.34] and 1.55 [95% CI: 1.22-1.96], respectively. When we controlled for maternal, pregnancy, and birth characteristics, ORs were reduced to 1.48 [95% CI: 0.77-2.84] and 1.33 [95% CI: 0.98-1.81], respectively. When we also controlled for neonatal complications, ORs were 0.98 [95% CI: 0.45-2.16] and 1.25 [95% CI: 0.90-1.75], respectively. Reductions in risks of autistic disorders related to preterm birth were primarily attributable to preeclampsia, small-for-gestational age birth, congenital malformations, low Apgar scores at 5 minutes, and intracranial bleeding, cerebral edema, or seizures in the neonatal period. Neonatal hypoglycemia, respiratory distress, and neonatal jaundice were associated with increased risk of autistic disorders for term but not preterm infants.
CONCLUSION: The increased risk of autistic disorders related to preterm birth is mediated primarily by prenatal and neonatal complications that occur more commonly among preterm infants."
19841360,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19841360/,"HYPOTHESIS: Pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in trauma are related.
DESIGN: Retrospective review of medical records.
SETTING: Academic level I trauma center.
PATIENTS: Trauma patients who underwent computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) with computed tomographic venography (CTV) of the pelvic and proximal lower extremity veins over a 3-year period (January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2006) were reviewed. Data on demographics, injury type and severity, imaging findings, hospital length of stay, and mortality were collected.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pulmonary embolism and DVT.
RESULTS: Among 247 trauma patients undergoing CTPA/CTV, PE was diagnosed in 46 (19%) and DVT in 18 (7%). Eighteen PEs were central (main or lobar pulmonary arteries), and 28 PEs were peripheral (segmental or subsegmental branches). Pulmonary embolism occurred within the first week of injury in two-thirds of patients. Seven patients with PE (4 femoral, 2 popliteal, and 1 iliac) had DVT. Pulmonary embolism was central in 5 patients and peripheral in 2 patients. No significant differences were noted in any of the examined variables between patients with PE having DVT and those not having DVT.
CONCLUSIONS: Few patients with PE have DVT of the pelvic or proximal lower extremity veins. Pulmonary embolism may not originate from these veins, as commonly believed, but instead may occur de novo in the lungs. These findings have implications for thromboprophylaxis and, particularly, the value of vena cava filters."
19841988,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19841988/,"INTRODUCTION: Superselective mesenteric embolization is effective in arresting colonic diverticular hemorrhage with minimal complications, but long-term results are lacking. We aimed to review the short- and long-term outcome of superselective embolization in arresting colonic diverticular hemorrhage in an Asian population.
METHODS: A retrospective review of all patients who underwent superselective embolization for bleeding colonic diverticula from December 2000 to March 2009 was performed. These cases were drawn from a database of embolization for active gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Short-term outcomes (< or =30 days from procedure) identified included rebleeding, ischemia, or any further intervention for any of these two complications. Readmission for rebleeding and/or definitive surgery after 30 days (long-term outcome) was also documented.
RESULTS: Twenty-three patients, median age 65 years (range 41-79 years), formed the study group. Nineteen (82.6%) patients had active hemorrhage from right colonic diverticula while four (17.4%) had left-sided diverticular bleeding. Technical success was achieved in all 23 (100%) patients. SHORT-TERM OUTCOME: Five (21.7%) patients rebled within the same admission, and all underwent surgery. One patient perished from ensuing anastomotic dehiscence and septic shock and accounted for the only mortality (4.3%) in our series. There was no patient with ischemic complications. Another two (8.7%) patients underwent elective surgical resection on the advice of their surgeons in the absence of rebleeding. LONG-TERM OUTCOME: The median follow-up was 40 months (5-99 months). Of the remaining 16 (69.6%) patients for whom the procedure was definitive initially, four (25.0%) rebled within 2 years from the primary procedure, and elective surgery was performed in one of them. Another had repeat embolization, while the other two were successfully managed conservatively. These three patients refused surgical intervention. One patient was lost to follow-up, and the remaining 11 patients had no further complications.
CONCLUSION: Superselective embolization for active colonic diverticular hemorrhage is safe and effective and should be considered as a first line treatment if possible and available. The procedure could act as a bridge to a subsequent more definitive elective surgery or be definitive as seen in over 50% of our patients over a period of 40 months."

PARTICIPANTS: Three thousand eight hundred and ninety-nine Latino (18-years or older) participants of the Pew Hispanic Center/Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Hispanic/Latino Health survey from the 48 contiguous United States.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional, stratified, random sample telephone interviews.
METHODS: Self-reported healthcare service use was examined in regression models that included a past-year USHC as the main predictor of diabetes awareness and knowledge. Anderson model predisposing and enabling factors were included in additional statistical models.
RESULTS: Significant differences in USHC between Latino groups were found with Mexican Americans having the lowest rates (59.7%). USHC was associated with significantly higher diabetes awareness and knowledge (OR=1.24; 95%CI=1.05-1.46) after accounting for important healthcare access factors. Men were significantly (OR=0.64; 95%CI=0.52-0.75) less informed about diabetes than women.
CONCLUSION: We found important and previously unreported differences between Latinos with a current USHC provider, where the predominant group, Mexican Americans, are the least likely to have access to a USHC. USHC was associated with Latinos being better informed about diabetes; however, socioeconomic barriers limit the availability of this potentially valuable tool for reducing the risks and burden of diabetes, which is a major public health problem facing Latinos."

SETTING: Ambulatory care setting.
PRACTICE DESCRIPTION: A pharmacy faculty member serves as an ambulatory care preceptor for students at a cardiac rehabilitation and wellness center on the campus of St. Joseph's Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia. Pharmacy services include patient case reviews, consultations, patient education, and therapeutic recommendations.
PRACTICE INNOVATION: As part of the advanced practice experience, students are responsible for monitoring drug therapy regimens and conducting medication reconciliations. A literature review of primary sources and education databases was conducted to report cognitive adverse drug reactions associated with cardiac drugs in selective electronic tertiary sources.
MAIN OUTCOMES: Documentation of cognitive dysfunction associated with drugs used to treat CVD.
RESULTS: Drugs used to treat CVD may be associated with adverse drug effects including short-term memory loss, amnesia, confusion, decreased mental acuity, and impaired concentration.
CONCLUSION: Pharmacists providing consultation in the cardiac rehabilitation setting can provide insight into medications that can contribute to cognitive dysfunction."

METHODS: Umbilical artery blood gas analysis (pH, pO(2), pCO(2), BE) and umbilical vein EPO and IL-6 levels were measured in 202 infants from normal, histological, and no clinical CA and histological plus clinical CA pregnancies.
RESULTS: Umbilical artery blood gas analyses were not different between normal controls and histological and clinical CA groups. Blanc Stage 1 histological CA had no abnormal EPO or IL-6 umbilical blood results. EPO in umbilical venous blood was elevated only in those infants with both histological and clinical CA. Umbilical vein IL-6 levels were elevated in all advanced microscopic and clinical CA. High and low EPO groups also have corresponding high and low IL-6 levels suggesting a common stimulus for these substances.
CONCLUSIONS: Blanc stage I histological CA is probably clinically insignificant. CA is infrequently associated with abnormal umbilical artery blood gas levels. Advanced histological and clinical CA can elevate both EPO and IL-6 in umbilical blood and these may be key elements of mechanisms that effect fetal brain function."
19843329,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19843329/,"BACKGROUND: How photosynthetic organelles, or plastids, were acquired by diverse eukaryotes is among the most hotly debated topics in broad scale eukaryotic evolution. The history of plastid endosymbioses commonly is interpreted under the ""chromalveolate"" hypothesis, which requires numerous plastid losses from certain heterotrophic groups that now are entirely aplastidic. In this context, discoveries of putatively algal genes in plastid-lacking protists have been cited as evidence of gene transfer from a photosynthetic endosymbiont that subsequently was lost completely. Here we examine this evidence, as it pertains to the chromalveolate hypothesis, through genome-level statistical analyses of similarity scores from queries with two diatoms, Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Thalassiosira pseudonana, and two aplastidic sister taxa, Phytophthora ramorum and P. sojae.
RESULTS: Contingency tests of specific predictions of the chromalveolate model find no evidence for an unusual red algal contribution to Phytophthora genomes, nor that putative cyanobacterial sequences that are present entered these genomes through a red algal endosymbiosis. Examination of genes unrelated to plastid function provide extraordinarily significant support for both of these predictions in diatoms, the control group where a red endosymbiosis is known to have occurred, but none of that support is present in genes specifically conserved between diatoms and oomycetes. In addition, we uncovered a strong association between overall sequence similarities among taxa and relative sizes of genomic data sets in numbers of genes.
CONCLUSION: Signal from ""algal"" genes in oomycete genomes is inconsistent with the chromalveolate hypothesis, and better explained by alternative models of sequence and genome evolution. Combined with the numerous sources of intragenomic phylogenetic conflict characterized previously, our results underscore the potential to be mislead by a posteriori interpretations of variable phylogenetic signals contained in complex genome-level data. They argue strongly for explicit testing of the different a priori assumptions inherent in competing evolutionary hypotheses."
19843639,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19843639/,"OBJECTIVE: To examine if telephones overcome geographical barriers to accessing primary care out-of-hours by parents of young children.
METHODS: Mixed methods including quantitative analysis of 5697 calls about children aged 0-4 years, 30 hours of observation at primary care centres, eight interviews with parents and a review of 80 telephone call recordings.
RESULTS: Call rates for children (0-4 years) decreased with increasing distance: the 20% of people who lived furthest from a primary care centre made fewer calls, 570 per 1000 patients/year (95% CI 558 to 582) than the 20% living closest, 652 (95% CI 644 to 661). Overall, call rates decreased with increasing rurality. Qualitative analysis suggested that this geographical variation was linked to familiarity with the system (notably previous contact with health services) and the availability of services, legitimacy of demand (particularly for children) and negotiation about mode of care.
CONCLUSIONS: People already disadvantaged by their distance from facilities or socioeconomic circumstances may continue to be at a disadvantage when services are provided by telephone."
19843727,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19843727/,"OBJECTIVE: Adopting a longitudinal approach to assess women after breast biopsy with a benign result, this study aimed to comparatively evaluate the effect of the biopsy method on compliance with clinical recommendations for follow-up.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: For this study, 410 patients who underwent biopsy of a breast lesion were included: fine-needle aspiration biopsy, n = 95 patients; core biopsy, n = 84; local excision under local anesthesia, n = 72; vacuum-assisted breast biopsy, n = 100; and hookwire localization, n = 59. Information about patient age, place of residence, whether complications occurred, and type of lesion was collected.
RESULTS: Compliance was higher among women who had undergone vacuum-assisted breast biopsy than those who had undergone one of the other biopsy methods. The superiority (carryover effect) of vacuum-assisted breast biopsy persisted for 18 months after the biopsy procedure. Patient compliance for all of the other biopsy methods followed an M pattern, with the peaks corresponding to the follow-up mammography sessions. In patients who had undergone vacuum-assisted breast biopsy, a gradual decrease in compliance over time was observed. Older women were more compliant than younger women with follow-up recommendations regardless of biopsy method. A subanalysis of the vacuum-assisted breast biopsy group indicated that complications are associated with better compliance.
CONCLUSION: Women more often adhere to clinical recommendations for follow-up sessions comprising mammography. Patient age and whether biopsy complications occurred also seem to modify compliance. Further studies should assess whether superior compliance after vacuum-assisted breast biopsy persists in other settings, such as with stereotactic or ultrasound guidance, different numbers of cores, and procedures of various durations."
19843841,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19843841/,"BACKGROUND: Community pharmacy has long been advocated as an appropriate gateway of supply for nonprescription medicines and health-related advice. Consumers sometimes self-treat the symptoms of minor illness, yet there is conflicting evidence over their ability to do so properly. Emerging trends also suggest a variable approach to nonprescription medicine supply by pharmacy staff. Understanding of this is limited and more structured exploration is needed.
OBJECTIVE: To explore variation in pharmacy staff response to requests for nonprescription medicines from different legislative schedules through analysis of data collected using pseudo-patient methods.
METHODS: Consumers posed as pharmacy patrons (ie, pseudo-patients, simulated patients) and requested 1 of 3 specific nonprescription medicines by name. Two of these, ibuprofen and a branded cold and flu medication, could be sold by any pharmacy staff member (these were considered Pharmacy Medicine). The third, a combination analgesic containing paracetamol (acetaminophen), codeine, and doxylamine, required pharmacist involvement in the sale (considered Pharmacist Only Medicine). Pseudo-patient visits measured the service provided in each pharmacy by observing whether staff performed particular behaviors such as providing advice regarding the drugs.
RESULTS: Staff response was generally superior when pseudo-patients requested the combination analgesic that required pharmacist intervention. Medicine advice was provided verbally to 84.9% of pseudo-patients requesting this analgesic compared with 51.1% of those requesting the cold and flu medication. Similar trends were observed for other behaviors.
CONCLUSIONS: Emerging patterns imply that pharmacy staff response may vary according to the medicine requested. It may be that pharmacists and their staff prioritize drugs or behaviors that they consider critically relevant as part of a risk management approach. This has possible implications for future scheduling policy. Further research using a range of scenarios would more fully explore the breadth of such behavior. This would aid identification of medicines that trigger professional intervention and inform development of targeted training programs."
19844200,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19844200/,"OBJECTIVES: Impaired intestinal permeability (IP) may have a role in the pathogenesis of ascites and in spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in patients with liver cirrhosis (LC). The aim of this study was to assess IP in LC patients with respect to healthy controls.
METHODS: IP was evaluated by the (51)Cr-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ((51)Cr-EDTA) permeability test in 52 LC patients and in 48 sex- and age-matched controls. The presence of (51)Cr-EDTA was also evaluated in ascitic fluid after therapeutic paracentesis in all LC patients with ascites.
RESULTS: An altered IP was found in 45% of LC patients compared with 4% of controls (P<0.00001). IP impairment was significantly associated with Child-Pugh status (75% of Child C patients vs. 39% of Child B and 22% of Child A patients), with the presence of ascites (60% in ascitic patients vs. 31% in nonascitic patients), and with a history of SBP (100% of patients with SBP vs. 50% of those without SBP). (51)Cr-EDTA was present in all ascitic samples obtained from patients with SBP compared with 22% of patients without SBP.
CONCLUSIONS: IP derangement was a common finding in LC, especially in patients with more advanced disease (presence of ascites and history of SBP). The presence of (51)Cr-EDTA in ascites in patients with SBP suggests an altered permeability of splancnic vessels and/or peritoneal membranes. Further studies are required to assess (51)Cr-EDTA urine and ascite cutoffs to set up SBP preventive strategies."
19844653,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19844653/,"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: We often encounter unresectable pancreatic cancer due to invasions of the major vessels. Vascular resection for locally advanced pancreatic cancers has an advantage in en block local resection. There are potential cases in which good outcomes can be achieved by arterial resection.
METHODS: Pancreatectomy (including total pancreatectomy in 15 cases, pancreatoduodenectomy in 7 cases and distal pancreatectomy in one case) was performed in 23 cases of invasive ductal carcinoma of the pancreas, in combination with resection and reconstruction of the hepatic artery in 15 cases, the superior mesenteric artery in 12 cases (there are overlaps) and the portal vein in 20 cases.
RESULTS: The median operating time was 686 min (416-1,190 min) and the median blood loss was 2,830 ml (440-19,800 ml). This shows that the surgery was highly-invasive. The operative mortality rate was 4.3%. On the basis of the UICC classification, there were 2 cases of Stage IIa, 4 cases of Stage IIb, 9 cases of Stage III, 8 cases of Stage IV, while there were 18 cases (78.3%) of R0 resection. On the other hand, the final histological findings showed that there were 8 cases (34.8%) of M1 (liver and non-regional lymph node metastases), so it is thought that decisions on operative indications should be not be made slightly. As for the overall survival rate, the 1-year survival rate was 51.2% and the 3-year survival rate was 23.1% while the median survival time (MST) was 12 months. As for 15 cases of M0, the 1-year survival rate was 61.9% and the 4-year survival rate was 38.7% while the MST was 16 months. On the other hand, the MST was poor (10 months) in 8 cases of M1, showing that a statistically significant difference was observed depending upon the degree of metastasis (log-rank P = 0.0409). In 18 cases of R0, the 1-year survival rate was 67.2%, the 4-year survival rate 30.2% and the MST 13 months, respectively, while in 5 cases of R1 and R2, the MST was 6 months, showing that there was a statistically significant difference between R0 cases and R1, R2 cases (log-rank P = 0.0002).
CONCLUSIONS: Further discussion is required concerning surgical indications and significance. However, it is thought that resection is useful only when surgery of R0 has taken place for selected locally advanced pancreatic cancer (M0)."
19845423,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19845423/,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the extent to which excluding physicians from a preferred provider organization (PPO) network causes patients to discontinue using their services and whether the associated changes will result in greater demand for emergency department or inpatient care.
STUDY DESIGN: Analysis of a natural experiment involving the narrowing of a PPO network operated by the Taft-Hartley Fund. The panel data analysis compared rates of patient discontinuation for excluded physicians before and after the change. The pre-post analysis used matched comparison groups for office visits, emergency department visits, inpatient admissions, and spending for affected patients.
METHODS: Claims data analysis used generalized estimating equations and controlled for patient age, sex, health status, and hourly wage. Models examining utilization and spending for 6187 patients who remained with excluded physicians also used a propensity score-matched comparison group identified from among patients who had never seen an excluded physician. Differential response to physician exclusion according to age, health status, and hourly wage was also examined through interaction terms.
RESULTS: The network narrowing reduced the odds of continuing to see an excluded physician (odds ratio, 0.18; P <.001). Patients who continued to see excluded physicians reduced their office visits by a mean of 0.9 visits per year, 0.8 visits more than comparison patients (P <.001). There were no significant changes in emergency department visits or admissions for patients of excluded physicians compared with a matched cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: Substantial copayment differentials may be an effective means of encouraging patients to change physicians. Where they are based on reliable information about provider quality and cost, tiered networks may improve value."
19845711,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19845711/,"OBJECTIVES: To determine whether there is a socioeconomic status (SES) disparity in caries experience (i.e., DMFT) in an adolescent sample from Pennsylvania and to determine whether differences in oral hygiene behaviors and preventive interventions account for this disparity.
METHODS: A cross-sectional clinical assessment was conducted on a representative sample of 9th grade and 11th grade students across Pennsylvania. These students also completed a brief questionnaire regarding their oral hygiene behaviors. From this group of students, a random subsample of 530 parents completed a questionnaire assessing SES, fluoride exposure, and recency of receipt of dental services. DMFT was examined at two thresholds of severity: simple prevalence (DMFT > 0) and severe caries (DMFT > 3).
RESULTS: Using structural equation modeling, we found that lower SES was associated with higher prevalence of DMFT and higher prevalence of severe caries. Although lower SES was associated with lower rates of brushing, less use of sealants, and less recent receipt of dental services, these oral health behaviors and preventive interventions did not account for the disparities in DMFT defined by SES.
CONCLUSIONS: There is an SES gradient in caries experience in adolescents in Pennsylvania. Disparities in caries experience, however, cannot be accounted for by SES-associated differences in brushing, flossing, sealant use, fluoride exposure, or recency of use of dental services. To facilitate the design of preventive interventions, future research should determine the pathways through which SES-associated disparities occur."
19845840,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19845840/,"AIM: Children in out-of-home care have high and frequently unidentified health needs. The Child Protection Unit at Sydney Children's Hospital offers comprehensive health screening to children in care. Recommendations for remediation are made, but follow-up in the clinic is not offered. Current research has failed to establish whether health screening results in health benefits for the children screened. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of the health screening clinic on children's health outcomes by tracking the first 100 children screened, determining how many of the health recommendations made for each child had been implemented and, if possible, what the health outcome had been.
METHODS: Research questionnaires were sent to the Department of Social Services caseworkers of the first 100 children screened.
RESULTS: Adherence to health recommendations was high; however, it was not possible to quantify the degree of health benefit to the children screened. A number of systemic problems were identified, which are likely to hinder the accessibility of health care for children in care.
CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive health screening of children in care is likely to benefit a child's health, although this could not be determined. Agencies responsible for placing children in care need systems in place to ensure better inter-agency collaboration between the health system and community services. This should help improve health outcomes."
19846052,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19846052/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether multivitamin supplements modify the relationship between alcohol consumption during pregnancy and the risk of miscarriage.
STUDY DESIGN: We used data from a population-based cohort study of pregnant women (n=1061; response rate=39%). Participants were asked about their alcohol consumption and vitamin intake during pregnancy.
RESULTS: Among multivitamin nonusers, women who drank alcohol during their pregnancy were more likely to have a miscarriage compared with women who abstained (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.67; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-2.69). However, among multivitamin users, there was no difference in the risk of miscarriage between alcohol consumers and abstainers. Results suggest the volume of alcohol as well as the timing of multivitamin supplementation may also be important.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that a woman of childbearing years might decrease her risk of miscarriage associated with alcohol intake by taking multivitamin supplements. However, our findings should be interpreted with caution and future research replicating these findings is necessary."
19846211,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19846211/,"OBJECTIVES: Primary: To investigate whether S-LPS could contribute to a better identification of patients to submit to IDS. Secondary: To identify the most appropriate level of laparoscopic index value (PIV) to identify inoperable patients in this subset of patients.
METHODS: A prospective single-institutional study including patients with advanced ovarian/peritoneal cancer (FIGO stage IIIC-IV) to be submitted to IDS after NACT. Patients have been considered eligible for surgical exploration in case of complete/partial radiological or serological response; stable disease if primary surgery had been performed in a different hospital; progressive radiological disease in the presence of serological response, young age, and good performance status (ECOG <1); and progressive serological disease with stable clinical and radiological disease. A laparoscopic assessment for each patient has been performed.
RESULTS: Ninety-eight consecutive AOC patients submitted to NACT have been eligible for the study. With the addition of S-LPS to the RECIST criteria, a surgical exploration is performed in all patients and the percentage of explorative laparotomies drops to about 10%. The use of S-LPS after the GCIG criteria can reduce the risk of both explorative laparotomies from 30% to 13%, and inappropriate unexplorations from 18% to 0%. Moreover, at a PIV >4 the probability of optimally resecting the disease at laparotomy is equal to 0.
CONCLUSIONS: Present data suggest that S-LPS can play a relevant role to discriminate patients with partially/stable disease or referred from other Institutions after NACT, which can be susceptible of successful IDS."
19846323,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19846323/,"OBJECTIVES: Aneurysm formation in Behcet's disease (BD) rarely involves extracranial carotid arteries. We report our experience of the management of extracranial carotid artery aneurysms (ECAAs) in BD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data of patients with Behcet ECAAs presenting from 1997 to 2008 were retrospectively collected focusing on the different treatment modalities, the indications for each modality and the outcome.
RESULTS: Twelve Behcet ECAAs were managed. Seven underwent ligation of the carotid artery, where the stump pressure exceeded 70 mmHg. The remaining five patients underwent vascular reconstruction: either excision and reconstruction by an autogenous vein interposition graft (n=3), excision and end-to-end anastomosis (n=1), or direct suture of a small rent in the artery (n=1). There were no perioperative mortalities or major strokes. There was one recurrent laryngeal nerve injury and one hematoma. There was one aneurysm recurrence, which was managed by ligation and resulted in a minor stroke.
CONCLUSION: Surgical repair in Behcet ECAAs should be performed with special precautions in order to prevent anastomotic pseudoaneurysm formation. Ligation can be performed when the anatomical and/or pathological circumstances are not favourable, provided that the stump pressure is adequate to maintain cerebral perfusion."
19846420,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19846420/,"OBJECTIVE: To analyse risk factors in alpine skiing.
DESIGN: A controlled multicentre survey of injured and non-injured alpine skiers.
SETTING: One tertiary and two secondary trauma centres in Bern, Switzerland.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: All injured skiers admitted from November 2007 to April 2008 were analysed using a completed questionnaire incorporating 15 parameters. The same questionnaire was distributed to non-injured controls. Multiple logistic regression was performed. Patterns of combined risk factors were calculated by inference trees. A total of 782 patients and 496 controls were interviewed.
RESULTS: Parameters that were significant for the patients were: high readiness for risk (p = 0.0365, OR 1.84, 95% CI 1.04 to 3.27); low readiness for speed (p = 0.0008, OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.60); no aggressive behaviour on slopes (p<0.0001, OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.37); new skiing equipment (p = 0.0228, OR 59, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.93); warm-up performed (p = 0.0015, OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.25 to 2.57); old snow compared with fresh snow (p = 0.0155, OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.80); old snow compared with artificial snow (p = 0.0037, OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.60); powder snow compared with slushy snow (p = 0.0035, OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.63); drug consumption (p = 0.0044, OR 5.92, 95% CI 1.74 to 20.11); and alcohol abstinence (p<0.0001, OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.34). Three groups at risk were detected: (1) warm-up 3-12 min, visual analogue scale (VAS)(speed) >4 and bad weather/visibility; (2) VAS(speed) 4-7, icy slopes and not wearing a helmet; (3) warm-up >12 min and new skiing equipment.
CONCLUSIONS: Low speed, high readiness for risk, new skiing equipment, old and powder snow, and drug consumption are significant risk factors when skiing. Future work should aim to identify more precisely specific groups at risk and develop recommendations--for example, a snow weather index at valley stations."
19846585,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19846585/,"AIMS: The aims of this study were to analyse the perceptions of female and male primary care physicians (PCPs) of alcohol problems in male and female patients, their recommendations to reduce or abstain from alcohol, their referrals to treatment and their views of safe levels of drinking for male and female patients. These factors were related to the physicians' own alcohol consumption.
METHODS: A slightly adjusted version of the WHO Collaborative Study Questionnaire for General Practitioners was posted to all PCPs (n = 132) in the district of Skaraborg, Sweden, of whom 68 PCPs responded. In the questionnaire, the PCPs' perceptions of two patient vignettes were analysed.
RESULTS: Both the gender of the patients in the vignettes and of the PCPs influenced the advice and the referrals that the patients received: 83% of male excessive drinkers and 47% of female excessive drinkers were recommended to cut down on drinking. In 50% of cases, the male excessive drinker was not referred, compared with 25% for the female excessive drinker. This was statistically significant only for excessive drinkers. The odds ratio for referral to any treatment was 0.33 (CI = 0.12-0.93) for the male excessive drinker compared with the female excessive drinker. The male PCP referred the excessive drinker less often to any treatment than did the female PCP, odds ratio 0.26 (CI = 0.08-0.90). The upper limit of alcohol consumption before the PCPs would advise the patient to cut down was significantly higher for PCPs with the AUDIT-C score >or= 3. The limit was 146 g/week for male patients and 103 g/week for female patients. Corresponding figures for PCP with the AUDIT-C score <or= 2 were 89 and 68 g/week.
CONCLUSION: Male patients were less likely to be advised to stop drinking altogether than female patients and were less likely to be referred, according to this vignette study. Taking into account that male patients have a higher prevalence of alcohol problems, this may be of considerable importance for men's health outcomes. Implications of these findings are the need to increase awareness of male excessive drinking and that gendered perceptions might bias alcohol management recommendations."
19847137,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19847137/,"INTRODUCTION: Hyperglycemia in sepsis is managed by intensive insulin therapy, which can cause hypoglycemia.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate the glycemic profile as well as safety and effectiveness of a nurse-controlled insulin therapy protocol in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 16 septic patients who died (nonsurvivors) and 61 septic patients who survived. Glycemia was measured every 4 h, and the dose of insulin infusion was adjusted to maintain glycemia of 4.4 mmol/l to 8.3 mmol/l. We analyzed glycemia levels and daily variations, insulin dose, episodes of hypo- and hyperglycemia.
RESULTS: Nonsurvivors and survivors had similar mean glycemia levels (7.38 vs. 7.08 mmol/l; p = 0.20) and insulin requirements (median [Me] = 26.9 vs. 23.9 units/d; p = 0.22; Me = 1.7 vs. 1.4 units/h; p = 0.25). Daily glycemia variation (Me = 4.81 vs. 3.03 mmol/l; p <0.001), episodes of hypoglycemia (18.8% vs. 3.3%; p = 0.02), spontaneous severe hypoglycemia (12.5% vs. 0%; p = 0.006) and hyperglycemia (75.0% vs. 45.9%; p = 0.04) were higher and more frequent in nonsurvivors. Three of 5393 blood samples (0.05%) met severe insulin-induced hypoglycemia criteria, and 74.4% of samples met the recommended range of 4.4-8.3 mmol/l.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients who died experienced more episodes of hyperglycemia, spontaneous hypoglycemia and greater variation in the daily glycemia level. Daily glycemia variation is more reliable than a mean glycemic level in evaluating glucose homeostasis in septic patients. Few episodes of severe insulin-induced hypoglycemia occurred while using the nurse-controlled insulin therapy protocol."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The medical records of patients referred for PSI during the time period from 1990 to 2005 were retrospectively reviewed. We compared the three most common planning techniques (two parallel opposing, single direct field, anterior and lateral fields).
RESULTS: Eighteen patients who received PSI were identified. Thirteen patients were diagnosed as CML and 5 as CLL. The mean age of the patients was 44 (+/-16) years and the majority were men (60%). Spleen enlargement was documented in all cases. The single direct anterior field was the most commonly used technique. The dose per fraction ranged from 25 cGy to 100 cGy. The total dose ranged from 125 cGy to 1200 cGy and the median was 200 cGy (mean 327 cGy). There was no significant difference between CML and CLL patients regarding the dose level. Three out of 5 CLL patients and only one out of 13 CML patients received re-irradiation. All patients showed subjective improvement regarding pain and swelling. There was a significant increase in the hemoglobin level and a significant decrease in the WBC count. The single direct field shows variations in the dose from 56 to 102%; however, it is the simplest and the best regarding the dose to the surrounding normal tissues especially the kidney and the liver.
CONCLUSION: PSI has a significant palliative benefit. Although the most widely accepted technique is the 2 parallel opposing anterior-posterior fields, single anterior field is also considered as a suitable option. Higher doses are needed for CLL patients compared to CML patients."
19847640,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19847640/,"PURPOSE: This study assessed pregnancy rates and obstetric outcomes in women with premature ovarian failure (Group A) with post-menopausal women > or =40 years (Group B) who had IVF +/- ICSI using donor eggs.
METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of 54 recipients with either premature ovarian failure or physiological menopause undergoing oocyte donation between 2000 and 2007 at Monash IVF.
RESULTS: The average number of stimulated cycles required for a woman in group A and B to deliver a baby was 1.75 and 1.4 respectively. Both groups had high cumulative pregnancy rates; however, there was a statistically significant difference with regards to rates of complications.
CONCLUSION: Oocyte donation in both premature ovarian failure and physiological menopause is highly successful and cumulative pregnancy rate is an important statistic which can be used to inform women seeking this technique. High rates of complications, in conjunction with individual risk-factor analysis needs to be considered when counselling post-menopausal women about oocyte donation."
19847670,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19847670/,"OBJECTIVE: Numerous studies have identified a reduced health-related quality of life (QoL) in patients with urinary incontinence (UI). The aim of this study was to assess and compare QoL in women with UI in the island of Crete, Greece, and in Turkey.
METHODS: Incontinent women from two community-based primary health care (PHC) groups (Greece and Turkey) and one outpatient clinic-based group were studied.
RESULTS: A total of 231 (24.7%) women out of 932 women from the PHC group in Greece and Turkey reported UI whereas another 38 incontinent women visited the secondary care outpatient clinic. Mean Incontinence Quality of Life questionnaire (I-QoL) total score of women visiting PHC centers was 73.8 (SD = 23.5). There was significant difference among the three groups regarding I-QoL total and subscale scores, with women from the Greek community-based group having the highest score (mean = 81.8, SD = 20.7, P < 0.001). Impaired QoL was significantly associated with severity (P < 0.001), incontinence type (P = 0.026), seeking secondary care, and Turkey as sample setting (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Urinary incontinence is a frequent problem for women visiting PHC centers, affecting negatively their quality of life. Besides incontinence severity, Turkey as place of residence emerged as another essential predictor of impaired quality of life, suggesting that other social and cultural factors may also play an important role."
19847722,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19847722/,"OBJECTIVE: Quality of life is a major criterion of the outcome of psychotherapeutic interventions. The concept of quality of life emphasizes patient self-ratings. However, they can be burdensome or inappropriate in some cases. Therefore we have compared self-ratings and clinician-ratings of quality of life.
METHODS: Self- and clinician-ratings of the SF-8 (1-week recall version) were measured from consecutive samples of 1 812 inpatients from eleven psychotherapeutic clinics at admission and at discharge six weeks later. A physical summary score (PSS) and a mental summary score (MSS) were calculated. Pearson product-moment correlations were used.
RESULTS: Self- and clinician-ratings of the PSS correlate r=0.48 at admission and r=0.58 at discharge, of the MSS r=0.46 and r=0.51, respectively. Concerning single items we find the highest correlation for item 4 (bodily pain: r=0.53 and r=0.55), the lowest for item 6 (social functioning: r=0.26 and r=0.30). Change scores of the PSS correlate r=0.20, of the MSS r=0.32. Correlations differ between diagnostic groups: Correlations are low for patients with either schizophrenia (F2), depressive episode (F32) or personality disorder (F60-62), comparatively higher for patients with dysthymia. Comparing correlations across the 11 clinics reveals substantial differences, for the MSS ranging from r=0.38 to r=0.58 at admission and r=0.27 to r=0.68 at discharge.
CONCLUSION: Patient self-ratings of quality of life as a psychotherapeutic outcome measure using the SF-8 Health Survey could not be substituted by clinician-ratings, they should be used as complements."
19847728,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19847728/,"BACKGROUND: Between 50 and 90% of patients in psychosomatic rehabilitation are affected by occupational problems and misdirected stress. The patients often find themselves in a vicious circle in which occupational problems lead to the development of mental illnesses before a background of lacking compensation possibilities and positive resources. Besides, mobbing can be understood as a special form of occupational stress, whereas in former studies, no differences in the magnitude of mental strain were discovered in comparison with rehabilitants who were in a psychosomatic remedial treatment.
PURPOSE: Patients who are in psychosomatic remedial treatment and are norm-aberrantly limited in their occupational efficiency and patients who are affected by mobbing in the job show a higher psychosocial strain than other patients in treatment whose occupational efficiency is not limited. Do mobbing victims more frequently receive a recommendation that measures to strengthen their working life participation be considered?
METHOD: A total of 189 patients were handed out a questionnaire at the beginning of their remedial treatment comprised of questions regarding their mobbing experiences, the IRES-3, the SCL-27, the Fatigue-Scale, the Incongruity questionnaire and the VDS-scale. The sample was split up into a group whose occupational efficiency was limited, a group affected by mobbing, and a group who had no efficiency limitations.
RESULTS: 72.6% were clearly limited in their occupational efficiency. 27.4% felt neither affected in their occupational efficiency nor due to mobbing. 21% of the sample as a whole were affected by mobbing. Patients limited in their occupational efficiency differed neither from patients whose efficiency was unlimited, nor from those who were affected by mobbing. On the other hand, mobbing victims differed in all symptom scales evaluated from patients who had no occupational efficiency limitations. Also the scales on personality styles were substantially increased compared to this group. With mobbing victims it was recommended more often that the possibilities for working life participation measures should be checked.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients in psychosomatic rehabilitation are strongly affected by occupational limitations and have a huge need for counselling and support. Therapy concepts should pick up the occupational problems at hand in a differentiated manner, with job-oriented linked-up rehabilitation being recommended. The increased mental strain of mobbing victims must always be borne in mind."

METHODS: A total of 2431 audiometric tests were performed in 708 workers (in 1979, 1984, 1989, 1994 and 1999). Audiometric tests were classified so that hearing loss could be assessed over time. Additionally, personal noise exposure was measured for each worker (average, 85 dB(A) in tests carried out in 1992, 1996 and 1999).
RESULTS: Over 5 years of noise exposure, mean cumulative incidence of noise-induced hearing loss was 8,2%. Over 10 years ofexposure (1979-89 or 1984-94 or 1989-99), the mean incidence was 15,3%. This percentage increased to 22,9% and 25,7% when the exposure lasted 15 or 20 years respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The considerable incidence of noise-induced hearing loss within the wide group of steel workers examined greatly exceeds the expected incidence related to the occupational exposure limits. The Evidence Based Occupational Medicine suggests that our health surveillance was not effective enough."
19849693,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19849693/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine if preoperative variables, including gender, age and tumour size, influence the decision for active surveillance of renal masses, as due to the increasing detection of incidental renal masses within the ageing population there is a need to identify reliable means of selecting patients who require therapy.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively identified all renal masses resected at our institution between 1 December 1999, and 1 October 2005. The size of tumour, patient age and gender were compared between those with and without malignancy on final pathology. The influence of these variables in predicting malignancy, high grade, and high stage were assessed by univariate and multivariate analysis using logistic regression models, with a significance level of P < 0.05. Subsets were analysed for the groups of patients with tumours of ≤ 3 or > 3 cm and those aged ≤ 75 or > 75 years.
RESULTS: Among 466 of 501 patients with evaluable data, univariate analysis showed that both male gender and increasing size positively predicted malignancy (odds ratio 1.13 and 1.40, respectively), but age, treated as a continuous variable, did not. On multivariate analysis both remained independent predictors of malignancy (odds ratio 1.13 and 1.40, respectively). Size was the only independent predictor of high-stage and high-grade disease on both univariate and multivariate analysis. Among 156 patients with tumours of ≤ 3 cm, on multivariate analysis, male gender was only weakly associated with the risk of malignancy, whereas size remained strongly predictive (odds ratio 1.98, P = 0.076; and 2.16, P = 0.015, respectively). Neither male gender, size nor age increased the risk of high-stage or high-grade disease in this cohort. Patients who were aged > 75 years had a greater risk of high-stage disease than those aged < 75 years (odds ratio 2.64, P = 0.008). On multivariate analysis, age > 75 years remained an independent predictor of malignancy and high-stage, along with size (odds ratio 2.75, P = 0.014; and 1.35, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Increased size of tumour increases the risk of malignancy and the likelihood of high-stage and high-grade disease. Among patients aged > 75 years there was a higher risk of malignancy and high-stage disease than in those aged ≤ 75 years. As such, the decision for observation should not be based upon age alone, and should be approached with caution in patients aged >75 years, particularly for larger lesions."

METHODS: A total of 36 patients diagnosed with frozen shoulder and undergoing hydrodilatation were evaluated. All patients had an initial hydrodilatation and were offered a repeat procedure after 6 weeks. Of the total patients, 22 chose to undergo a repeat procedure. The Shoulder Disability Questionnaire UK Score and Oxford Shoulder Score were used to evaluate pre- and postprocedure outcome. The mean follow up was 15.4 months.
RESULTS: The Oxford Shoulder Score improved by a significant level after both single (30.5-17.1) and repeat hydrodilatation (36.0-21.4). No significant change was observed after either procedure when using the Shoulder Disability Questionnaire UK Score as an outcome measure.
CONCLUSIONS: The data are suggestive that routine hydrodilatation after 6 weeks is not appropriate and should be instead offered to those patients who can tolerate it and who have not fully benefitted after a single procedure."
19849854,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19849854/,"BACKGROUND: Major modifications to the pharyngeal jaw apparatus are widely regarded as a recurring evolutionary key innovation that has enabled adaptive radiation in many species-rich clades of percomorph fishes. However one of the central predictions of this hypothesis, that the acquisition of a modified pharyngeal jaw apparatus will be positively correlated with explosive lineage diversification, has never been tested. We applied comparative methods to a new time-calibrated phylogeny of labrid fishes to test whether diversification rates shifted at two scales where major pharyngeal jaw innovations have evolved: across all of Labridae and within the subclade of parrotfishes.
RESULTS: Diversification patterns within early labrids did not reflect rapid initial radiation. Much of modern labrid diversity stems from two recent rapid diversification events; one within julidine fishes and the other with the origin of the most species-rich clade of reef-associated parrotfishes. A secondary pharyngeal jaw innovation was correlated with rapid diversification within the parrotfishes. However diversification rate shifts within parrotfishes are more strongly correlated with the evolution of extreme dichromatism than with pharyngeal jaw modifications.
CONCLUSION: The temporal lag between pharyngeal jaw modifications and changes in diversification rates casts doubt on the key innovation hypothesis as a simple explanation for much of the richness seen in labrids and scarines. Although the possession of a secondarily modified PJA was correlated with increased diversification rates, this pattern is better explained by the evolution of extreme dichromatism (and other social and behavioral characters relating to sexual selection) within Scarus and Chlorurus. The PJA-innovation hypothesis also fails to explain the most dominant aspect of labrid lineage diversification, the radiation of the julidines. We suggest that pharyngeal jaws might have played a more important role in enabling morphological evolution of the feeding apparatus in labrids and scarines rather than in accelerating lineage diversification."

METHODS: All multiple-owned supermarkets, and a 1 in 8 sample of other food outlets, listed in 1997 and 2007 in the public register of food premises held by Glasgow City Council, Scotland, were visited to establish whether they were trading as foodstores. Postcode sectors in which foodstores were located were classified into least, middling and most deprived neighbourhoods.
RESULTS: In total, 325 listed foodstores were visited in 1997 and 508 in 2007. Of these 87% and 88%, respectively, were trading as foodstores. There was a very slight gradient in validity by deprivation, with validity higher in least deprived neighbourhoods, though this was not statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: There was reasonable, but not perfect, agreement between the list of food premises and field observations, with nearly 1 in 9 of sampled foodstores not present on the ground.

PATIENTS-METHODS: One hundred and three children with community acquired pneumonia who were hospitalised were recruited along with 55 controls.
RESULTS: During hospitalisation wheezing was audible in 11/103 (10.6%) patients with pneumonia and in none of the controls (p=0.009). Wheezing ever or asthma was elicited in 29/103(28%) patients with pneumonia and in 8/55 (14.5%) of the controls and this difference was not significant. Two years after the hospitalisation with pneumonia, wheezing episodes occurred in 12/103 with pneumonia and 1/55 of the controls (p=0.034). Among those who developed asthma following pneumonia 11/12 also had wheezing prior to pneumonia.
CONCLUSION: There is an excess of wheezing prior, during, and after an episode of pneumonia in school aged children and therefore children with pneumonia should be followed up carefully."
19850404,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19850404/,"OBJECTIVE: Although the literature on degenerative disease of the cervical spine contains numerous articles studying the changes on levels adjacent to a fusion, there exist very few such studies concerning cervical spine stabilization for trauma.
METHODS: Over a 16-year period (1989-2005), one hundred and twelve patients underwent stabilization of the lower cervical spine (C3-T1) for subaxial cervical spine injuries, either with an anterior or posterior procedure, or both. Eighty-one patients with adequate follow-up were included in the study and 3 groups were identified: Group A, consisting of 8 patients who underwent anterior stabilization and developed Adjacent Level Ossification Development (ALOD), Group B, comprising 53 patients who were anteriorly plated but who did not develop ALOD and Group C, comprising 20 patients who received posterior stabilization.
RESULTS: Eight out of 61 patients (13.1%) who were anteriorly operated developed ALOD in 11 adjacent levels (Group A). Severe (grade 3) ossification was noted in 6/8 patients at the cranial adjacent level, and in 2/8 patients at the caudal one. Three out of 8 patients presented with early ALOD at 3, 4 and 18 months respectively. Despite the radiographic abnormalities showing ossification, all the patients had an uncomplicated course without symptoms. All the radiographs of Group B and Group C patients demonstrated grade 0 ossification for both the cranial and caudal adjacent levels.
CONCLUSION: Adjacent-level ossification in cervical spine injuries may appear very early in the postoperative period and it can have a different course than in the degenerative disc disease population, at least in some patients. The first cephalad level adjacent to a fusion appears to be at greater risk. However, even when ALOD is evident radiographically, it very rarely produces any symptoms."
19850491,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19850491/,"BACKGROUND: The objective of this investigation was to assess the quality of life (QoL) before and after pulmonary lobectomy in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and to compare these values with a case-matched population of patients with normal respiratory function.
METHODS: This is an observational analysis performed on a prospective dataset of 220 consecutive patients submitted to pulmonary lobectomy for lung cancer (2006-2008). Patients submitted to extended procedures (chest wall resection and superior sulcus) were excluded from the analysis. Pre- and postoperative (3 months) QoL were assessed in all patients through the administration of the Short Form 36v2 (SF36v2) health survey, a generic QoL instrument assessing eight health physical and mental concepts. Propensity score was used to match COPD patients (according to the NHLBI/WHO Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) criteria: forced expiratory volume in 1s/forced expiratory vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) ratio <0.7 and FEV1 <80%) with counterparts without COPD. QoL scales were compared between the two matched groups by means of the Mann-Whitney test.
RESULTS: Propensity score yielded 50 well-matched pairs of patients with and without COPD. Compared with non-COPD patients, those with COPD had a threefold higher rate of cardiopulmonary morbidity (14 cases vs 5 cases, 28% vs 10%, p=0.04), lower reduction in FEV1 (6% vs 13%, p=0.0002), but lower residual postoperative FEV1 values (62% vs 74%, p<0.0001). Postoperative carbon monoxide lung diffusion capacity (DLCO) (69% vs 65%, p=0.1) and VO(2 max) (15.3 ml kg(-1)min(-1) vs 14.3 ml kg(-1)min(-1)p=0.4) values were similar between the groups. Although most of the preoperative and postoperative QoL domains in both groups were reduced compared with normal population (<50), we were not able to find differences between the groups in any of the preoperative and postoperative physical and mental QoL scales.
CONCLUSIONS: The evidence of an acceptable QoL in COPD patients may help both patients and physicians in the surgical decision-making process in the face of high rates of complications."

METHODS: Two random samples (high intervention group A, n=11 708; low intervention group B, n=1308) were invited for a health examination, assessment of absolute risk of ischemic heart disease and individual lifestyle counselling. The participation rate was 52.5%. High-risk individuals in group A were also offered group-based counselling on diet and PA and/or smoking cessation. High-risk individuals in group B were referred to usual care. All high-risk individuals were reinvited for examination and counselling after 1 and 3 years, and all participants were reexamined after 5 years. The control group (group C, n=5264, response rate 61.1%) answered a mailed questionnaire. Change in self-reported PA from baseline to 5-year follow-up was the main outcome. Level of education was classified as no vocational training, ≤4 years and >4 years. Data were analysed using longitudinal linear regression models with random intercepts.
RESULTS: In men, the high-intensity intervention had a beneficial effect on PA level after 5 years. The age- or time-related decrease in PA was approximately 30 min/week less compared to men in the control group (p<0.0001). Level of education had no significant impact on the effect of the intervention neither in men (p=0.39) nor in women (p=0.32).
CONCLUSION: A population-based multifactorial lifestyle intervention did not influence social inequality in PA."
19850594,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19850594/,"OBJECTIVE: The gold standard assessment for sleep quality is polysomnography (PSG). However, actigraphy has gained popularity as an ambulatory monitor. We aimed to assess the value of actigraphy in measuring sleep fragmentation in children.
METHODS: 130 children aged 2-18 years referred for assessment for sleep disordered breathing (SDB) were recruited. The arousal index (AI) scored from PSG was compared to the actigraphic fragmentation index (FI) and number of wake bouts/h.
RESULTS: The ability of actigraphic measures to correctly classify a child as having an AI>10 events/h rated as fair for the FI and poor for wake bouts/h (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve, 0.73 and 0.67, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Actigraphy provides only a fair indication of the level of arousal from sleep in children. While the limitations of actigraphy prevent it from being a diagnostic tool for SDB, it still has a role in evaluating sleep/wake schedules in children."
19850668,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19850668/,"BACKGROUND: The association of psychosis with certain serious crimes, such as homicide, has been clearly demonstrated, but it is uncertain to what extent psychotic disorders are associated with arson.
METHODS: We used a case-control design to investigate the association of being diagnosed with schizophrenia and other psychoses and committing arson. Data were obtained from Swedish national registers for criminal convictions, hospital discharge diagnoses (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision [ICD-9], and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision [ICD-10]), and sociodemographic factors for 1988-2000. We included all convicted arson offenders of both sexes in Sweden (N=1689) and compared them with a random sample of general population control subjects (N=40,560).
RESULTS: After adjustment for sociodemographic confounders, arson offenders were more likely to be diagnosed with schizophrenia (in men, adjusted odds ratio [OR]=22.6, 95% confidence interval [CI]=14.8-34.4; in women, adjusted OR=38.7, 95% CI=20.4-73.5) or other psychoses (in men, adjusted OR=17.4, 95% CI=11.1-27.5; in women, adjusted OR=30.8, 95% CI=18.8-50.6).
CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with schizophrenia and other psychoses have significantly increased risks of an arson conviction. These risk estimates are higher than those reported for other violent crimes and place arson in the same category as homicide as crimes that are most strongly associated with psychotic disorders."
19851267,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19851267/,"BACKGROUND: Acute appendicitis remains the most common surgical emergency and although diagnosis should be made on clinical grounds, sometimes this can be difficult. Laparoscopy has gained increasing favour as a method of both investigating right iliac fossa pain and treating the finding of appendicitis. The aim of this study was to determine the accuracy of intraoperative diagnosis of appendicitis.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Records of all patients who underwent laparoscopy for possible appendicitis at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital over a 1-year period were reviewed. Notes of those patients who underwent an open appendicectomy were also reviewed for comparison. Intraoperative findings were recorded, as were the subsequent pathologic findings.
RESULTS: Over the 1-year period from September 2005 to September 2006, 355 operations for suspected appendicitis were performed. In 277 (78%) cases, these were performed laparoscopically. Seventy-three out of 78 open appendectomies were confirmed as appendicitis. Only 1 of these was not macroscopically evident to the surgeon. The appendix was removed in 259 of the 277 laparoscopic procedures. Correct intraoperative diagnosis was made in 217 (84%) of removed appendices, 12 (29%) of the appendices thought to be macroscopically normal and removed were found to be appendicitis after histologic examination. Eighteen patients undergoing the laparoscopic procedure had their appendix left in situ due to normal appearance; none had represented at 6 months postsurgery.
CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopy may aid in the diagnosis of acute right iliac fossa pain. However, intraoperative diagnosis is not easy with almost one-third of apparently normal appendices being inflamed histologically. We would therefore advocate the removal of a normal looking appendix in the absence of other explanatory pathology."
19851423,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19851423/,"AIM: In September 2008, the New Zealand (NZ) Commerce Commission issued a warning to the major tobacco companies to remove ""light"" and ""mild"" descriptors from cigarette packaging. Despite published evidence that suggested tobacco companies had started colour-coding their packs in anticipation of the Commission's decision, the investigation did not consider more general misleading packaging. This study explored changes in tobacco packaging that had been introduced to the New Zealand market, by surveying descriptors used on cigarette packs after the Commerce Commission's warning.
METHOD: A convenience sample of discarded cigarette packs were collected in four cities and six towns/rural areas between November 2008 and January 2009. The majority of packs (93%) were collected in the capital city (Wellington). Information on the descriptors and pack colours was analysed.
RESULTS: Four percent of the 1208 packs collected still included the terms ""light"" and ""mild"". Almost half the packs (42%) used a colour word (e.g. red, blue, gold) as a descriptor to indicate mildness or strength. A further 18% used other words that suggested mildness/strength (e.g. ""subtle"", ""mellow""). A quarter of packs used a descriptor that did not connote either mildness or strength; however, the majority of these packs still appeared to be colour-coded.
CONCLUSION: Although the words ""light"" and ""mild"" have been largely removed from tobacco packaging in the New Zealand market, these words have been replaced with associated colours or other words that may continue to communicate ""reduced harm"" messages to consumers. Further research to test how smokers interpret the new words and colours, and how these influence their behaviour, is desirable. However, government-mandated generic (plain) packaging would remove the opportunity to communicate misleading claims and so would afford the highest level of consumer protection."

METHODS: A total of 51 patients with acute type A2, B2 and B3 scaphoid fractures were treated by limited dorsal approach. During follow-up examinations we analysed the functional outcome and per- and post-operative complications, and we compared them with studies using the dorsal percutaneous approach.
RESULTS: We found fewer complications using the limited dorsal approach.
CONCLUSIONS: We found no advantages of the dorsal percutaneous approach. In addition to a favourable functional outcome, the limited dorsal approach permits visualization of the screw insertion point and of the fracture line course, and prevents insufficient screw sinking underneath the bone cartilage and malunion."
19851466,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19851466/,"BACKGROUND: High-throughput gene expression profiling technologies generating a wealth of data, are increasingly used for characterization of tumor biopsies for clinical trials. By applying machine learning algorithms to such clinically documented data sets, one hopes to improve tumor diagnosis, prognosis, as well as prediction of treatment response. However, the limited number of patients enrolled in a single trial study limits the power of machine learning approaches due to over-fitting. One could partially overcome this limitation by merging data from different studies. Nevertheless, such data sets differ from each other with regard to technical biases, patient selection criteria and follow-up treatment. It is therefore not clear at all whether the advantage of increased sample size outweighs the disadvantage of higher heterogeneity of merged data sets. Here, we present a systematic study to answer this question specifically for breast cancer data sets. We use survival prediction based on Cox regression as an assay to measure the added value of merged data sets.
RESULTS: Using time-dependent Receiver Operating Characteristic-Area Under the Curve (ROC-AUC) and hazard ratio as performance measures, we see in overall no significant improvement or deterioration of survival prediction with merged data sets as compared to individual data sets. This apparently was due to the fact that a few genes with strong prognostic power were not available on all microarray platforms and thus were not retained in the merged data sets. Surprisingly, we found that the overall best performance was achieved with a single-gene predictor consisting of CYB5D1.
CONCLUSIONS: Merging did not deteriorate performance on average despite (a) The diversity of microarray platforms used. (b) The heterogeneity of patients cohorts. (c) The heterogeneity of breast cancer disease. (d) Substantial variation of time to death or relapse. (e) The reduced number of genes in the merged data sets. Predictors derived from the merged data sets were more robust, consistent and reproducible across microarray platforms. Moreover, merging data sets from different studies helps to better understand the biases of individual studies and can lead to the identification of strong survival factors like CYB5D1 expression."
19851696,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19851696/,"PURPOSE: The most preferred method for the treatment of primary varicose veins due to greater saphenous vein (GSV) insufficiency is saphenofemoral high ligation and thigh stripping of the GSV, and ambulatory phlebectomy. Stripping is usually ended at the knee level to prevent nerve injury in the calf. However, different surgical modalities may be used depending on the surgeon's choice and experience.
METHODS: We present the results of complete stripping of the GSV to the ankle and ambulatory phlebectomies performed by a single surgeon. Ninety-six patients (102 limbs) who underwent standardized surgical procedure were participated in this study. Median follow-up time was 3.4 years.
RESULTS: All complaints due to varicose veins were resolved in all extremities. Some temporary complications observed were resolved fully during follow-up. Permanent paresthesia which was the most important complication was found only in two patients (2%). No recurrence was observed.
CONCLUSION: The risk of saphenous nerve injury in the calf should not to be considered a reason to avoid complete stripping of the GSV to the ankle. If it is applied carefully and with appropriate technique, complete stripping still seems to be a good treatment option."
19851815,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19851815/,"BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive approaches such as sclerotherapy have been introduced to treat aneurysmal bone cysts. Sclerotherapy has been associated with reasonable healing rates during the past two decades. However, it is unclear whether sclerotherapy compares with the more traditional extended curettage and bone grafting.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We therefore compared the healing rates and functional scores in patients having percutaneous repetitive sclerotherapy using polidocanol (Group 1) with those with intralesional excision (extended curettage with a high-speed burr) and bone grafting (Group 2) for treatment of aneurysmal bone cyst.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We randomly divided 94 patients into two treatment groups. We assessed healing rates (primary outcome measure), pain relief, time to healing and recurrence, hospital stay, and the Enneking functional score. Forty-five patients from Group 1 and 46 from Group 2 were available for study. The minimum followup was 3.2 years (mean, 4.4 years; range, 3.2-6.1 years).
RESULTS: At last followup, 93.3% in Group 1 and 84.8% in Group 2 had achieved healing. Complications in Group 1 were minor and resolved. In Group 2, three patients had deep infections and five had superficial infections, and two had growth disturbances. Although the healing rates were similar, we found higher rates of clinically important complications, worse functional outcomes, and higher hospital burden associated with intralesional excision.
CONCLUSIONS: Repetitive sclerotherapy using polidocanol is a minimally invasive, safer method of treatment for aneurysmal bone cysts compared with intralesional excision and bone grafting. In this preliminary study, we found similar recurrence rates for the two treatment methods, however, this will require confirmation in larger studies.

19851818,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19851818/,"BACKGROUND: Chondral lesions, peroneal tendon tears, and other disorders in patients with chronic ankle instability may not be detected by preoperative MRI. Also, MRI often is obtained and interpreted at the referring institution, leading to variability in reading.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We assessed the accuracy of the radiologists' and orthopaedic surgeon's reading of preoperative MRI for diagnosing ankle lesions in patients with ankle instability warranting surgery.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 133 patients who underwent 135 surgeries for lateral ankle ligament reconstruction with concomitant ankle arthroscopy and who had preoperative MRI.
RESULTS: We found 72 associated lesions in 66 of the 135 surgeries, including 38 chondral injuries, 18 peroneus brevis tears, seven loose bodies, and nine other miscellaneous abnormalities. Eliminating eight lesions for which the decision to operate was not based on operative findings, there were 127 surgeries with 64 associated lesions that required intraoperative confirmation or were detected intraoperatively. In the original reports, the radiologists identified 39% (15) of the chondral injuries, 56% (10) of the peroneal tears, and 57% (four) of the loose bodies. Radiologists' MRI sensitivity for detecting lesions was 45%. The attending surgeon identified 47% (18) of the chondral injuries, 89% (16) of the loose bodies, 71% (five) of the peroneus brevis tears, and the posterior talus process lesion, with a sensitivity of 63%.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest orthopaedic surgeons should review preoperative MRIs and also suggest the sensitivity of MRI may not be adequate to detect lesions in these patients before surgery.

19852665,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19852665/,"BACKGROUND: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) can cause severe infection in patients who are undergoing vascular surgical operations. Testing all vascular surgery patients preoperatively for MRSA and attempting to decolonize those who have positive results may be a strategy to prevent MRSA infection. The economic value of such a strategy has not yet been determined.
METHODS: We developed a decision-analytic computer simulation model to determine the economic value of using such a strategy before all vascular surgical procedures from the societal and third-party payer perspectives at different MRSA prevalence and decolonization success rates.
RESULTS: The model showed preoperative MRSA testing to be cost-effective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, <$50,000 per quality-adjusted life year) when the MRSA prevalence is > or = 0.01 and the decolonization success rate is > or = 0.25. In fact, this strategy was dominant (ie, less costly and more effective) at the following thresholds: MRSA prevalence > or = 0.01 and decolonization success rate > or = 0.5, and MRSA prevalence > or = 0.025 and decolonization success rate > or = 0.25.
CONCLUSION: Testing and decolonizing patients for MRSA before vascular surgery may be a cost-effective strategy over a wide range of MRSA prevalence and decolonization success rates."

RESULTS: National and local reports indicate that barriers exist in the delivery of oral health services for individuals with intellectual/developmental and later life disabilities.
CONCLUSION: Oral health care is a component of rehabilitation, as long as attendant pain erodes energy and aspirations of individuals with disabilities. Dental practitioners face many of the same complex difficulties encountered by other health practitioners in the provision of services for individuals with disabilities. The need is for the practitioners in the many health fields to play an important role in developing an awareness of, and referrals for, necessary oral health care."
19853353,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19853353/,"BACKGROUND: The role of genetics in allergy development is well accepted. However, studies could not delineate the mode of inheritance or what is specifically being inherited. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of genetics on the development of allergy manifestation, serum IgE level, and sensitization to specific allergens.
METHODS: Fifty-eight twin sets (age 7 months to 11 years) were evaluated for allergy by medical history, family history, physical examination, serum total IgE level, and percutaneous testing to selected common allergens.
RESULTS: In 25 monozygotic (MZ) sets, concordance of atopy was significantly higher than in 33 dizygotic (DZ) sets (84.6% vs 62.5%). The age at onset tended to be earlier when the mother was allergic than when the father was (23.5 months vs 30.5 months). When both twins were allergic, the intra-pair difference in age at onset was within <6 months in 50% of MZ sets versus 31.8% in DZ sets. Total IgE level in twins showed a very strong correlation in MZ sets (r 0.92), but only a moderate correlation among DZ sets (r 0.57). Skin test positivity to specific allergens did not show a significant concordance between twins in either group.
CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that the genetic influence was strongest on the inheritance of IgE phenotype, the development of the atopic tendency, the age of onset, and to some extent on the specific allergy manifestation. The effect seemed less on determining the specific offending allergen(s), suggesting possible roles of epigenetic and environmental factors."
19853699,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19853699/,"BACKGROUND: Large trials have demonstrated that rate control is an acceptable alternative for rhythm control. However, optimal heart rate during atrial fibrillation (AF) remains unknown. Aim of this analysis was to compare outcome between rate control > or =80 and <80 beat/min in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation.
METHODS: In the RAte Control versus Electrical cardioversion for persistent atrial fibrillation study, 522 patients were included, and 256 were randomized to rate control. This post hoc analysis included patients randomized to rate control. Patients were divided according to their mean resting heart rate during follow-up, <80 beat/min (n = 75) or > or =80 beat/min (n = 139). The end point, a composite of cardiovascular mortality, heart failure, thromboembolic complications, bleeding, pacemaker implantation, and severe drug side effects, was compared between both groups.
RESULTS: During follow-up (2.3 +/- 0.6 years), a significant difference between both groups in heart rate was observed (72 +/- 5 vs 90 +/- 8 beat/min; P < .001). Rate control drugs were not significantly different between both groups. New York Heart Association class and fractional shortening remained unchanged in both groups. There were 17 (23%) end points in the low heart rate group and 24 (17%) in the higher heart rate group (absolute difference, 5.4 [-7.3 to 8.2]; P = ns). Independent predictors for the primary end point were coronary artery disease, digoxin use, and interrupted anticoagulation, not high heart rate. Quality of life was comparable in both groups during follow-up.

19853748,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19853748/,"PURPOSE: Good outcomes have been reported with laparoscopic appendectomy (LA) for uncomplicated appendicitis in children, but the use of laparoscopy for complicated appendicitis in children is more controversial. This is related to a higher incidence of postoperative abdominal and wound infections. The purpose of this trial was to retrospectively compare LA and open appendectomy (OA) for complicated appendicitis and evaluate the efficacy of LA in children with complicated appendicitis.
METHODS: The outcome of 128 patients with complicated appendicitis in children was retrospectively analyzed. There were 80 children in the LA group and 48 in the OA group. The appendectomies were performed by a single senior surgeon and his surgical trainees. There was no selection of cases for LA. Data collection included demographics, operative time, resumption of diet, infectious complications (wound infection and intraabdominal abscess), length of hospitalization, and duration of antibiotic use.
RESULTS: There were no cases of LA that required conversion to OA. The operative time for LA (88.5 +/- 28.8 minutes for LA vs 71.8 +/- 30.6 minutes for OA; t = 3.10; P = .002) was longer. Patients in the LA group returned to oral intake earlier (1.8 +/- 0.6 days for LA vs 2.8 +/- 0.8 days for OA; t = -8.04; P < .01) and had a shorter length of hospital stay (6.5 +/- 2.2 days for LA vs 7.8 +/- 2.9 days for OA; t = -2.87; P = .005). The incidence of wound infection (1/80 [1.3%] for LA vs 6/48 [12.5%] for OA; P < .05) and postoperative intraabdominal abscess (2/80 [2.5%] for LA vs 7/48 [14.6%] for OA; P < .05) in LA group was lower. No significant difference was found in the duration of antibiotic administration between the 2 groups (5.8 +/- 1.8 days for LA vs 6.3 +/- 2.3 days for OA; t = -1.37; P = .174). No mortality was observed in either group.
CONCLUSIONS: The minimally invasive laparoscopic technique is feasible, safe, and efficacious for children with complicated appendicitis. Laparoscopic appendectomy should be the initial procedure of choice for most cases of complicated appendicitis in children."
19854034,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19854034/,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the risk of tracheal intubation at birth in very premature neonates related to the type of maternal anesthesia in case of elective cesarean.
POPULATION AND METHODS: All 219 live-born very premature neonates (28-32 weeks of gestation), delivered after an elective cesarean in the 27 maternity wards of 2 French semi-rural neonatal networks. Eighty-three percent (182/219) were delivered in level III maternity wards in university hospitals.
RESULTS: Of the very preterm neonates, 33.3% (73/219) were intubated in the delivery room, either for respiratory distress syndrome or a low APGAR score. Very preterm neonates delivered after maternal general anesthesia were more often intubated than those delivered after spinal anesthesia (48.7% vs 25.2%; OR: 2.8; 95% CI: 1.8-5.1). The risk of intubation related to maternal general anesthesia remained statistically significant after an adjustment for gestational age, fetal growth retardation, respiratory distress syndrome, type of maternity ward, and a propensity score that took into account maternal sociodemographic characteristics and the causes of very preterm birth (aOR: 3.4; 95% CI: 1.4-8.2). The risk of intubation related to general anesthesia was lower after adjusting for the 5-min APGAR score (aOR: 2.8; 95% CI: 1.0-7.3).
CONCLUSION: Very preterm neonates delivered after cesarean with general anesthesia require tracheal intubation in the delivery room more often than those delivered with spinal anesthesia. This study cannot assess a causal link between anesthesia and the need for neonatal intubation. However, neonatologists have to be aware of the type of maternal anesthesia because it may interfere with the non-invasive ventilation support policy of the very preterm neonate."
19854402,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19854402/,"BACKGROUND: The clinical significance of a positive intraoperative frozen section analysis of the pancreatic margin, especially for adenoma or borderline lesion, is not well understood during operations for intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas.
STUDY DESIGN: Data from 130 consecutive patients who underwent intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm resection in a single institution were retrospectively analyzed.
RESULTS: In the first intraoperative frozen section analysis, 26 patients were positive for adenoma or borderline lesion, 10 for carcinoma in situ, 2 for cancer cells floating in the duct, and 6 for invasive cancer. Twenty-nine patients underwent additional resection, and 105 patients finally achieved a negative pancreatic margin. Among 18 patients with a positive pancreatic margin for adenoma or borderline lesion, only 1 had a recurrence. All 20 patients who suffered a recurrence harbored invasive intraductal papillary mucinous carcinoma in resected specimens. In multivariate analysis, predictive factors of recurrence after intraductal papillary mucinous carcinoma resection were the presence of lymph node metastasis, serosal invasion, and a high level of serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9.
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of adenoma or borderline lesion at the pancreatic margin does not always warrant further resection because of the low recurrence rate in the remnant pancreas. Recurrence after intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm resection is influenced primarily by the presence and extent of invasive cancer rather than the status of the pancreatic margin."

The objectives were to calculate costs of protein C treatment, at best-case scenario, per statistical life saved.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-two patients with deranged global haemostatic tests admitted to the mixed surgical medical intensive care unit, Malmö University Hospital. We hypothesized that increasing protein C levels in patients with low levels would enhance survival to the same rate as a cohort with higher protein C. Number of statistical lives saved were estimated using survival analysis. Costs per life saved at 30days were calculated.
RESULTS: Total costs per life saved in 2007 prices (upper limit of 95% CI) were calculated at euro 50,200 (recombinant activated protein C, drotrecogin alfa (activated), Xigris) and euro 46,000 (zymogen protein C, Ceprotin), which may be compared to the value of a statistical life (euro 937,000).
CONCLUSIONS: Our theoretical model of converting a low protein C group to a higher protein C group by treating with activated protein C or the protein zymogen showed no major difference between the treatments in terms of costs, and that costs are lower than the value of a statistical life. Although our study has several caveats the results support the PROWESS study, in that patients with a very severe disease, having low protein C levels, may benefit from protein C treatment in a cost effective way."
19854477,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19854477/,"OBJECTIVES: To examine whether a lower hematocrit was associated with a lower prostate-specific antigen (PSA), when stratifying by body mass index (BMI) in healthy men. PSA test is widely used in screening for prostate cancer. Many studies have found that PSA levels inversely correlate with BMI. It remains unclear whether hemodilution causes this inverse relationship.
METHODS: We investigated 19,367 men who visited a hospital for a routine health checkup in 2007. We obtained information on age, BMI, PSA, hematocrit, and smoking status. BMI was categorized as < 18.5, 18.5-22.0, 22.0-25.0, 25.0-30.0, and > or = 30.0 kg/m(2).
RESULTS: In all subjects, older age and lower BMI were weakly correlated with a higher PSA (r = 0.20, P <.001 and r = -0.05, P <.001, respectively). A multiple regression model for predicting PSA was constructed using age, current smoking status, and hematocrit for each BMI category. After controlling for age and smoking, PSA increased significantly with increasing hematocrit in participants with BMIs of 18.5-30 kg/m(2) (all P <.001). For example, in men with a BMI of 22-25 kg/m(2), slight increases (1.4% increase; 95% confidence interval, 1.0%-1.9%) were observed in PSA with a 1-unit increase in hematocrit.
CONCLUSIONS: In healthy men with a BMI of 18.5-30 kg/m(2), a lower hematocrit was significantly associated with a lower PSA. Hemodilution may explain the lower PSA levels observed in men with a higher BMI, resulting in an inverse relationship between BMI and PSA."
19854582,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19854582/,"UNLABELLED: Occult hepatitis B is defined as the presence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA in the absence of detectable HBs antigen. The prevalence of occult hepatitis B among patients HIV-infected is uncertain, varying between 0% and 89%, and the clinical consequences of the coinfection are poorly known. The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of occult hepatitis B among HIV-infected patients and determine risk factors.
METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted with plasma samples from 31HIV-infected patients untreated for HBV infection and for whom at least one sample was available. All patients were found to be carriers of isolated anti-HBc antibodies between 2000 and 2008, and HBV DNA was quantified in 51 samples (one to three per patient) by real-time PCR using the Qiagen HBV PCR kit.
RESULTS: HBV DNA was found in samples from seven patients (22%). Occult hepatitis B seemed to be more frequent among patients coinfected with HCV (p=0.047). The number of CD4 cells was significantly less in samples containing detectable HBV DNA than in those with no detectable HBV DNA.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of occult hepatitis B seemed high, and HBV DNA titers were weak (< 20UI/mL), among patients infected with HIV and carrying isolated anti-HBc antibodies. These results would support screening HIV-infected patients for the presence of HBV DNA if confirmed with a larger patient population."
19854705,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19854705/,"BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is partially attributed to traditional cardiovascular risk factors, which can be identified and managed based on risk stratification algorithms (Framingham Risk Score, National Cholesterol Education Program, Systematic Cardiovascular Risk Evaluation and Reynolds Risk Score). We aimed to (a) identify the proportion of at risk patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) requiring statin therapy identified by conventional risk calculators, and (b) assess whether patients at risk were receiving statins.
METHODS: Patients at high CVD risk (excluding patients with established CVD or diabetes) were identified from a cohort of 400 well characterised patients with RA, by applying risk calculators with or without a x1.5 multiplier in specific patient subgroups. Actual statin use versus numbers eligible for statins was also calculated.
RESULTS: The percentage of patients identified as being at risk ranged significantly depending on the method, from 1.6% (for 20% threshold global CVD risk) to 15.5% (for CVD and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality) to 21.8% (for 10% global CVD risk) and 25.9% (for 5% CVD mortality), with the majority of them (58.1% to 94.8%) not receiving statins. The application of a 1.5 multiplier identified 17% to 78% more at risk patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Depending on the risk stratification method, 2% to 26% of patients with RA without CVD have sufficiently high risk to require statin therapy, yet most of them remain untreated. To address this issue, we would recommend annual systematic screening using the nationally applicable risk calculator, combined with regular audit of whether treatment targets have been achieved."
19854730,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19854730/,"AIMS: Cardiovascular risk factors such as elevated serum lipid levels are important in the development of coronary atherosclerosis. Radiofrequency (RF) analysis of intravascular ultrasound [IVUS, Virtual histology (VH)] offers a unique tool to study the composition of coronary atherosclerotic plaque in vivo. We used data from the multicentre VH registry to assess the association between cardiovascular risk factors and coronary plaque volume and composition.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Between August 2004 and July 2006, 990 patients in 42 centres were enrolled in a prospective, multicentre, non-randomized global VH registry. Coronary artery imaging was performed by conventional IVUS and RF-IVUS. The four RF-IVUS plaque components [dense calcium (DC), necrotic core (NC), fibrous (F) tissue, and fibro fatty (FF)] were analysed in every recorded frame. The results were expressed as mean cross-sectional areas, absolute volume, and percentage of total plaque volume. Risk factor assessment included evaluation of family history of previous myocardial infarction (MI), past or current smoking, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and the laboratory measurements. Patients with diabetes had an increased relative proportion of NC (6.47 +/- 0.28 vs. 5.86 +/- 0.14%, P = 0.037) and DC (4.58 +/- 0.27 vs. 3.90 +/- 0.14%, P = 0.017), and patients with hypertension had an increased relative proportion of FF, DC (4.35 +/- 0.16 vs. 3.57 +/- 0.17%, P = 0.02) and NC (6.24 +/- 0.17 vs. 5.60 +/- 0.19%, P = 0.01). Compared with patients with LDL-C <100 mg/dL, patients with LDL-C >160 mg/dL had higher plaque volume (342.1 +/- 26.2 vs. 318.6 +/- 10.7 mm(3)). Linear regression analysis showed a correlation between the level of HDL-C and F (r = -0.149, P < 0.01), FF (r = -0.106, P < 0.01), and NC (r = -0.90, P < 0.05). The level of LDL correlated with F (r = 0.110, P < 0.01). Patients with prior MI have an increased percentage of F (30.03 +/- 0.59 vs. 28.20 +/- 0.37%, P = 0.009). Smoking had no relevant effect on plaque composition. Treatment with acetylsalicylacid and statins reduced FF with altering plaque volume.
CONCLUSION: Radiofrequency-IVUS detects marked differences in coronary plaque composition related to the risk factor profile with particular focus on lipid levels. Greater amounts of NC were associated with diabetes, hypertension, MI, and low HDL-C. The effects of treatment of changes related to plaque composition are underway."
19854748,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19854748/,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to examine if dissatisfaction with psychosocial work climate predicts psychiatrically diagnosed depressive, anxiety and substance abuse disorders.
METHODS: In Aarhus County, Denmark, 13 423 public service employees at 683 workplace units answered a questionnaire survey assessing psychosocial work environment. An average workplace unit score of overall satisfaction with psychosocial working conditions, rated on a scale from 0-10 with 10 being most satisfied, was computed and assigned to the individual employees at each work unit. Aggregated satisfaction scores were divided into three levels, according to the 25-75 percentiles. Data on hospitalisations and outpatient treatments for depressive, anxiety and substance abuse disorders was obtained from the Danish Central Psychiatric Research Register. HRs and 95% CIs were computed for first onset of studied disorders, starting from the baseline survey at 1 January 2002 through to 30 April 2008. Risk estimates were adjusted for sociodemographic variables.
RESULTS: A low satisfaction with psychosocial working conditions was associated with an increased risk of any mental health disorder, HR(adj) 1.71, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.82. The lower the satisfaction level, the higher was the risk of mental health disorders. Moreover, substance abuse disorders were more frequent among men dissatisfied with work climate, HR(adj) 3.53, 95% CI 1.55 to 8.03.
CONCLUSION: Working in a dissatisfying psychosocial environment increases the risk of subsequent mental health disorders. Randomised, controlled intervention trials may help in resolving whether this association is causal."

DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: The responses from 24 281 respondents >65 years to the Canadian Community Health Survey Cycle 1.1 were used to find activity levels and determine health resource use and costs. Logistic regression models were used to assess risks of hospitalisation.
RESULTS: Physical inactivity was associated with statistically significant increases to hospitalisations, lengths of stay and healthcare visits (p<0.01). Average healthcare costs (based on the 2007 value of the Canadian dollar) for the physically inactive were $C1214.15 higher than the healthcare costs of the physically active ($C2005.27 vs $C791.12, p<0.01).
CONCLUSION: Among those >65 years, physical activity is strongly associated with reduced health resource use and costs."
19855258,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19855258/,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The outcome of hepatic resection in cirrhotic patients has improved remarkably in recent years with improved surgical techniques and perioperative care; however, the role of portal hypertension is still uncertain. The aim of this study was to elucidate surgical outcomes of hepatectomy in patients with portal hypertension.
METHODS: Data from 241 cirrhotic patients who underwent resection for hepatocellular carcinoma were retrospectively collected and analyzed: patients were divided into 2 groups according to the presence (n = 89) or absence (n = 152) of portal hypertension at the time of surgery. To overcome biases owing to the different distribution of covariates throughout the 2 groups, a one-to-one match was created using propensity score analysis: after match, intraoperative, and postoperative course and survival rates were analyzed.
RESULTS: Patients with portal hypertension experienced worse preoperative liver function (mean model for end-stage liver disease [MELD] score, 9.5 +/- 7.8 vs. 8.4 +/- 1.3; P = 0.001) and survival rates (P = 0.008) in comparison to those without portal hypertension: after one-to-one matching, patients with (n = 78) and without portal hypertension (n = 78) had the same preoperative characteristics and showed the same intraoperative course, postoperative occurrence of liver failure, morbidity, length of in-hospital stay and survival rates (P = ns in all cases). The only predictors of postoperative liver failure were MELD score (P = 0.001) and extent of hepatectomy (P = 0.005).
CONCLUSIONS: Faced with the same MELD score and extent of hepatectomy planning, presence of portal hypertension should not be considered as a contraindication for hepatic resection in cirrhotic patients."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Literature review of 275 articles describing the neuroretinal rim in glaucoma and a survey of ophthalmologists describing 2 disc photographs. Frequencies of descriptors of the neuroretinal rim were surveyed, which included ""thinning"" and ""narrowing.""
RESULTS: Of the 275 articles, 80 described the neuroretinal rim clinically. Forty-one articles used ""thinning"" to describe progressive loss of rim tissue in a radial axis, 13 articles used ""narrowing"" and rest used ""width"" to describe the characteristics of neuroretinal rim. Of the 295 ophthalmologists, 264 used ""thinner,"" whereas 31 used ""narrower"" to describe the neuroretinal rim.
CONCLUSIONS: Accurate phenotyping is an essential part of patient care, research, and training. ""Thinning"" is currently used more commonly than ""narrowing"" in the literature to describe progressive loss of the neuroretinal rim in a radial axis. It would be appropriate to use ""narrowing"" for radial loss or decrease in width and ""thinning"" for decrease in the thickness of the rim."
19855981,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19855981/,"PURPOSE: The diagnosis of acute appendicitis by physical examination can sometimes be difficult in extremely obese children. C-reactive protein (CRP) is commonly used to support the clinical diagnosis of appendicitis. However, obesity has been widely recognized as a chronic inflammatory condition and associated with elevated inflammatory indicators including CRP. The aim of this study was to examine the association between obesity and CRP levels in extremely obese children presenting with suspected appendicitis.
MATERIALS: The hospital records of 947 consecutive patients, who underwent appendectomy for acute appendicitis between 2002 and 2008 were retrospectively analyzed. 164 children (17.3%) were extremely obese. Extreme obesity was defined, as greater than two standard deviations above the standardized mean weight for age. The diagnostic value of CRP level was compared between extremely obese and non-obese children.
RESULTS: The incidence of histologically normal appendix was significantly higher in extremely obese children [42 out of 164 (25.6%)] compared to non-obese children [85 out of 783 (10.8%) (P < 0.001)]. The mean CRP levels were significantly higher in extremely obese children with histologically normal appendix compared to non-obese children with normal appendix (P < 0.001). The specificity and the positive predictive value were significantly lower in the extremely obese children group than in the non-obese group (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: CRP is not a reliable marker of inflammation in extremely obese children presenting with suspected appendicitis. Our data highlight the importance of obesity when interpreting the significance of an elevated CRP level in children with suspected diagnosis of appendicitis."
19855983,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19855983/,"PURPOSE: The rat gavage model is used to explore the pathogenesis and treatment of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Although intestinal histological damage is seen in this model, intestinal perforation is rarely observed. Whether organ failure occurs in this model is largely unknown. We hypothesised that increased intestinal permeability leads to organ failure in experimental NEC.
METHODS: NEC was induced in neonatal rats by gavage feeding of hypertonic formula plus exposure to hypoxia plus oral lipopolysaccharide (4 mg/kg per day daily). Breast-fed rats were used for comparison. At 92 h, lactulose (3 mg) and mannitol (2 mg) were administered orally in 0.1 ml water. Four hours later, rats were killed and blood samples collected. Lactulose and mannitol were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and lactulose/mannitol ratio calculated as index of intestinal permeability. Plasma cardiac troponin-I was measured by ELISA as a marker of cardiac damage and plasma creatinine measured spectrophotometrically as a marker of renal failure.
RESULTS: Experimental NEC induced an increase in intestinal permeability (P = 0.0002). This was associated with cardiac damage (P < 0.0001), and renal failure (P = 0.004).
CONCLUSION: Intestinal permeability is increased in experimental NEC in association with increased cardiac damage. Rat mortality may be due to cardiac failure secondary to an inflammatory response caused by increased intestinal permeability."
19856050,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19856050/,"BACKGROUND: We aimed to determine the appropriateness of adding 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positronemission tomography (PET) to computed tomography (CT) and other pre-existing diagnostic imaging modalities for detecting subclinical lymph node metastasis of esophageal cancer, by comparing images from these modalities with the results of histopathological analysis.
METHODS: Twenty patients who received radical surgery for squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus were examined by PET-CT, and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) examination before surgery. Based on these diagnostic modalities, the clinical target volume (CTV) was set as the gross tumor volume (GTV) plus a 1-cm margin. Histopathological diagnosis was performed in all patients immediately after resection.
RESULTS: Fifty-three (3.0%) of 1764 nodes in the 20 patients were histopathologically positive for cancer cells. The CTV was not adequate to cover these histopathologically detected positive lymph nodes in 8 of 20 patients on CT, 5 of 20 on CT+EUS, 7 of 20 on PET-CT, and 5 of 20 on PET-CT+EUS.
CONCLUSION: The detection rate of subclinical lymph node metastasis did not improve with the use of PET-CT, for either the cervical and supraclavicular, mediastinal, or abdominal regions. It is not recommended to use FDG-PET or PET-CT alone as a diagnostic tool to determine CTV if pathologically involved lymphatic regions are to be included in the CTV in the treatment protocol. The accuracy of PET-CT must be further improved in order to better detect positive nodes and improve the definition of the CTV."
19856433,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19856433/,"PURPOSE: To improve characterization of focal liver lesions by a prospective quantitative analysis of percentage signal intensity change, in dynamic and late phases after slow (0.5 mL/s) Resovist administration.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-three patients were submitted on clinical indication to MR examination with Resovist. Signal intensity of 92 detected focal lesions (5-80 mm) were measured with regions of interest and normalized to paravertebral muscle in arterial, portal, equilibrium and T1/T2 late phases, by two observers in conference. Five values of percentage variations per patient were obtained and statistically evaluated.
RESULTS: The enhancement obtained on dynamic study is more suitable in hemangiomas and focal nodular hyperplasias than in adenomas and hepatocellular carcinomas. To discriminate benign versus malignant lesions on late-phase-T2-weighted images, a cutoff = -26%, allowed sensitivity and specificity values of 97.4% and 97.7%, respectively. Area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.99. To differentiate hemangioma versus all other focal liver lesions, on late-phase-T1-weighted images, a cutoff = +40% permitted sensitivity and specificity values of 90.5% and 98.0%, respectively. Area under the ROC curve was 0.98.

However there is a question about the accuracy of interpretations of peak oxygen consumption (VO(2)max) used at present.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed 302 CHF patients stratified into 3 groups according to VO(2)max (mL/kg/min): group 1 = <10 (n = 37); group 2 = 10-14 (n = 121) and group 3 = >14 (n = 144). We compared the mortality rate, the OHT rate, time to OHT, time to death and pulmonary function tests (PFT) among the groups using ANOVA Kruskal-Wallis tests for analysis in Statistica 7.1.
RESULTS: No important differences were observed between groups 1 and 2 (P > .05), but first in comparison with group 3 (P < .05) in terms of mortality (48.6% vs 33.1% vs 21.5%), number of OHT (24.3% vs 32.2% vs 14.6%), time to death (15.4 vs 16.6 vs 34.4 months) or PFT results (forced expiratory volume in the first second forced vital capacity and peak expiratory flow, all as direct or as percent of normal values). In contrast, time to OHT (4.6 vs 6.9 vs 10.9 months) and percent of normal vital capacity (72% vs 81% vs 91%) differed significantly among all groups (P < .05).
CONCLUSION: Patients with VO(2)max between 10 and 14 or <10 mL/kg/min are at similar risk of death."

19858388,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19858388/,"PURPOSE: Sexual function in male lymphoma survivors was examined and compared with that of age-matched controls.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study included serum gonadal hormone levels (testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin, luteinizing hormone [LH], and follicle-stimulating hormone) and responses to questionnaires assessing sexual function (Brief Sexual Function Inventory [BSFI]), socioeconomic factors, quality of life, emotional distress, and fatigue. The lymphoma group included 246 men < or = 50 years old at diagnosis who were diagnosed from 1980 to 2002 and treated at the Norwegian Radium Hospital. For each lymphoma survivor, two age-matched controls (n = 492) were drawn from a normative sample with BSFI scores.
RESULTS: The lymphoma survivors had a mean age at survey of 47.4 years, the mean duration of follow-up was 14.8 years, and 79% lived in committed relationships. All BSFI domain scores decreased significantly with age. Lymphoma survivors having low testosterone and/or elevated LH had lower BSFI scores than survivors with normal gonadal hormones. Multivariate analyses showed that increasing age, more emotional distress, poor physical health, and low testosterone and/or elevated LH were significantly associated with reduced sexual function within the lymphoma group. Lymphoma survivors had significantly lower BSFI domain scores than did controls on erection, ejaculation, and sexual satisfaction.
CONCLUSION: Lymphoma survivors had significantly poorer sexual function than normative controls. It is unclear whether the abnormal hormone levels directly cause the reduced sexual function within the lymphoma group or if a mediating factor is involved, such as aging, emotional distress, or perceived health status."
19858412,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19858412/,"BACKGROUND: A better knowledge of patient x-ray dose and the associated radiation risk in pediatric interventional cardiology is warranted in view of the extensive use of x-rays and the higher radiosensitivity of children. In the present study, gamma-H2AX foci were used as a biomarker for radiation-induced effects. Patient-specific dose was assessed and radiation risks were estimated according to the linear-no-threshold model, commonly used in radiation protection, and the gamma-H2AX foci data.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In 49 pediatric patients (median age, 0.75 years) with congenital heart disease who underwent cardiac catheterization procedures, blood samples were taken before and shortly after the procedure. gamma-H2AX foci were determined in peripheral blood T lymphocytes. In each patient, a net increase in gamma-H2AX foci, representing DNA double-strand breaks induced by interventional x-rays, was observed. In addition, a patient-specific Monte Carlo simulation of the procedure was performed, resulting in individual blood, organ, and tissue doses. Plotting of gamma-H2AX foci versus blood dose indicated a low-dose hypersensitivity. Median effective doses calculated according to the International Commission on Radiological Protection 60 and 103 publications are 5.6 and 6.4 mSv, respectively. The lifetime-attributable risk of cancer mortality was calculated from the linear-no-threshold model and the gamma-H2AX foci data. This resulted in lifetime-attributable risk values of 1% and 4%, respectively, for the patient population under study.
CONCLUSIONS: gamma-H2AX foci as a biomarker for DNA damage indicate that radiation risk estimates according to the linear-no-threshold hypothesis are possibly underestimates. Great care should be taken to minimize and optimize patient radiation exposure."
19858700,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19858700/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of isolated gastrocnemius and soleal vein thrombosis (IGSVT) and the effect of anticoagulation on venous thromboembolism (VTE) events in patients with IGSVT.
SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Although IGSVT is diagnosed with increasing frequency, the clinical significance and optimal management remains unknown.
METHODS: Vascular laboratory studies from April 2002 to April 2007 were retrospectively reviewed to identify patients with IGSVT. Medical records were reviewed for demographic data, risk factors, treatment modalities, and VTE events. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed.
RESULTS: Of 38,426 lower extremity venous duplex studies, 406 patients with IGSVT were included in this study. Mean follow-up was 7.5 +/- 11 months. The overall incidence of VTE among the entire cohort was 18.7%, which included 3.9% pulmonary embolism and 16.3% deep venous thrombosis, with 1.5% of patients having both pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis. However, the incidence of VTE was 30% (36/119) and 27% (13/48) in patients who received no or prophylactic anticoagulation, respectively, but only 12% in patients treated with therapeutic anticoagulation (23/188; P = 0.0003). Multivariate analysis identified lack of therapeutic anticoagulation (P = 0.017) and history of VTE (P = 0.011) as independent predictors of subsequent VTE development. The rate of IGSVT resolution during follow up was 61.2% with therapeutic anticoagulation, but only 40.0% and 41.0% with prophylactic or no anticoagulation, respectively (P = 0.003).
CONCLUSIONS: IGSVT is associated with a clinically significant rate of VTE which is dramatically reduced with therapeutic anticoagulation. These data warrant further investigation, taking into account the risks and benefits of anticoagulation."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional ethics committee approval and written informed consent were obtained. Forty consecutive patients underwent conventional FP MRA with 15 mL gadobenate dimeglumine, using a conventional 3D FLASH sequence (14 sec acquisition time). Immediately afterward, SS images were obtained using a high resolution coronal 3D FLASH sequence (240 sec acquisition time). All patients also underwent CTA and conventional DSA within 8 +/- 3 days. Three experienced radiologists assessed FP and SS image quality and calculated sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and predictive values for stenosis grade and length, plaque morphology, and tandem lesions using DSA as reference. Detected stenoses were quantified and compared (Spearman rank correlation coefficient, [R(s)]; McNemar test) with DSA and CTA findings. Inter-read variability was assessed using kappa (kappa) statistics. The impact of SS acquisitions on diagnostic confidence and patient management was assessed.
RESULTS: MRA FP and SS image quality was excellent in 63 (78.8%) and 46 (57.5%) vessels, adequate in 11 (13.8%) and 20 (25.0%) vessels, and poor in 6 (7.5%) and 14 (17.5%) vessels, respectively. Area under the curve analysis revealed no significant differences between MRA FP, MRA FP + SS, and CTA for the grading of stenoses (P = 0.838; accuracy values of 97.4%, 97.4%, and 98.7%, respectively). Greater accuracy (P < 0.001) was noted for FP + SS images over FP images alone for the assessment of plaque morphology (96.1% for FP + SS images vs. 83.3% for FP). Increased diagnostic confidence was noted for 49 (61.3%) vessels because of additional SS images whereas an impact on final diagnosis was noted in 8 (10%) cases. Good correlation was noted between SS image quality and impact on final diagnosis (R(s) = 0.7; P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: SS imaging of the carotid arteries is feasible with gadobenate dimeglumine. The increased spatial resolution attainable allows improved evaluation of stenoses and plaque irregularity, yielding comparable diagnostic performance to that of CTA and DSA."
19858806,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19858806/,"PURPOSE: The relationship of the quality of teaching hospitals' clinical performance to resident education in quality and patient safety is unclear. The authors studied residents' knowledge of these areas in major teaching hospitals with higher- and lower-quality performance rankings. They assessed the presence of formal and informal quality curricula to determine whether programmatic differences exist.
METHOD: The authors used qualitative research methodology with purposeful sampling. They gathered data from individual structured interviews with residents and key educational and quality leaders in six medical schools and teaching hospitals, which represented a range of quality performance rankings, geographic regions, and public or private status.
RESULTS: No relationship emerged between a hospital's quality status, residents' curriculum, and the residents' understanding of quality. Residents' definitions of quality and safety and their knowledge of the practice-based learning and systems-based practice competencies were indistinguishable between hospitals. Residents in all programs had extensive patient safety knowledge acquired through an informal curriculum in the hospital setting. A formal curriculum existed in only two programs, both of them ambulatory settings.
CONCLUSIONS: Residents' learning about quality and patient safety is extensive, largely through a positive informal curriculum in the teaching hospital and, less frequently, via a formal curriculum. No relationship was found between the quality performance of the teaching hospital and the residents' curriculum or understanding of quality or safety. Residents seem to learn through an informal curriculum provided by hospital initiatives and resources, and thus these data suggest the importance of major teaching hospitals in quality education."
19858952,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19858952/,"BACKGROUND: Patient education of self-care is an integral component of nursing care. Promoting self-care is important for patients with diabetes because day-to-day decision making has a tremendous impact on health.
PURPOSE: To examine diabetes knowledge of nurses working on medical cardiology and cardiovascular surgical intermediate care units.
METHODS: In this prospective, cross-sectional, correlational study, 90 registered nurses working on medical cardiology and cardiovascular surgical units completed a 20-item survey on diabetes survival skill education. Correlational and comparative statistics were used to analyze data.
RESULTS: Subjects (N = 90) were more often female (n = 73; 83.0%) and worked full time (n = 76; 84%); mean (SD) RN experience was 5.6 years (SD, 7.6 years). Total mean score on the Diabetes Survival Skills Knowledge Test (DKSST) was 10.4 (SD, 2.6), reflecting 50% mastery of diabetes survival skill content. Test scores were higher in nurses with greater general comfort in teaching patients about diabetes (P =.04), more years of experience as a nurse (P =.004), more years of work at the current workplace (P <.001), and more years in their current work unit (P <.001). By age, nurses in the oldest quartile (> or =37 years) had higher DKSST content area scores in oral glucose-lowering agents (P =.02) and symptom management (P =.01) and had a trend toward higher overall DKSST score (P =.06) and score on blood glucose self-monitoring (P =.06). Sex, formal education level, work commitment, and previous diabetes education were not associated with higher DKSST scores.
CONCLUSION: Nurse's knowledge and comfort related to diabetes survival skill teaching were low. The strongest correlate of higher DKSST score was length of time as a nurse. Because previous education and other nurse characteristics were not associated with higher test scores, nurse educators and advanced practice nurses must modify education delivery modalities to improve retention of information used in the delivery of patient education about diabetes survival skills."
19858979,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19858979/,"OBJECTIVES: The purposes of this study were to assess the incidence of intraoperative trauma implant waste in a regional territory of the United States and to assess its impact on costs.
METHODS: The total number of procedures using a single device manufacturer's orthopaedic trauma implants in one geographic region and number of occurrences of intraoperative orthopaedic trauma implant waste were recorded prospectively from 74 contiguous hospitals over a period of 18 months along with the individual responsible for the waste (surgeon, vendor representative, or operating room staff), the cost of the wasted implant, and whether the hospital paid for the implant. Hospitals were stratified into teaching or community institutions. The collected data were then aggregated and analyzed for overall incidence and cost as well as cost per trauma procedure.
RESULTS: Implant waste occurred in 37 of 6531 procedures (0.6%) with 16 of the centers (21.6%) reporting at least one occurrence and 95% attributed to the surgeon or operating room staff. Community hospitals were found to have a significantly higher incidence of implant waste as compared with teaching hospitals. Hospitals absorbed 74% of the wasted implant costs ($20,357 over the study period). This expense represented a mean additional cost of $3.12 per orthopaedic trauma procedure performed.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a small but notable annual incidence and cost of orthopaedic trauma implant waste in the study region with the majority of this cost borne by the hospitals. However, implant waste occurs infrequently and represents a very small cost to hospitals per procedure. Educational programs and other strategies to reduce its incidence are unlikely to yield any substantial cost savings."

Spine L1-L4 and L2-L4 sBMD mean differences between the two systems were 0.042 g/cm(2) (4.1%) and 0.035 g/cm(2) (3.2%), respectively.
INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study is to validate the 1994 pencil-beam DXA ""universal standardization equations"" for state-of-the-art fan-beam DXA systems.
METHODS: The spine and bilateral femurs of 87 postmenopausal women were scanned on both Hologic Delphi and GE-Lunar Prodigy DXA systems at three different clinical centers. The scans were analyzed using Hologic Apex and GE-Lunar EnCore software. The BMD results were converted to sBMD using the equations previously developed. Linear regression analysis was used to describe the relationship of the two systems' BMD results. Bland-Altman analysis was used to assess the differences in measures.
RESULTS: The Apex and Prodigy sBMD values were highly correlated (r ranged from 0.92 to 0.98). Spine L1-L4 and L2-L4 sBMD values had significant intercepts and slopes for Bland-Altman regression, with mean differences of 0.042 g/cm(2) (4.1%) and 0.035 g/cm(2) (3.2%), respectively. The total hip and neck sBMD showed no significant intercept and slope, except left total sBMD had a significant difference between the two systems of 0.009 g/cm(2) (1.0%).
CONCLUSIONS: The sBMD values were shown to be equivalent within 1.0% for hip but were significantly different for spine on the two systems. Biases may persist in pooled sBMD data from different manufacturers, and further study is necessary to determine the cause."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Multicenter, cross-sectional study of patients with probably AD by DSM-IV or NINCDS-ADRDA criteria, on monotherapy with donepezil, ODT or film-coated tablets. Satisfaction with treatment was assessed by the caregiver self-administered generic Treatment Satisfaction with Medicines Questionnaire (SATMED-Q) -range: 0, no satisfaction, to 100, maximal satisfaction-, total and in six dimensions: undesirable effects, efficacy, medical care, medication ease and convenience, medication impact on daily activities, and overall satisfaction.
RESULTS: 546 patients were enrolled (9,6% institutionalized); 64,8% women; 78,2 +/- 6,5 years of age; disease evolution of 22.5 +/- 24.6 months, Minimental State Examination (MMSE) mean score: 18,5 +/- 5; 67.9% on film-coated tablets and 32.1% on ODT. After adjusting by MMSE and time of treatment, caregivers of patients on ODT showed significantly higher SATMED-Q total score (74.5 +/- 11.8 vs. 70.4 +/- 12.3; p lower than 0.0004) and medication ease and convenience (84.9 +/- 16.4 vs. 79.8 +/- 17.6; p = 0.0059), impact of medication on daily activities (50.2 +/- 22.8 vs. 43.7 +/- 25.5; p = 0.0006) and satisfaction with medical care (79.4 +/- 19.5 vs. 75.6 +/- 21.8; p = 0.04894) scores. 91.6% of caregivers of patients on ODT (versus 82.9% of those on film-coated tablets; p = 0.023) stated that taking the medication was easy for their relatives.
CONCLUSIONS: Results show that caregivers of AD patients on donepezil treatment are more satisfied with ODT versus film-coated tablets, especially due to its better ease of use."
19859994,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19859994/,"AIM: To compare hepatitis C virus (HCV) titers in patients with chronic hepatitis C with and without exposure to 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins).
METHODS: Medical records were reviewed for 6463 patients with documented HCV infection at a single center between March 2004 and September 2006. Patients with confirmed viremia and meeting inclusion criteria were assigned to one of three groups: Group A (n = 50), dyslipidemic patients with statin usage during HCV RNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) determination; Group B (n = 49), dyslipidemic patients with prior or future statin usage but not at the time of HCV RNA PCR determination; and Group C (n = 102), patients without statin usage during the study period. The primary analysis explored the effect of statin therapy on HCV viremia. Secondary analyses assessed class effect, dose response, and effect of other lipid-lowering therapies on HCV viral titers.
RESULTS: Median HCV RNA titers did not significantly differ among the three groups (Group A: 4 550 000 IU/mL, Group B: 2 850 000 IU/mL, Group C: 3 055 000 IU/mL). For those subjects with longitudinal assessment of HCV viremia prior to and while on statins, there were no significant differences between pre- and post-HCV viral titers. Additionally, no differences in HCV titers were observed at any dose level of the most prescribed statin, simvastatin. However, hypertriglyceridemia independently correlated with HCV titers, and niacin exposure was associated with significantly lower viral titers (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: There was no apparent effect of statins on HCV viral replication in this analysis. Further investigation is warranted to explore the possible antiviral properties of triglyceride-lowering agents and their potential role as adjuncts to standard HCV therapy."
19860360,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19860360/,"PURPOSE: Many women report disturbed sleep during pregnancy, but its impact on clinical outcomes remains unknown. This study examined subjective sleep quality and daytime sleepiness in relation to preterm birth.
METHODS: A convenience sample of 220 pregnant women completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) during the second trimester. Women who had preterm and full-term births were compared on these measures.
RESULTS: The preterm birth rate of the sample was 14.6%. Sleep latency, the period from lights out to sleep onset, was significantly longer in the preterm group, which also reported a tendency to use more sleep medications, but had lower PSQI daytime dysfunction scores. Perceived stress did not differentiate preterm and full-term groups.
CONCLUSION: Disturbed sleep in pregnancy may be associated with preterm birth. Future studies should examine specific physiological factors that underlie this increased vulnerability."

DESIGN: We performed a retrospective review of laboratory records at Tygerberg Hospital over a 4-year period from January 2003 to December 2006. All children (aged <13 years) in whom an FNAB and other mycobacterial specimens were collected as part of their diagnostic workup were included.
RESULTS: In 95 children, the following specimens were collected: FNAB (n = 95), gastric aspirates (n = 142), other respiratory specimens (n = 36), non-respiratory specimens (n = 26). Mycobacterial disease was diagnosed in 70 (73.7%) patients. Children without respiratory specimens (n = 6) and/or with Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette-Guérin disease (n = 15) were excluded from comparative analysis. In the remainder, FNAB was positive in 45/74 (60.8%) vs. any respiratory specimen in 29/74 (39.2%, P < 0.001). The mean time to bacteriological diagnosis with FNAB was 7.1 days (95%CI 4.2-10.1) compared to 22.5 days (95%CI 15.8-29.1) for any respiratory specimen.
CONCLUSION: FNAB is a simple, rapid and effective modality for achieving confirmation of mycobacterial disease in paediatric TB suspects with a palpable peripheral lymph node mass."
19861218,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19861218/,"BACKGROUND: The dynamic cross cylinder (DCC) test is a standard clinical procedure used to assess the accommodative response (AR) subjectively. However, because of potential problems arising from the ambiguous stimulus conditions, it is unclear whether this test provides an accurate measure of the AR. The aim of this study was to compare clinical subjective findings with objective measurements of the AR.
METHODS: Subjective findings to a 2.50-diopter (D) accommodative stimulus obtained with the DCC test (without fogging lenses) were compared with objective measurements of the AR obtained with a Grand Seiko WAM 5500 optometer (RyuSyo Industrial Co. Ltd., Kagawa, Japan) in 25 young subjects. As spherical lenses were introduced to quantify the subjective finding, objective measures of the AR were also recorded through these lenses.
RESULTS: The mean AR recorded subjectively and objectively was 2.35 and 1.68 D, respectively (P < 0.0001). Of the 10 subjects who demonstrated a lead of accommodation subjectively, only 1 had a lead objectively. For the 8 subjects who showed a lag of accommodation subjectively, all had a lag objectively. Introducing lenses produced a significant change in the mean AR.
CONCLUSION: The subjective DCC test as performed here does not provide an accurate measurement of the AR to a near target in a young population. We recommend that alternative techniques such as using an objective, open-field optometer or Cross-Nott retinoscopy be adopted for determining the within-task AR."
19861590,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19861590/,"BACKGROUND: Long-term use of a foot-drop stimulator applying functional electrical stimulation (FES) to the common peroneal nerve improves walking performance even when the stimulator is off. This ""therapeutic"" effect might result from neuroplastic changes.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of long-term use of a foot-drop stimulator on residual corticospinal connections in people with central nervous system disorders.
METHODS: Ten people with nonprogressive disorders (eg, stroke) and 26 with progressive disorders (eg, multiple sclerosis) used a foot-drop stimulator for 3 to 12 months while walking in the community. Walking performance and electrophysiological variables were measured before and after FES use. From the surface electromyogram of the tibialis anterior muscle, we measured the following: (1) motor-evoked potential (MEP) from transcranial magnetic stimulation over the motor cortex, (2) maximum voluntary contraction (MVC), and (3) maximum motor wave (M(max)) from stimulating the common peroneal nerve.
RESULTS: After using FES, MEP and MVC increased significantly by comparable amounts, 50% and 48%, respectively, in the nonprogressive group and 27% and 17% in the progressive group; the changes were positively correlated (R(2) = .35; P < .001). Walking speed increased with the stimulator off (therapeutic effect) by 24% (P = .008) and 7% (P = .014) in the nonprogressive and progressive groups, respectively. The changes in M(max) were small and not correlated with changes in MEP.
CONCLUSIONS: The large increases in MVC and MEP suggest that regular use of a foot-drop stimulator strengthens activation of motor cortical areas and their residual descending connections, which may explain the therapeutic effect on walking speed."
19861742,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19861742/,"CONTEXT: Visual disability in India is categorized based on severity. Sometimes the disabled person does not fit unambiguously into any of the categories.
AIMS: To identify and quantify disability that does not fit in the current classification, and propose a new classification that includes all levels of vision.
SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Retrospective chart review of visual disability awarded in a teaching hospital.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The last hundred records of patients who had been classified as visually disabled were screened for vision in both eyes and percentage disability awarded. Data were handled in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration.
RESULTS: Twenty-one patients had been classified as having 30% disability, seven each had 40% and 75%, and 65 had 100% disability. Eleven of them did not fall into any of the current categories, forcing the disability board to use its own judgment. There was a tendency to over-grade the disability (seven of 11; 63.6%). The classification proposed by us is based on the national program for control of blindness' definition of normal vision (20/20 to 20/60), low vision ( < 20/60 to 20/200), economic blindness ( < 20/200 to 20/400) and social blindness ( < 20/400). It ranges from the mildest disability (normal vision in one eye, low vision in the other) up to the most severe grade (social blindness in both eyes).
CONCLUSIONS: The current classification of visual disabilities does not include all combinations of vision; some disabled patients cannot be categorized. The classification proposed by us is comprehensive, progresses logically, and follows the definitions of the national program."
19862479,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19862479/,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate if L(+)-lactate (lactate) can be used as a marker of progression of joint inflammation in comparison with a reference marker, prostaglandin E2 (PGE(2)), and to analyse implications for drug treatments.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The assessment of the inflammation time course and the treatment efficacy studies were performed on two occasions. At specific time points, synovial fluid was extracted from Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 87) challenged with either carrageenan (Cg) or Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA) or from six non-inflamed rats. Naproxen (7.5 or 30 micromol/kg) or rofecoxib (30 micromol/kg) was administered per os 2 h post Cg or at 48 h post FCA. Levels of PGE(2) and lactate were assessed either by immuno-assay or by colorimetric assay.
RESULTS: Increased levels of both markers were detected following Cg or FCA injection. Pharmacological treatments resulted in lower concentrations of PGE(2) whereas levels of lactate remained unaffected compared to the vehicle-treated group.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that lactate may be useful as an additional biomarker of inflammatory processes, especially for monitoring the non-cox-inhibitor sensitive cascade."
19862540,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19862540/,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate plasma endothelin-1 (ET-1) and fetuin-A concentrations in women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) and to determine whether there is any association between these parameters and fetal asphyxia.
METHODS: We carried out a prospective case-control study consisting of 32 women with ICP at third trimester of pregnancy and 32 pregnant women without ICP. Blood samples from maternal peripheral venous circulation were collected and ET-1 and fetuin-A levels were determined from the plasma samples. Pulse-wave Doppler and Apgar scores were also recorded.
RESULTS: ET-1 concentrations were significantly higher in ICP patients. No difference was observed in fetuin-A levels between the two groups. Six newborns were declared as asphyctic (APGAR score at the 5 min <7). Maternal ET-1 levels did not correlate with the APGAR score at 5 min, total bile acid (TBA) and umbilical artery systolic/diastolic ratio with ICP patients. TBA levels were positively correlated with umbilical artery systolic/diastolic ratio negatively correlated with APGAR score at the 1' and 5'-Apgar score in all subjects. Plasma ET-1 concentration was higher in the preterm neonates of mothers with ICP compared with normal term neonates of mothers.
CONCLUSIONS: Although these data did not show evidence that maternal ET-1 would be associated with fetal distress, we can speculate that maternal ET-1 may be playing a role in the underlying pathology regarding microvascular dysfunction especially in the preterm neonates of mothers with ICP. Elevated TBA levels may increase the risk of asphyxia whereas fetuin-a (as an anti-inflammation marker) does not seem to have effect in women with ICP."
19862654,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19862654/,"PURPOSE: Post-contrast enhancement characteristics (PEC) are a major criterion for differential diagnosis in MR mammography (MRM). Manual placement of regions of interest (ROIs) to obtain time/signal intensity curves (TSIC) is the standard approach to assess dynamic enhancement data. Computers can automatically calculate the TSIC in every lesion voxel and combine this data to form one color-coded parametric map (CCPM). Thus, the TSIC of the whole lesion can be assessed. This investigation was conducted to compare the diagnostic accuracy (DA) of CCPM with TSIC for the assessment of PEC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 329 consecutive patients with 469 histologically verified lesions were examined. MRM was performed according to a standard protocol (1.5 T, 0.1 mmol/kgbw Gd-DTPA). ROIs were drawn manually within any lesion to calculate the TSIC. CCPMs were created in all patients using dedicated software (CAD Sciences). Both methods were rated by 2 observers in consensus on an ordinal scale. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis was used to compare both methods.
RESULTS: The area under the curve (AUC) was significantly (p=0.026) higher for CCPM (0.829) than TSIC (0.749). The sensitivity was 88.5% (CCPM) vs. 82.8% (TSIC), whereas equal specificity levels were found (CCPM: 63.7%, TSIC: 63.0%).
CONCLUSION: The color-coded parametric maps (CCPMs) showed a significantly higher DA compared to TSIC, in particular the sensitivity could be increased. Therefore, the CCPM method is a feasible approach to assessing dynamic data in MRM and condenses several imaging series into one parametric map."
19863292,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19863292/,"BACKGROUND: Recently, we have reported a new clinical disease concept called fungus-associated chronic cough (FACC), which entailed the following manifestations: (1) chronic cough; (2) the presence of environmental fungi, particularly basidiomycetous (BM) fungi, in the sputum; and (3) good clinical response to antifungal drugs. To clarify the relationship between the exposure to environmental fungi and the development of cough attacks, we reviewed the clinical records of patients with FACC and performed a molecular biological analysis of the BM fungi.
METHODS: We successfully selected 8 patients with chronic cough, wherein a sputum culture yielded B. adusta beforehand; moreover, we conducted allergological tests such as the immediate-type skin test, a serological test, bronchoprovocation test, and lymphocyte stimulation test (LST), using the antigenic solution of B. adusta. The efficacy of individualized therapy and the clinical manifestations in the eight patients were examined.
RESULTS: All the eight patients were diagnosed with FACC. Although three patients who did not show a positive reaction to the bronchoprovocation test or LST showed excellent clinical response to anti-fungal drugs; other 5 patients who showed a positive reaction to the bronchoprovocation test and/or LST seemed to be more intractable because of taking a longer time for complete remission and more frequent recurrence of cough.
CONCLUSION: It was suggested that so-called allergic fungal cough (AFC), which is characterized by sensitization to B. adusta, may be included in a part of chronic intractable cough."
19864081,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19864081/,"PURPOSE: To review the effectiveness of reduced-dose and restricted-volume radiation-only therapy in the treatment of intracranial germinoma and to assess the feasibility of reducing or eliminating the use of chemotherapy.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between January 1996 and March 2007, a retrospective analysis was performed that included 38 patients who received either reduced radiation alone (30 Gy for 26 patients) or reduced radiation with chemotherapy (n = 12 patients). All 38 patients received extended focal (including whole-ventricle) irradiation and were followed up until February 2008. Overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) rates were calculated. Variables associated with survival were evaluated by univariate Cox proportional hazards regression.
RESULTS: Median follow-up was 62.4 months (range, 10.1-142.5 months). The total 5-year OS rate was 93.7%. The 5-year OS and RFS rates for patients receiving radiation only were 100% and 96.2%, respectively. The rates for those receiving radiation plus chemotherapy were 83.3 % and 91.7%, respectively (not statistically significant). No predictive factor was significantly associated with the OS or RFS rate. Chemotherapy had no significant effect on survival but was associated with a higher incidence of treatment-related toxicity.
CONCLUSIONS: A further decrease in the radiation dose to 30 Gy with whole-ventricle irradiation is sufficient to treat selected patients with intracranial germinoma. Wide-field irradiation or chemotherapy should be avoided as these methods are unnecessary. Thus, reduction of the radiation dose to 30 Gy may be feasible, even without chemotherapy."
19864309,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19864309/,"AIMS: The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of patient gender onto primary pacemaker implantation, evaluating the database of the Institute of Quality Assurance Hessen in the federal state of Hessen, Germany.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The database of the obligatory external quality control program for the years 2003-2006 was evaluated retrospectively. In 72 centres, 17 826 patients undergoing stationary primary pacemaker implantation have been registered. Male patients had more AV blocks when compared with women and less sick sinus syndrome and atrial fibrillation with bradycardia. In patients being 80 years and older, men received significantly more dual-chamber devices than women for the indications: AV block and sick sinus syndrome. In women, atrial pacing thresholds were significantly higher and P-wave amplitudes were significantly lower. Women had, independent from age or pacing system implanted, significantly more acute complications than men, with significant differences for pneumothorax and pocket haematoma.
CONCLUSION: This large-scale real-life patient cohort of primary stationary pacemaker implantation showed that gender has an impact onto pacemaker implantation, with less favourable outcomes for women."
19864343,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19864343/,"BACKGROUND: There is a growing body of evidence that testicular function has decreased rapidly over the last 50 years. However, much less is known about corresponding trends in ovarian function. Herein, we examine the temporal changes in ovarian function in a large sample of infertile patients from the Czech Republic over a period of 14 years.
METHODS: In a retrospective study, we analysed a large body of data from women, 20-40 years of age, undergoing IVF/ICSI treatment between 1995 and 2008. We defined ovarian function using five variables: basal FSH level, estradiol (E2) level on the day of HCG administration, dose of gonadotrophins used for ovarian stimulation, number of retrieved oocytes and dose of gonadotrophins per oocyte. Controlling simultaneously for temporal changes in patient age and stimulation protocol, we applied generalized additive models to describe the temporal trends.
RESULTS: During the study period the mean age of the study population increased by 2.7 years. Whereas the basal FSH and gonadotrophin dose did not change over time, the E2 level and oocyte retrieval declined, and the dose of FSH per oocyte increased during the study period.
CONCLUSIONS: The results are indicative of a small, but detectable decrease in ovarian function over a period of 14 years, which is not causally related to the ageing population."
19864913,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19864913/,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Specific language impairment (SLI) is believed to be associated with nonverbal auditory (NVA) deficits. It remains unclear, however, whether children with SLI show deficits in auditory time processing, time processing in general, frequency discrimination (FD), or NVA processing in general.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-seven children (aged 8-11) with SLI and 27 control children (CG), matched for age and gender, were retrospectively compared with regard to their performance on five NVA skills in terms of just noticeable differences (JND) and time order judgments (TOJ). JND was used for FD, intensity discrimination, and gap detection, while TOJ was used for FD and clicks.
RESULTS: Children with SLI performed significantly worse than the CG only on the FD tasks (JND and TOJ). The other nonverbal tasks showed no significant intergroup differences. Additionally, moderate associations were found between the FD tasks and phonological skills, as well as between FD tasks and language scores.
CONCLUSION: Children with SLI appear to have restricted FD skills compared to controls, but there was no evidence for a common NVA deficit or reduced temporal auditory abilities."

Together with SKP2, CKS1B is known to implicate p27(Kip1) protein turnover promoting cell-cycle progression.
METHODS: CKS1B, p27(Kip1), and SKP2 were immunostained in 75 HCCs and correlated with clinicopathological features, local recurrence-free survival (LRFS), and overall survival (OS). Silencing of CKS1B and SKP2 with interference short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) was performed in SK-Hep1 and Hep-3B cell lines.
RESULTS: Immunohistochemically, increased CKS1B and SKP2, and attenuated p27(Kip1) were all associated with tumor multiplicity (P < 0.05) and increasing American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage (P < 0.05). Overexpression of CKS1B significantly correlated with advanced Okuda stages (P = 0.048) and SKP2 overexpression (P = 0.047). Neither CKS1B nor SKP2 was inversely related to p27(Kip1), which was reinforced by no alteration in p27(Kip1) abundance in HCC-derived cells with CKS1B or SKP2 silencing. Both CKS1B overexpression (P = 0.0011 and P = 0.0017) and p27(Kip1) attenuation (P = 0.0079 and P = 0.0085) were predictive of OS and LRFS, respectively, while SKP2 overexpression was associated with worse OS alone (P = 0.0043). Combined assessment of CKS1B and p27(Kip1) was able to robustly distinguish three prognostically different groups (P < 0.0001). In multivariate comparison, CKS1B overexpression represented the strongest independent adverse prognosticator [OS, P = 0.0235, hazard ratio (HR): 4.193; LRFS, P = 0.0204, HR: 4.262], followed by p27(Kip1) attenuation (OS, P = 0.0320, HR: 2.553; LRFS, P = 0.0262, HR: 2.533).
CONCLUSIONS: CKS1B protein overexpression in HCCs is implicated in clinical aggressiveness but not in p27(Kip1) turnover, implying presence of p27(Kip1)-independent oncogenic attributes. The combined assessment of CKS1B and p27(Kip1) immunoexpressions effectively risk-stratifies HCCs with different prognoses, which may aid in the management of this deadly malignancy."
27428220,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27428220/,"BACKGROUND: the difference in the risk of thyroid malignancy for patients with multinodular goiter (MNG) and solitary nodular goiter (SNG) remains controversial. Although total thyroidectomy (TT) is the current preferred surgical option for MNG, permanent hypothyroidism in these patients may be a concern. Therefore, we discuss whether nontotal thyroidectomy is a reasonable alternative surgical option.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed for 1598 consecutive patients who underwent thyroid surgery for nodular goiter between January 2007 and December 2012. Numerous clinical parameters were collected and analyzed.
RESULTS: We reviewed 795 patients with MNG and 803 patients with SNG. The prevalence of malignancy on final pathology was significantly higher in the patients with MNG than in the patients with SNG (15.6% vs 10.1%, P = 0.001). However, a multivariate analysis revealed that this difference was insignificant (P = 0.50). Papillary carcinoma was the predominant type in both groups, but papillary microcarcinoma was more frequently found (41.1%) in the patients with MNG. The only multifocal cancers were of the papillary carcinoma histologic type, and the incidence of multifocal papillary carcinoma was significantly higher in the patients with MNG (23.4% vs 7.4%, P = 0.005). Reoperation was not required for the patients who underwent TT for goiter recurrence or incidental carcinoma. The overall rate of recurrence following nontotal thyroidectomy was 12.2%. Among the patients who underwent reoperation for goiter recurrence, 2 (20.0%) were complicated with permanent hypoparathyroidism. Among the patients who underwent a nontotal bilateral thyroidectomy, an average of 56.5% had permanent hypothyroidism.
CONCLUSIONS: Multinodularity does not increase the risk of thyroid malignancy. However, patients with MNG who develop papillary carcinoma are at an increased risk of cancer multifocality. If a patient can tolerate lifelong thyroid hormone replacement, TT is the preferred surgical option because it helps avoid reoperation and the associated complications. Nontotal bilateral thyroidectomy does not ensure the preservation of thyroid hormone function."

To discuss some of the limitations of existing muscle injury grading systems and their potential to cover the full range of injury presentations for calf injuries.
DESIGN: Case report.
SETTING: A professional football player was assessed by physical examination, clinical testing and imaging (MRI) after a gradual onset of a calf injury. After returning to training and competition, a follow-up of his symptoms was performed with regular ultrasound imaging assessments.
PARTICIPANT: A professional football player (35 years, 1.90 m, 88 kg) male, African, striker, playing in the Professional Arabian Gulf League.
CONCLUSION: The discordance between the clinical presentation and the imaging findings resulted in a challenging situation regarding the decision of whether to allow the player to train and compete. In addition, existing muscle injury grading systems do not seem to cover the full range of injuries seen in clinical practice."

DESIGN: Case-control observational study.
SETTING: A university-associated combined sports neurology and orthopedic sports medicine clinic.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 221 male (n = 140) and female (n = 81) athletes aged 12 to 24 years, including 115 concussion cases (52%) and 106 orthopedic controls (48%), were included in this study.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants completed a one-page questionnaire that recorded their age, sex, reason for visit (concussion vs any other injury), concussion history, and self/immediate family member migraine headache history.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The odds of having a previous history of migraine headache were compared in the concussion group versus orthopedic controls.
RESULTS: Controlling for between-group differences in age and sex, there was a significant positive association between concussion group status and history of migraine headache [adjusted odds ratio (OR), 1.90; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03-3.50. P = 0.039]. However, when including a previous concussion history in the statistical model, this relationship failed to reach significance [adjusted OR, 1.68; 95% CI, 0.89-3.16. P = 0.107].
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that there is an association between migraine headache and concussion in athletes, but the cause-effect nature of this relationship cannot be determined. Migraine headache should be considered a modifying factor when caring for concussed athletes."

The objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy of kinesiology taping in the early postoperative phase after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). We hypothesized that kinesiology taping reduces knee pain and swelling and improves knee range of movement and functional outcome.
DESIGN: Randomized controlled study.
SETTING: Primary Institutional Hospital.
PATIENTS: Sixty subjects who underwent an elective ACLR with or without concurrent meniscectomy were randomized into intervention (with kinesiology taping postsurgery) and control groups.
INTERVENTIONS: Subjects from both groups received standardized postoperative physiotherapy. Subjects from the intervention group received additional kinesiology taping on the first and second weeks postsurgery, each application lasting 5 days.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pain visual analogue score (VAS), total range of motion (ROM) of the knee, Lysholm-Tegner scale, and mid patella circumferential girth were measured before the surgery and at the first, second, and sixth week postsurgery.
RESULTS: Within each group, statistically significant differences were found in all study parameters in both groups. Comparison of the study parameters between both groups revealed no statistical significance at various time points except the reduction of pain in the taping group in the early postoperative phase (between the first and second week) (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first randomized controlled study investigating the efficacy of kinesiology taping in arthroscopic knee surgery. Our study showed that kinesiology taping reduced pain in the early postoperative period after ACLR. There was no statistical significance in the reduction of swelling or improvement of knee score and total range of motion with kinesiology taping."

DESIGN: This was a case-control study.
PARTICIPANTS: Nine CH and 9 GH.
INDEPENDENT VARIABLE: Allocation to CH or GH.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Each player was assessed for blood lactate concentration and jumping performance [squat jump (SJ) and countermovement jump (CMJ)] before/after RSA. Post-RSA rate of perceived exertion (RPE) was obtained. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to calculate RSA sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing between CH and GH. Intraclass correlation coefficient was used to assess reliability.
RESULTS: No baseline differences were found for any variable. ΔSJ before/after RSA was -14 ± 2% and -5 ± 2% in CH and GH, respectively (P < 0.05). ΔCMJ before/after RSA was -15 ± 2% and -7 ± 2% in CH and GH, respectively (P < 0.05). ΔSJ-based and ΔCMJ-based (before/after RSA) area under curve (AUC) resulted in 0.90 ± 0.07 and 0.86 ± 0.09, respectively, with both AUCs differentiating between CH and GH with 77.78% sensitivity and 88.89% specificity. Pooled AUC resulted in 0.88 ± 0.06. Intraclass correlation coefficient was high (0.85/0.97).
CONCLUSIONS: Repeated sprint ability is a simple, low-cost field test potentially able to assist in clinical decision making for return to sport."
27429024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27429024/,"OBJECTIVE: To compare treatment failure leading to hospital readmission in children with complicated appendicitis who received oral versus intravenous antibiotics after discharge.
BACKGROUND: Antibiotics are often employed after discharge to prevent treatment failure in children with complicated appendicitis, although existing studies comparing intravenous and oral antibiotics for this purpose are limited.
METHODS: We identified all patients aged 3 to 18 years undergoing appendectomy for complicated appendicitis, who received postdischarge antibiotics at 35 childrens hospitals from 2009 to 2012. Discharge codes were used to identify study subjects from the Pediatric Health Information System database, and chart review confirmed eligibility, treatment assignment, and outcomes. Exposure status was based on outpatient antibiotic therapy, and analysis used optimal and full matching methods to adjust for demographic and clinical characteristics. Treatment failure (defined as an organ-space infection) requiring inpatient readmission was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included revisits from any cause to either the inpatient or emergency department setting.
RESULTS: In all, 4579 patients were included (median: 99/hospital), and utilization of intravenous antibiotics after discharge ranged from 0% to 91.7% across hospitals. In the matched analysis, the rate of treatment failure was significantly higher for the intravenous group than the oral group [odds ratio (OR) 1.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-2.88; risk difference: 4.0%, 95% CI 0.4-7.6%], as was the rate of all-cause revisits (OR 2.11, 95% CI 1.44-3.11; risk difference: 9.4%, 95% CI 4.7-14.2%). The rate of peripherally inserted central catheter line complications was 3.2% in the intravenous group, and drug reactions were rare in both groups (intravenous: 0.7%, oral: 0.5%).
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with oral antibiotics, use of intravenous antibiotics after discharge in children with complicated appendicitis was associated with higher rates of both treatment failure and all-cause hospital revisits."
27429033,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27429033/,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of center volume on postoperative mortality (POM) according to patient condition.
BACKGROUND: Centralization has been shown to improve POM in esophageal and, to a lesser extent, gastric cancer surgery; however, the benefit of centralization for patients with low operative risk is questionable.
METHODS: All consecutive patients who underwent esophageal or gastric cancer surgery between 2010 and 2012 in France were included (N = 11,196). The 30-day POM was compared in terms of the center volume (low: <20 cases per year, intermediate: 20-39, high: 40-59, and very high: ≥60) and stratified according to the Charlson score (0, 1-2, ≥3). The consistency across the esophageal (n = 3286) and gastric (n = 7910) subgroups, and variations between 30-day and 90-day POM were analyzed.
RESULTS: Low-volume centers treated 64.2% of patients. A linear decrease in 30-day and 90-day POM was observed with increasing center volume, with rates of 5.7% and 10.2%, 4.3% and 7.9%, 3.3% and 6.7%, and 1.7% and 3.6% in low, intermediate, high, and very high-volume centers, respectively (P < 0.001). Comparing low and very high-volume centers, 30-day POM was 4.0% versus 1.1% for Charlson 0 (P = 0.001), 7.5% versus 3.4% for Charlson 1 to 2 (P < 0.001), and 14.7% versus 3.7% for Charlson ≥3 (P = 0.003) patients. A similar linear decrease was observed in the esophageal and gastric cancer subgroups. Between the low and very high-volume centers, an almost 70% reduction in the relative risk of POM was systematically observed, independent of Charlson score or tumor location.
CONCLUSIONS: To improve POM, esophageal and gastric cancer surgery should be centralized, irrespective of the patient's comorbidity or tumor location."
27429348,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27429348/,"BACKGROUND: The way people who experience mental illness are perceived by health care professionals, which often includes stigmatising attitudes, can have a significant impact on treatment outcomes and on their quality of life.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether stigma towards people with mental illness varied for undergraduate nursing students who attended a non-traditional clinical placement called Recovery Camp compared to students who attended a 'typical' mental health clinical placement.
DESIGN: Quasi-experimental.
PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-nine third-year nursing students were surveyed; n=40 attended Recovery Camp (intervention), n=39 (comparison group) attended a 'typical' mental health clinical placement.
METHODS: All students completed the Social Distance Scale (SDS) pre- and post-placement and at three-month follow-up. Data analysis consisted of a one-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) exploring parameter estimates between group scores across three time points. Two secondary repeated measures ANOVAs were performed to demonstrate the differences in SDS scores for each group across time. Pairwise comparisons demonstrated the differences between time intervals.
RESULTS: A statistically significant difference in ratings of stigma between the intervention group and the comparison group existed. Parameter estimates revealed that stigma ratings for the intervention group were significantly reduced post-placement and remained consistently low at three-month follow-up. There was no significant difference in ratings of stigma for the comparison group over time.
CONCLUSIONS: Students who attended Recovery Camp reported significant decreases in stigma towards people with a mental illness over time, compared to the typical placement group. Findings suggest that a therapeutic recreation based clinical placement was more successful in reducing stigma regarding mental illness in undergraduate nursing students compared to those who attended typical mental health clinical placements."
27430321,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27430321/,"BACKGROUND: The 2010 guidelines of the French National Cancer Institute (INCa) classify patients with endometrial cancer into three risk groups for lymph node invasion and recurrence on the basis of MRI and histological analysis of an endometrial specimen obtained preoperatively. The classification guides therapeutic choices, which may include pelvic and/or para-aortic lymphadenectomy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of preoperative assessment to help identify intermediate- or high-risk patients requiring lymphadenectomy.
METHODS: The study included all patients who underwent surgery for endometrial cancer between January 2010 and December 2013 at either Rennes University Hospital or Vannes Regional Hospital. The criteria for eligibility included a preoperative assessment with MRI and histological examination of an endometrial sample. A histological comparison was made between the preoperative and surgical specimens.
RESULTS: Among the 91 patients who underwent a full preoperative assessment, the diagnosis of intermediate- or high-risk endometrial cancer was established by MRI and histology with a sensitivity of 70 %, specificity of 82 %, positive predictive value (PPV) of 87 %, negative predictive value (NPV) of 61 %, positive likelihood ratio (LR+) of 3.8 and negative likelihood ratio (LR-) of 0.3. The risk group was underestimated in 32 % of patients and overestimated in 7 % of patients. MRI underestimated endometrial cancer stage in 20 % of cases, while endometrial sampling underestimated the histological type in 4 % of cases and the grade in 9 % of cases.
CONCLUSION: The preoperative assessment overestimated or underestimated the risk of recurrence in nearly 40 % of cases, with errors in lesion type, grade or stage. Erroneous preoperative risk assessment leads to suboptimal initial surgical management of patients with endometrial cancer."
27431210,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27431210/,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether different types of visual feedback influence the control of standing balance.
METHODS: Twenty-six subjects performed three tasks on a force platform: (1) standing with eyes open; (2) maintaining the own center of pressure (COP) displacement (internal feedback) on a target; and (3) pointing with a handheld laser pointer (external feedback) on a target. The COP and ankle displacements were measured through a force platform and a biaxial electrogoniometer, respectively, during 60 s in each task. Global posturographic parameters were computed in the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral directions. In addition, the standard deviation and mean frequency of the ankle movements were also calculated in the sagittal plane.
RESULTS: The sway area and standard deviation of COP differed between conditions, wherein smaller and higher values were typically observed during the internal and external feedback, respectively. Conversely, both the mean frequency and the mean velocity of COP were greater during internal feedback compared with other tasks, while external feedback usually leads to smaller values. Additionally, smaller and higher values for the ankle standard deviation and the ankle mean frequency, respectively, were observed during internal feedback, with the external feedback condition showing an opposite behavior.
CONCLUSIONS: These results showed that the global postural sway and the postural adjustments at ankle during standing balance change depending on the type of visual feedback information."

DESIGN: Prospective observational study.
SETTING: University hospital.
PARTICIPANTS: All children ages 0 to 10 years.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: cTnI was measured after the induction of anesthesia but before the surgery, at the pediatric intensive care unit arrival, and at 4, 12, and 24 hours postoperatively. Follow-up was extended up to 6 months. Overall, 169 children were analyzed, of whom 165 were survivors and 4 were nonsurvivors. cTnI levels were significantly higher in nonsurvivors only at 24 hours (p = 0.047). Children undergoing surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) had significantly higher cTnI concentrations compared with those without CPB (p<0.001). Logistic regression analysis was performed on the 146 children in the CPB group with the following predictive variables: CPB time, postoperative cTnI concentrations, the presence of a cyanotic malformation, and intramyocardial incision. None of the variables predicted mortality. Postoperative cTnI concentrations did not predict 6 months׳ mortality. Only cTnI at 24 hours predicted the length of stay in the pediatric intensive care unit.
CONCLUSIONS: This study did not find that postoperative cTnI concentration predicted midterm mortality after normothermic congenital heart surgery. (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01616394)."

BACKGROUND: LSG has become the most common bariatric operation worldwide. Its long-term metabolic effects in patients with T2DM are, however, unknown.
METHODS: Outcomes of 134 patients with obesity with T2DM who underwent LSG at an academic center during 2005 to 2010 and had at least 5 years of follow-up were assessed.
RESULTS: At a median postsurgical follow-up of 6 years (range: 5-9), a mean body mass index loss of -7.8 ± 5.1 kg/m (total weight loss: 16.8% ± 9.7%) was associated with a reduction in mean glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c, -1.3 ± 1.8%, P < 0.001), fasting blood glucose (-37.8 ± 70.4 mg/dL, P < 0.001) and median number of diabetes medications (-1, P < 0.001). Long-term glycemic control (HbA1c <7%) was seen in 63% of patients (vs 31% at baseline, P < 0.001), diabetes remission (HbA1c <6.5% off medications) in 26%, complete remission (HbA1c <6% off medications) in 11%, and ""cure"" (continuous complete remission for ≥5 years) was achieved in 3%. Long-term relapse of T2DM after initial remission occurred in 44%. Among patients with relapse, 67% maintained glycemic control (HbA1c <7%). On adjusted analysis, taking 2 or more diabetes medications at baseline predicted less long-term remission (odds ratio 0.19, 95% confidence interval 0.07-0.55, P = 0.002) and more relapse of T2DM (odds ratio 8.50, 95% confidence interval: 1.40-49.20, P = 0.02). Significant improvement in triglycerides (-53.7 ± 116.4 mg/dL, P < 0.001), high-density lipoprotein (8.2 ± 12.9 mg/dL, P < 0.001), systolic (-8.9 ± 18.7 mmHg, P < 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (-2.6 ± 14.5 mmHg, P = 0.04), and cardiovascular risk (13% relative reduction, P < 0.001) was observed.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of preoperative index-level range of motion (ROM) and disc height on postoperative ROM after cervical total disc arthroplasty (TDA) using compressible disc prostheses.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Clinical studies demonstrate benefits of motion preservation over fusion; however, questions remain unanswered as to which preoperative factors have the ability to identify patients who are most likely to have good postoperative motion, which is the primary rationale for TDA.
METHODS: We analyzed prospectively collected data from a single-arm, multicenter study with 2-year follow up of 30 patients with 48 implanted levels. All received compressible cervical disc prostheses of 6 mm-height (M6C, Spinal Kinetics, Sunnyvale, CA). The influence of index-level preoperative disc height and ROM (each with two levels: below-median and above-median) on postoperative ROM was analyzed using 2 x 2 ANOVA. We further analyzed the radiographic outcomes of a subset of discs with preoperative height less than 3 mm, the so-called ""collapsed"" discs.
RESULTS: Shorter (3.0 ± 0.4 mm) discs were significantly less mobile preoperatively than taller (4.4 ± 0.5 mm) discs (6.7° vs. 10.5°, P = 0.01). The postoperative ROM did not differ between the shorter and taller discs (5.6° vs. 5.0°, P = 0.63). Tall discs that were less mobile preoperatively had significantly smaller postoperative ROM than short discs with above-median preoperative mobility (P < 0.05). The ""collapsed discs"" (n = 8) were less mobile preoperatively compared with all discs combined (5.1° vs. 8.6°, P < 0.01). These discs were distracted to more than two times the preoperative height, from 2.6 to 5.7 mm, and had significantly greater postoperative ROM than all discs combined (7.6° vs. 5.3°, P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: We observed a significant interaction between preoperative index-level disc height and ROM in influencing postoperative ROM. Although limited by small sample size, the results suggest discs with preoperative height less than 3 mm may be amenable to disc arthroplasty using compressible disc prostheses.

27434225,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27434225/,"BACKGROUND: Most major cancer organizations seek to reduce sociodemographic disparities in high-risk cancers partly by increasing access to theoretically high-quality, academic-oriented cancer care. The objective of this study was to determine whether academic centers have less sociodemographic treatment disparities than community centers using high-risk prostate cancer as a test case.
METHODS: The National Cancer Data Base was used to identify 138,019 patients who were diagnosed with nonmetastatic, high-risk prostate cancer from 2004 to 2012. Multivariable logistic analysis was used to identify independent determinants of definitive therapy. The Gray test and multivariable Cox regression were used to analyze the timing of therapy. All analyses were stratified by academic versus community cancer center.
RESULTS: Compared with white or privately insured patients, black, Hispanic, and uninsured patients with prostate cancer were less likely to receive definitive therapy at both community centers (adjusted odds ratio: 0.60 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.56-0.64], 0.69 [95% CI, 0.61-0.78], and 0.25 [95% CI, 0.22-0.30], respectively) and academic cancer centers (adjusted odds ratio: 0.50 [95% CI, 0.46-0.54], 0.56 [95% CI, 0.50-0.64], and 0.31 [95% CI, 0.28-0.36], respectively). Among patients who received definitive therapy, black, Hispanic, and uninsured patients were more likely to experience treatment delays at both community centers (≥15, ≥ 10, and ≥19 days, respectively; all Gray P < .001) and academic centers (≥19, ≥ 11, and ≥18 days, respectively); treatment delays were observed among the aforementioned groups even after multivariable Cox regression analysis (P < .001 for all adjusted hazard ratios).
CONCLUSIONS: Nationally, academic cancer centers demonstrate similarly high rates of sociodemographic disparities in cancer treatment patterns as community cancer centers. Making community centers conform to academic center standards may not necessarily reduce treatment disparities. Cancer 2016;122:3371-3377. © 2016 American Cancer Society."
27434359,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27434359/,"UNLABELLED: We performed a retrospective pilot study on a group of symptomatic patients attending our community heart failure clinic with left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD), rising or elevated LV end diastolic pressure, elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), but with no clinical or radiographic evidence of heart failure; a group we hypothesised may be in the pre-HFPEF stage.
METHODS: Those with LVEF >45% and LV diastolic dysfunction were included and divided into two groups: E/e' <15 and E/e' ≥15 corresponding with rising and raised LVEDP, respectively. Clinical events (deaths and hospital admissions) were compared at 1year and were grouped into all-cause events or cardiovascular events. The total numbers of all-cause and cardiovascular events of the individual groups and the entire cohort were assessed at 1year.
RESULTS: Out of 584 screened, 80 patients were included. Thirty five patients had E/e' <15 and 45 had E/e' ≥15. At 1year follow-up the 1year all-cause events in the E/e' ≥15 group was higher compared to the E/e' <15 group (p=0.03). At 12months, in the entire cohort there were a total of 45 clinical events (39 hospital admissions and 6 deaths) out of which 20 events were cardiovascular.
CONCLUSION: Patients in the pre-HFPEF stage had many events and those with elevated E/e' ≥15 had a poor 1year outcome. As this was strongly influenced by comorbidities we suggest close monitoring of these patients in dedicated HFPEF clinics along with vigorous management of comorbidities."
27435165,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27435165/,"BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that mindfulness is a protective factor that buffers individuals from experiencing severe posttraumatic stress following exposure to a trauma. We aimed to examine the association between dispositional (trait) mindfulness and posttraumatic stress in individuals who had been exposed to the trauma of a natural disaster.
METHOD: A disaster group (n = 25) consisting of Norwegian tourists who survived the 2004 South East Asian tsunami at a location with high mortality rates was recruited. Dispositional mindfulness and posttraumatic stress were measured with the Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised Version, respectively.
RESULTS: There was no significant association between mindfulness and posttraumatic stress. Moreover, there were no significant associations between posttraumatic stress and the mindfulness sub-facets of observing, acting with awareness, non-judging, and non-reacting. However, there was a significant positive correlation between the descriptive factor of mindfulness and IES-R total. There were no significant linear correlations between the five sub-facets of mindfulness and the three categories of posttraumatic symptoms, intrusion, avoidance and hyper-arousal.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings do not indicate a relationship between dispositional mindfulness and posttraumatic stress levels after exposure to a trauma, except for the descriptive sub-facet of mindfulness and here the correlation is positive and not negative as would be expected if mindfulness is a protective factor for posttraumatic stress. Future studies should investigate the relationship between mindfulness and posttraumatic stress while accounting for factors such as trauma history, type of trauma, and individual differences in traumatic stress reactions."

In this study, we investigated whether or not EMT has a role in radiocontrast-induced nephropathy. Radiocontrast medium might be triggering reversible EMT via serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK 1). We investigated the effect of different concentrations of the contrast agent iopromide on human proximal tubule cell (HK-2) culture by measuring the level of SGK1, snail family zinc finger 1 (SNAIL1), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), and collagen type I alpha 1 (COL1A1).
METHODS: We conducted a scratch assay and qPCR. HK-2 cells were cultured in the petri dishes/flasks and starved with serum-free medium. The 40, 20, and 10 mg/mL doses of iopromide were administrated to cells. The scratches were photographed immediately and again at the 20th hour. The levels of gene expression of SGK1, SNAIL1, CTGF, and COL1A1 were measured using the real-time qPCR system at the end of the 24th hour.
RESULTS: Iopromide caused the breaking of intercellular connections, the disappearance of the cobblestone appearance of cells, and the migration of cells at the 20th hour in the scratch assay. It also increased the expression of SGK1, SNAIL1, CTGF, and COL1A1 genes.
CONCLUSION: Our study concluded that certain important markers of EMT increase in different concentrations of the contrast agent. High osmolality might trigger EMT. The relationship between contrast agent and EMT has not been defined before. Further in vivo and in vitro studies are required."
27435353,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27435353/,"INTRODUCTION: In this study, we aimed to evaluate Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) in patients with acute rheumatic carditis during the acute phase and after anti-inflammatory therapy.
METHODS: Pediatric patients diagnosed with acute rheumatic carditis (ARC) between 2006 and 2014 and age- and sex-matched controls were retrospectively analyzed. At the time of diagnosis and after 2 months of medical therapy, we reviewed the obtained demographic features; echocardiographic data; complete blood count reports, including RDW; acute phase reactants, including C-reactive protein; and erythrocyte sedimentation rate values.
RESULTS: The number of the cases with ARC and age- and sex-matched controls were 100 and 110, respectively. The mean age of patients was 11.6 ± 2.5 years. WBC and platelet counts, RDW were found to be significantly higher in patient group compared with controls at the time of diagnosis, prior to the onset of treatment. RDW, platelet count, CRP, and ESR levels significantly decreased after an 8 weeks of medical treatment. RDW values after the medical treatment were still significantly higher compared with controls. RDW values were significantly higher in patients with multiple valvular involvement both prior to and after the treatment. Moreover, we found a significant and positive correlation between the RDW and the severity of mitral regurgitation in our patients (r: 0.46, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: High levels of RDW after initial medical treatment may indicate an ongoing subtle inflammatory process that leads to future stenotic valvular lesions. However, long-term follow-up studies are needed involving adulthood period to support this hypothesis."
27435695,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27435695/,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Technology is becoming increasingly integral to the practice of occupational therapists and part of the everyday lives of clients. 'Generation Y' are purported to be naturally technologically skilled as they have grown up in the digital age. The aim of this study was to explore one cohort of 'Generation Y' occupational therapy students' skills and confidence in the use of technologies relevant to contemporary practice.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey design was used to collect data from a cohort of 274 students enrolled in an Australian undergraduate occupational therapy programme.
RESULTS: A total of 173 (63%) students returned the survey. Those born prior to 1982 were removed from the data. This left 155 (56%) 'Generation Y' participants. Not all participants reported to be skilled in everyday technologies although most reported to be skilled in word, Internet and mobile technologies. Many reported a lack of skills in Web 2.0 (collaboration and sharing) technologies, creating and using media and gaming, as well as a lack of confidence in technologies relevant to practice, including assistive technology, specialist devices, specialist software and gaming.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the results suggested that this group of 'Generation Y' students were not universally skilled in all areas of technology relevant to practice but appear to be skilled in technologies they use regularly. Recommendations are therefore made with view to integrating social networking, gaming, media sharing and assistive technology into undergraduate programmes to ensure that graduates have the requisite skills and confidence required for current and future practice."

METHODS: We retrospectively selected 81 patients who underwent (i) whole-gland HIFU ablation between 2007 and 2011 as first-line therapy or salvage treatment after radiotherapy or brachytherapy, and (ii) pre- and postoperative MRI. On preoperative imaging, two senior (R1, R2) and one junior (R3) readers assessed the number of sectors invaded by the lesion with the highest Likert score (dominant lesion) using a 27-sector diagram. On postoperative imaging, readers assessed destruction of the dominant lesion using a three-level score. Multivariate analysis included the number of sectors invaded by the dominant lesion, its Likert and destruction scores, the pre-HIFU prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, Gleason score, and the clinical setting (primary/salvage).
RESULTS: The most significant predictor was the number of prostate sectors invaded by the dominant lesion for R2 and R3 (p≤0.001) and the destruction score of the dominant lesion for R1 (p = 0.011). The pre-HIFU PSA level was an independent predictor for R2 (p = 0.014), but with only marginal significance for R1 (p = 0.059) and R3 (p = 0.053).
CONCLUSION: The dominant lesion's size and destruction assessed by MRI provide independent prognostic information compared with usual predictors.
KEY POINTS: • The size of the MR-dominant lesion significantly influences post-HIFU recurrence-free survival. • The destruction score of the MR-dominant lesion predicts post-HIFU recurrence-free survival. • Patients with a completely devascularized MR-dominant lesion show better recurrence-free survival • Pre- and post-HIFU MRI provide prognostic information independent of usual predictors."
27436025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27436025/,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the significance of fat in the radiofrequency ablation (RFA) zone of hepatocellular adenomas (HCA), and its association with tumoral fat and hepatic steatosis.
METHODS: The radiological archive was searched for patients with ablated HCAs and follow-up magnetic resonance imaging between January 2008 and June 2014. Age, sex, risk factors and duration of clinical and imaging follow-up were recorded. Pre-RFA imaging was assessed for tumour size, intra-tumoral fat and steatosis. Post-RFA imaging was reviewed for size, enhancement and intra-ablational fat. Intra-ablational fat was classified as peripheral, central or mixed; the association of these distributions with steatosis and tumoral fat was assessed using Fisher's exact test.
RESULTS: Sixteen patients with 26 ablated HCAs were included. Fat was present in 23/26 (88 %) ablation zones. Only 1/26 (4 %) showed serial enlargement and enhancement suggestive of residual disease; the enhancing area did not contain fat. All remaining ablations showed involution and/or diminishing fat content without suspicious enhancement (mean follow-up, 27 months; range, 2-84 months). The peripheral and mixed/central patterns of intra-ablational fat were associated with steatosis (P = 0.0005) and tumoral fat (P = 0.0003), respectively.
CONCLUSION: Fat in the ablation zone of HCAs is a common finding which, in isolation, does not indicate residual tumour.
KEY POINTS: • Fat in the RFA zone of HCAs is a common finding on MRI. • The distribution of fat is associated with hepatic steatosis and intra-tumoral fat. • In isolation, intra-ablational fat of treated HCAs does not indicate residual tumour."

METHODS: 531 consecutive patients were treated with CT-guided lumbar interlaminar epidural injections with steroids and local anaesthetics. 411 patients received a particulate steroid and 120 patients received a non-particulate steroid. Pain levels were assessed using the 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS) and overall reported 'improvement' was assessed using the Patients Global Impression of Change (PGIC) at 1 day, 1 week and 1 month post-injection. Descriptive and inferential statistics were applied.
RESULTS: Patients receiving particulate steroids had statistically significantly higher NRS change scores (p = 0.0001 at 1 week; p = 0.0001 at 1 month). A significantly higher proportion of patients receiving particulate steroids reported relevant improvement (PGIC) at both 1 week and 1 month post injection (p = 0.0001) and they were significantly less likely to report worsening at 1 week (p = 0.0001) and 1 month (p = 0.017).
CONCLUSION: Patients treated with particulate steroids had significantly greater pain relief and were much more likely to report clinically relevant overall 'improvement' at 1 week and 1 month compared to the patients treated with non-particulate steroids.
KEY POINTS: • CT-guided epidural injections of the lumbar spine with particulate vs. non-particulate steroids. • Good outcomes with particulate steroids. • Less pain relief in patients with non-particulate steroids. • Less improvement in patients with non-particulate steroids."
27436228,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27436228/,"AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) and vitamin D, nerve growth factor (NGF) and oxidative stress markers in patients with type 1 diabetes.
METHODS: Ninety-six patients with type 1 diabetes were included in the study. All patients were evaluated for DPN with Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument. Fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, lipid parameters, 25 (OH) D3, NGF, total oxidant status, total antioxidant status and oxidative stress index were measured.
RESULTS: Twenty-six patients (27 %) had DPN (group 1) and 70 patients did not have neuropathy (group 2). When the groups were evaluated with respect to general demographic characteristics, no differences were detected. Mean age, duration of diabetes and retinopathy were found significantly higher in patients who had neuropathy. Glomerular filtration rate levels were significantly lower in the neuropathy group. Between the groups, 25 (OH) vitamin D levels were significantly lower in the neuropathy group, while there were no differences in NGF levels or in oxidative stress markers. Michigan neuropathy examination score was positively correlated with age, and diabetes duration was negatively correlated with 25 (OH) vitamin D levels. In addition, 25 (OH) vitamin D was positively correlated with NGF. In the logistic regression analysis to determine the independent variables that will affect the development of neuropathy, duration of diabetes was detected as the only factor (p = 0.039, OR = 1.071).
CONCLUSION: It seems that the most important risk factor for the development of neuropathy in type 1 diabetic patients is disease duration."
27437055,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27437055/,"BACKGROUND: A critical consideration when applying the results of a clinical trial to a particular patient is the degree of similarity of the patient to the trial population. However, similarity assessment rarely is practical in the clinical setting. Here, we explore means to support similarity assessment by clinicians.
METHODS: A scale chart was developed to represent the distribution of reported clinical and demographic characteristics of clinical trial participant populations. Constructed for an individual patient, the scale chart shows the patient's similarity to the study populations in a graphical manner. A pilot test case was conducted using case vignettes assessed by clinicians. Two pairs of clinical trials were used, each addressing a similar clinical question. Scale charts were manually constructed for each simulated patient. Clinicians were asked to estimate the degree of similarity of each patient to the populations of a pair of trials. Assessors relied on either the scale chart, a summary table (aligning characteristics of 2 trial populations), or original trial reports. Assessment time and between-assessor agreement were compared. Population characteristics considered important by assessors were recorded.
RESULTS: Six assessors evaluated 6 cases each. Using a visual scale chart, agreement between physicians was higher and the time required for similarity assessment was comparable.
CONCLUSION: We suggest that further research is warranted to explore visual tools facilitating the choice of the most applicable clinical trial to a specific patient. Automating patient and trial population characteristics extraction is key to support this effort."
27437703,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27437703/,"PURPOSE: It is plausible that breast tissue is particularly susceptible to carcinogens, including ethanol, between menarche and the first full-term pregnancy (""first pregnancy""). There is some epidemiological evidence that intake before the first pregnancy is more closely associated with risk of breast cancer than is intake thereafter. We examined this association using lifetime alcohol consumption data from a prospective cohort study.
METHODS: We calculated usual alcohol intake for age periods 15-19 years and for 10-year period from age 20 to current age (in grams per day) using recalled frequency and quantity of beverage-specific consumption for 13,630 parous women who had their first pregnancy at age 20 years or later, had no cancer history and were aged 40-69 years at enrollment. Cox regression was performed to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95 % confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: A total of 651 incident invasive adenocarcinomas of the breast were diagnosed during a mean follow-up of 16.1 years. Alcohol consumption was low overall with only a few drinking ≥40 g/day. Intake before the first pregnancy was markedly lower (mean intake: 2.5 g/day; abstention: 58.8 %) than intake thereafter (mean intake: 6.0 g/day; abstention: 33.6 %). Any alcohol intake before the first pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (HR 1.35, 95 % CI 1.10-1.66 for drinking compared with abstention), whereas any intake after the first pregnancy was not (HR 0.89, 95 % CI 0.72-1.09).
CONCLUSIONS: Limiting alcohol intake before the first pregnancy might reduce women's risk of breast cancer."
27437763,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27437763/,"OBJECTIVE: This study examines the efficacy and long-term safety of a midline sparing decompression for patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS). We specifically looked at the rate of re-operation with a lumbar fusion. Of the patients that did require a secondary fusion procedure, we examined retrospectively any risk factors (both clinical and radiological) that could have been identified pre-operatively to predict the necessity of a primary fusion procedure.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data was collected prospectively within a single surgeon practice at our institution. All patients had a diagnosis of neurogenic claudication secondary to DS. Radiological and clinical risk factors that could have predicted the requirement of a fusion procedure were retrospectively analysed.
RESULTS: This is a study of 70 patients (46F:24M). The median age at surgery was 68 years. All patients had a diagnosis of neurogenic claudication and were treated with a mid-line sparing decompression. Following the primary procedure, patients' VAS and ODI scores for both leg and back pain improved significantly both at short-term follow-up (mean seven months) and sustained at long-term follow-up (range 16-57 months, mean 33 months; p < 0.0001 Wilcoxon matched pair ranks). Eight (11%) patients had symptom progression and required a further fusion procedure. We found that if on the pre-operative MRI, the patient had a facet joint angle of greater than 60°, and a preserved disc height (greater than 7 mm) this would increase the likelihood of the requirement for fusion. Of the patients that required a secondary fusion procedure, 6/8 patients (75%) had sagittal facets, hyperlordosis and a preserved disc height pre-operatively.
CONCLUSIONS: A primary decompression using a midline sparing osteotomy is an effective procedure for the treatment of neurogenic claudication caused by DS. The second message is that on inspection of the pre-operative imaging, sagittally placed facet joints, a hyperlordosis and a preserved disc height then a fusion procedure should be considered primarily."
27438006,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27438006/,"PURPOSE: Allografts are frequently used for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. However, due to the inherent risk of infection, a method that achieves complete sterilization of grafts is warranted without impairing their biomechanical properties. Fractionation of electron beam (FEbeam) irradiation has been shown to maintain similar biomechanical properties compared to fresh-frozen allografts (FFA) in vitro. Therefore, aim of this study was to evaluate the biomechanical properties and early remodelling of grafts that were sterilized with fractionated high-dose electron beam irradiation in an in vivo sheep model.
METHODS: ACL reconstruction was performed in 18 mature merino mix sheep. Sixteen were reconstructed with allografts sterilized with FEbeam irradiation (8 × 3.4 kGy) and two with FFA. Eight FFA from prior studies with identical surgical reconstruction and biomechanical and histological analyzes served as controls. Half of the animals were sacrificed at 6 and 12 weeks, and biomechanical testing was performed. Anterior-posterior laxity (APL) was assessed with an AP drawer test at 60° flexion, and load to failure testing was carried out. Histological evaluation of mid-substance samples was performed for descriptive analysis, cell count, crimp and vessel density. For statistical analysis a Kruskal-Wallis test was used for overall group comparison followed by a Mann-Whitney U test for pairwise comparison of the histological and biomechanical parameters.
RESULTS: Biomechanical testing showed significantly decreased stiffness in FEbeam compared to FFA at both time points (p ≤ 0.004). APL was increased in FEbeam compared to FFA, which was significant at 6 weeks (p = 0.004). Median of failure loads was decreased in FEbeam grafts, with 12 reconstructions already failing during cyclic loading. Vessel density was decreased in FEbeam compared to FFA at both time points, with significant differences at 12 weeks (p = 0.015). Crimp length was significantly shorter in FEbeam compared to FFA at both time points (p ≤ 0.004) and decreased significantly in both groups from 6 to 12 weeks (p ≤ 0.025).
CONCLUSION: ACL reconstruction with fractionated Ebeam sterilization significantly alters the biomechanical properties and the early remodelling process of treated grafts in vivo. Therefore, this sterilization method cannot be recommended for clinical application. As substantial changes in the remodelling are inherent in this study, care in the rehabilitation of even low-dose sterilized allografts, used for ACL reconstruction, is recommended."
27438032,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27438032/,"BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most common malignant neoplasm in the female population. However, stomach is a rare site for metastasis, and can show up many years after initial diagnosis and treatment of the primary tumor.
AIM: Analyze a case series of this tumor and propose measures that can diagnose it with more precocity.
METHODS: Were analyzed 12 patients with secondary gastric tumors. Immunohistochemistry has demonstrated that primary tumor was breast cancer. We retrieved information of age, histological type, interval between diagnosis of the primary breast cancer and its metastases, immunohistochemistry results, treatment and survival.
RESULTS: The mean age was 71.3 years (ranging 40-86). Ten cases had already been underwent mastectomy in the moment of the diagnosis of gastric metastasis. Two patients had diagnosis of both primary and secondary tumors concomitantly. At average, diagnosis of gastric metastasis was seven years after diagnosis of primary breast cancer (ranging 0-13). Besides, nine cases had also metastases in other organs, being bones the most affected ones. Immunohistochemistry of the metastases has shown positivity for CK7 antibody in 83.34%, estrogen receptor in 91.67%, progesterone receptor in 66.67% and AE1AE3 antibody in 75%, considering all 12 cases. Moreover, CK20 was absent significantly (66.67%). The positivity of BRST2 marker did not present statistical significance (41.67%). Eight cases were treated with chemotherapy associated or not with hormonal blockade. Surgical treatment of gastric metastasis was performed in four cases: three of them with total gastrectomy and one with distal gastrectomy. Follow-up has shown a mean survival of 14.58 months after diagnosis of metastasis, with only two patients still alive.
CONCLUSION: Patients with a history of breast cancer presenting endoscopic diagnosis of gastric cancer it is necessary to consider the possibility of gastric metastasis of breast cancer. The confirmation is by immunohistochemistry and gastrectomy should be oriented in the absence of other secondary involvement and control of the primary lesion."

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Like most colleges across the nation, this nursing program was experiencing an increase in acts of student incivility.
OPERATIONAL DEFINITIONS: Incivility, also called bullying, may include behaviors such as name calling, side conversations, and condescending language.
METHOD: The sample consisted of 94 third-semester nursing students and 6 faculty members. The Incivility in Nursing Education survey was used as a tool to measure student and faculty perceptions.
DATA ANALYSIS: Data from pre- and postimplementation surveys demonstrated scientific evidence of both faculty and student perception and a significant decrease in acts of uncivil behavior in the nursing program.
LIMITATIONS: Because the study was limited to one nursing program and included only third-semester nursing students, the results of the study may not be transferable to all nursing programs.
CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed a reduction in perceived uncivil acts of behavior in the nursing program by faculty and students."
27438781,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27438781/,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Maltreatment in childhood and adolescence is a risk factor for substance use disorders (SUDs) in adulthood. This association has rarely been investigated in the light of emotion dysregulation. To fill this gap, this study examines emotion dysregulation and SUDs among adults with a history of early maltreatment.
METHODS: Comparison of emotion dysregulation in adults with a history of early abuse and neglect who developed either an SUD (n = 105) or no mental disorder (n = 54). Further, a mediation model for the association between the severity of early maltreatment and SUDs was tested. Participants completed research diagnostic interviews for psychopathology, the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire.
RESULTS: By using hierarchical regression techniques and mediational analyses controlling for age and gender, it was possible to provide evidence for the mediating role of emotion dysregulation between early emotional and physical maltreatment and later SUDs.
CONCLUSIONS: Emotion dysregulation is a potential mechanism underlying the relationship between early emotional and physical maltreatment and the development of SUDs. In light of these findings, focusing on the early training of adaptive emotion regulation strategies after childhood maltreatment might be of considerable relevance to prevent the development of SUDs."
27438789,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27438789/,"PURPOSE: Few studies have addressed the psychological characteristics of adolescents with binge eating disorder (BED). No research has focused on the psychological functioning of these adolescents' parents or on the prevalence of traumatic experiences among them.
METHODS: In this study, 202 adolescents aged 11-13 and their parents were recruited from mental health clinics to complete the youth self-report (YSR), the response evaluation measure for youth (REM-71), the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), the Symptom Check-List (SCL-90-R), and the traumatic experience checklist (TEC).
RESULTS: Female adolescents scored higher than males on withdrawal, internalizing problems, dissociation, and somatization subscales. Boys scored higher than girls on externalizing problems and acting out subscales. Maternal depression predicted withdrawal and dissociation in female adolescents. Maternal sexual abuse predicted social problems in males and self-destructive behaviors in females. Paternal physical abuse predicted delinquent behavior and acting out in males.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that parental traumatic experiences play a role in their offspring's mental health; the data also showed different psychopathological configurations in male and female adolescents with BED and their parents, suggesting the development of prevention and treatment polices specific to gender."
27438793,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27438793/,"PURPOSE: Many surgeons are reluctant to offer elective inguinal and femoral hernia repair (IHR) to the elderly due to concerns of increased risk. The authors sought to evaluate the outcomes of elderly patients undergoing IHR compared to the general population.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of the 2011 NSQIP database evaluating 19,683 patients undergoing IHR. Patients were divided by age into three categories: <65, 65-79 and >80. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess impact of comorbid conditions and type of surgery on outcomes. Patients were analyzed for mortality and complications based on their age and the types of surgery (elective, urgent, emergent, laparoscopic versus open) and comorbid conditions.
RESULTS: There were 17,375 male patients (88 %). 92.7 % were elective. 70 % were performed using an open technique. Age distribution was 63.4 % < 65, 26.6 % 65-79, 10 % >80. Mortality was similar across age groups in elective repair. Mortality was increased in emergency repair in all age groups (p < 0.001). Mortality was increased in emergency surgery compared to elective surgery in patients >80 (OR = 57, p < 0.001). Mortality was similar between laparoscopic and open in <65 (OR = 0.96, p = 0.97) and unable to be assessed in other age groups. Dyspnea and COPD predicted higher mortality and complications with emergency surgery in the elderly (age 65-79 OR 15.3 and 14.9, respectively, age >80 OR 56.5 and 14.9, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Elective inguinal hernia repair carries a similar mortality in the elderly compared to the general population. Emergent IHR carries a very high risk of death in the elderly. The authors recommend considering elective IHR regardless of age."

The development of primary care mental health services in response to the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies initiative provides an opportunity to investigate this in more depth.
AIMS: A preliminary exploration of prevalence of IAPT service-users being treated for moderate-severe depression and/or anxiety who report that they have relatives with alcohol and/or drug problems. To explore the characteristics of the sample including comparison with those without a substance misusing relative.
METHOD: One hundred service users completed a brief questionnaire. Routine data on depression and anxiety symptoms were accessed for the full consenting sample. Descriptive statistics were used to explore the family members of substance users and differences to the rest of the sample.
RESULTS: Twenty-two of the 100 IAPT service users reported having a close relative whose use of substances was of concern to them. The group with a relative who used substances were more depressed at the beginning of treatment than the rest of the sample.
CONCLUSIONS: A significant number of people seeking psychological help for depression and anxiety within IAPT services reported being concerned about a close relative who misuses substances. They may be more distressed than those without a relative who misuses substances. Further exploration is warranted but preliminary findings indicate that this is an important research area with significant clinical implications."
27439914,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27439914/,"BACKGROUND: Evidence on physical activity (PA) and transitions out of full-time employment in middle-to-older age is mainly cross-sectional and focused upon retirement. The purpose was to examine trajectories in PA before and after transitions out of full-time employment.
METHODS: Data were obtained for 5,754 people in full-time employment aged 50-75 from the US Health and Retirement Survey. Logistic regression was used to examine trajectories in twice-weekly participation in light, moderate and vigorous PA among those transitioning to part-time work, semi-retirement, full retirement, or economic inactivity due to disability, in comparison to those remaining in full-time employment.
RESULTS: Twice weekly participation in vigorous and light physical activity changed little for those who remained in full-time employment, while moderate physical activity decreased between baseline and follow-up (OR 0.95, 95 % CI 0.91, 0.99). Differences in physical activity according to transitional categories at follow-up were evident. Baseline differences in physical activity across all intensities were greatest among participants transitioning from full-time to part-time employment compared to those who remained in full-time employment throughout the study period (vigorous OR 1.41 95 % CI 1.23, 1.61; moderate OR 1.28 95 % CI 1.12, 1.46; light OR 1.29 95 % CI 1.12, 1.49). Those transitioning to unemployment were already among the least physically active at baseline, irrespective of intensity (albeit, with 95 % CIs spanning unity). Those transitioning to full-time retirement were also among the least active (e.g. vigorous OR 0.71 95 % CI 0.61, 0.81; moderate OR 0.80 95 % CI 0.71, 0.90). Declines in physical activity were reported for those transitioning to economic inactivity due to a disability (vigorous OR 0.29 95 % CI 0.14, 0.64; moderate OR 0.56 95 % CI 0.33, 0.95; light OR 0.34 95 % CI 0.19, 0.63). Physical activity increased regardless of intensity among participants transitioning to semi-retirement (p > 0.05) and full retirement (e.g. vigorous OR 1.28 95 % CI 1.09, 1.51; moderate OR 1.24 95 % CI 1.07, 1.43). Light physical activity increased for those transitioning to unemployment (OR 1.40 95 % CI 1.02, 1.93), though less change was evident in moderate or vigorous physical activity.
CONCLUSIONS: The amount and intensity of PA varies by the type of transition out of full-time employment among people in middle-to-older age."
27439923,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27439923/,"OBJECTIVE: Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) is a diagnostic tool commonly used to detect significant coronary lesion. However equivocal, false negative or positive results can be yielded. Controversial findings regarding the role of ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) in MPS evaluation persist. The aim of the present study was to examine the role of serum IMA in the assessment of MPS results.
METHODS: MPS using technetium (99mTc) sestamibi and transthoracic echocardiography was performed on 62 consecutive subjects prospectively enrolled. Exercise treadmill test (ETT) with modified Bruce protocol was used to induce coronary ischemia. During MPS performance, blood samples for serum IMA were obtained at 3 times: at pre-exercise, at the peak of ETT, and 6 hours after ETT. Patients were classified into 3 groups according to MPS results (normal, equivocal, and ischemia).
RESULTS: Sixty-two patients (23 normal, 20 equivocal, 19 with ischemia) were included. Pre- and peak-exercise IMA values were similar among the groups (p=0.706 and 0.904). Post-exercise IMA values of the normal and equivocal groups were similar (p=0.733), while that of the ischemia group was significantly higher than the values of either the normal (p<0.001) or equivocal groups (p<0.001). ΔIMA (the difference between post-exercise and peak-exercise IMA) of the ischemia group was significantly higher than that of either the normal (p<0.001) or equivocal groups (p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: Serum IMA was found to be significantly increased in cases of ischemia on MPS. Subjects with normal and equivocal MPS had a similar pattern during the test. IMA may be used in differentiation of equivocal results from false positive results."

The aim was to evaluate early outcomes, secondary patency and limb salvage rates of thrombolysed cold stored venous allograft bypasses and to compare the outcomes with thrombolysis of autologous bypasses.
METHODS: This was a single center study of consecutive patients with acute and non-acute limb ischemia between September 1, 2000, and January 1, 2014, with occlusion of cold stored venous allografts, and between January 1, 2012, and January 1, 2014, with occlusion of autologous bypass who received intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy.
RESULTS: Sixty-one patients with occlusion of an infrainguinal bypass using a cold stored venous allograft (n = 35) or an autologous bypass (n = 26) underwent percutaneous intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy. The median duration of thrombolysis was 20 h (IQR 18-24) with no difference between the groups (p = .14). The median follow up was 18.5 months (IQR 11.0-52.0). Secondary patency rates of thrombolysed bypass at 6 and 12 months were 44 ± 9% and 32 ± 9% in patients with a venous allograft bypass and 46 ± 10% and 22 ± 8% with an autologous bypass, with no difference between groups (p = .40). Limb salvage rates at 1, 6, and 12 months after thrombolysis in the venous allograft group were 83 ± 7%, 72 ± 8% and 63 ± 9%, and in the autologous group 91 ± 6%, 76 ± 9%, and 65 ± 13%, with no difference between groups (p = .69).
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term results of thrombolysis of venous allograft bypasses are similar to those of autologous bypasses. Occluded cold stored venous allograft can be successfully re-opened in most cases with a favorable effect on limb salvage."
27441401,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27441401/,"BACKGROUND: The Swiss Sentinel system for influenza virus surveillance reports influenza-like illness in the community through a network of primary care practitioners, but the epidemiologic, demographic, and virological characterization may differ from that observed in hospitalized patients with influenza.
OBJECTIVE: To compare demographic and virological data from hospital influenza cases with Sentinel system data during the 2014-2015 season.
METHODS: We included 2623 in- and outpatients with a screening request for influenza A/B in a university teaching hospital in Geneva, Switzerland, and 933 participants from the Swiss Sentinel surveillance system and compared the demographic and virological data of the two populations, including the respective distribution of influenza subtypes, and conducted a phylogenetic comparison at the HA1 level of influenza viruses recovered in community and hospital cases.
RESULTS: There were similar proportions of influenza strains recovered in the hospital and in the community (H3N2, 57.1% and 56.9%; H1N1pdm09, 15.5% and 14.2%; B, 27.4% and 28.8%, respectively). HA1 sequence analysis confirmed that all three strains were genetically similar between the two populations. During this particular season, influenza cases were detected earlier in the hospital than in the Sentinel system.
CONCLUSIONS: Although an influenza surveillance system based on the community can predict the type of influenza strains that will be associated with hospitalizations, it fails to estimate the potential virulence of circulating strains. Further, the population characteristics in the community differ from those in hospitalized patients. This suggests that any national influenza surveillance system should include both community- and hospital-based surveys."
27441474,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27441474/,"BACKGROUND: Little data address the usefulness of defibrillation testing in patients with prolonged QRS duration, known for more advanced myocardial disease. We aimed to compare baseline characteristics and outcomes between patients who underwent defibrillation testing (DT+) and those who did not (DT-), immediately after the implantation of a cardiac resynchronization therapy with defibrillator (CRT-D).
METHODS: Data from all patients with ischemic or non-ischemic cardiomyopathy implanted in primary prevention with a CRT-D in 12 French centers were considered for analysis (2002-2012).
RESULTS: Out of the 1516 patients with DT information available, DT was performed in 958(63%) patients. Compared to DT- patients, DT+ patients presented no significant differences in terms of age (65.1±10.8 vs 64.7±10.3years, p=0.45), LVEF (25%[20.0-30.0] vs 25%[20.5-30.0], p=0.30), or etiologies of heart failure (ischemic: 49.6% vs 46.9%, p=0.32). By contrast, DT+ patients were less likely to present atrial fibrillation (25.3% vs 33.4%, p=0.001), renal insufficiency (eGFR<60ml/min in 45.3% vs 51.7%, p=0.04) and NYHA functional class≥III (68.9% vs 77.4%, p=0.0006). All of the three perioperative deaths occurred in the DT+ group and were related to DT itself. After a mean follow-up of 3.1±2.1years, the adjusted incidence of overall mortality was lower among DT+ patients (adjusted HR 0.6, 95%CI 0.4-0.7, p<0.0001). However, ICD-unresponsive sudden deaths remained very rare and no more frequently observed among DT- patients (p=0.41).
CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, the higher (up to 40%) mortality at midterm among DT- patients is mainly reflecting their more severe cardiac disease, rather than a higher rate of ICD-unresponsive sudden death."
27441570,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27441570/,"PURPOSE: Given that the efficacy of employing angiosome-targeted angioplasty in the treatment of diabetic foot remains controversial, this study was conducted to examine its efficacy.
METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review and meta-analysis using core databases, extracting the treatment modality of angiosome-targeted angioplasty as the predictor variable, and limb salvage, wound healing, and revision rate as the outcome variables. We used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to assess the study quality, along with the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. We evaluated publication bias using a funnel plot.
RESULTS: The search strategy identified 518 publications. After screening these, we selected four articles for review. The meta-analysis revealed that overall limb salvage and wound healing rates were significantly higher (Odds ratio = 2.209, 3.290, p = 0.001, p<0.001) in patients who received angiosome-targeted angioplasty than in those who received nonangiosome-targeted angioplasty. The revision rate between the angiosome and nonangiosome groups was not significantly different (Odds ratio = 0.747, p = 0.314).
CONCLUSION: Although a further randomized controlled trial is required for confirmation, angiosome-targeted angioplasty in diabetic foot was more effective than nonangiosome-targeted angioplasty with respect to wound healing and limb salvage."

The aim of this study was to measure the incidence of SSI in patients undergoing reduction mammoplasty with and without antibiotic prophylaxis, comparing the results and defining the value of antibiotic prophylaxis.
METHODS: The study was randomized, double-blinded, and interventional. Two groups were formed randomly, with 75 patients in each. Group 1 received prophylactic antibiotic (cefazolin 2 g 30 min before surgery with repetition at 1 g every 3 h during surgery), and Group 2 (control) did not have antibiotic prophylaxis. Patients were followed until the 30th post-operative day for identification of SSI.
RESULTS: There were 13 cases of SSI, 3 in Group 1 (4.1%) and 10 in Group 2 (13.9%) (p = 0.039). Their secretion cultures were positive for Staphylococcus aureus. There were more cases of SSI in patients having greater resections (n = 9), but the difference was not significant (p = 0.051).
CONCLUSION: Infection was significantly more common in the group that did not receive prophylaxis."
27441597,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27441597/,"BACKGROUND: Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play a key role in bone formation. Local application of BMP2 (Dibotermin alfa) supports bone formation when applied to complex fractures. However, up to 33% of patients do not respond to this therapy.
PURPOSE: Aiming to investigate whether inter-individual responses to BMP2 treatment can be predicted by gene expression patterns, we investigated the effect of BMP2 on primary human osteoblasts and THP-1 cell-derived osteoclasts from 110 donors.
METHODS: Osteoblasts were obtained by collagenase digestion of spongy bone tissues. Osteoclasts were differentiated from THP-1 cells using the conditioned media of the osteoblasts. Viability was determined by resazurin conversion. As functional characteristics AP and Trap5B activity were measured. Gene expression levels were determined by RT-PCR in 21 of the 110 evaluated donors and visualized by electrophoresis.
RESULTS: Based on our data, we could classify three response groups: (i) In 51.8% of all donors, BMP2 treatment induced osteoblast function. These donors strongly expressed the BMP2 inhibitor Noggin (NOG), the alternative BMP2 receptors repulsive guidance molecule B (RGMb) and activin receptor-like kinase 6 (Alk6), as well as the Wnt inhibitor sclerostin (SOST). (ii) In 17.3% of all donors, BMP2 treatment induced viability. In these donors, the initial high SOST expression significantly dropped with BMP2 treatment. (iii) 30.9% of all donors were not directly affected by BMP2 treatment. These donors expressed high levels of the pseudoreceptor BMP and activin membrane-bound inhibitor (BAMBI) and lacked SOST expression. In all donors, SOST expression correlated directly with receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) expression, defining the cells' potential to stimulate osteoclastogenesis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data identified three donor groups profiting from BMP2 treatment either directly via stimulation of osteoblast function or viability and/or indirectly via inhibition of osteoclastogenesis, depending on their expression of BAMBI, SOST, NOG, and RANKL. On the basis of patients' respective expression profiles, the clinical application of BMP2 as well as its timing might be modified in order to better fit the patients' needs to promote bone formation or to inhibit bone resorption."
27441755,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27441755/,"AIMS: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of a new strategy that uses an amino acid formula in the elimination diet of infants with suspected cow's milk allergy (CMA).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This pharmacoeconomic study was developed from the perspective of the Brazilian Public Healthcare System. The new strategy proposes using an amino acid formula in the diagnostic elimination diet of infants (≤24 months) with suspected CMA. The rationale is that infants who do not respond to the amino acid formula do not suffer from CMA. Patients with a positive oral challenge test receive a therapeutic elimination diet based on Brazilian Food Allergy Guidelines. This approach was compared to the current recommendations of the Brazilian Food Allergy Guidelines. A decision model was constructed using TreeAge Pro 2012 software. Model inputs were based on a literature review and the opinions of a panel of experts. A univariate sensitivity analysis of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios was performed.
RESULTS: The mean cost per patient of the new amino acid formula strategy was R$3,341.57, while the cost of the current Brazilian guidelines strategy was R$3,641.08. The mean number of symptom-free days per patient, which was used as an indicator of effectiveness, was 900.6 and 875.7 days, respectively. The new strategy is, therefore, dominant. In the sensitivity analysis, the dominance was maintained with parameter variation.
LIMITATIONS: In the absence of information in the literature, some premises were defined by a panel of specialists.
CONCLUSIONS: The new strategy, which uses an amino acid formula in the elimination diagnostic diet followed by an oral food challenge, is a dominant pharmacoeconomic approach that has a lower cost and results in an increased number of symptom-free days."
27441999,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27441999/,"OBJECTIVES: Migraine is a debilitating condition that affects approximately 15% of the general population. It represents a huge proportion of presentations to the emergency department and a significant number of neurology admissions. Patients are often investigated with imaging. This is particularly the case with migraine with aura (MA). The yield of imaging is however low. There is limited information on Australian hospital presentations and utility of imaging. We aimed to analyse the demographics of migraine presentations to our hospital and the yield of imaging in our centre to help guide future approaches to these patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively looked at medical records of patients presenting to the western health from January 2012 to June 2013. Patients were classified as either having migraine with aura or without. Baseline demographics, cardiovascular risk factors and imaging studies (CT brain, MRI brain and carotid Doppler studies) in each group were evaluated. Patients found to have white matter hyperintensities on MRI were further evaluated.
RESULTS: We found patients with aura were more likely to have hypercholesterolemia (12% vs 7%, p=0.05). Patients with aura were more likely to be evaluated with imaging (CT brain (70% vs 41% p<0.0001) and MRI brain (44% vs 17% p<0.0001)). The patients investigated with imaging had no clinically significant findings. 21% of patients with aura were investigated with carotid Doppler studies. Only 1 patient had an abnormal result. Patients with white matter hyperintensities were older (51 vs 39 years; p<0.0001) and were more likely to have Hypertension (29% vs 14% p=0.019), Hypercholesterolemia (29% vs 11% p=0.003) and T2DM (16% vs 4% p=0.011).

27443348,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27443348/,"BACKGROUND: Alcohol consumption during attempts at smoking cessation can provoke relapse and so smokers are often advised to restrict their alcohol consumption during this time. This study assessed at a population-level whether smokers having recently initiated an attempt to stop smoking are more likely than other smokers to report i) lower alcohol consumption and ii) trying to reduce their alcohol consumption.
METHOD: Cross-sectional household surveys of 6287 last-year smokers who also completed the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test consumption questionnaire (AUDIT-C). Respondents who reported attempting to quit smoking in the last week were compared with those who did not. Those with AUDIT-C≥5 were also asked if they were currently trying to reduce the amount of alcohol they consume.
RESULTS: After adjustment for socio-demographic characteristics and current smoking status, smokers who reported a quit attempt within the last week had lower AUDIT-C scores compared with those who did not report an attempt in the last week (βadj = -0.56, 95 % CI = -1.08 to -0.04) and were less likely to be classified as higher risk (AUDIT-C≥5: ORadj = 0.57, 95 % CI = 0.38 to 0.85). The lower AUDIT-C scores appeared to be a result of lower scores on the frequency of 'binge' drinking item (βadj = -0.25, 95 % CI = -0.43 to -0.07), with those who reported a quit attempt within the last week compared with those who did not being less likely to binge drink at least weekly (ORadj = 0.54, 95 % CI = 0.29 to 0.999) and more likely to not binge drink at all (ORadj = 1.70, 95 % CI = 1.16 to 2.49). Among smokers with higher risk consumption (AUDIT-C≥5), those who reported an attempt to stop smoking within the last week compared with those who did not were more likely to report trying to reduce their alcohol consumption (ORadj = 2.98, 95 % CI = 1.48 to 6.01).
CONCLUSION: Smokers who report starting a quit attempt in the last week also report lower alcohol consumption, including less frequent binge drinking, and appear more likely to report currently attempting to reduce their alcohol consumption compared with smokers who do not report a quit attempt in the last week."
27443620,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27443620/,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, second primary gastrointestinal tumors are not uncommon. However, it is unclear whether a screening endoscopy is needed for detecting gastrointestinal neoplasm in patients with head and neck cancer. Therefore, we analyzed the prevalence and independent risk factors for second primary gastrointestinal neoplasm in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.
METHODS: A consecutive series of 328 patients with primary head and neck squamous cell carcinoma that underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy or colonoscopy were included using our registry. An age- and sex-matched group of 328 control subjects was enrolled. We assessed risk factors of synchronous gastrointestinal cancer.
RESULTS: The prevalence of esophageal cancer with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma was significantly higher than that of the control group (1.5% vs. 0.0%, p=0.011). An age of 54 years or more (OR, 1.033; 95% CI, 1.008-1.059; p=0.009) and male gender (OR, 4.974; 95% CI, 1.648-15.013; p=0.004) were risk factors for concomitant colorectal cancer or adenomas in the head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative colonoscopy can be recommended for detecting synchronous second primary colorectal lesions in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients with male sex regardless of age, and esophagogastroduodenoscopy is necessary in all head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients for detecting esophageal cancer."
27443758,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27443758/,"OBJECTIVES: Mycological contamination of occupational environments can be a result of fungal spores' dispersion in the air and on surfaces. Therefore, it is very important to assess it in both types of the samples. In the present study we assessed fungal contamination in the air and in the surface samples to show relevance of surfaces sampling in complementing the results obtained in the air samples.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In total, 42 settings were assessed by the analysis of air and surfaces samples. The settings were divided into settings with a high fungal load (7 poultry farms and 7 pig farms, 3 cork industries, 3 waste management plants, 2 wastewater treatment plants and 1 horse stable) and a low fungal load (10 hospital canteens, 8 college canteens and 1 maternity hospital). In addition to culture-based methods, molecular tools were also applied to detect fungal burden in the settings with a higher fungal load.
RESULTS: From the 218 sampling sites, 140 (64.2%) presented different species in the examined surfaces when compared with the species identified in the air. A positive association in the high fungal load settings was found between the presence of different species in the air and surfaces. Wastewater treatment plants constituted the setting with the highest number of different species between the air and surface.
CONCLUSIONS: We observed that surfaces sampling and application of molecular tools showed the same efficacy of species detection in high fungal load settings, corroborating the fact that surface sampling is crucial for a correct and complete analysis of occupational scenarios."

METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis, including detailed pathologic and radiologic review, of pancreatic cancer patients undergoing FOLFIRINOX, with or without radiation therapy (RT), prior to surgical resection at a high-volume academic center over a 4-year period.
RESULTS: Of 26 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 22 (84.6%) received FOLFIRINOX alone without RT (median number of treatment cycles = 9). The majority of patients met formal radiographic criteria for BRPC, with the superior mesenteric vein representing the most common vessel involved. R0 resection rate was 90.9%, with 12 patients (54.5%) requiring vascular reconstruction. Treatment response was classified as moderate or marked in 16 patients (72.7%) according to the College of American Pathologists grading system. Estimated median disease-free and overall survival rates are 22.6 months and not reached (NR), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the largest series to describe the use of neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX, without radiation therapy, in patients with BRPC undergoing surgical resection. Given the high R0 resection rates and favorable clinical outcomes with chemotherapy alone, this strategy should be further assessed in prospective study design. J. Surg.

27444815,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27444815/,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the reliability of the Guy's Stone Score, the Seoul National University Renal Stone Complexity (S-ReSC) score and the S.T.O.N.E. scores in percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL), and assess their utility in discriminating outcomes [stone free rate (SFR), complications, need for multiple PCNL sessions, and auxiliary procedures] valid across parameters of experience of surgeon, independence from surgical approach, and variations in institution-specific instrumentation.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospectively maintained database of two tertiary institutions was analysed (606 cases). Institutes differed in instrumentation, while the overall surgical team comprised: two trainees (experience <100 cases), two junior consultants (experience 100-200 cases), and two senior surgeons (experience >1000 cases). Scores were assigned and re-assigned after 4 months by one trainee and an expert surgeon. Inter-rater and test-retest agreement were analysed by Cohen's κ and intraclass correlation coefficient. Multivariate logistic regression models were created adjusting outcomes for the institution, comorbidity, Amplatz size, access tract location, the number of punctures, the experience level of the surgeon, and individual scoring system, and receiver operating curves were analysed for comparison.
RESULTS: Despite some areas of inconsistencies, individually all scores had excellent inter-rater and test-retest concordance. On multivariable analyses, while the experience of the surgeon and surgical approach characteristics (such as access tract location, Amplatz size, and number of punctures) remained independently associated with different outcomes in varying combinations, calculus complexity scores were found consistently to be independently associated with all outcomes. The S-ReSC score had a superior association with SFR, the need for multiple PCNL sessions, and auxiliary procedures.
CONCLUSION: Individually all scoring systems performed well. On cross comparison, the S-ReSC score consistently emerged to be more superiorly associated with all outcomes, signifying the importance of the distributional complexity of the calculus (which also indirectly amalgamates the influence of stone number, size, and anatomical location) in discriminating outcomes. Our study proves the utility of scoring systems in prognosticating multiple outcomes and also clarifies important aspects of their practical application including future roles such as benchmarking, audit, training, and objective assessment of surgical technique modifications."
27445066,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27445066/,"PURPOSE: There is some debate regarding whether artificial reproductive technology (ART) constitutes an independent risk factor for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). We wanted to assess the prevalence of ART in multiple birth infants seen for ROP screening and whether or not ROP was identified or treated, in order to evaluate whether ART contributes a risk factor for ROP independent of the generation of multiple births.
METHODS: A retrospective audit was performed of all multiple birth babies admitted to a tertiary neonatal unit who met the UK ROP screening criteria (<32 weeks gestational age [GA] and/or <1,501 g birthweight [BW]).
RESULTS: A total of 205 babies met our criteria, of whom 87.3% were twins. A total of 39.5% were born following ART. A total of 30.5% of the non-ART group developed ROP vs 34% of the ART group (p = 0.837). Stage 3 ROP developed in 5.1% of non-ART babies and 6% of ART babies. A total of 8.5% of non-ART babies and 10% of ART babies required treatment for ROP. Logistic regression demonstrated that ART was not independently associated with development of ROP.
CONCLUSIONS: Artificial reproductive technology multiple birth babies make up a considerable proportion of the ROP screening burden and their number is likely to increase as ART is increasingly available and utilized. We found no significant difference between the numbers of babies developing ROP in the ART vs non-ART groups, but the numbers are small. The estimated odds of developing ROP are slightly higher in the ART babies, so our data do not rule out a possible association."

METHODS: All living New Zealand residents incurring a SCI before 1 January 1990 were eligible. A co-ordinated consultation with apposite New Zealand organisations was undertaken to identify and access existing SCI databases, and remove duplicate or ineligible records.
RESULTS: 1,400 people were identified. Using the national patient information management system to determine eligibility, 1,174 people remained after exclusions; 600 (51.1%) through the Auckland Spinal Rehabilitation Unit and 574 (48.9%) through the Burwood Spinal Unit. Common to both databases were people's National Health Index number, contact details, basic demographic data, date of injury, and neurological level of SCI.
CONCLUSIONS: An unexpectedly large SCI population was uncovered; a population largely hidden due to the uncoordinated, fragmented and inconsistently collected information held within different organisations. As life expectancy rapidly increases for those with SCI, coupled with an accelerated ageing general population, this hidden SCI population can be expected to grow. A single, well-managed and coordinated national SCI registry is urgently needed in New Zealand for planning and delivery of services, especially for those developing age-related complex interwoven secondary conditions."

Therefore, one could expect that the design processes of professionals and of student designers are conducted differently, and that these processes consist of different components (steps, actions, methods, tools, etc. used in the design process).
OBJECTIVE: The differences and similarities between the design processes of design students and professionals were studied. In addition the effect of the designers experience on the design process is studied.
METHODS: The design processes of seating products of 19 professional designers, 15 master students and 16 bachelor students were compared in order to understand the differences in the components they apply in their design process.
RESULTS: The results showed significant differences between professional designers and design students for eight out of fifteen of the components. The components for which differences were found were applied more frequently by professionals than by students. For six of the components significant positive correlations were found with the designer's experience.
CONCLUSIONS: There are significant differences between the design processes of design students as well as similarities. The differences amongst others related to the designers' experience."

Wide interindividual variations in drug disposition warrant frequent doses adjustments, but there is a lack of international consensus on dose adjustment guidelines.
PROCEDURE: To identify relapse predictors, we collected 28,255 data sets on drug doses and blood counts (median: 47/patient) and analyzed erythrocyte (Ery) levels of cytotoxic 6MP/MTX metabolites in 9,182 blood samples (median: 14 samples/patient) from 532 children on MTX/6MP maintenance therapy targeted to a white blood cell count (WBC) of 1.5-3.5 × 10 /l.
RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 13.8 years for patients in remission, stepwise Cox regression analysis did not find age, average doses of 6MP and MTX, hemoglobin, absolute lymphocyte counts, thrombocyte counts, or Ery levels of 6-thioguanine nucleotides or MTX (including its polyglutamates) to be significant relapse predictors. The parameters significantly associated with risk of relapse (N = 83) were male sex (hazard ratio [HR] 2.0 [1.3-3.1], P = 0.003), WBC at diagnosis (HR = 1.04 per 10 × 10 /l rise [1.00-1.09], P = 0.048), the absolute neutrophil count (ANC; HR = 1.7 per 10 /l rise [1.3-2.4], P = 0.0007), and Ery thiopurine methyltransferase activity (HR = 2.7 per IU/ml rise [1.1-6.7], P = 0.03). WBC was significantly related to ANC (Spearman correlation coefficient, r  = 0.77; P < 0.001), and only a borderline significant risk factor for relapse (HR = 1.28 [95% CI: 1.00-1.64], P = 0.046) when ANC was excluded from the Cox model.
CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that a low neutrophil count is likely to be the best hematological target for dose adjustments of maintenance therapy."

Although research in lower-extremity arthroplasty suggests patients with hepatitis C are at risk for increased complications, including postoperative bleeding, acute postoperative infection, and general medical complications, no similar studies have investigated this question in patients undergoing total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA).
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked whether there is an increased risk of postoperative complications after TSA among patients who have hepatitis C, and if so, what complications in particular seem more likely to occur in this population?
METHODS: Patients who underwent TSA, including anatomic or reverse TSA, were identified in the PearlDiver database using ICD-9 procedure codes. This is a for-fee insurance patient-records database that contains more than 100 million individual patient records from 2005 to 2012. The Medicare data in the database are the complete 100% Medicare Standard Analytical File indexed to allow for patient tracking with time. Patients with hepatitis C who underwent shoulder arthroplasty then were identified using ICD-9 codes. Patients with hepatitis B coinfection or HIV were excluded. A control cohort of patients without hepatitis C who underwent TSA was created and matched to the study cohort based on age, sex, obesity, and diabetes mellitus. A total of 1466 patients with hepatitis C and 21,502 control patients were included. The two cohorts were statistically similar in terms of sex (53% females in study and control groups), age (nearly ½ of each cohort younger than 65 years), obesity (approximately 17% of each cohort were obese), diabetes (approximately 40% of each cohort had diabetes), and followup of each cohort occurred throughout the length of the database from 2005 to 2012. Postoperative complications were assessed using ICD-9 and Current Procedural Terminology codes and compared between cohorts.
RESULTS: Patients with hepatitis C, when compared with matched control subjects, had greater odds of infection within 3 months (odds ratio [OR], 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1-2.6; p = 0.015), 6 months (OR, 1.7; CI, 1.3-2.4; p = 0.001), and 1 year (OR, 2.1; CI, 1.7-2.7; p < 0.001); revision TSA within 1 year (OR, 1.5; CI, 1.1-2.9; p = 0.008) and 2 years (OR, 1.6; CI, 1.2-2.0; p = 0.001), dislocation within 1 year (OR, 1.6; CI, 1.2-2.2; p < 0.001); postoperative fracture within 1 year (OR, 1.8; CI, 1.2-2.6; p = 0.002); systemic or medical complications within 3 months (OR, 1.3; CI, 1.0-1.6; p = 0.022); and blood transfusion within 3 months (OR, 1.7; CI, 1.4-1.9; p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Hepatitis C is associated with an increased risk for complications after TSA, including infection, dislocation, fracture, revision TSA, systemic complications, and blood transfusion compared with matched control subjects. Although this study is able to identify increased odds of complications in patients with hepatitis C, the mechanism by which these occur is likely not solely related to the virus, and is more likely related to a higher degree of case complexity in addition to other postoperative socioeconomic factors.

27448266,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27448266/,"BACKGROUND: Research on infrahumanization shows there is a strong tendency to deprive outgroups of the ability to experience secondary emotions when compared to ingroups. However, it is not known whether this tendency is also applied to social groups towards which ambivalent attitudes are held, such as individuals with Down syndrome.
METHODS: In the first study, participants were asked to attribute primary and secondary emotions to members of the ingroup (students) and outgroup (individuals with Down syndrome). The second study explored the effect of the physical features of Down syndrome on the differential association of emotions. A lexical decision task preceded by photographs of three face types (adults with Down syndrome, adults with ambiguous faces and adults without Down syndrome) was used for that purpose.
RESULTS: The results showed a higher attribution of secondary emotions to members of the ingroup than to members of the outgroup. Also revealed that participants associated secondary emotions with the faces of adults without Down syndrome and with ambiguous faces far more quickly than with faces of individuals with Down syndrome.
CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm the existence of infrahumanization bias and the effect of visibility of the stigma in this subtle type of prejudice."
27448573,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27448573/,"BACKGROUND: Metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) has historically been refractory to cytotoxic and hormonal agents. IL-2 and IFN-α provide response in a minority of patients. Small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies have established a role in the setting of mRCC. However, there is a lack of data from the Indian subcontinent. The aim of this study was to look whether our patients behave similarly as reported in the Western data to targeted agents, especially sunitinib.
METHODS: The study was a prospective observational study conducted for a period of 5 years from 2011 to 2016. Sixty-three patients received targeted agents and were recruited in the study. Five patients were excluded for various reasons, and three were lost to follow-up. Fifty-five patients were properly studied and followed up. Fifty patients received sunitinib, four patients received sorafenib, and one patient received parenteral temsirolimus. Patients were followed for AEs and survival.
RESULTS: The most common AEs in patients taking sunitinib were fatigue (70 %), hand-foot syndrome (62 %), skin rash (58 %), mucosal inflammation (58 %), anorexia (42 %), skin discoloration (42 %), followed by dry mouth, dysgeusia, dyspepsia, dry skin, dry mouth, hair color changes, hypothyroidism, alopecia, oral pain/stomatitis, hypertension, decreased weight, photosensitivity, peripheral edema, erythema, and others. The median overall survival in our patients was 13.2 (95 % CI 10.1-16.5), progression-free survival was 8.1 months (95 % CI 6.4-10.5), and objective response was seen in 36 %.
CONCLUSION: Non-Western patients behave differently with sunitinib therapy compared to Western patients. Our patients have more mucocutaneous side effects and lesser overall survival."
27448796,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27448796/,"BACKGROUND: The clinical and pathogenetic heterogeneity of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) limits our ability to predict its short- and long-term evolution. Aim of this naturalistic study was to observe the clinical evolution of very young children with ASD for 12 months after first diagnosis, in order to identify those children who might develop a more positive trajectory and understand how a wide range of biological, clinical and familial factors can influence prognosis.
METHODS: Ninety-two children were characterized in terms of family history, prenatal and perinatal variables, and clinical conditions. The sample was divided into four subgroups based on the association of 22 biological, clinical and family history variables. Developmental Quotient (DQ), determined using the Psychoeducational Profile Revised (PEP-R), and symptoms severity, measured by means of the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS), were evaluated at baseline (T0) and after one year (T1), while receiving treatment as usual. Changes in DQ and ADOS between baseline and follow-up and differences in the short-term evolution of the four subgroups were analyzed.
RESULTS: At T1, 55.4 % of the children demonstrated some gains either of autistic symptomatology or of developmental skills. Mean ADOS score was 13.63 ± 3.67 at T0 and 10.85 ± 4.10 at T1 and mean DQ was 0.64 ± 0.14 at T0 and 0.66 ± 0.15 at T1. At follow-up, 33.7 % of the children showed an improvement in DQ and 37 % presented a less severe symptomatology, measured by means of ADOS. Overall, 15.2 % of the sample displayed major improvements both on developmental quotient and ADOS severity score; these children presented less EEG abnormalities and familial psychiatric disorders. The four subgroups, based on biological, clinical and familial variables, showed differing trends in terms of evolution.
CONCLUSIONS: Categorizing very young children with ASD in terms of biological, clinical and familial variables can be instrumental in predicting short-term evolution. This exploratory study highlights the importance of a precise characterization and thorough analysis of interactions among biological and clinical variables, in order to predict the developmental evolution in children with ASD."
27448848,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27448848/,"BACKGROUND: In 1998 it was postulated by the ICCS that urge syndrome, later termed overactive bladder (OAB), and dysfunctional voiding (DV) might not be separate entities and instead represent transitional stages between each other, and that DV may be the evolutionary end product of OAB. The aim of this study was to determine not only if OAB sometimes transitions into DV but also if the reverse occurs, and, if so, might they indeed be parts of one entity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: To create an objective study of these two conditions, specific ""qualifiers"" supporting the diagnosis of each condition were introduced: 1) DV included the qualifier of an active EMG during voiding on two studies; 2) OAB included the qualifiers of a short lag time (<2 s) as a surrogate for detrusor overactivity (DO) and a quiet EMG during voiding. Two separate cohorts (one for DV and one for OAB) of 77 consecutive patients each were reviewed. All DV patients were treated with biofeedback and some with antimuscarinics. All OAB patients were treated with antimuscarinics. Both cohorts also received standard therapy and bowel management when indicated. All patients had multiple uroflow/EMG evaluations before and during therapy and were followed for a minimum of 6 months.
RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 17.5 months and median age at diagnosis was 6.6 years for DV and 6.4 years for OAB. Of the OAB children none transitioned into DV, although two demonstrated transient DV-like EMG activity on interval testing that did not require biofeedback. Of DV children, following the initiation of biofeedback therapy, the EMG became quiet on follow-up uroflow/EMG after a mean of 9.3 months in 70 of 77 (91%). With EMG quieting, however, a short EMG lag time suggesting DO became apparent in those children with persistent irritative symptoms. This short lag time became apparent in 25 of 31 (81%) children treated with biofeedback alone versus only 8 of 39 (21%) on biofeedback plus antimuscarinics.
CONCLUSION: OAB with qualifiers and DV are two distinct LUT conditions and children do not appear to transition from the one to the other. While some children with DV did demonstrate a short lag time during follow-up, this is because once the EMG quieted in response to biofeedback, it improved our ability to document the already existing DO secondary to their previous DV. A dysfunctional voiding sequence with the postulated initial step being the transition of OAB into DV does not seem to be likely as the age at initial diagnosis was similar in both groups."
27450240,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27450240/,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this paper was to ascertain whether greater familiarity with a smartphone or tablet was associated with participants' preferred mobile delivery modality for eHealth interventions.
METHODS: Data from 1865 people who participated in the Australian Health and Social Science panel study were included into two multinomial logistic regression analyses in which preference for smartphone and tablet delivery for general or personalised eHealth interventions were regressed onto device familiarity and the covariates of sex, age and education.
RESULTS: People were more likely to prefer both general and personalised eHealth interventions presented on tablets if they reported high or moderate tablet familiarity (compared to low familiarity) and people were more likely to prefer both general and personalised eHealth interventions presented on smartphones if they reported high or moderate smartphone familiarity, were younger, and had university education (compared to completing high school or less).
CONCLUSION: People prefer receiving eHealth interventions on the mobile devices they are most familiar with. These findings have important implications that should be considered when developing eHealth interventions, and demonstrates that eHealth interventions should be delivered using multiple platforms simultaneously to optimally cater for as many people as possible."
27450386,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27450386/,"INTRODUCTION: Immediate treatment has been shown to decrease the recurrence of cerebrovascular accidents following transient ischemic attacks (TIA), prompting the use of a specialized neurologic emergency department (Neuro ED) to triage patients. Despite these findings, there is little evidence supporting the notion that hospital admission improves post-TIA outcomes. Through the lens of a Neuro ED, this retrospective chart review of TIA patients examines whether hospital admission improves 90-day outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred sixty charts of patients discharged with TIA diagnosis were reviewed. These charts encompassed patients with TIA who presented to a main emergency department (ED) or Neuro ED from January 2014 to April 2015. Demographic information, admission ABCD(2) scores, admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores, and admission Modified Rankin Scale, and reason for any return visits within 90 days were collected.
RESULTS: This review shows that patients triaged by the Neuro ED were admitted at a lower rate than those seen by the standard ED. Further, patients triaged by the Neuro ED experienced lower readmission and recurrence of stroke or TIA within 90 days.
CONCLUSIONS: These results provide preliminary support for the notion that discharging appropriate TIA patients, with adequate follow-up, will not adversely affect the recurrence of TIA or stroke within 90 days."
27450694,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27450694/,"OBJECTIVE: Thyroid disorders and iron deficiency (ID) are associated with obstetrical and fetal complications. Iron is essential for the normal functioning of thyroid peroxidase (TPO-abs) and ID is frequent during pregnancy. The aim of this study was to compare the prevalence of thyroid autoimmunity (TAI) and dysfunction during the first trimester of pregnancy in women with and without ID.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional data analysis of 1900 pregnant women nested within an ongoing prospective collection of pregnant women's data.
METHOD: The study was performed in a single, tertiary referral center. During the first antenatal visit, ferritin, TPO-abs, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free T4 (FT4) were measured and age and BMI were recorded. ID was defined as ferritin <15µg/L, TAI when TPO-abs was >60kIU/L, and subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) when TSH was >2.5mIU/L.
RESULTS: ID was present in 35% of women. Age and BMI were comparable between both groups. In the ID group, the prevalence of TAI and SCH was significantly higher, compared with that in the non-ID group (10% vs 6% and 20% vs 16%; P=0.011 and 0.049 respectively). Ferritin was inversely correlated with serum TSH (ρ=-0.076; P=0.001) and positive with FT4 levels (ρ=0.112; P<0.001). In the logistic regression model, ID remained associated with TAI after correction for confounding factors (P=0.017). The association with SCH was absent after correction for the confounders in the logistic regression model (P=0.082), but remained present in the linear regression model (P=0.035).
CONCLUSIONS: ID was frequent during the first trimester of pregnancy and was associated with a higher prevalence of TAI, higher serum TSH, and lower FT4 levels."
27451069,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27451069/,"OBJECTIVES: The undeniable asset of the antagonist protocols in in vitro fertilization is the decrease of the risks of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, by the use of a release by GnRH agonist. Nevertheless, questioning persist concerning the rates of clinical pregnancies, the oocyte quantity and the empty follicle syndrome. We thus studied these parameters in our center.
METHODS: A retrospective study was realized from January 1st, 2013 till July 31st, 2015. The main objective was the evaluation of the rate of clinical pregnancies in antagonist protocol. A first group of 775 cycles have benefited from a release of the ovulation by HCG, while a second group of 204 cycles, by GnRH agonist. The secondary objectives were the oocyte quantity, the rate of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, and the rate of empty follicle syndrome.
RESULTS: No statistically significant difference was found between both groups concerning the rates of clinical pregnancies, oocytes quantity, and the rate of empty follicle syndrome, whatever is the type of used release, in fresh embryo transfer. A syndrome of premature ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome was found at 7.9 % of the patients in the group 2 versus 2.3 % in the group 1, with a statistically significant difference (P<0.05). At these patients, a strategy of frozen embryo transfer (""freeze all"") was proposed. The accumulated rates by pregnancy in both groups were not statistically different.
CONCLUSION: The release by GnRH agonist does not show inferiority in terms of clinical pregnancy, in comparison to HCG."
27451382,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27451382/,"INTRODUCTION: Group B streptococcus (GBS) is the most common infectious agent responsible for early-onset bacterial sepsis (EOS) in term newborns. French prevention of perinatal GBS disease guidelines recommend screening for maternal vaginal GBS colonization at the 9th month of pregnancy, and use of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) in case of detected GBS vaginal colonization. Peripheral bacterial sampling (gastric aspiration, ear, or meconium) and measurement of C-reactive protein (CRP) are performed in asymptomatic newborns in case of infectious risk factors and/or incomplete IAP.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the relation between a rapid intrapartum screening test for GBS during labor in term parturients and infants developing GBS EOS and in comparison to current recommendations.
METHODS: We conducted an observational analytic single-center study, with use of a rapid intrapartum GBS screening test, at Toulouse University Hospital.
RESULTS: A total of 1416 mother-newborn dyads were prospectively included between 31/01/2012 and 17/08/2012. Vaginal GBS colonization was found at the 9th month of pregnancy in 148 mothers (10.6 %), and 176 mothers (12.5 %) were screened positively at delivery using intrapartum GBS rapid polymerase chain reaction assay (GBS PCR) (P=0.025). No confirmed neonatal GBS EOS was found. Nine infants had suspected GBS EOS because of a positive peripheral bacterial finding and elevated CRP. In these infants, seven pregnant mothers were GBS-positive with GBS PCR assay during labor, and four women were positive on prenatal culture at the 9th month of pregnancy. The diagnostic values of the two tests highlighted a nonsignificant superiority of intrapartum GBS PCR assay (AUC=0.83 [0.68-0.97] vs. 0.67 [0.50-0.84]), (P=0.057). The negative predictive value was improved with intrapartum PCR assay (negative likelihood ratio [LR]: 0.3 [0.1-0.9] vs. 0.6 [0.4-1.1]). Intrapartum GBS PCR assay provided its best positive predictive value in the absence of complete AIP and without other infectious factors (positive LR: 21.3 [15.4-29.5]).
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the intrapartum GBS PCR assay offers a better predictive value of GBS EOS than the usual vaginal culture swab at the 9th month but requires confirmation by large studies."
27451873,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27451873/,"BACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency is common in patients with hyperparathyroidism, but the importance of replacement before surgery is controversial. We aimed to evaluate the impact of vitamin D deficiency on the extent of resection and risk of postoperative hypocalcemia for patients undergoing parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism.
METHODS: We identified patients with primary hyperparathyroidism undergoing parathyroid surgery between 2000 and 2015 using a prospectively maintained database. Patients with normal (≥30 ng/mL) vitamin D were compared to those with levels less than 30 ng/mL.
RESULTS: There were 1015 (54%) patients with normal vitamin D and 872 (46%) patients with vitamin D deficiency undergoing parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism. Vitamin D deficiency was associated with higher preoperative parathyroid hormone (median 90 versus 77 pg/mL, P < 0.001) and calcium (median 10.5 versus 10.4 mg/dL, P < 0.001) compared with normal vitamin D. To achieve similar cure rates, patients with vitamin D deficiency were less likely to require removal of more than one gland (20% versus 30%, P < 0.001) than patients with normal vitamin D. Patients with vitamin D deficiency had similar rates of persistent (1.5% versus 2.0%, P = 0.43) and recurrent (1.7% versus 2.6%, P = 0.21) hyperparathyroidism. Postoperatively, both groups had equivalent rates of transient (2.3% versus 2.3%, P = 0.97) and permanent (0.2% versus 0.4%, P = 0.52) hypocalcemia.
CONCLUSIONS: Restoring vitamin D in deficient patients should not delay the appropriate surgical treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism. Deficient patients are more likely to be cured with the excision of a single adenoma and no more likely to suffer persistence, recurrence, or hypocalcemia than patients with normal vitamin D."
27452410,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27452410/,"AIM: The aim of this study was to quantify the impact of different types and magnitudes of dosimetric uncertainties in cervix cancer brachytherapy (BT) on tumour control probability (TCP) and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) curves.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A dose-response simulation study was based on systematic and random dose uncertainties and TCP/NTCP models for CTV and rectum. Large patient cohorts were simulated assuming different levels of dosimetric uncertainties. TCP and NTCP were computed, based on the planned doses, the simulated dose uncertainty, and an underlying TCP/NTCP model. Systematic uncertainties of 3-20% and random uncertainties with a 5-30% standard deviation per BT fraction were analysed.
RESULTS: Systematic dose uncertainties of 5% lead to a 1% decrease/increase of TCP/NTCP, while random uncertainties of 10% had negligible impact on the dose-response curve at clinically relevant dose levels for target and OAR. Random OAR dose uncertainties of 30% resulted in an NTCP increase of 3-4% for planned doses of 70-80Gy EQD2.
CONCLUSION: TCP is robust to dosimetric uncertainties when dose prescription is in the more flat region of the dose-response curve at doses >75Gy. For OARs, improved clinical outcome is expected by reduction of uncertainties via sophisticated dose delivery and treatment verification."
27452925,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27452925/,"BACKGROUND: FDG PET (PET)±computed tomography (CT) has increasingly been used in some areas of oncology imaging. It is sometimes performed outside recommendations, at diagnosis or monitoring of sarcomas. We assessed the value of PET-CT in routine practice in sarcomas.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: All consecutive sarcoma adult patient charts presented at the multidisciplinary sarcoma meeting in a tertiary care center over a period of 10months were examined in order to analyze the performances of PET-CT when available.
RESULTS: Of 232 patients, 50 (21 %) underwent a PET-CT. Sensitivity and specificity of PET-CT were 94.7 %, 57.1 %, respectively. SUV values were highly variable, including for a given histology or grade. PET-CT resulted in practice changing in 14 % of cases. When extrapulmonary metastases are suspected and for some subtypes of sarcomas, PET-CT could provide additional information because in view of its good sensitivity.
CONCLUSION: Given the most frequent pulmonary tropism, first hand chest CT may be sufficient at first diagnostic work-up for the detection of pulmonary metastases. However, the relatively poor specificity suggests that further analyses should be performed to identify clinical situations where PET-CT may be of added value compared to current standards."
27453453,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27453453/,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the proportion of paper (podium) presentations at the 2006-2010 Arthroscopy Association of North America (AANA) annual scientific meetings that were ultimately published in a peer-reviewed journal. Furthermore, we aimed to evaluate whether the level of evidence correlated with the publication rate of these presentations or the impact factor (IF) of the publishing journal.
METHODS: Paper presentations from the 2006-2010 AANA annual meetings were included for evaluation. Clinical studies were graded for quality using the level of evidence by 2 independent reviewers. A comprehensive strategy was used to search the databases PubMed, Medline, and Embase for publications in scientific journals that corresponded to the presentations and were published within 5 years of the presentation date.
RESULTS: Three hundred twenty-eight presentations were evaluated. Overall, 179 peer-reviewed publications corresponding to particular meeting presentations were identified, for a 5-year publication rate of 55%. There was no correlation between the publication rate and the level of evidence (P = .836), the type of study (P = .628), or the joint of focus (P = .07) of the presentations. The mean IF of journals that published Level I studies (4.8 [standard error, 2.3]) was significantly higher than the mean IF of journals that published Level II, III, or IV studies (2.58 [standard error, 0.10]) (P = .017).
CONCLUSIONS: Between 2006 and 2010, presentations of the highest level of evidence at AANA meetings were subsequently published at a similar rate to presentations of lower levels of evidence, albeit in journals with higher IFs.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study is an important initial evaluation of the ultimate clinical impact of AANA meeting presentations. The study type, joint of focus, and level of evidence of the presentations all had no correlation with the rate at which these presentations were ultimately published."
27454152,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27454152/,"INTRODUCTION: Impairments in self-other voice discrimination have been consistently reported in schizophrenia, and associated with the severity of auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs). This study probed the interactions between voice identity, voice acoustic quality, and semantic valence in a self-other voice discrimination task in schizophrenia patients compared with healthy subjects. The relationship between voice identity discrimination and AVH severity was also explored.
METHODS: Seventeen chronic schizophrenia patients and 19 healthy controls were asked to read aloud a list of adjectives characterised by emotional or neutral content. Participants' voice was recorded in the first session. In the behavioural task, 840 spoken words differing in identity (self/non-self), acoustic quality (undistorted/distorted), and semantic valence (negative/positive/neutral) were presented. Participants indicated if the words were spoken in their own voice, another person's voice, or were unsure.
RESULTS: Patients were less accurate than controls in the recognition of self-generated speech with negative content only. Impaired recognition of negative self-generated speech was associated with AVH severity (""voices conversing"").
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that abnormalities in higher order processes (evaluation of the salience of a speech stimulus) modulate impaired self-other voice discrimination in schizophrenia. Abnormal processing of negative self-generated speech may play a role in the experience of AVH."
27454190,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27454190/,"INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to study whether the associations of maternal body mass index with offspring birthweight and placental weight differ by maternal diabetes status.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a population study of 106 191 singleton pregnancies by using data from the years 2009-2012 in the Medical Birth Registry of Norway. We estimated changes in birthweight and in placental weight (in grams) by maternal body mass index by linear regression analysis.
RESULTS: In pregnancies of women without diabetes, birthweight increased by 14.7 g (95% confidence interval 14.1-15.2) per unit increase in maternal body mass index, and the increase in placental weight was 4.2 g (95% confidence interval 4.0-4.4). In pregnancies of women with gestational diabetes, the corresponding figures were 11.8 g (95% confidence interval 8.3-15.4) and 2.9 g (95% confidence interval 1.7-4.0). In pregnancies of women with type 1 diabetes we found no significant changes in birthweight or in placental weight by maternal body mass index. Overall, mean birthweight was 513.9 g (95% confidence interval 475.6-552.1) higher in pregnancies involving type 1 diabetes than in pregnancies of women without diabetes. Mean placental weight was 102.1 g (95% confidence interval 89.3-114.9) higher. Also, in pregnancies of women with gestational diabetes, both birthweight and placental weight were higher than in women without diabetes (168.2 g and 46.5 g, respectively). Adjustments were made for maternal body mass index and gestational age at birth.
CONCLUSIONS: Birthweight and placental weight increased with increasing maternal body mass index in pregnancies of women without diabetes and in pregnancies of women with gestational diabetes, but not in pregnancies of women with type 1 diabetes. Independent of body mass index, mean birthweight and mean placental weight were highest in pregnancies of women with type 1 diabetes."
27454332,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27454332/,"PURPOSE: Quality of life of patients with epilepsy depends largely upon unpredictability of seizure occurrence and would improve by predicting seizures or at least by detecting seizures (after their clinical onset) and react timely. Detection systems are available and researched, but little is known about the actual need and user preferences. The first indicates the market potential; the second allows us to incorporate user requirements into the engineering process.
METHODS: We questioned 20 pediatric and young adult patients, 114 caregivers, and 21 involved medical doctors and described, analyzed, and compared their experiences with systems for seizure detection, their opinions on usefulness and purpose of seizure detection, and their requirements for such a device.
RESULTS: Experience with detection systems is limited, but 65% of patients and caregivers and 85% of medical doctors express the usefulness, more so during night than day. The need is higher in patients with more severe intellectual disability. The higher the seizure frequency, the higher the need, opinions in the seizure-free group being more divided. Most patients and caregivers require 100% correct detection, and on average, one false alarm per seizure (one per week for those seizure-free) is accepted. Medical doctors allow 90% correct detections and between two false alarms per week and one per month depending on seizure frequency. Detection of seizures involving heavy movement and falls is judged most important by patients and caregivers and second to most by medical doctors. The latter judge heart rate monitoring most relevant, both towards seizure detection and SUDEP (sudden unexpected death in epilepsy) prevention.
CONCLUSIONS: The results, including a goal of 90% correct detections and one false alarm per seizure, should be considered in development of seizure detectors."
27454616,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27454616/,"BACKGROUND: Current guidelines for epicardial catheter ablation for ventricular tachycardia (VT) advocate that epicardial access is avoided in anticoagulated patients and should be performed prior to heparinisation. Recent studies have shown that epicardial access may be safe in heparinised patients. However, no data exist for patients on oral anticoagulants. We investigated the safety of obtaining epicardial access on uninterrupted warfarin.
METHODS: A prospective registry of patients undergoing epicardial VT ablation over two years was analysed. Consecutive patients in whom epicardial access was attempted were included. All patients were heparinised prior to epicardial access with a target activated clotting time (ACT) of 300-350s. Patients who had procedures performed on uninterrupted warfarin (in addition to heparin) were compared to those not taking an oral anticoagulant.
RESULTS: 46 patients were included of which 13 were taking warfarin. There was no significant difference in clinical and procedural characteristics (except INR and AF) between the two groups. Epicardial access was achieved in all patients. There were no deaths and no patients required surgery. A higher proportion of patients in the warfarin group had a drop in haemoglobin of >2g/dL compared to the no-warfarin group (38.5% versus 27.3%, p=0.74) and delayed pericardial drain removal (7.8% versus 3.03%, p=0.47). There was no difference in overall procedural complication rate. No patients required warfarin reversal or blood transfusion.
CONCLUSION: Epicardial access can be achieved safely and effectively in patients' anticoagulated with warfarin and heparinised with therapeutic ACT. This may be an attractive option for patients with a high stroke risk."
27454788,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27454788/,"PURPOSE: To assess the ability of computed tomography (CT) to differentiate an atypical lipomatous tumor/well-differentiated liposarcoma (WDLPS) from a WDLPS with a dedifferentiated component (DDLPS) within it.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-nine untreated patients with abdominal atypical lipomatous tumors/well-differentiated liposarcomas who had undergone contrast-enhanced CT were identified using an institutional database. Three radiologists who were blinded to the pathology findings evaluated all the images independently to determine whether a dedifferentiated component was present within the WDLPS. The CT images were evaluated for fat content (≤25% or >25%); presence of ground-glass density, enhancing and/or necrotic nodules; presence of a capsule surrounding the mass; septations; and presence and pattern of calcifications. A multivariate logistic regression model with generalized estimating equations was used to correlate imaging features with pathology findings. Kappa statistics were calculated to assess agreement between the three radiologists.
RESULTS: On the basis of pathological findings, 12 patients had been diagnosed with DDLPS within a WDLPS and 37 had been diagnosed with WDLPS. The presence of an enhancing or a centrally necrotic nodule within the atypical lipomatous tumor was associated with dedifferentiated liposarcoma (P = 0.02 and P = 0.0003, respectively). The three readers showed almost perfect agreement in overall diagnosis (κ r = 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.67-0.99).
CONCLUSIONS: An enhancing or centrally necrotic nodule may be indicative of a dedifferentiated component in well-differentiated liposarcoma. Ground-glass density nodules may not be indicative of dedifferentiation."
27454839,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27454839/,"BACKGROUND: Following a landmark study showing decreased morbidity and mortality after implementation of the surgical safety checklist (SSC), it has been widely adopted into perioperative policy. We explored the impact of attitudes and beliefs surrounding the SSC on its uptake in Calgary.
METHODS: We used qualitative methodology to examine factors influencing SSC use. We performed semistructured interviews based on Rogers' theory of diffusion of innovation. Purposive and snowball sampling were used to identify surgeons, anesthesiologists and operating room nurses from hospitals in Calgary. Data collection and analysis were based on grounded theory. Two individuals jointly analyzed data and achieved consensus on emerging themes.
RESULTS: Generated themes included 1) the SSC has brought organization to previous informal perioperative checks, 2) the SSC is most helpful when it is simple, and 3) the 3 current components of the checklist are redundant. The briefing was considered the most important aspect and the debriefing the least important. Initially the SSC was difficult to implement owing to a shift in time management and perioperative culture; however, it has now assimilated into perioperative routine. Finally, though most participants agreed that the SSC might avoid some delays and complications, only a few believe there have been observable improvements to morbidity and mortality.
CONCLUSION: Although the SSC has been integrated into perioperative practice in Calgary, participants believe that previous informal checkpoints were able to circumvent most perioperative issues. Although the SSC may help with flow and equipment, participants believe it fails to show a subjective, clinically important improvement."
27454886,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27454886/,"BACKGROUND: Given a set of biallelic molecular markers, such as SNPs, with genotype values encoded numerically on a collection of plant, animal or human samples, the goal of genetic trait prediction is to predict the quantitative trait values by simultaneously modeling all marker effects. Genetic trait prediction is usually represented as linear regression models which require quantitative encodings for the genotypes. There are lots of work on the prediction algorithms, but none of the existing work investigated the effects of the encodings on the genetic trait prediction problem.
METHODS: In this work, we view the genetic trait prediction problem from a novel angle: a multiple regression on categorical data problem, which requires encoding the categorical data into numerical data. We further proposed two novel encoding methods and we show that they are able to generate numerical features with higher predictive power.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Our experiments show that our methods are superior to the other encoding methods for both single marker model and epistasis model. We showed that the quantitative genetic trait prediction problem heavily depends on the encoding of genotypes, for both single marker model and epistasis model.
CONCLUSIONS: We conducted a detailed analysis on the performance of the hybrid encodings. To our knowledge, this is the first work that discusses the effects of encodings for genetic trait prediction problem."
27454908,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27454908/,"OBJECTIVES: The conditions under which planning for behaviour change is most effective are not fully understood. In the context of a weight management programme, we examined the interrelationship between plan specificity, type of behaviour planned (diet vs. exercise), and weight loss goals.
DESIGN: Prospective design and content analysis of plans formed by participants of a 10-week weight management programme.
METHODS: Participants (n = 239) formulated two plans, for dietary and exercise behaviours, respectively. Plans were rated for specificity by examining the number of plan components. Weight loss goals were assessed by asking how much weight participants intend to lose. Weight was measured objectively each of the 10 weeks. Changes in body mass index (BMI) over time and the interactions between plan specificity and weight loss goals, for all plans and separately for diet and exercise, were estimated using linear mixed models.
RESULTS: Plan specificity was unrelated to weight loss, but interacted with weight loss goals in predicting linear change in BMI (t = -2.48): More specific plans were associated with higher decreases in weight in participants with high weight loss goals. Separate interaction tests for plans formulated for diet and exercise change showed that more specific dietary plans, but not exercise plans, were associated with higher decreases in weight in participants with high weight loss goals (t = -2.21).
CONCLUSIONS: Within a population that is highly motivated to lose weight, the combination of high weight loss goals and formulating detailed plans for changing dietary behaviours may be most effective in supporting weight loss. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? More specific plans are associated with increased performance of health-related behaviours. More motivated individuals form more specific plans. The interrelationship between plan specificity, plan content and behaviour-related goals in relation intervention effectiveness has not been explored to date. What does this study add? The effectiveness of forming specific plans may depend on the strength of behaviour-related goals as well as the behaviour selected for change. More detailed plans, in particular dietary plans, were related to greater weight loss, but only for participants with higher initial weight loss goals. Detailed exercise plans were not associated with weight loss, regardless of initial weight loss goals."
27456006,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27456006/,"BACKGROUND: Quality of life (QoL) in old age is of major importance because the global population is aging rapidly. Offspring support, including financial and emotional support, is important in later life and directly affects the wellbeing of elderly individuals. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between QoL in older parents and offspring support.
METHODS: We used baseline data from the 2006-2012 Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging, from 3,274 individuals aged 65 years or older. We measured the individual's QoL using a visual analog scale and included both relationship satisfaction and regular economic support as variables. A generalized estimating equation (GEE) model was used to perform longitudinal regression analysis on the data.
RESULTS: Regarding the QoL of older parents, those with an unsatisfying relationship with their offspring had a QoL of -21.93 (SE = 0.55; P < 0.0001) compared to those with satisfying offspring relationships. Those receiving no regular financial aid from their offspring had a QoL of -0.92 (SE = 0.38; P = 0.0171) compared to those who received such economic support. Combination effects were observed, with cases living alone - and having poor offspring relationships and no regular financial support from their offspring - showing the most drastic decrease in QoL (-23.46; SE = 1.03; P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Offspring support influences the QoL of elderly individuals, and Korean children appear to play a crucial role in the QoL of their (older) parents. Considering that the role of offspring is rapidly diminishing due to industrialization policies, initiatives are required to revitalize offspring support for elderly parents."
27456218,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27456218/,"BACKGROUND: The basic reproduction number (R 0) is an important summary of the dynamics of an infectious disease. It is a threshold parameter: an infection can only invade a population if R 0 is greater than 1. However, a number of studies using simple models have suggested that for malaria, it is in theory possible for infection to persist indefinitely even if an intervention has reduced R 0 below 1. Such behaviour is known as a bistable equilibrium. Using two published mathematical models which have both been fitted to detailed, age-stratified data on multiple outcomes, the article investigates whether these more complex models behave in such a way, and hence whether a bistable equilibrium might be a real feature of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Africa.
RESULTS: With the best-fitting parameter values, neither model has a bistable state, because immunity reduces onwards infectiousness. The results imply that there is a threshold such that if interventions can reduce transmission so that R 0 is below 1 for long enough, then malaria will be locally eliminated.
CONCLUSIONS: This means that calculations of the reduction in R 0 that interventions can achieve (the effect size) have a useful and straightforward interpretation, whereas if the theoretical possibility of a bistable equilibrium were the real behaviour, then such effect size calculations would not have a clear interpretation."
27456506,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27456506/,"BACKGROUND: Health related quality of life (HRQOL) is patient-reported, and an important treatment outcome for patients undergoing renal replacement therapy. Whether HRQOL in dialysis can affect mortality or graft survival after renal transplantation (RTX) is not determined. The aims of the present study were to investigate whether pretransplant HRQOL is associated with post-RTX patient survival or graft function, and to assess whether improvement in HRQOL from dialysis to RTX is associated with patient survival.
METHODS: In a longitudinal prospective study, HRQOL was measured in 142 prevalent dialysis patients (67 % males, mean age 51 ± 15.5 years) who subsequent underwent renal transplantation. HRQOL could be repeated in 110 transplant patients 41 (IQR 34-51) months after RTX using the self-administered Kidney Disease and Quality of Life Short Form (KDQOL-SF) measure. Kaplan-Meier plots were utilized for survival analyses, and linear regression models were used to address HRQOL and effect on graft function.
RESULTS: Follow-up time was 102 (IQR 97-108) months after RTX. Survival after RTX was higher in patients who perceived good physical function (PF) in dialysis compared to patients with poorer PF (p = 0.019). Low scores in the domain mental health measured in dialysis was associated with accelerated decline in graft function (p = 0.048). Improvements in the kidney-specific domains ""symptoms"" and ""effect of kidney disease"" in the trajectory from dialysis to RTX were associated with a survival benefit (p = 0.007 and p = 0.02, respectively).
CONCLUSION: HRQOL measured in dialysis patients was associated with survival and graft function after RTX. These findings may be useful in clinical pretransplant evaluations. Improvements in some of the kidney-specific HRQOL domains from dialysis to RTX were associated with lower mortality. Prospective and interventional studies are warranted."
27456516,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27456516/,"BACKGROUND: In the context of an implementation research project aiming at improving use of HIV and sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services for female sex workers (FSWs), a broad situational analysis was conducted in Tete, Mozambique, assessing if services are adapted to the needs of FSWs.
METHODS: Methods comprised (1) a policy analysis including a review of national guidelines and interviews with policy makers, and (2) health facility assessments at 6 public and 1 private health facilities, and 1 clinic specifically targeting FSWs, consisting of an audit checklist, interviews with 18 HIV/SRH care providers and interviews of 99 HIV/SRH care users.
RESULTS: There exist national guidelines for most HIV/SRH care services, but none provides guidance for care adapted to the needs of high-risk women such as FSWs. The Ministry of Health recently initiated the process of establishing guidelines for attendance of key populations, including FSWs, at public health facilities. Policy makers have different views on the best approach for providing services to FSWs-integrated in the general health services or through parallel services for key populations-and there exists no national strategy. The most important provider of HIV/SRH services in the study area is the government. Most basic services are widely available, with the exception of certain family planning methods, cervical cancer screening, services for victims of sexual and gender-based violence, and termination of pregnancy (TOP). The public facilities face serious limitations in term of space, staff, equipment, regular supplies and adequate provider practices. A stand-alone clinic targeting key populations offers a limited range of services to the FSW population in part of the area. Private clinics offer only a few services, at commercial prices.
CONCLUSION: There is a need to improve the availability of quality HIV/SRH services in general and to FSWs specifically, and to develop guidelines for care adapted to the needs of FSWs. Access for FSWs can be improved by either expanding the range of services and the coverage of the targeted clinic and/or by improving access to adapted care at the public health services and ensure a minimum standard of quality."
27456959,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27456959/,"BACKGROUND: Sedentary behaviours (time spent sitting, with low energy expenditure) are associated with deleterious health outcomes, including all-cause mortality. Whether this association can be considered causal has yet to be established. Using systematic reviews and primary studies from those reviews, we drew upon Bradford Hill's criteria to consider the likelihood that sedentary behaviour in epidemiological studies is likely to be causally related to all-cause (premature) mortality.
METHODS: Searches for systematic reviews on sedentary behaviours and all-cause mortality yielded 386 records which, when judged against eligibility criteria, left eight reviews (addressing 17 primary studies) for analysis. Exposure measures included self-reported total sitting time, TV viewing time, and screen time. Studies included comparisons of a low-sedentary reference group with several higher sedentary categories, or compared the highest versus lowest sedentary behaviour groups. We employed four Bradford Hill criteria: strength of association, consistency, temporality, and dose-response. Evidence supporting causality at the level of each systematic review and primary study was judged using a traffic light system depicting green for causal evidence, amber for mixed or inconclusive evidence, and red for no evidence for causality (either evidence of no effect or no evidence reported).
RESULTS: The eight systematic reviews showed evidence for consistency (7 green) and temporality (6 green), and some evidence for strength of association (4 green). There was no evidence for a dose-response relationship (5 red). Five reviews were rated green overall. Twelve (67 %) of the primary studies were rated green, with evidence for strength and temporality.
CONCLUSIONS: There is reasonable evidence for a likely causal relationship between sedentary behaviour and all-cause mortality based on the epidemiological criteria of strength of association, consistency of effect, and temporality."
27456975,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27456975/,"BACKGROUND: An increase in a patient's visits to doctors usually raises concerns and may be a 'red flag' for a patient's deterioration of health. The aim of this study was to analyze whether an increase of patient-physician contacts is a first sign of a malignancy in a patient's near future.
METHODS: This is a retrospective case-control study. From 153 German general practices' electronic patient records (EPR), cases with at least one new malignancy diagnosis and no-malignancy controls were matched for gender and age. We calculated (1) the number of contacts in the first quarter up to the sixth quarter before a malignancy diagnosis was made and (2) the inter-contact interval (ICI), i.e. the time lag between two consecutive patient-physician contacts measured in days. Differences between cases and controls were investigated in several analyses of variance, with group and time as main factors.
RESULTS: A total of 3,310 cases and 3,310 controls could be included. The number of contacts for cases in the six quarters before a malignancy diagnosis increased from 4.8 contacts (SD 4.3) to 5.5 contacts (SD 4.8). The number of contacts for controls increased only marginally from 4.3 contacts (SD 3.6) to 4.5 (SD 4.2). The factor 'group' (cases vs. controls) was highly significant in the analyses of variance, also 'time' and the interaction 'group * time'. The effect size, however, was very small (R(2) being less than 0.02), which is the equivalent for about one additional contact per quarter in cases directly before a newly made malignancy diagnosis.
CONCLUSION: An increase in contact frequency is a call for GPs to become more attentive towards these patients. It may raise the suspicion of an impending serious disease but the increase is not so dramatic and unique that it can be interpreted a reliable sign of a malignant diagnosis."
27458062,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27458062/,"PURPOSE: The prevalence of prostatic inflammation (PI) is very frequent in patients affected by benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). To investigate the relationship between prostatic inflammation (PI) and the presence of MetS and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in a cohort of patients affected by BPH/LUTS.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective study from January 2012 to June 2014 on 264 consecutive patients, who underwent transurethral resection of the prostate for bladder outlet obstruction. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) has been defined according to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF). Prior to surgery, each patient has been evaluated for the presence of MetS and NAFLD. All surgical specimens were investigated for the presence of an inflammatory infiltrate, according to the Irani score.
RESULTS: The prevalence of patients affected by MetS alone was 13.8% (32/232), 13.8% (32/232) by NAFLD alone, and 42.7% (99/232) by both diseases. The rate of subjects affected by MetS + NAFLD and severe PI was significantly greater than those with only one metabolic alteration (75.8% vs. 24.2%, P < 0.01). The multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that FLI was independently associated with high PI (Irani score ≥ 4) (odds ratio [OR]: 1.04; P < 0.01). Further, the combination between MetS and NAFLD was associated severe PI (OR: 4.5; P < 0.01) while not MetS as a single alteration.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with BPH/LUTS and metabolic aberration exhibited grater PI. The coexistence of MetS and NAFLD exerted a greater detrimental effect on prostate gland by increasing severity of inflammation. Prostate 76:1528-1535, 2016. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
15809486,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15809486/,"UNLABELLED: 111In-Labeled antibodies and peptides have been routinely used as chemical and biologic surrogates for 90Y-labeled therapeutic agents. However, recent studies have shown that there are significant differences in biodistribution between 111In- and 90Y-labeled agents. Yttrium and lutetium metals favor the +3 oxidation state, similar to indium, but there are minor differences in the solution and coordination chemistries among these metals. These 3 metals, however, form strong complexes with the macrocyclic chelator, 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N',N'',N'''-tetraacetic acid (DOTA). We, therefore, compared the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of 111In- and 177Lu-labeled J591 antibody. The radiation dosimetry of 90Y-J591 was estimated based on both 111In and 177Lu data to validate the usage of 111In as a chemical and biologic surrogate for 90Y.
METHODS: J591 is a deimmunized monoclonal antibody with specificity for the extracellular domain of prostate-specific membrane antigen. In patients with prostate cancer, phase I dose-escalation studies were conducted with 90Y-J591 (n = 29) and 177Lu-J591 (n = 25). Each patient had pharmacokinetics and imaging studies with 111In-J591 (185 MBq/20 mg) over a period of 1 wk and before treatment with 90Y-J591 antibody. In the 177Lu trial, the pharmacokinetics and imaging studies were performed after treatment with the 177Lu-J591 dose (370-2,590 MBq/m2/10 mg/m2) over a 2-wk period after treatment.
RESULTS: Blood and urinary pharmacokinetics were similar for both tracers. Based on biexponential decay, the terminal half-life was 44 +/- 15 h for both tracers. In addition, the total-body retention of radioactivity over a 7-d period was also similar between the 2 isotopes. The percentage uptake in liver was about 20% greater with 111In than with 177Lu. Radiation dosimetry estimates for 90Y-J591 calculated on the basis of 111In or 177Lu data were mostly similar and showed that liver is the critical organ, followed by spleen and kidney. Based on blood radioactivity, the radiation dose (mGy/MBq) to the bone marrow was 3 times higher with 90Y (0.91 +/- 0.43) compared with that with 177Lu (0.32 +/- 0.10).
CONCLUSION: 111In- and 177Lu-labeled J591 antibodies have similar plasma and whole-body clearance kinetics. The net retention of 111In activity by lung, liver, and spleen is slightly higher compared with that with 177Lu. These results justify using 111In as a chemical and biologic surrogate for 90Y. However, the radiation dose to the liver may be overestimated by about 25% based on 111In data. In addition, the data also suggest that 177Lu may be a potential alternative for estimating the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of 90Y-labeled radiopharmaceuticals."
15809505,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15809505/,"BACKGROUND: Decreased glucose concentration in the blood causes the inhibition of the hexose monophosphate (HMP) cycle in the erythrocyte. NADPH, which is the source of the reductive equivalents necessary for the reproduction of glutathione (GSH), is not regenerated. The presence of glucose in dialysate should provide the stability of its concentration in the blood of patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD). The aim of the study was to assess the influence of glucose in the dialysate on the intensity of oxidative stress in patients undergoing regular HD.
METHODS: The study comprised 43 patients hemodialyzed with dialysate containing (HD-g(+)) or not containing glucose (HD-g(-)). The concentrations of the products of reaction with thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance (TBARS) and GSH as well as the activity of erythrocyte superoxide dismutase were determined. Glucose concentrations in the blood before and immediately after dialysis were also measured.
RESULTS: After flow-through dialysis the glucose concentration in the blood decreases both when dialysate does not contain glucose (4.8 vs. 1.6 mmol/l) and when dialysate contains glucose (6.6 vs. 5.8 mmol/l). HD caused changes in the TBARS concentration: in the HD-g(+) group the concentration decreased after HD, whereas in the HD-g(-) group it increased. In both groups of patients studied the GSH concentration changed after HD; in the HD-g(-) group it decreased and in the HD-g(+) group it increased. The results obtained in the groups of patients examined were confirmed by in vitro studies.
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of glucose in the dialysate guarantees the normal activity of the HMP cycle, which provides the production of reductive equivalents for the regeneration of reduced GSH - free radicals scavenger - and therefore the limitation of oxidative stress."
15809539,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15809539/,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the associations between measures of auditory processing and measures of auditory or cognitive function in elderly listeners with impaired hearing.
DESIGN: Multiple measures of auditory processing, auditory function, and cognitive function were obtained and linear, multiple-regression analyses were conducted to examine the relations between these sets of variables. In particular, four measures of auditory processing were obtained from each of 213 elderly participants. Measures of auditory processing included duration discrimination for a 1000-Hz pure tone, temporal-order discrimination for mid-frequency pure tones, dichotic syllable identification, and recognition of 45% time-compressed monosyllables. Each participant also completed additional measures of auditory function, including pure-tone thresholds, auditory brain stem responses for each ear and at two presentation rates (11.1 and 71.1 clicks per second), and performance-intensity functions for monosyllabic words (PI-PB rollover). Finally, three measures of cognitive function, all from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised, were obtained from the 213 participants.
RESULTS: For three of the four measures of auditory processing examined in this study (duration discrimination, temporal-order discrimination, and dichotic CV identification), a measure of cognitive function (IQ) and age were the two primary predictors of individual differences in performance. For these three measures of auditory processing, 11 to 14% of the total variance could be accounted for by the predictor variables. For the remaining measure of auditory processing (recognition of time-compressed monosyllables), 56% of the total variance could be accounted for by a set of four predictor variables, but most of this variance (54% of the total variance) was associated with individual differences in hearing loss. When hearing loss was removed as a predictor for this measure of auditory processing, 14% of the total variance was explained by four variables: age, IQ, and two measures derived from auditory brain stem response wave-V latency.
CONCLUSIONS: Performance on the battery of auditory processing measures by elderly hearing-impaired listeners was systematically related to individual differences in cognitive function rather than auditory function, especially for stimuli not affected by peripheral hearing loss. However, much of the variance in auditory processing performance remained unaccounted for by any of the predictor variables examined in this study."
15809787,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15809787/,"BACKGROUND: Peritoneal tears (PTs) are not uncommon during the course of laparoscopic total extraperitoneal (LTEP) repair of groin hernias. Most endoscopic surgeons advocate routine closure of these tears. Our approach is not to perform routine closure of PTs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible effect of our approach on the intra- and postoperative course of patients in whom PTs were left opened.
METHODS: Prospective data were collected for LTEP repairs of 298 hernias performed in 166 consecutive patients.
RESULTS: There were 134 primary and 34 recurrent hernias. In 23% of patients, unilateral or bilateral PTs were observed during the course of operation. Of these, the prevalence of tears was 21.8% for primary repair and 41% for recurrent repair. In 40 patients with PTs, the procedure was accomplished successfully laparoscopically. The early postoperative course was uncomplicated in all patients. Results of outpatient follow-up with a mean observation time of 16 months (range, 2-30) did not reveal any complications that could be attributed to PTs.
CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that PTs do not have to be routinely closed and the majority of cases may be safely managed without peritoneal closure. We have not observed any intra- or postoperative complications that could be attributed to peritoneal tears."

The aim of this study was to evaluate urinary and sexual function in male patients after laparoscopic colorectal resection for diverticular disease.
METHODS: From January 1997 to March 2002, we performed a retrospective analysis of urinary and sexual function in 56 consecutive male patients who had undergone laparoscopic colorectal resection for diverticular disease. Preoperative and 6-month postoperative assessment was carried out using data collected via standardized postal questionnaires.
RESULTS: Three patients were excluded (one had a prior prostatectomy, one had Peyronie's disease, and one was treated with neuroleptics). Fifty-three patients with a mean age of 54 A+/- 2 years were included in the study. There were no conversions. The morbidity rate was 9.4%. Mean follow-up was 27 A+/- 2 months. There was no significant difference in preoperative and postoperative urinary function. Fifty-one patients (96%) were sexually active preoperatively and were still sexually active postoperatively. Compared with the preoperative period, postoperative impairment of libido, erection, ejaculation, and orgasm were not significant. Every patient was able to achieve ejaculation after the intervention, and no retrograde ejaculations were reported. One patient was unable to have an erection after the intervention.
CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic colorectal resection for diverticular disease does not significantly impair urinary and sexual function."

15811103,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15811103/,"AIM: This paper reports a study exploring the perspectives of people affected by cancer (service users) and health care professionals' about current medical consultant-led services and the acceptability of a proposed nurse-led ambulatory chemotherapy service.
BACKGROUND: A number of studies have evaluated a nurse-led model of cancer care delivery but little work has been undertaken in chemotherapy settings. Furthermore, many of these studies give little information on how the perspective of users was incorporated in the design and evaluation of these services.
METHODS: Service users (n = 26) and health care professionals (n = 22) were recruited across the South East of England. A qualitative study was undertaken... Using a semi-structured interview schedule, participants were asked to give their perceptions of current chemotherapy services and the potential of a nurse-led service. A thematic analysis of data was undertaken.
FINDINGS: This paper focuses on the theme of the current and future context of a chemotherapy service. Three sub-themes were identified: contextualizing roles, defining therapeutic outcomes, and demonstrating effectiveness. All interviewees saw this role as different but complementary to the role of medical staff. There were mixed opinions from service users and professionals on the acceptability of nurse-led chemotherapy provision. In defining potential outcomes of nurse-led care, service users described benefits in terms of service and economic outcomes. Professionals saw additional benefits in terms of patient-based outcomes. Professionals and service users expressed the need for appropriate education of nurses for this role and rigorous evaluation of any new service before widespread implementation.
CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the perspective of users is imperative when re-designing cancer nursing services. Implementation of nurse-led models in chemotherapy services should be preceded by staff education and followed by systematic evaluation."
15811104,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15811104/,"AIM: This paper reports a study to gain a new theoretical understanding of parental grief responses and the process of adaptation to a diagnosis of childhood diabetes.
BACKGROUND: A diagnosis of childhood (type 1) diabetes is an anxious and distressing event for the whole family. Little is known about the experience of parents of newly diagnosed children as they cope with and adapt to their new situation. Parkes' Theory of Psychosocial Transition proposes that life-change events, or 'psychosocial transitions', require people to undertake a major revision of their assumptions about the world. The relevance of this theory to adjusting to a diagnosis of childhood diabetes has not been explored.
METHOD: Forty audio taped in-depth interviews were undertaken with 38 parents of 20 newly-diagnosed children. The data were subsequently examined using the framework of the Theory of Psychosocial Transition.
FINDINGS: Before diagnosis, most parents associated their child's symptoms with normal childhood illnesses. The unexpectedness and speed of the diagnosis left all parents ill-prepared to deal with the situation. Their world suddenly changed, leaving them insecure and uncertain about the future. Diabetes intruded emotionally and practically upon all of their lives. Parents successfully adjusted and adapted their lives and rebuilt a new model of the world to accommodate their child's diabetes. However, this dynamic process has no guaranteed endpoint for parents.
CONCLUSIONS: A diagnosis of childhood diabetes leads to a psychosocial transition for parents. The concept of transition provides a logical explanation of parents' responses to loss, and allows increased understanding of the grieving and adaptation processes experienced by parents of children diagnosed with a chronic condition such as diabetes. This knowledge should help health care professionals to assist parents in the period of transition."
15811161,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15811161/,"OBJECTIVE: To review the available literature pertaining to amantadine as therapy for improving cognition and reducing agitation following a non-penetrating traumatic brain injury (TBI).
DATA SOURCES: Clinical literature was accessed through MEDLINE (from 1966 to February 2004) and bibliographic searches. Key search terms included 'amantadine', 'traumatic brain injury', 'cognition', and 'agitation'.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Amantadine is primarily used for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A. Its ability to improve mentation and motor function in patients with head injury remains questionable. An evaluation of five clinical trials, two case reports, and one case series is conducted focusing on the use of amantadine following TBI. Patients in clinical trials were assessed using a variety of neuropsychological tools aimed at, among other things, assessing cognition and agitation. Although individual patient results varied, the majority of patients studied showed improved neuropsychological test scores. Similar observations are noted in the case reports and case series. Improvement in cognition and reduced agitation seems to occur with post-injury amantadine therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Amantadine is a reasonable option for improving cognition and reducing agitation following a TBI but confirmatory evidence of the efficacy the drug is necessary."
15811180,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15811180/,"BACKGROUND: Ocular hypotony results in an increased break down of the blood-aqueous barrier and an increase in inflammatory mediator release. We postulate that this release may lead to an increased risk of trabeculectomy failure through increased bleb scarring. This study was designed to try to address the question if hypotony within one month of trabeculectomy for Primary Open Angle Glaucoma (POAG), is a risk factor for future failure of the filter.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective, case notes review, of patients who underwent trabeculectomy for POAG between Jan 1995 and Jan 1996 at our hospital. We identified those with postoperative hypotony within 1 month of surgery. Hypotony was defined as an intraocular pressure (IOP) < 8 mmHg or an IOP of less than 10 mmHg with choroidal detachment or a shallow anterior chamber. We compared the survival times of the surgery in this group with a control group (who did not suffer hypotony as described above), over a 5 year period. Failure of trabeculectomy was defined as IOP > 21 mmHg, or commencement of topical antihypertensives or repeat surgery.
RESULTS: 97 cases matched our inclusion criteria, of these 38 (39%) experienced hypotony within 1 month of surgery. We compared the survival times in those patients who developed hypotony with those who did not using the log-rank test. This data provided evidence of a difference (P = 0.0492) with patients in the hypotony group failing more rapidly than the control group.
CONCLUSION: Early post-trabeculectomy hypotony (within 1 month) is associated with reduced survival time of blebs."
15811201,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15811201/,"BACKGROUND: Worldwide, patients are offered a telephone consultation as a first point of access to a health care professional. Whilst older patients form a significant proportion of callers, this group has expressed reservation about consultations that preclude a physical examination.
OBJECTIVE: This study compares how two groups of patients (< 70 years, > or = 70 years) perceive their ability to cope with illness following a telephone consultation.
METHODS: Nine hundred and fifty-six patients from deprived inner city areas receiving telephone consultations with a General Practitioner (GP)/Family doctor or nurse at five practices in South Yorkshire, UK were surveyed within 24 h of the consultation. A 49% response rate was achieved; the mean age of respondents in the respective groups was 78.5 years and 48 years. The questionnaire included the Patient Enablement Instrument (PEI), a self-reported measure of patients' ability to cope with illness measure of patients' ability to cope with illness and supplementary questions on access to GPs in the practice.
RESULTS: There was a low response rate from younger patients and males in particular. Ethnic minority groups were hardly represented among the respondents. How ever, scores on the PEI following telephone consultations were no different between older and younger respondents (Mann-Whitney U test, p = 0.56). Regression analysis with PEI scores as the dependent variable and fitting age and differences in responses to the questionnaire as explanatory variables yielded an R(2) of 0.02 suggesting that 'age' per se was a poor predictor of 'enablement'.
CONCLUSIONS: These data support an inclusive policy in the provision of telephone access to health care professionals in primary care. We conclude that older patients are not disadvantaged by consulting a primary care professional by telephone."
15811763,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15811763/,"OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated sodium and fluid balance disturbances in anorexia nervosa.
METHODS: Serum urea, creatinine, urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio, protein concentration, osmolality, electrolytes, hemoglobin, and hematocrit were evaluated on admission, after intravenous fluid supplementation, and at discharge in 14 patients who had anorexia nervosa and were admitted to a medical unit for severe malnutrition and/or medical complications. Diet history and physical signs of salt and water depletion were also evaluated on admission. The diagnosis of plasma volume depletion was considered confirmed if serum urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio was higher than 25.
RESULTS: Mean body mass indexes were 12.9 +/- 2.4 kg/m2 on admission and 14.2 +/- 2.0 kg/m2 at discharge. Mean duration of hospitalization was 24.2 +/- 11.9 d. Plasma volume depletion was found on admission in nine patients (64%), and hyponatremia was associated with hypovolemia (hypovolemic hyponatremia) in three of them. Most of the commonly used indexes of hemoconcentration (hematocrit, hemoglobin, serum urea, and creatinine) were normal on admission but decreased significantly after intravenous fluid supplementation and were maintained at lower levels at discharge (P < 0.001, P < 0.0004, P < 0.009, and P < 0.001, respectively, compared with admission values). Hemoconcentration masked an underlying anemia (hemoglobin < 12 g/dL) in six patients. Only two of the nine patients with plasma volume depletion had a history of diuretic abuse, and the other seven patients reported long-term sodium restriction as a method to control body weight.
CONCLUSIONS: Plasma volume depletion and hypovolemic hyponatremia are common in the most severely malnourished patients with anorexia nervosa. Clinicians should be aware that, because of malnutrition, the common indexes of hemoconcentration may be within normal range and that hemoconcentration may mask anemia. Further studies are needed to assess the role of neglected behaviors such as sodium and fluid restriction."
15811766,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15811766/,"OBJECTIVE: A diet low in sodium, high in potassium, and high in calcium is recommended to lower blood pressure. However, compliance with this diet is poor, probably because of dietary intake underestimation. Therefore, we compared electrolyte intake as estimated from dietary recall with a 24-h urinary excretion.
METHODS: Thirty-six patients (26 men and 10 women) with a mean age of 46 +/- 8 y participated in the study. All participants had essential hypertension and were on no drug therapy (n = 20) or non-diuretic monotherapy (n = 16). Patients were instructed to consume a low-sodium (50 mmol/d), high-potassium (supplementation with 30 to 60 mmol/d), and high-calcium (1000 mg/d) diet. Compliance with the diet was assessed at baseline and then 1, 2, and 3 mo after starting the diet. Sodium, potassium, and calcium intakes were carefully estimated from patients' dietary recall and 24-h urinary collection.
RESULTS: Estimated sodium intake significantly correlated with 24-h urinary excretion (R = 0.43 P < 0.001). However, estimated sodium intake was lower than urinary sodium excretion by 34% at baseline and by 47% after 3 mo of dieting (P < 0.05). Estimated potassium intake correlated with 24-h urinary excretion. Estimated calcium intake significantly increased from 933 +/- 83 mg/d to 1029 +/- 171 mg/d (P < 0.05). Calcium intake derived from patients' recall far exceeded and only slightly correlated with 24-h urinary excretion (R = 0.23, P < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients tend to underestimate their sodium intake by 30% to 50%; therefore, urinary sodium excretion is more accurate to assess sodium intake. Thus, 24-h urinary sodium excretion should be used in clinical practice and in clinical trials, especially when dietary non-compliance is suspected."

METHODS: From 1988 to 2001, there were 21 pathologically proven primary urethral carcinomas diagnosed and treated at our hospital (14 males, 7 females). Seven of 14 male patients were chronically exposed to arsenic in drinking water for an average of 23 years. We compared our cases to three studies in the USA (80 males, 179 females), and analyzed the influence of chronic arsenic exposure by onset age, histology, staging, and outcome.
RESULTS: Male patients with localized tumors had better survival compared to those with advanced tumors (p = 0.0045 in males, p = 0.07 in females). In comparison to the three studies in the USA, there was an unusual higher frequency of bulbomembranous adenocarcinoma at our center (43 vs. 18%, 2 and 0%, respectively, p < 0.0001), particularly among those with chronic arsenic exposure (73 vs. 14%, p = 0.031).
CONCLUSIONS: In South Taiwan, there was a high frequency of bulbomembranous urethral adenocarcinoma, which might be associated with chronic arsenic exposure. Although the implications of such an observation are minimal owing to its rarity, it is worth exploring."
15812253,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15812253/,"BACKGROUND: Despite the increasing popularity of wrist-cuff blood pressure (BP) devices, their accuracy has not been established and international guidelines do not support their use. Because arm position influences BP measurement, it is possible that conflicting reports on wrist-cuff device accuracy reflects diverse arm positions.
METHOD: This study compared BP measured by two oscillometric devices, the upper arm-cuff OMRON HEM 705 CP and the OMRON R6 oscillometric wrist-cuff device. In the former BP was measured with the arm in two supported positions, dependent on a table (manufacturer's instructions) and horizontal (mid sternum), while the latter followed the manufacturer's instructions.
RESULTS: In contrast to the dependent arm where BP was significantly higher (P<0.05), the horizontal arm position with the arm-cuff produced a mean systolic and diastolic BP comparable to the wrist-cuff device where the wrist was at heart level being respectively, 137+/-29/80+/-16 and 134+/-27/77+/-16 mmHg. A close relationship over a wide BP range was also confirmed by least squares, least product linear regression and Bland-Altman analysis.
CONCLUSION: This study supports the use of wrist-cuff monitors for self/home use and underlines the need for a more precise definition for arm position when using all BP devices -- mercury and oscillometric."

Because tethered spinal cord syndrome (TCS) has similar symptoms, we evaluated imaging for TCS in patients with FG syndrome.
STUDY DESIGN: Patients were recruited from the International FG Syndrome Support Group, and an FG Syndrome Consensus Group reviewed clinical histories, medical records, and photographs of each responding patient. Results of cranial and spinal imaging studies were available for 12 patients.
RESULTS: Of 12 boys with FG syndrome, 6 had hypoplasia of the corpus callosum, and 3 of these had TCS (all with constipation and urinary symptoms). The other 9 did not have urinary symptoms. After surgical untethering, bowel and bladder symptoms improved.
CONCLUSIONS: Tethered spinal cord syndrome occurred in 25% of patients with FG syndrome associated with hypoplasia of the corpus callosum and causing bowel and bladder incontinence. A high index of suspicion is necessary for early diagnosis, and timely intervention results in significant improvement in symptomatology."
15813764,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15813764/,"PURPOSE: At the Faculty of Medicine at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium, we have developed a final examination that consists of extended matching multiple-choice questions. Extended matching questions (EMQs) originate from a case and have 1 correct answer within a list of at least 7 alternatives. If EMQs assess clinical reasoning, we can assume there will be a difference between the ways students and experienced doctors solve the problems within the questions. This study compared students' and residents' processes of solving EMQs.
METHODS: Twenty final year students and 20 fourth or fifth year residents specialising in internal medicine solved 20 EMQs aloud. All questions concerned diagnosis or pathogenesis. Ten EMQs related to internal medicine and 10 questions to other medical disciplines. The session was audio-taped and transcribed.
RESULTS: The residents correctly answered significantly more questions concerning internal medicine than did the students. Their reasoning was more ""forward"" and less ""backward"". No difference between residents and students was found for the other questions. The residents scored better on internal medicine than on the other questions. They used more backward and less forward reasoning when solving the other questions than they did with the internal medicine questions. The better half of the respondents used significantly more forward and less backward reasoning than did the poorer half.
CONCLUSION: In accordance with the literature, medical expertise was characterised by forward reasoning, whereas outside their area of expertise, the subjects switched over to backward reasoning. It is possible to assess processes of clinical reasoning using EMQs."

AIM: To assess the proportion of patients reaching medical care after hepatitis C diagnosis in a general population (1 006 171 inhabitants) in France.
METHODS: Between 1994 and 1999, 1508 cases were diagnosed, of which 1251 were eligible for the study.
RESULTS: Two-hundred and two patients did not have any medical care; among them, 55.4% had normal alanine transferase, 58.4% had risk factors related to lifestyle and 22.8% were alcoholics. Amongst the 1049 other patients, 41.6% had a liver biopsy, 25.0% were treated. Treatment was more often carried out in males than in females (OR: 1.59; P = 0.001), and in patients under 65 than in older patients (OR: 2.22; P < 0.008). Among non-treatment reasons, alcoholism (P = 0.001), drug-addiction (P = 0.04) and escaping monitoring (P = 0.04) were more frequent in males than in females, whereas normal alanine transferase was more frequent in females than in males (P = 0.004). Amongst 278 patients with a Metavir score >A1F1, 71 (25.5%) did not undergo treatment.
CONCLUSION: In a general population, one patient in six did not receive on-going health care; a quarter of patients with a Metavir score >A1F1 did not receive any treatment. These results showed insufficient clinical management, which could compromise the effectiveness of treatment in general population."
15813874,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15813874/,"OBJECTIVE: Universal Newborn Hearing Screening (UNHS) programmes have been widely implemented, but their costs, benefits and long-term logistics remain to be clearly defined. There are few rigorous evaluations of alternative strategies. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of the distraction test component of the two-tiered Victorian Infant Hearing Screening Program (VIHSP).
METHODS: All babies born in the State of Victoria, Australia in 1993 who survived the neonatal period were screened for the presence of risk factors for hearing loss. Those at-risk were referred for Auditory Brainstem Evoked Response (ABR) screening by a professional audiologist. All others were screened by modified distraction test at age 7-9 months. This birth cohort was followed through age 6 for diagnoses of congenital hearing loss resulting in fitting of hearing aids. Estimates of false-positives, false-negatives, sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive values were determined for the distraction test as a population screen. Ages at diagnosis and aid fitting for screen failures with hearing loss were compared with current goals.
RESULTS: For targeted (moderate or greater-aided) losses, the distraction test yielded eight (0.02%) documented false-negatives (one severe and seven moderate) and an estimated 4265 (99%) false-positives. Distraction test sensitivity was 65%, specificity 91% and PPV 0.3%. Mean age at diagnosis for distraction test failures across all severities, including mild losses, was 23 (SD 18) months with a mean age at aid fitting of 26 (SD 20) months.
CONCLUSIONS: The distraction test screen generated large numbers of false-positives and a significant number of false-negatives, performing particularly poorly with moderate losses. Ages at diagnosis and aid fitting for screen failures were far older than currently accepted goals. There is little evidence that the distraction test can be made to work acceptably as a population-based screen."
15814606,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15814606/,"INTRODUCTION: It is perceived wisdom that within the host macrophage, Mycobacterium tuberculosis frequently encounters oxidative stress. Exposure of bacteria to reactive oxygen intermediates can have a mutagenic effect on the DNA. Various mutations are thought to arise as a consequence, including the oxidation of guanine residues, leading to G?C-->T?A substitution, and oxidation of cytosine resulting in a G?C-->A?T substitution.
METHODS: We measured the relative contribution of oxidative stress by recording the percentage of single nucleotide substitutions reported in the genes rpoB and pncA that confer resistance to the antimicrobials rifampicin and pyrazinamide, respectively, and determined whether there is an excess of G?C-->T?A or G?C-->A?T substitutions.
RESULTS: Out of 840 clinical isolates reported with single nucleotide mutations in the rpoB gene, 67% were G?C-->A?T changes, and 3% were G?C-->T?A substitutions. These figures were compared to the pncA gene, where out of 114 isolates, 30% of the single nucleotide mutations were G?C-->A?T transitions and 9% were G?C-->T?A changes.
CONCLUSIONS: While there is an excess of G?C-->A?T changes in the rpoB gene, this was not the case in the pncA gene. Fifty-three percent of mutations within the rpoB gene were C-->T mutations of the type S531L. Although this mutation gives a fitness disadvantage, it is less than other common mutations, so it is more likely that that fitness is the determinant of surviving mutation rather than oxidative stress because of the small numbers of other C-->T and G-->A mutations at other sites (12%). There was no evidence of oxygen free radicals damaging the guanine bases in either gene."
15814921,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15814921/,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The association of high-grade oligodendrogliomas with tumor contrast material enhancement on MR images has been reported. Some authors have even used contrast enhancement as a criterion for their oligodendroglioma grading system. The purpose of our study was to evaluate if tumor contrast enhancement is a specific finding for anaplastic oligodendroglioma.
METHODS: Pretreatment MR images of 24 oligodendrogliomas were reviewed retrospectively, and findings were compared with the histologic grade. The presence or absence and the pattern of tumor contrast enhancement were evaluated qualitatively. A contrast enhancement ratio (CER), a quantitative criterion, was calculated to assess the difference in degree of enhancement between the low-grade and anaplastic tumors. Tumor grade was diagnosed at pathologic examination according to the World Health Organization classification system.
RESULTS: Contrast enhancement was noted in nine (56%) of 16 low-grade tumors and in five (62%) of eight anaplastic tumors. A characteristic enhancement pattern, nodular-like enhancement, was found in eight tumors. The CERs were 2.12-40.88 (mean, 20.08) in low-grade tumors and were 3.20-62.52 (mean, 28.73) in anaplastic tumors (P > .05).
CONCLUSION: Tumor contrast enhancement was not statistically significantly different between the tumor groups. We believe that the presence or absence of tumor contrast enhancement is not a specific finding for simply discriminating low-grade from anaplastic oligodendrogliomas. Histologic confirmation is necessary even in tumors without contrast enhancement."
15815205,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15815205/,"AIMS: Small bowel contents can sometimes hamper the quality of capsule images. Our aim was to investigate the effect of PEG administered prior to capsule endoscopy (CE) upon quality of images, gastrointestinal transit time, and detection rate of small bowel bleeding lesions in patients with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-two consecutive patients were included. CE was performed following a 12-hour fasting period. The 16 first patients (Group A) received no preparation and the following 27 patients (Group B) received 2 L of PEG the night before. The quality of images was assessed at both in duodenojejunum and ileum level, using a scale including the presence of air bubbles, biliary secretion, and residue (1-4).
RESULTS: Quality of images were not different in Group A compared with Group B in the duodenojejunum and in the ileum. Gastric transit time tended to be shorter in Group A compared with Group B (25.5 vs. 45.7 minutes) (P = 0.15), whereas small bowel transit was not different between both groups (271 vs. 288 minutes). Total small bowel CE examination was complete in Group A and in 24 of 26 in Group B (not significant). Potential bleeding lesions were seen in 8 patients in Group A and 12 in Group B (not significant).
CONCLUSION: Our retrospective study suggests that 2 L PEG preparation seems able to improve neither the quality of CE images nor its diagnostic performance. Moreover, in our study, PEG tended to increase gastric emptying time and may constitute a limitation for small bowel complete examination."
15815795,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15815795/,"BACKGROUND: In some patients with acute pulmonary embolism (APE) thrombi may lodge at the levels of the bifurcation of pulmonary trunk and extend into both main pulmonary arteries, forming so-called saddle embolism (SE).
AIM: To assess the incidence of SE and whether it is associated with an increased risk of complicated clinical course.
METHODS: We studied 150 consecutive patients (94 females, 56 males) aged 63.6+/-16.7 years with APE confirmed with contrast enhanced spiral computed tomography or transesophageal echocardiography.
RESULTS: SE was detected in 22 (14.7%) patients. Mean age (SE vs N-SE) was 64.3+/-17.4 vs 63.5+/-16.6 years, heart rate 100.8+/-14.1 beats/min vs 97.8+/-21.1 beats/min, systolic blood pressure 126.2+/-20.1 vs 127.1+/-23.3 mmHg and blood pulsoximetry 92 (68-98) vs 91 (30-98) % (all differences NS). In patients with SE, echocardiographic signs of the right ventricular overload, defined as right to left ventricular end - diastolic ratio >0.6 with right ventricular hypokinesia and/or maximal tricuspid peak systolic gradient >30 mmHg with shortened acceleration time of pulmonary ejection <80 ms, were more frequent (77.3% vs 51.6%, p=0.04), as was the mid-systolic deceleration of pulmonary ejection velocity (77.3% vs 49.2%, p=0.04). Mortality and complicated clinical course rates were similar in patients with SE or N-SE (mortality: 4.5% vs 13.3%, NS, and complicated clinical course: 34.4% vs 25.0%, NS).
CONCLUSIONS: Saddle pulmonary embolism is frequent, especially in patients with echocardiographic signs of impaired pulmonary ejection pattern. Saddle embolism does not indicate unfavourable clinical outcome and probably should not influence treatment selection."

RESULTS: PASI-score was reduced by 89% in 74 patients. The direct cost to improve one in-patient by 75% in PASI score (PASI-75) was 4342.27 EUR; the total costs for employed patients were 7441.81 EUR. Direct costs of treatment with efalizumab would come to 15048.89 EUR per patient with PASI-75 in a 12 weeks period.

METHODS: A set of 115 patients with well-established dates and singleton, appropriate for gestational age (GA), non-anomalous fetuses with nuchal cord(s) diagnosed with prenatal color Doppler imaging, between 28 and 41 weeks and 115 controls matched for GA, were studied. Patients with hypertension, diabetes and autoimmune conditions were excluded. Doppler indices were obtained from the umbilical artery (UA) and the fetal middle cerebral artery (MCA) upon initial diagnosis of the nuchal cord.
RESULTS: Of 115 GA-matched pairs of pregnancies, 103 fetuses had a single nuchal cord and 12 a double nuchal cord. No significant differences were noted in patient age, gravidity, parity, sonographically estimated fetal weight (SEFW), and growth centile at ultrasonographic diagnosis. Mean UA systolic/diastolic ratio (S/D) was 2.28 +/- 0.32 and 2.36 +/- 0.33 (P = 0.03) and UA resistance index (RI) 0.55 +/- 0.06 and 0.57 +/- 0.06 (P = 0.02) among study and controls, respectively. Mean fetal MCA S/D and RI did not differ significantly between the two groups (fetal MCA S/D 5.01 +/- 1.28 and 5.04 +/- 1.71 (P = 0.86), and mean fetal MCA RI 0.78 +/- 0.06 and 0.78 +/- 0.05 (P = 0.88)). No significant differences were noted in GA at delivery, incidence of meconium-stained amniotic fluid, birth weight, mode of delivery, neonatal gender, 1 and 5 minute Apgar scores, or UA pH and base excess, between study and control patients.

METHODOLOGY: For this study, in the Department of Surgical Sciences of Catania University we observed 62 patients affected by colorectal cancer, 32 affected by precancerous lesions and 20 used as the control group. In each patient we performed an endoscopic biopsy on the lesion, one 5 cm to the lesion and one 10 cm to the lesion. In each biopsy were detected polyamines concentrations.
RESULTS: We found a significant increment of free and acetylated polyamines levels in neoplastic patients in comparison with non-neoplastic. Polyamines levels are increased at the site of cancer in comparison of adjacent colonic mucosa. In addition polyamines levels are increased in normal colon mucosa from cancer patients compared with the mucosa of control patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Significant increment of polyamines levels at the site of cancer in comparison of non-neoplastic mucosa and adjacent colonic mucosa give them the possibility to occupy an important role in early detection of colon cancer by acting like oncological markers."

In addition, the value of CEA in postoperative surveillance is discussed.
METHODOLOGY: A review was performed of 541 patients who underwent curative resection for UICC stage I colorectal carcinoma between January, 1985 and December, 1998. Periodic check-up was routinely conducted to identify recurrence.
RESULTS: The median follow-up was 82 months. The recurrence rate was 2.9% in the UICC stage Ia (pT1N0M0) group, and 5.6% in the Ib (pT2N0M0) group. Cancer-specific survival rates at 5 years were 99.3% and 97.6%, respectively (p=0.0354). Recurrences occurred more frequently in patients with lower rectal carcinoma (p=0.0415). Curative-intent salvage surgery was performed in 61.9% (13/21) for recurrent lesions. Between the patients who were CEA positive (13/21; 61.9%) and those who were CEA negative at the time of recurrence, there was no significant difference in the prognosis.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of recurrence was low after curative surgery in patients with UICC stage I colorectal carcinoma, and it is therefore possible to reduce times and types of postoperative examinations. CEA measurement alone appears to be sufficient."

METHODOLOGY: Forty patients with thoracic esophageal cancer who were scheduled for esophagectomy with lymphadenectomy were randomly allocated to either of the following two groups: 20 patients received methylprednisolone (500 mg/body) in saline 2 hours before surgery and another 20 patients received a placebo (saline alone). The effects on the early clinical course were assessed by rectal intramucosal pH (pHi) as a marker of systemic oxygenation, water balance, serum cytokine levels and the incidence of postoperative complications. The effects on the late clinical course were examined by comparing patient survival time.
RESULTS: Rectal pHi value, water balance, blood balance and body weight change did not significantly differ between the two groups. Serum proinflammatory cytokine (interleukin-6 and interleukin-8) levels were significantly higher in the control group than the methylprednisolone group 2 hours after surgery. Serum C-reactive protein was also significantly higher in the control group on postoperative day 2 and 3. No significant differences were seen in the incidence of postoperative complications. Survival curves for the two groups did not statistically differ.
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative methylprednisolone significantly reduces inflammatory cytokine response immediately after surgery for esophageal cancer, but its clinical benefit remains unclear."

We believe that the results of our study demonstrate that this block may be performed safely on anaesthetized patients, providing that certain conditions are met.
METHODS: Five hundred and forty-eight cases of arthroscopic shoulder surgery were analysed retrospectively in order to identify the results of interscalene block performed after induction of general anaesthesia, but before the start of surgery. Patients were kept in hospital for 24 h and assessed before being discharged from the hospital and again in the period from 4 to 8 weeks after surgery. Duration of the block, quality of postoperative pain relief and neurological complications were recorded.
RESULTS: Our study failed to reveal any permanent or long-term neurological complications attributable to interscalene block performed after induction of general anaesthesia.
CONCLUSION: It is our opinion that the primary factor for safe interscalene block is modification of the anaesthetic technique rather than the timing of regional block in relation to induction of general anaesthesia."
15816589,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15816589/,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to report our experience concerning the effectiveness, complications and safety of spinal anaesthesia, and to determine whether spinal anaesthesia was effective in full-term infants undergoing elective inguinal hernia repair.
METHODS: Sixty-eight full-term infants aged < 6 months were included in the study. Infants were divided into three groups; Group I (< 1 month, n = 20), Group II (> 1 and < 3 months, n = 26), and Group III (3-6 months, n = 22). All spinal blocks were performed under mask inhalation anaesthesia. A dose of bupivacaine 0.5% 0.5 mg kg(-1) was used for infants under 5kg and 0.4 mg kg(-1) for those over 5 kg. Heart rate, mean arterial pressure, respiratory rate and SPO2 were recorded before and after spinal anaesthesia at 5 min intervals. Time to onset of analgesia, time to start of operation, duration of operation, anaesthesia and hospitalization, postoperative analgesic requirement and complications were recorded.
RESULTS: Adequate spinal anaesthesia without sedation was better, time to obtain maximum cutaneous analgesia was shorter and need for sedation and postoperative analgesic requirement were significantly lower in Group I. Although heart rate, mean arterial pressure and respiratory rate decreased < 20% in all groups following spinal analgesia, the decrease in Group I was lower than the others.
CONCLUSIONS: Spinal anaesthesia is an effective choice in inguinal hernia repair for full-term infants aged < 1 month, providing excellent and reliable surgical conditions. However, this technique is not as useful for infants aged between 1 and 6 months."
15816595,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15816595/,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Magnesium disorders are common in hospitalized patients. In patients with low or normal magnesium, the intravenous magnesium loading test has been demonstrated to be a sensitive test to assess magnesium deficiency in critically ill patients. However, it is more time consuming and more difficult than the measurement of intracellular or extracellular magnesium concentrations. This study evaluated whether erythrocyte, plasma and urinary magnesium concentrations predict renal magnesium retention measured by th magnesium loading test.
METHODS: One-hundred-and-three intensive care patients (36 females, 67 males) in a tertiary care centre and 41 healthy subjects (13 females, 28 males) took part in this prospective study. Intracellular, total plasma, ionize extracellular and urinary magnesium concentrations were measured and also magnesium retention by intravenous magnesium loading test.
RESULTS: Total plasma magnesium concentration was poorly correlated with magnesium retention (r = 0.36 r2 = 0.13) and was the only parameter that significantly predicted magnesium retention in intensive care patients (P < 0.01). However, only 10% of the magnesium retention data were linked to the total plasma magnesium concentration.
CONCLUSIONS: Total plasma magnesium concentration predicts magnesium retention in critically ill intensive care patients but not intracellular and urinary magnesium concentrations. Only a small proportion of the magnesium retention was due to the total plasma magnesium concentration."
15816955,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15816955/,"PURPOSE: Although the ketogenic diet has been in use for >80 years, little agreement exists as to which patients are most likely to have dramatic, sudden, and complete seizure control.
METHODS: A case-control study was performed of children with intractable epilepsy started on the ketogenic diet at our institution since June 2001. Patients with a dramatic response were defined as those becoming seizure free within 2 weeks of diet onset. These children were compared with all other patients treated with the diet over the same time period in terms of patient demographics, epilepsy characteristics, and diet parameters.
RESULTS: Eighteen early, dramatic responders over a 3-year period were identified and compared with 89 patients who were not similarly improved. The absence of complex partial seizures as the predominant seizure type (0 vs. 23%; p = 0.02) correlated with this dramatic success. The presence of infantile spasms (39% vs. 20%; p = 0.09) approached significance, but all other variables did not.
CONCLUSIONS: An early, dramatic response to the ketogenic diet is more likely in patients with predominant seizure types other than complex partial. It may also be more likely to occur in children who have infantile spasms. In all other patient demographics and diet parameters, an equal likelihood of similar success was found."
15816971,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15816971/,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to know the effect of education level (EL) on the cognitive change after onset of epilepsy. The rationale is that people with high EL may have more cognitive reserve and show resistance to damage brought about by epilepsy.
METHODS: Patients were from an outpatient epilepsy clinic of a national university hospital. All received initial and repeated neuropsychological tests and the Cognitive Ability Screening Instrument (CASI), at an interval of 12 months. CASI consists of nine items, with a total score of 100. We compared the differences between the two tests, in terms of z-scores. The EL was divided into high and low with a cut-off at 12 years, and age at entry was divided with a cut-off at 38 years. Epilepsy severity was divided into intractable and nonintractable.
RESULTS: A total of 64 patients completed the study, including 31 with high EL and 33 with low EL, with no differences in gender and epilepsy severity between groups. In general, patients had cognitive impairment in multiple domains. At the baseline, the effect of EL was found for all items except remote memory and orientation, whereas the effect of age was observed for remote and recent memory. At the 12-month follow-up, subjects with high EL showed deterioration in mental manipulation, whereas subjects with low EL showed improvement in verbal fluency but deterioration in attention.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with high EL have better cognitive functioning than those with low EL after epilepsy has developed, which supports the cognitive reserve theory. However, 1-year follow-up might be too short to see significant changes between groups."
15816996,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15816996/,"BACKGROUND: Highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels are significant predictors of subsequent diabetes and metabolic syndrome (MS). Owing the strong correlations between components of the MS and obesity with hs-CRP levels, previous studies about the associations of hs-CRP with insulin resistance might have been confounded by the inclusion of overweight or dysmetabolic subjects.
DESIGN: Our aim was to evaluate the associations between hs-CRP levels and fasting insulin and insulin resistance (evaluated by the Homeostasis Model Assessment: HOMA IR) in a subgroup of subjects with normal body mass index (BMI) and without any metabolic abnormalities. Out of a cohort of 1658 middle-aged subjects, representative of the local sanitary districts of the province of Asti (north-western Italy) enrolled for metabolic screening: 241 (14.5%) showed normal BMI, glucose tolerance, blood pressure and waist values and no dyslipidaemia.
RESULTS: In this subgroup of subjects, those with hs-CRP levels > or = 3 mg L(-1) showed significantly higher median insulin and HOMA-IR values (respectively: 20.4 vs. 6.0 pmol L(-1), and 0.8 vs. 0.2 microU mL(-1)x mmol L(-1)). In a multiple regression model, insulin and insulin resistance remained significantly and independently related to hs-CRP levels, after adjustments for age, sex, BMI, waist, alcohol consumption, level of physical activity and smoking habits. Very few individuals within lower fasting insulin quartiles showed hs-CRP values > or = 3 mg L(-1) when compared with approximately 60% of those within the highest quartile.
CONCLUSIONS: The novel finding is that a state of low-grade systemic inflammation is present in normal BMI subjects who show subclinical insulin resistance but no other metabolic abnormalities."
15817656,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15817656/,"OBJECTIVES: To (a) develop further logically derived line drawing atlases (LDAs) for grading radiographic knee osteoarthritis (OA); and (b) determine which is superior using metrological criteria.
METHODS: A series of LDAs (-3 to +3, -4 to +4, and -5 to +5) were produced by (a) incorporating additional grades for osteophyte and joint space width (JSW) above the 0-3 pilot LDA, over an equivalent range of disease; and (b) adding negative grades for JSW. 121 sets of bilateral knee radiographs (standing, anteroposterior plus flexed skyline), plus serial views of 68 tibiofemoral joints (TFJs) and 36 patellofemoral joints were scored twice by one observer for each LDA. Minimum JSW of 50 radiograph sets was directly measured and awarded a categorical grade dependent upon the boundaries of each LDA grade. Time taken to grade 30 randomly selected knee radiograph sets was measured.
RESULTS: Intraobserver reproducibility was similar for all LDAs, (weighted kappa: JSW = 0.85-0.87; osteophyte = 0.77-0.79), with no deterioration with increasing grades. Criterion validity favoured the -5 to +5 LDA, which was also quickest to use. All atlases showed similar responsiveness (standardised response mean: medial TFJ JSW = 0.78-0.83; medial femoral osteophyte = 0.61-0.73), with most sites compromised by small sample size, little change in score, and high variation between subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: A set of LDAs was created illustrating the full range of normality/abnormality likely to be encountered in a community study of knee pain or OA. Despite superior validity and equivalent reproducibility, improved responsiveness of the -5 to +5 LDA was not confirmed."
15817918,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15817918/,"OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the addition of metformin to gonadotrophin ovulation induction in insulin-resistant, normogonadotrophic, anovulatory women alters ovarian responsiveness to exogenous FSH.
DESIGN: Placebo-controlled double-blind assessment in an academic hospital.
RESULTS: After a progestagen withdrawal bleeding, patients were randomised for either metformin (n = 11) or placebo (n = 9) treatment. In cases of absent ovulation, exogenous FSH was subsequently administered to induce ovulation. Only during metformin treatment did body mass index and androgen (androstenedione and testosterone) levels decrease, whereas FSH and LH levels increased significantly. In the metformin group, a single patient ovulated before the initiation of exogenous FSH. Significantly more monofollicular cycles and lower preovulatory oestradiol concentrations were observed in women receiving FSH with metformin compared with FSH alone.
CONCLUSIONS: Metformin co-treatment in a group of insulin-resistant, normogonadotrophic, anovulatory patients resulted in normalization of the endocrine profile and facilitated monofollicular development during the FSH induction of ovulation."
15817994,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15817994/,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the effect of CoQ10 (added to either a fibrate, or PUFA or association of both) in patients affected by massive hypertriglyceridemia (MHTG) resistant to fibrates and PUFA.
DESIGN: Open, sequential, comparative intervention study.
SETTING: Specialised centres for dyslipidemia management.
SUBJECTS: 15 subjects (mean age: 45.1 +/- 12.5 years) affected by MHTG and hyporesponsive to either fibrates, or PUFA, or fibrates-PUFA association, and 15 age-matched subjects regularly responders to PUFA and fenofibrate treatment.
INTERVENTIONS: Treatment for periods of 6 weeks each with the following consecutive treatments: CoQ10 150 mg/day, PUFA 3000 mg/day, fenofibrate 200 mg/day, PUFA 3000 mg/day + fenofibrate 200 mg/day, PUFA 3000 mg/day + CoQ10 150 mg/day, fenofibrate 200 mg/day + CoQ10 150 mg/day, and finally, fenofibrate 200 mg/day + PUFA 3000 mg/day + CoQ10 150 mg/day.
RESULTS: CoQ10 supplementation improved, in the control group, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, creatinine and Lp(a) plasma levels, both during fenofibrate and/or PUFA treatment. In MHTG group, CoQ10 supplementation significantly improved TG, TC, Lp(a), uric acid and blood pressure during fenofibrate treatment, but only Lp(a) and blood pressure during PUFA treatment. Fenofibrate appeared to have better effect on hsCRP and gamma-GT plasma levels than PUFA. No significant change was observed in any group and under any treatment in regards to homocysteinemia, PAI-1, or t-PA.
CONCLUSION: Even though the mechanism of action through which the effects were obtained is yet to be elucidated, adding CoQ10 to fenofibrate could improve the drug's efficacy in MHTG patients not responding to fenofibrate alone."
15818034,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15818034/,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Patients with cardiogenic sources of embolism may be at increased risk of cerebral infarction when anticoagulation therapy is suspended for surgical procedures. The purpose of this study was to determine frequency of cardioembolic cerebral infarction during periprocedural warfarin withdrawal.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis of prospective cerebral infarction registry data from two tertiary medical centers.
RESULTS: Over a 12-month period, 14 cases of cardioembolic cerebral infarction occurring during the period of warfarin withdrawal for a medical procedure were observed, accounting for 7.1% of the 197 cardioembolic cerebral infarctions encountered. Across all patients, cerebral infarctions developed an average of 5.4 days after the last dose of warfarin (range 3-8). Among the 14 patients (8 males and 6 females) with warfarin cessation-related infarcts, age ranged from 54 to 91 years. Each had been on chronic anticoagulation with warfarin for more than 1 year. Retrospective analysis suggested that all these cerebral infarctions had been potentially preventable. In each case, either the planned procedure did not require discontinuation of warfarin or, when withdrawal was required, no bridging, parenteral anticoagulation was provided to lessen the risk during the warfarin-free period.
CONCLUSION: Patients at high risk of cardioembolic cerebral infarction may benefit from more intensive management strategies to reduce cerebral infarction risk during periprocedural periods."

METHODS: Using population-based data from the 2003 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey, respondents were classified according to their arthritis status, whether or not they were ever advised by a health professional to increase their physical activity to help them better manage their arthritis, and whether they engaged in exercise or physical activity within the past month.
RESULTS: Overall, 42% of respondents with arthritis reported ever being advised to increase their physical activity to help their arthritis. Respondents who were more likely to have ever received the advice were female, middle-aged or older, African American, Hispanic, overweight or obese, sedentary or insufficiently physically active, and had higher levels of education. Persons who reported ever receiving the advice were less likely to report that they had exercised within the past month. A higher level of education was the only variable associated with recent exercise or physical activity among those advised to be more active.
CONCLUSION: Less than 50% of adults with arthritis report ever being advised by a health professional to become more physically active. Advice alone appears insufficient to promote increased physical activity in adults with arthritis."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients were identified from a roster of patients who had undergone testing at a nonvascular laboratory between September 1, 2001, and January 31, 2002, and were found to have evidence of PAD, defined as an ankle-brachial index of 0.9 or less. We thoroughly reviewed patients' electronic medical records. Backward elimination multivariate logistic regression modeling was used to Identify factors associated with reaching the goal LDL-C level.
RESULTS: Among 143 patients with PAD, 105 (73%) met the goal LDL-C level. Lipid-lowering therapy was prescribed for 109 (76%). Lower diastolic blood pressure and lower weight were independently associated with an LDL-C level of less than 100 mg/dL.
CONCLUSION: We found higher rates of lipid-lowering therapy in patients with PAD than reported previously. Patients with diabetes mellitus or coronary artery disease were not more likely to meet the goal LDL-C level than those without these comorbidities. Clinical practice may be catching up to clinical guidelines."
15819655,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15819655/,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To develop a practitioner-led description of gerontological nursing and articulate the principles which underpin its practice.
BACKGROUND: As the population ages expertise in gerontological nursing will become increasingly important. However, a complete and widely accepted delineation of the rationale, philosophy, knowledge base and special skills for gerontological nursing is yet to be developed.
METHODS: As one cycle of a larger action research project informed by realistic evaluation, a representative sample of 30 Scottish nurses worked together as a Community of Practice to develop a description of gerontological nursing that would have utility in their practice and in the development of best practice care guidance. Data collection involved group interviews and records of on-line discussions. Data were analysed using content analysis. The emerging description was verified through external consultation with other nursing colleagues and older people.
RESULTS: Nursing older people within Scotland was perceived as low status and participants reported that a positive reframing of gerontological nursing was needed. A description and underlying principles were developed by nurses and used as a lens to shape best practice statements. The description embraces a person-centred and enabling approach to evidenced-based gerontological nursing.
CONCLUSIONS: Gerontological practice requires an accessible consensus view and description to support its development. Practising nurses developed such a view and its utility has been seen in the development of best practice statements. Relevance to clinical practice. The description and principles of gerontological nursing can be used to guide nursing practice, practice development and research."
15819729,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15819729/,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the utilization of psychiatric in-patient care among immigrants, and to compare immigrants and natives with respect to sociodemographic and clinical characteristics.
METHOD: Analysing a sample of 23 377 consecutive referrals to psychiatric hospitals of a catchment area in 1995-2001.
RESULTS: Within this sample, 20% were foreign nationals. Rates of psychotic disorders were similar in immigrants and natives. Regarding other diagnoses, sociodemographic and clinical measures, there were significant differences. Most immigrant groups had higher rates of compulsory admission, were more likely to be admitted with lower illness severity and not to be readmitted, and spent significantly shorter time in hospital, compared with Swiss in-patients. Some of these differences were clearly gender-specific.
CONCLUSION: Service utilization and psychiatric treatment decisions are not explained merely by illness-related aspects in immigrants. Social and cultural factors have to be recognized in order to prevent disadvantages in psychiatric care."
15819734,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15819734/,"OBJECTIVE: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is exclusively related to symptoms of the central nervous system. Retrospectively in up to 15% the initial presentation is psychiatric disturbances. In these cases the diagnosis often is delayed or missed.
METHOD: Two cases of CADASIL diagnosed in a psychiatric hospital are presented.
RESULTS: Both patients were admitted to the gerontopsychiatric department (one because of a suicidal attempt and a depressive episode, the other because of cognitive decline and progressive personal neglect). Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed severe leukoencephalopathy in the absence of cardiovascular risk factors. In both cases, diagnosis of CADASIL was made by the identification of specific granular osmiophilic material in skin biopsies.
CONCLUSION: Brain MRI should be performed in all cases of late onset of severe psychiatric symptoms. CADASIL should be considered as a possible differential diagnosis whenever a marked leukoencephalopathy is detectable. Diagnosis can be verified by taking a skin biopsy or by specific genetic testing."
15819837,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15819837/,"AIM: The purpose of this study was to explore the types and frequency of verbal abuse of nurses by other nurses. Further, this study explored the components, characteristics, consequences and effects of abuse in an effort to better understand the dynamics of verbal abuse of nurses in the workplace. Nurses who experience occupational burnout are more likely to abuse other nurses.
BACKGROUND: It is believed that nurses have been historically subjected to verbal abuse by colleagues, something previously considered to be done primarily by doctors. The effects and consequences of verbal abuse can be devastating and long-lasting. Research that has focused on its consequences has found that it is both physiologically and psychologically damaging.
METHOD: Participants completed an adapted survey, incorporating the Verbal Abuse Scale and the Verbal Abuse Survey and demographic questions developed by the researchers. Specifically, types of verbal aggression, the frequency and stressfulness of each type, emotional reaction to verbal aggression, cognitive appraisal of verbally aggressive encounters, and similarity and effectiveness of coping behaviours were explored. The long-term negative effects of verbal aggression, including absenteeism and errors in patient treatment, were also evaluated to determine if verbal aggression is a contributing factor.
RESULTS: Respondents reported that the most frequent source of abuse was nurses (27%), followed by patients' families (25%), doctors (22%), patients (17%), residents (4%), other (3%) and interns (2%). Of those who selected a nurse as the most frequent source, staff nurses were reported to be the most frequent nursing source (80%) followed by nurse managers (20%).
CONCLUSIONS: Verbal abuse in nursing is quite costly to the individual nurses, the hospitals and the patients. Nurses who regularly experience verbal abuse may be more stressed, may feel less satisfied with their jobs, may miss more work and may provide a substandard quality of care to patients."
15819975,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15819975/,"BACKGROUND: Low socioeconomic status has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality for various health conditions. The purpose of this study was twofold: to examine the mortality experience of older persons admitted to hospital with community acquired pneumonia and to test the hypothesis of whether an association exists between socioeconomic status and mortality subsequent to hospital admission for community-acquired pneumonia.
METHODS: A population based retrospective cohort study was conducted including all older persons patients admitted to Ontario hospitals with community acquired pneumonia between April 1995 and March 2001. The main outcome measures were 30 day and 1 year mortality subsequent to hospital admission for community-acquired pneumonia.
RESULTS: Socioeconomic status for each patient was imputed from median neighbourhood income. Multivariate analyses were undertaken to adjust for age, sex, co-morbid illness, hospital and physician characteristics. The study sample consisted of 60,457 people. Increasing age, male gender and high co-morbidity increased the risk for mortality at 30 days and one year. Female gender and having a family physician as attending physician reduced mortality risk. The adjusted odds of death after 30-days for the quintiles compared to the lowest income quintile (quintile 1) were 1.02 (95% CI: 0.95-1.09) for quintile 2, 1.04 (95% CI: 0.97-1.12) for quintile 3, 1.01 (95% CI: 0.94-1.08) for quintile 4 and 1.03 (95% CI: 0.96-1.12) for the highest income quintile (quintile 5). For 1 year mortality, compared to the lowest income quintile the adjusted odds ratios were 1.01 (95% CI: 0.96-1.06) for quintile 2, 0.99 (95% CI: 0.94-1.04) for quintile 3, 0.99 (95% CI: 0.93-1.05) for quintile 4 and 1.03 (95% CI: 0.97-1.10) for the highest income quintile.

15820244,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15820244/,"BACKGROUND: Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) are the most common tumor markers for colorectal cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possibility of adding them into the current staging system by analyzing their prognostic significance.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study population was patients (n = 574, 67.1 +/- 11.3 years old, 397 males) who received potentially curative resection of colorectal adenocarcinoma (stage I-III) between January 1994 and August 2002, including preoperative measurements of CEA and CA19-9. Clinicopathological characteristics and associated follow-up data were retrospectively collected by reviewing available medical charts. CEA higher or equal to 5 ng/ml was defined as abnormal (CEA+). The CA19-9 level was set at 37 U/ml (CA19-9+). Patients were further divided into four groups (1, 2, 3, 4) according to the results of these two markers (CEA/CA19-9: -/-, -/+, +/-, and +/+). Survival was analyzed for AJCC staging, CEA (+) versus (-), CA19-9 (+) versus (-), and four groups.
RESULTS: CEA and CA19-9 survival curves were not significantly different. However, the combined use of the two markers revealed a significant survival benefit (P = 0.035) of group 1 (""-"" for both markers) over 4 (""+"" for both) in stage II.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with an elevated level of both CEA and CA19-9 in stage II of colorectal cancer have a significantly poorer prognosis than those with normal levels of these markers. We recommend adding both CEA and CA19-9 to the current staging system."
15820266,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15820266/,"BACKGROUND: It has been proposed that all forms of bipolar disorder-perhaps all primary affective disorders-are best conceptualized as a spectrum of related illness, clinically overlapping but not necessarily genetically uniform illnesses. We aim to describe with retrospective methodology the demographic, clinical, and therapeutic response in a group of social anxiety disorder (SA) patients who improves while taking antidepressants and compare them with bipolar II (B-II) patients.
METHODS: 57 SA outpatients (DSM-IV) were diagnosed and naturalistic efficacious treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). Their demographic, clinical features and therapeutic response were compared with 41 DSM-IV bipolar II patients in their starting evaluations in our outpatient clinic in the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
RESULTS: There is a sub-group of SA patients who improves while taking antidepressants and presents a clear hypomanic phase. Their improvement is identical to a mild/moderate hypomanic state. Without the antidepressant, the symptoms of SA return. The SA and B-II patients have a similar number of previous depressive episodes, alcohol abuse, suicide attempts, and family history for mood disorder.
LIMITATIONS: It is a retrospective data description based on a naturalist follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Some SA patients have demographic, clinical and therapeutic features similar to B-II patients and they might just be a Bipolar-III sub-group with a higher level of complains to social situations and without spontaneous hypomania during lifetime."
15820282,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15820282/,"BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease related to excessive work/job stress has been a significant social concern for the Japanese public. Therefore, we conducted a cross-sectional study to (1) compare job stress levels between patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients and healthy workers, and (2) examine the types of stresses associated with patients' causal belief of AMI among patients with AMI.
METHODS: Forty-seven patients admitted to the hospital with AMI and 47 healthy workers visiting a hospital for their annual physical examination were recruited in Japan. Both groups were employed full time and matched on age and gender. Job stress was assessed by the Brief Job Stress Questionnaire, which consists of four subscales: job demand, job control, support from supervisors, and support from coworkers. Causal belief was assessed by a semi-structured interview.
RESULTS: Compared with healthy workers (50.7+/-8.6 h), AMI patients worked significantly longer hours per week (58.3+/-15.0 h) prior to their AMI. Among AMI patients, 38% reported that job stress might have contributed to their AMI. AMI patients who reported acute stressful events at work during the month prior to AMI were 6.88 times (95% CI: 1.84, 25.75) more likely to believe that job stress/overwork caused their AMI after controlling for working hours per week and age.
CONCLUSIONS: Like other known cardiac risk factors, it is important for clinicians to assess patient's excessive working hours. The education and counseling of patients following AMI must take into consideration long working hours, acute stressful events at work, and the patient's perceived view of job stress."

METHODS: We reviewed 36 cases undergoing resection of the inferior vena cava concomitant with resection of malignant neoplasms. Our criteria for circumferential resection of the inferior vena cava were half or more of the circumference of the vessel wall invaded by tumor, a primary tumor of the caval wall, or massive intraluminal tumor thrombus suspected of adhering to the caval wall. We detailed 10 patients undergoing circumferential resection of the inferior vena cava.
RESULTS: Most of patients who did not undergo replacement of the inferior vena cava showed no sign of swelling of the lower limbs, but one showed persistent leg edema with oliguria. This patient had poor development of collateral circulation and mild obstruction of the inferior vena cava before surgery. Two patients who underwent replacement of inferior vena cava had no venous sequelae, although they had poor development of collateral circulation before surgery.
CONCLUSION: Caval replacement after circumferential resection of the inferior vena cava may be necessary in patients who have preoperative poor development of collateral circulation or who have oliguria or unstable hemodynamics intraoperatively."
15820562,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15820562/,"BACKGROUND: Central venous catheters are essential to management of cancer patients. Thrombotic complications are potentially severe, but it is difficult to prescribe systematically a prophylactic treatment. So it is necessary to identify the higher risk patients who need a prophylaxis.
AIM: To identify factors associated with the development of clinically significant venous thrombosis in cancer patients with long-term catheters.
METHODS: Monocentric prospective study about 5447 long-term central venous catheters inserted into patients receiving treatment for solid tumours (50% of breast cancers). Clinically significant catheter-related thromboses are confirmed by ultrasonography, phlebography or scanner.
RESULTS: The median duration of catheter use is 147 days. There are 135 clinically significant catheter-related thromboses. The risk for thrombosis is 0.1149 events per 1000 device days. The incidence of symptomatic thrombosis is 0.9% at 30 days, 1.36% at 60 days, 1.83% at 90 days and 2.25% at 120 days. The multivariate analysis shows that female sex, duration of insertion procedure (more than 25 minutes) and place of insertion (femoral place) are factors associated with clinically significant venous thrombosis. The right subclavian insertion causes less risk. The catheters with their tip too ""high"" in the superior vena cava are systematically changed, so that the position of the catheter tip does not appear as a risk factor in our study. The disease stage and the type of treatments are not well examined.
CONCLUSIONS: A predictive score can be made with the three risk factors that have been identified. Thanks to this score it is possible to determine the patients with higher risk for clinically significant catheter-related venous thrombosis. These patients must be more frequently watched over and must receive a prophylactic treatment. The best prophylaxis has to be determined."
15820596,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15820596/,"AIM: The aim of this study was to analyze outcome in patients enrolled in sentinel node biopsy procedure in early-staged cutaneous melanoma.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Therefore a prospective study was conducted enrolling patients presenting with early-staged cutaneous melanoma. Our study focused on age and sex, duration from diagnosis to treatment, duration of hospitalization, dressing care and work inability in current follows. Duration from scintigraphy to surgery was analyzed and compared to sensibility of the procedure. What is more we observed rate and kind of complications and economical consequences, increasing duration of dressing care and work inability. The authors aimed at evaluating costs of SLN procedure including hospitalization, lymphoscintigraphy, general anaesthesia, costs of dressings, inability and overcosts of complications.
RESULTS: Forty-five patients were enrolled in our study (sex-ratio 1/2) mean aged 60 years old. Duration from diagnosis to treatment was mean 36 days. Sensibility of the procedure was excellent in trunk and limbs cases, lower in head and neck. In current cases patients were mean hospitalized three days, underwent 20 days of dressings and work inability depended on further interferon treatment. Complications occurred in 25% as seroma or local infections requiring antibiotherapy. Duration to healing was then 45 days increasing inability. Global costs of SLN procedure were significantly higher than previous wait and watch policy.
CONCLUSION: SLN biopsy is an expensive and invasive procedure with a high rate of complications. It defers melanoma treatment, only way to gain survival."
15821119,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15821119/,"BACKGROUND: Cancer pain is highly prevalent and commonly undertreated. This study was designed to determine whether dissemination of a clinical protocol for pain management would improve outcomes in community oncology practices.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A pain management protocol was developed based on accepted guidelines. After baseline assessment, oncology practices were randomly assigned to 'analgesic protocol' (AP) sites, where oncologists implemented the guidelines in a group of lung or prostate cancer patients, or to 'physician discretion' (PD) sites, where customary treatment was continued. Patients treated on protocol and a comparison group of patients with pain due to breast cancer or myeloma were monitored for change in pain using the Brief Pain Inventory, and for change in other symptoms or mood.
RESULTS: The protocol terminated early because of poor accrual. We compared groups using proportions of patients who had no or mild pain at follow-up. Although measures of protocol adherence did not suggest the occurrence of major practice change, the proportion of lung or prostate cancer patients with no or mild pain increased significantly from baseline for those treated at AP sites compared with those treated at PD sites. There was no significant difference between the breast and myeloma patients treated at AP sites versus those treated at PD sites.
CONCLUSION: A protocol for cancer pain management can improve pain control. Diffusion of these benefits to other patients was not confirmed. Given the small sample size, these findings require confirmation in a larger trial."
15821184,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15821184/,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: The monitoring of cardiac output (CO) during exercise rehabilitation in patients with COPD, often including strenuous exercise, is advisable. Invasive methods (thermodilution, Fick method) are accurate, but for clinical routine use noninvasive CO estimation is required. We have shown that impedance cardiography (Physio Flow; Manatec Biomedical; Macheren, France) is reliable in COPD patients at rest and during a recumbent, light-intensity exercise. The aim of our study was to evaluate the validity of this noninvasive device in COPD patients during a maximal incremental exercise test (IET) and also during a strenuous intermittent work exercise test (IWET).
DESIGN: Prospective comparative study of the impedance cardiograph vs the direct Fick method applied to oxygen.
PATIENTS: Eight patients with moderate-to-severe COPD (59 +/- 6 years old; FEV(1), 38 +/- 15% predicted; residual volume, 194 +/- 64% predicted) [mean +/- SD].
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Forty-nine simultaneous measurements of CO by means of the direct Fick method (COfick) and CO measured by the impedance cardiograph (COpf) were obtained during the IET, and 108 measurements were made during the IWET. The correlation coefficients between the two measurements were r = 0.85 and r = 0.71 for the IET and the IWET, respectively. COpf was higher than COfick. The difference between the two methods was 3.2 +/- 2.9 L/min during the IET and 2.5 +/- 2.1 L/min during the IWET. Expressed as a percentage of the mean of the two measurements, this corresponded to 31 +/- 21% and 25 +/- 20%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The relatively high number of values differing by > 20% precludes the use of impedance cardiography in clinical routine in such a difficult setting (hyperinflated patients and intense exercise)."
15821470,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15821470/,"PURPOSE: Obesity is estimated to account for up to 20% of all cancer deaths. We evaluated the effect of body mass index (BMI) on survival in patients undergoing radical or partial cystectomy for bladder cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pathological and medical records on 300 consecutive patients undergoing radical or partial cystectomy for invasive bladder cancer between January 1990 and December 1993 were reviewed. The standard WHO definition of BMI was used, that is normal weight-less than 25 kg/m, overweight-25 to 29.9 kg/m and obesity-30 kg/m or greater. Sufficient data were available on 288 of 300 patients (96%) with cystectomy (radical in 264 and partial in 24) for analysis.
RESULTS: The BMI distribution was normal weight in 34% of patients, overweight in 41% and obesity in 25%. Mean followup was 53.4 months (median 39, range 1 to 168). Median overall survival was 43.0 months (95% CI 37.1 to 58.4), while median disease specific survival was 82.5 months (95% CI 50.0 to 127.5). Multivariate analysis revealed that age greater than 65 years, pathological stage, smoking history and soft tissue margin status as significant factors impacting overall survival (p <0.05). Pathological stage was organ confined (less than pT3a) in 51% of cases. BMI was not associated with disease specific survival as a continuous (p = 0.17) or categorical (p = 0.51) variable. Although it was insignificant, unadjusted analysis showed lower disease specific mortality in patients with a BMI of less than 25 mg/kg and organ confined disease (p = 0.08).
CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant association between BMI and overall or disease specific survival, although there may be a trend toward better disease specific survival in normal weight (BMI less than 25 kg/m) patients with organ confined disease (p = 0.08)."
15821500,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15821500/,"PURPOSE: We predicted the outcome of visual internal urethrotomy (VIU) by measuring the percentage of lumen narrowing at the stricture site on retrograde urethrography (RGU).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 1991 to June 2002 patients with primary bulbar urethral strictures who underwent VIU were selected for the study. Patients with a history of intervention, complete block of the urethral lumen and stricture greater than 2 cm were excluded from study. Urethral diameter at the area of maximum stenosis and at the normal distal urethra was measured on RGU with Vernier caliper and percentage narrowing was derived. Patients were followed 3 times monthly with symptoms, calibration and whenever required with RGU. Recurrence of symptoms, failure to self-calibrate and the need for secondary procedure were considered treatment failure.
RESULTS: Complete followup data were available in 105 patients (44 grade 1 and 61 grade 2). Mean bulbar urethral stricture length was 0.86 cm. Inflammation was the cause of stricture in 83 (79%) and trauma the cause in 22 (21%) patients. In the Cox proportional hazards model only grade of narrowing had a significant impact on outcome. There were 41 cases of treatment failure in the total followup of 46 +/- 9 months. Mean recurrence-free duration +/- SD was 13 +/- 15 and 44.52 +/- 19 months in cases of treatment failure and success, respectively (p <0.0001). Mean percentage narrowing was significantly higher with treatment failure (69.9% +/- 16.1% vs 48.55% +/- 17.3%, p <0.0001). A cutoff of 74% for urethral narrowing was derived to predict the outcome with 78% probability.
CONCLUSIONS: Percentage narrowing of the urethral lumen at the stricture site is a useful predictor of VIU outcome."
15821810,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15821810/,"CONTEXT: Recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) has been associated with venous thrombosis in the mother. Acquired and inherited thrombophilia factors are possible causes.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between thrombogenic factors and recurrent spontaneous abortion.
TYPE OF STUDY: Case-control study.
SETTING: Centro de Atenção Integral à Saúde da Mulher, Universidade Estadual de Campinas.
METHODS: 40 ml of blood was collected from 88 women attending an RSA clinic and 88 fertile women attending a family planning clinic, to evaluate the presence of acquired and inherited thrombophilia factors. Anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA), lupus anticoagulant and deficiencies of proteins C and S and antithrombin III were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), dilute Russell Viper Venom time (dRVVT), coagulometric and chromogenic methods. DNA was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to study factor V Leiden and G20210A mutations in the prothrombin gene and C677T mutation in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene. Data were analyzed using odds ratios and a regression model for age adjustment. Fishers exact test was used to evaluate statistical relationships between associated factors and RSA.
RESULTS: ACA was detected in 11 women with RSA and one fertile woman. Heterozygous C677T was detected in 59 women with RSA and 35 fertile women. Concomitant presence of ACA and C677T was found in eight women with RSA and no fertile women (p < 0.01).
DISCUSSION: The meaning of the association between C677T mutation in the MTHFR gene and ACA is still not clear. It is possible that an inherited factor that alone would not strongly predispose a woman to thrombosis could, when associated with an acquired factor, start the process and increase the likelihood of thrombosis expression.
CONCLUSIONS: ACA and C677T in the MTHFR gene are statistically associated with RSA. The association of these two conditions is a new finding in thrombogenic factors and RSA."
15821939,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15821939/,"BACKGROUND: Physicians' ratings about their patients' pain prove to be invalid compared to patients' ratings. This is especially true if pain rating acts as an indicator for therapy outcome. The aim of this study was to compare physicians' and patients' ratings of pain relief following acupuncture and to identify correlations between patient characteristics and potential miscalibrations.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a cross-sectional study 291 pain patients with gonarthrosis or chronic low back pain and their attending physicians were asked to give their rating of patients' pain relief following acupuncture. Patients were interviewed by telephone, and doctors responded to questionnaires.
RESULTS: The proportion of false-positive physicians' ratings was 81% referring to patients without self-reported benefit from acupuncture. Just every fifth patient without pain relief was correctly classified by his physician. There was no correlation between patients' characteristics and false-positive ratings of physicians.
CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of treatment in daily medical routine should be primarily based on information provided by patients."
15822042,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15822042/,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: The role of desmoplasia in colorectal carcinoma progression is unclear and the presence of collagen stroma may represent a barrier against cancer diffusion and vascular invasion or a stroma to build up and support the tumor. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of desmoplastic response on long-term survival of patients who underwent radical resection for colorectal carcinoma.
METHODS: The study included 429 patients who underwent radical colorectal resection for cancer with a median follow-up period of 72.8 months.
RESULTS: At univariate analysis significant associations were observed between desmoplasia and histologic type, parietal infiltration, growth pattern, and staging. No associations were found between desmoplasia and the other clinical and histologic parameters. The multivariate analysis stratified for tumor stage revealed that the factor showing the most favorable influence on time to death was desmoplasia. The presence of desmoplasia was likely to decrease the failure rate to a third of the rate experienced by patients without desmoplasia. Parietal infiltration was associated with an increased risk for a shortened time to death.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results favor the view that desmoplasia is a protective factor for survival in patients with colorectal carcinoma. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that desmoplasia may prevent cancer invasiveness by building a barrier against tumor diffusion."
15822121,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15822121/,"BACKGROUND: It is commonly believed that the sensitivity of Papanicolaou (Pap) tests decreases with a short interval between cytology samplings. To the authors' knowledge, there is only limited evidence to support this belief.
METHODS: For 5055 women in the Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance (ASCUS)-Low Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion (LSIL) Triage Study (ALTS), the Pap interval was defined as the number of days between the referral Pap smear demonstrating ASCUS or LSIL (""first cytology"") and the enrollment liquid-based (""repeat"") cytology. The authors investigated the influence of the interval between Pap smears on repeat cytology by examining percentages of abnormal findings, cellularity, and test sensitivity among women diagnosed with histologic grade 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN3) during the 2-year course of the ALTS. In addition, because human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA adjunct testing is now performed, the authors evaluated HPV viral load, which was assayed using residual liquid cytology specimens, in women with CIN3.
RESULTS: The Pap interval ranged from 8-30 days in 763 women, 31-60 days in 2317 women, 61-90 days in 1090 women, 91-120 days in 491 women, and 121-184 days in 394 women (mean of 61.3 days; standard deviation of 34 days). Repeat cytologic interpretations of unsatisfactory findings, ASCUS, and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) did not appear to vary among the Pap interval groups. However, low-grade cytologic regression occurred with an increasing Pap interval; negative cytology increased from 28.3% (8-30 days) to 41.6% (121-184 days) (P < 0.0001) whereas LSIL cytology decreased (P trend = 0.002). The approximate cellularity of the samples was slightly better in the interval group of 8-30 days (P trend = 0.04). Among women with CIN3, the repeat test sensitivity at a threshold of ASCUS or greater and the HPV DNA viral load was not found to vary by Pap interval (P trend = 0.80 and P trend = 0.36, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: The authors concluded that a short Pap interval (range, 15-120 days) does not significantly affect the quality of liquid-based repeat cytology, nor the viral load tested from a residual liquid-based specimen."
15822733,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15822733/,"BACKGROUND: Only 30% of survivors from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest receive basic life support (BLS) before the arrival of emergency personnel. This is also due to reluctance to perform BLS, especially mouth-to-mouth ventilation without barrier devices in victims who are unknown to the rescuer (either layperson or healthcare provider).
METHODS: To evaluate the incidence of reluctance to perform mouth-to-mouth ventilation without barrier devices and its consequences in a simulated BLS scenario proposed by a questionnaire to healthcare providers of critical area in a public general hospital.
RESULTS: Answers were collected from 128 of 165 (77.5%) interviewed healthcare providers. Physicians were 46 of 128 (35.9%), professional nurses were 78 of 128 (60.9%) and 4 of 128 (3.2%) were other health workers devoted to patient assistance. Seventy-five of 128 (58.6 %) were reluctant to perform mouth-to-mouth ventilation without barrier devices; 68 of 75 (90.6%) would perform BLS only by chest compression. Compared with non-reluctant providers, they would have been available to perform assisted ventilation by non-validated alternative methods (54.2 vs 18.8% respectively, p < 0.001). Seven of 75 (9.6%, no physician among them) would perform no BLS at all. The most significant predictors of reluctance were age < 40 years (p = 0.07) and previous attendance of BLS-BLSD courses (p = 0.07).
CONCLUSIONS: Reluctance to perform mouth-to-mouth ventilation without barrier devices is frequent and may reduce the number of potential BLS providers. Because of the concern about disease transmission between victim and rescuer, rescuers with a duty to respond such as healthcare providers should follow precautions including the use of barrier device also outside their workplace. When barrier devices are unavailable first responders should consider chest compression alone instead of not performing any BLS maneuvers. BLS training should help give a greater emphasis on this topics."
15823064,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15823064/,"PURPOSE: To prospectively examine the outcomes of excluded abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) that continue to expand without evidence of endoleak.
METHODS: From 1984 to 1998, 1218 patients underwent operative retroperitoneal exclusion of AAA and aortoiliac reconstructions. During the procedure, the aneurysm sac was ligated proximally, as well as distally, which created an ideal in-vivo model of excluded AAA sacs with or without endoleaks. From January 2002 to June 2003, 15 of these patients were identified as having an increase in AAA sac size with or without an endoleak on duplex ultrasonography. These patients were prospectively evaluated by computed tomography and diagnostic arteriography. Patients with a demonstrable endoleak underwent embolization, and the remainder underwent open surgical exploration.
RESULTS: Eight patients had arteriographically demonstrated endoleaks that were treated with coil embolization. The remaining 7 patients (6 men; mean age 76 years, range 68-81) without a demonstrable endoleak underwent elective surgical exploration and sac endoaneurysmorrhaphy. The mean time interval between the original surgery and aneurysm sac exploration was 76 months (range 52-92); during this time, the mean aneurysm sac size increased by 2.7 cm (range 1.3-5.2). The mean sac pressure was 53 mmHg, and the sac walls were noticeably thickened, with markedly dilated vasa vasorum. The sac contained yellow, fibrinous material with clear serous fluid (5 patients without any evidence of retrograde flow) or liquefied thrombus with serosanguinous fluid (2 patients with retrograde flow from lumbar arteries). No AAA sacs were pulsatile.
CONCLUSIONS: Continued expansion of excluded AAA sacs can occur from causes other than a missed endoleak. Exudation of fluid from thickened sac wall and vasa vasorum, as well as local enzymatic activity, might lead to the formation of a sac hygroma. Furthermore, these findings raise questions as to the need for surgical exploration of all patients with an enlarging AAA sac in the setting of low sac pressures and no definable endoleak."

METHODS: Two cross-sectional studies were undertaken of physicians working in local public health medicine in all Norwegian municipalities, using a postal questionnaire.
RESULTS: Half of the physicians working in public health in 1999 were recruited after 1994. Although the number of physicians working in public health increased from 505 in 1994 to 555 in 1999 (10%) an estimation of the total weekly hours worked decreased by 3.7% from 8,715 hours in 1994 to 8,386 hours in 1999. The vast majority of physicians worked in combined posts (87%), and they reduced their engagement in public health by 2.6 hours on average from 1994 to 1999. The reduction depended on remuneration model, speciality in community medicine, and municipality size.
CONCLUSIONS: Local public health in Norway was under pressure in the 1990s. For public health physicians, preventive medicine lost out to clinical work. No promising signals of change in the professional or political framework or in incentives for public health work are seen."
15823974,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15823974/,"AIM: A study was undertaken to analyse the possible interaction between work environment and income for the probability of self-rated health being less than good.
METHODS: Data from the Swedish Survey of Living Conditions for the years 1998 and 1999 were analysed. Employed 20- to 64-year-olds with a registered wage were included (n=5982). The synergy index (SI) was applied, using odds ratios from logistic regressions for men, women, and all. Low and high levels of physical demands, decision authority, skill discretion and psychological demands were separately combined with low- and high-wage income (median split). Full-time work and four sociodemographic factors were controlled for.
RESULTS: Significant synergy was found for women when they were exposed to low income and a low level of skill discretion (SI=1.46 [1.01-2.13]), although this was attenuated by education level (SI=1.47 [0.96-2.25]). In general (both sexes), poor health caused by low income and unfavourable work is additive rather than multiplicatively exaggerating the risk among the jointly exposed.
CONCLUSION: Work exposures in the form of high physical load, low levels of decision authority and skill discretion, or a high level of psychological demands were significantly related to poor health also when income was high, suggesting that high income does not seem to buffer the detrimental effects of adverse working conditions. As nearly half of employed women were found to be in circumstances marked by synergy, it seems a relevant public health issue to improve these women's conditions at work, by simultaneously increasing, for example, job variety and wages."
15823994,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15823994/,"PURPOSE: The causes of the feeling of a lump in the throat (globus pharyngeus) are disputed. The symptoms are persistent and may lead clients to change their diet and suffer a reduced quality of life. Coexisting swallowing difficulties are often reported but no neurological or structural abnormality can be found. Psychological factors are likely to play a part in the condition and an eclectic approach to therapy appears to be warranted. This paper reports on a treatment programme that includes education, reassurance and the use of exercises.
METHOD: Fourteen clients participated. Their progress was assessed using the Glasgow and Edinburgh Throat Scale (GETS). A baseline period was used to assess the stability of their symptoms prior to therapy. This was followed by a group therapy session, use of the exercises and a further reassessment. Videofluoroscopy was conducted before and after therapy.
RESULTS: Clients score on the GETS improved. However, change was seen both during the baseline and the treatment making it unclear which aspects of the treatment were effective. Improvement during the baseline suggests that clients benefit from attention and reassurance. It is unclear, therefore, whether the therapy session and the exercises provide a specific benefit or a general benefit due to continued attention. The clients' videofluoroscopies were unchanged after therapy. The presence of residue after the swallow in the valleculae and the pyriform sinuses may contribute to the symptoms of globus.
CONCLUSION: The treatment is economical and appears to benefit clients. However, further research is needed to distinguish whether it has a specific effect or whether clients benefit from general attention and reassurance."
15824014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15824014/,"PURPOSE: To determine the visual acuity (VA) in a group of preschool children who were true positives for refractive screening (positive group) in order to compare it with the VA of a sample of children without any refractive anomaly (control group); also, to investigate if true-positive treated children can achieve the VA of the control group within what delay.
METHODS: Fifty seven children without any refractive anomaly were tested with the VA child chart if the Nidek SCP 670 projector; 47 children presenting with the refractive anomalies were tested with the same chart. A Kruskal Wallis exact test for singly ordered tables were used to compare VA between those groups and a non-parametric Wilcoxon test for paired samples was used to compare pre- and post-treatment VA in 27 children of the positive group. The mean time necessary to achieve the post-treatment VA was calculated.
RESULTS: Median VA: 20/20 in the control group, 20/33 in the positive group. The VA difference between the two pre- and post-treatment VA are highly significant. Among the 27 treated children, pre-treatment median VA was 20/50, post-treatment 20/20. The differences between the pre- and post-treatment VA was 9 months.
CONCLUSION: The positive group had a significantly lower VA than the control group. In the treated group, treatment initiated at a mean age of 4 years resulted in an increase in VA to that of the control group after an average time of 9 months, encouraging early screening and treatment before VA is measureable in order to shorten this delay."
15824055,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15824055/,"BACKGROUND: Very little effort has been directed to enable GPs to better informed decisions about PSA screening among their male patients.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate an innovative programme designed to enhance GPs' capacity to promote informed decision making by male patients about PSA screening.
METHODS: The study design was a cluster randomised controlled trial set in New South Wales, Australia's most populous state. 277 GPs were recruited through a major pathology laboratory. The interventions were three telephone-administered 'peer coaching' sessions integrated with educational resources for GPs and patients and the main outcome measures were: GP knowledge; perceptions of patient involvement in informed decision making; GPs' own decisional conflict; and perceptions of medicolegal risk.
RESULTS: Compared with GPs allocated to the control group, GPs allocated to our intervention gained significantly greater knowledge about PSA screening and related information [Mean 6.1 out of 7; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 5.9-6.3 versus 4.8; 95% CI = 4.6-5.0; P < 0.001]. They were less likely to agree that patients should remain passive when making decisions about PSA screening [Odds ratio (OR) = 0.11; 95% CI = 0.04-0.31; P < 0.001]. They perceived less medicolegal risk when not acceding to an 'uninformed' patient request for a PSA test (OR = 0.31; 95% CI 0.19-0.51). They also demonstrated lower levels of personal decisional conflict about the PSA screening (Mean 25.4; 95% CI 24.5-26.3 versus 27.8; 95% CI 26.6-29.0; P = 0.0002).
CONCLUSION: A 'peer coaching' programme, supplemented by education materials, holds promise as a strategy to equip GPs to facilitate informed decision making amongst their patients."
15824077,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15824077/,"AIMS: With its homology with plasminogen, lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] may be related to thrombosis and inflammation. We assessed the role of Lp(a) in coronary heart diseases (CHD) by a recently developed assay that is not affected by the plasminogen-like Kringle-type-2 repeats.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Of 32 826 women from the Nurses' Health Study, who provided blood at baseline, we documented 228 CHD events during 8 years of follow-up. Each case was compared with two matched controls. In a multivariable model adjusted for body mass index, family history, hypertension, diabetes, post-menopausal hormone use, physical activity, blood drawing characteristics, and alcohol intake, the odd ratio (OR) for Lp(a) levels > or =30 mg/dL was 1.9(95% CI: 1.3-3.0) when compared with those with Lp(a)<30 mg/dL. Women with high levels of both Lp(a) (> or =30 mg/dL) and fibrinogen (> or =400 mg/dL) had an OR of 3.2(95% CI: 1.6-6.5) for CHD, when compared with the combination of low levels (P interaction=0.05). Women with high levels of both Lp(a) and C-reactive protein (> or =3 mg/L) had an OR of 3.67(95% CI: 2.03-6.64) for CHD, when compared with the combination of low levels (P interaction=0.06).
CONCLUSION: Lp(a) levels >30 mg/dL are associated with twice the risk of CHD events among women and may be related to thrombosis and inflammation."
15824500,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15824500/,"BACKGROUND: Chronically compromised uterine perfusion may lead to placental insufficiency and subsequent intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Various therapeutic approaches (e.g. vasodilators, low-dose aspirin, intravenous glucose infusion, and hemodilution) are often of limited efficacy. Local anesthetics have been shown to improve placental blood flow in pre-eclamptic women. We hypothesized that epidural administration of local anesthetics might improve outcome in IUGR independent of the underlying cause. In preparation for a clinical trial to test this hypothesis, we performed a pilot study in 10 patients.
METHODS: After approval of the study protocol, 10 pregnant women presenting with oligohydramnios and IUGR were included in the study. In addition to our standard protocol (magnesium, glucose, betamethasone), each patient received an epidural catheter (T10/T12) with continuous infusion of bupivacaine 0.175% at a rate of 5 ml/h. Uteroplacental circulation was monitored by Doppler sonography and the amount of amniotic fluid was estimated daily.
RESULTS: Epidural insertion and infusion was performed without complications. Four patients continued to deteriorate rapidly, amniotic fluid volume did not change and uterine artery pulsatility index (PI) tended to increase. In the remaining 6 patients the clinical status stabilized, amniotic fluid volume tended to increase and uterine artery PI tended to decrease during treatment. This improvement was associated with a prolonged interval to cesarean section and increased infant birth weight.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that, even if the underlying cause of IUGR is not pre-eclampsia, epidural local anesthetic administration might improve placental blood flow and be beneficial in a subgroup of patients. A clinical trial to test this hypothesis appears warranted."
15824522,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15824522/,"BACKGROUND: High-resolution CT (HRCT) of the lungs has become an essential component to evaluate patients with diffuse lung disease. Little is known, however, about the current practices of pulmonologists caring for patients with these complex conditions, and, in particular, whether HRCT can obviate the need for surgical lung biopsy.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the practices of pulmonologists concerning the acceptability of a HRCT diagnosis in lieu of lung biopsy in diffuse lung disease.
METHODS: We asked practicing pulmonologists among membership of the American College of Chest Physicians whether HRCT results could replace lung biopsy in 16 diffuse lung diseases. Responses were examined in light of published evidence, practice guidelines, and certain practice parameters.
RESULTS: Two hundred and thirty (52.6%) of 437 eligible physicians responded. Sixty-seven percent (67%) of respondents accepted HRCT diagnosis for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis/usual interstitial pneumonia (IPF/UIP) despite their awareness of guidelines recommending histological diagnosis. Most would not accept a radiologic diagnosis for lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM; 37%) or eosinophilic granuloma (Langerhans' cell histiocytosis, LCH; 19%), even though CT findings are frequently characteristic. Responses were similar by type of clinical practice and recency of fellowship training. Chest physicians who referred patients for HRCT more frequently were more likely to accept HRCT diagnosis (p=0.008) and those who had higher self-ratings of proficiency in reading HRCT (p = 0.004) were more likely to believe HRCT often suggests specific diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Most US pulmonologists will accept an HRCT diagnosis of IPF/UIP without lung biopsy, but are reluctant to do so for most other diffuse lung conditions including LAM and LCH."
15824544,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15824544/,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about potential risks of ultrasound during pregnancy. The developing brain is susceptible to environmental influences, and prenatal ultrasound has been reported to affect cognitive abilities in animals.
METHODS: To assess a possible association between prenatal ultrasound and intellectual performance, we studied men born in Sweden from 1973 to 1978 who enrolled for military service from 1991 to 1996. Intellectual scores (mean +/- standard deviation = 5 +/- 2) were measured by a test battery at enrollment, and subnormal performance was defined as a score of 3 or less. We estimated differences in mean intellectual score between ultrasound-exposed and ultrasound-unexposed using linear regression, and we calculated relative risks of subnormal performance using logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: There were 7999 eligible men born in a hospital (Malmo) that included ultrasound scanning in standard antenatal care (exposed) and 197,829 men born in hospitals without ultrasound scanning programs (unexposed). We found lower intellectual performance scores (mean difference = -0.16; 95% confidence interval = -0.21 to -0.11) and an increased risk of subnormal performance (odds ratio = 1.28; CI = 1.18 to 1.38) among ultrasound-exposed compared with unexposed. However, men born in Malmo before scanning was introduced also had lower scores, and the decrease in test scores after the introduction of ultrasound was small. Moreover, we found no differences in intellectual performance within pairs of brothers as a result of ultrasound exposure.
CONCLUSIONS: This study failed to demonstrate a clear association between ultrasound scanning and intellectual performance."
15824655,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15824655/,"BACKGROUND: The management of patients with hemodynamic instability related to pelvic fracture is a major challenge, with high morbidity and mortality. Evidence-based institutional practice guidelines (PG) were developed as a strategy to optimize the care of these patients. The aims of this study were to evaluate the adherence to the new PG and compare the outcomes before and after their implementation.
METHODS: Major blunt trauma patients (Injury Severity Score [ISS] > 15) with hemodynamic instability (initial base deficit > 6 mEq/L or received > 6 units of packed red blood cells [PRBCs] during the first 12 hours) related to pelvic fracture were investigated. Patients presenting with ongoing bleeding from other regions or with severe head injury (Glasgow Coma Scale score < 9) were excluded. The pre-PG group (n = 17) were patients managed during the 18 months ending on December 31, 2001. The post-PG group (n = 14) consisted of patients managed during the subsequent 18 months. Demographics, ISS, shock severity, resuscitation, and outcome data were prospectively collected. The adherence to the key steps of PG was evaluated retrospectively in the pre-PG and prospectively in the post-PG group, including abdominal clearance (AC) with diagnostic peritoneal aspiration/lavage or ultrasound (<15 minutes), noninvasive pelvic binding (PB) (<15 minutes), pelvic angiography (PA) (<90 minutes after admission), and minimally invasive orthopedic fixation (MIOF) (<24 hours). Data are presented as mean +/- SEM or percentages.
RESULTS: The pre-PG and post-PG groups were similar regarding age (40 +/- 4 years vs. 42 +/- 6 years), gender (both 71% male), ISS (39 +/- 3 vs. 37 +/- 4), admission base deficit (9 +/- 1 vs. 10 +/- 1) admission systolic blood pressure (116 +/- 7 vs. 112 +/- 6 mm Hg), Glasgow Coma Scale score (12 +/- 1 vs. 12 +/- 1), and PRBC transfusion in the first 12 hours (9 +/- 2 U vs. 9 +/- 2 U). The adherence to the guidelines in the post-PG period was as follows: AC, 100%; PB, 86% (p < 0.05 based on t test or chi test); PA, 93% (p < 0.05 based on t test or chi test); and MIOF, 86%. In the pre-PG period, adherence to the guidelines was as follows: AC, 65%; PB, 0%; PA, 30%; and MIOF 52%. In the post-PG period, the 24-hour PRBC transfusion decreased from 16 +/- 2 U to 11 +/- 1 U and the mortality decreased from 35% to 7% (p < 0.05 based on t test or chi test for both).
CONCLUSION: The adherence to the PG as a reflection of optimal management was significantly improved. PG focusing particular on timely hemorrhage control reduced the 24-hour transfusion requirements and the mortality rate in the post-PG group."
15824658,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15824658/,"BACKGROUND: Patients with isolated hip fractures are frequently excluded from trauma registries. The goal of this study was to show that patients with these injuries have higher resource use and poorer outcomes than the rest of the trauma population.
METHODS: The Quebec Trauma Registry was used to identify all trauma patients from April 1, 1998, to March 31, 2003. Patients who were dead on arrival at the emergency room were excluded. Isolated hip fracture (HIP) was defined as a diagnosis of a single fracture to the neck of the femur (Abbreviated Injury Scale 1990 codes 851808.3, 851810.3, 851812.3, and 851818.3) secondary to a fall and for which the Injury Severity Score was 9 or 10 (no other Abbreviated Injury Scale code higher than 1). Patients with all other trauma diagnosis (OT) were used for comparison. Outcome variables were length of hospital stay, length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, in-hospital complications, and status and orientation at discharge. Chi-square and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used.
RESULTS: There were 68,422 patients: 14,426 (21.1%) HIP patients and 53,996 (78.9%) OT patients. The median Injury Severity Score was 9 for HIP (range, 9-10) and 9 for OT (range, 1-75). Mean length of hospital stay was 18.4 days for HIP compared with 11.7 days for OT (p < 0.0001). HIP patients represented 29.5% of the total hospital stay. ICU stay was required for 1,353 HIP patients (9.4%) and for 12,395 (23.0%) OT patients (p < 0.0001). Mean ICU stay was 3.9 days for HIP compared with 5.5 days for OT (p = 0.0006). In-hospital mortality was 8.5% in HIP compared with 3.7% in OT (p < 0.0001). HIP represented 62.7% of patients referred for long-term care and 39.3% of patients referred to a rehabilitation center.
CONCLUSION: Patients with HIP represented 21.1% of admissions while accounting for 42% of total days of hospitalization and 38% of deaths. Patients with hip fractures have a significantly higher risk of death, prolonged hospital stay, and complication rate, and are more often transferred to a rehabilitation center or to a long-term nursing home than the rest of the trauma population despite lower severity. They require multidisciplinary care typical of the rest of the trauma population and should be included in the trauma registry if the registry is to document the full outcome and resource use of the trauma population."
15824660,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15824660/,"BACKGROUND: Our recent experimental study showed that peripheral muscle tissue oxygen saturation (StO2), determined noninvasively by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), was more reliable than systemic hemodynamics or invasive oxygenation variables as an index of traumatic shock. The purpose of this study was to establish the normal range of thenar muscle StO2 in humans and the relationship between shock state and StO2 in trauma patients.
METHODS: This was a prospective, nonrandomized, observational, descriptive study in normal human volunteers (n = 707) and patients admitted to the resuscitation area of our Level I trauma center (n = 150). To establish a normal StO2 range, an NIRS probe was applied to the thenar eminence of volunteers (normals). Subsequently, in a group of trauma patients, an NIRS probe was applied to the thenar eminence and data were collected and stored for offline analysis. StO2 monitoring was performed continuously and noninvasively, and values were recorded at 2-minute intervals. Five moribund trauma patients were excluded. Members of our trauma faculty, blinded to StO2 values, classified each patient into one of four groups (no shock, mild shock, moderate shock, and severe shock) using conventional physiologic parameters.
RESULTS: Mean +/- SD thenar StO2 values for each group were as follows: normals, 87 +/- 6% (n = 707); no shock, 83 +/- 10% (n = 85); mild shock, 83 +/- 10% (n = 19); moderate shock, 80 +/- 12% (n = 14); and severe shock, 45 +/- 26% (n = 14). The thenar StO2 values clearly discriminated the normals or no shock patients and the patients with severe shock (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Decreased thenar muscle tissue oxygen saturation reflects the presence of severe hypoperfusion and near-infrared spectroscopy may be a novel method for rapidly and noninvasively assessing changes in tissue dysoxia."
15824747,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15824747/,"OBJECTIVE: An association between obesity and asthma symptoms has been reported in the literature, but such a relationship is inconsistent if atopic status or bronchial hyper responsiveness (BHR) is considered. The objective was to assess the association between obesity and asthma symptoms or BHR in adults.
METHODS: A study was carried out in 1232 people born between 1974 and 1978 in Chile. The participants completed the European Community Health Survey questionnaire, were skin tested and subject to a BHR challenge to methacholine.
MEASUREMENTS: Weight, height and waist circumference were measured and body mass index (BMI) was calculated.
RESULTS: There was a positive association between wheeze and breathlessness following exercise and BMI (both with an OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.00-1.06), the associations with wheeze tended to disappear in women who did react at least to one allergen, and persisted in those who did not react to any allergens. BMI was negatively associated with BHR (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.89-0.97). Waist circumference was not associated with asthma symptoms and it was negatively associated with BHR.
CONCLUSION: Although there was an association between BMI and asthma symptoms, there were weaknesses in the evidence because waist circumference, a more direct measure of obesity than BMI, was not associated with asthma symptoms, and BMI and waist circumference were negatively associated with BHR."
15824914,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15824914/,"OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to identify and evaluate the frequency of drugs involved in adverse drug reactions (ADRs) for which recommendations of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) had not been respected and to compare the percentages of drugs suspected of being the cause of ADRs when correctly and incorrectly used.
METHODS: All ADRs reported to the Regional Pharmacovigilance Centre of Tours (RPC) over a period of 5 months were analysed to identify drugs used ""incorrectly"" defined by drug use beyond the recommendations of the SPC, i.e. drugs used when contra-indicated and/or drugs used for an off-label indication, and/or drugs used at an inappropriate dose, and/or inappropriate duration of treatment, and/or drugs used in the presence of a potentially or definitely interacting drug.
RESULTS: Included in the study were 182 ADRs involving 182 patients. Of 642 drugs, 169 (26%) were incorrectly used and for 81 patients (44.5%) ADRs involved at least one ""incorrectly"" used drug. These included 10% (64 of 642) drug interactions, 7.3% (47 of 642) off-licence indications, 5% (32 of 642) inadequate dosage, 3% (20 of 642) incorrect duration of treatment and 1% (6 of 642) contraindications. ""Correctly"" used drugs appeared to be less often the cause of the ADRs than ""incorrectly"" used drugs (59.4% versus 75%, P=0.0001).
CONCLUSION: ""Incorrectly"" used drugs were more often causally linked to ADR than correctly used drugs. A meaningful number of ADRs could probably be avoided if SPC guidelines for a safe and effective drug use are carefully adhered to."
15824941,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15824941/,"BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: In previous randomized trials, early endoscopy improved the outcome in patients with bleeding peptic ulcer, though most of these studies defined ""early"" as endoscopy performed within 24 hours after admission. Using the length of hospital stay as the primary criterion for the clinical outcome, we compared the results of endoscopy done immediately after admission (early endoscopy in the emergency room, EEE) with endoscopy postponed to a time within the first 24 hours after hospitalization, but still during normal working hours (""delayed"" endoscopy in the endoscopy unit, DEU).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of data from 81 consecutive patients with bleeding peptic ulcer admitted in 1997 and 1998 (age range 16 - 90 years). Of these 81 patients, 38 underwent DEU (the standard therapy at the hospital) and 43 underwent EEE. Patients in the two groups were comparable with regard to admission criteria, were equally distributed with respect to their risk of adverse outcome (assessed using the Baylor bleeding score and the Rockall score), and differed only in the treatment they received. Endoscopic hemostasis was performed whenever possible in all patients with Forrest types I, IIa, and IIb ulcer bleeding.
RESULTS: We found similar rates in the two groups for recurrent bleeding (16 % in DEU patients vs. 14 % in EEE patients), persistent bleeding (8 % in DEU patients vs. none in EEE patients), medical complications (21 % in DEU patients vs. 26 % in EEE patients), the need for surgery (8 % in DEU patients vs. 9 % in EEE patients), and the length of hospital stay (5.1 days for DEU patients vs. 5.9 days for EEE patients). None of the differences between the two groups in these parameters were statistically significant. None of the patients died.
CONCLUSIONS: Early endoscopy in an emergency room did not improve the clinical outcome in our 81 consecutive patients with bleeding peptic ulcer."
15824944,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15824944/,"BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Methods of lubrication are rarely considered to be a matter for study in gastrointestinal endoscopy. We evaluated a new technique, i. e. the release of seed oil in discrete amounts from the tip of the scope during colonoscopy.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: 346 consecutive patients prospectively underwent colonoscopy with a standard lubricating method (using water-soluble jelly; group A) or with the standard method plus seed oil (corn oil) instillations through the biopsy channel (group B). The following variables were evaluated in the two groups: the success rate for total intubation, and the time required to reach the cecum; the time needed to examine the colon at withdrawal; the detection rates for colorectal diseases; the level of pain and degree of difficulty associated with the examination. Patients in whom total colonoscopy was not achieved were asked to undergo a further examination in which the other lubricating technique was used.
RESULTS: Successful intubation to the cecum was significantly more frequent ( P < 0.005) in the oil lubrication group (group B, 159/168) than in the control group (group A, 145/170), and less time was needed ( P < 0.001). No significant differences were found with regard to time for examination at withdrawal and detection rates for colorectal diseases. Level of pain and degree of difficulty during colonoscopy were significantly lower in the oil group ( P < 0.001). In the cross-over examinations done in patients in whom total colonoscopy was not achieved, no statistical difference was found between the two groups. We observed no side effects for patients or damage to the instrument.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed technique could be a simple, safe, and inexpensive method for easier and less painful colonoscopy; moreover, it might facilitate difficult examinations. Further studies are needed to confirm our data and to ensure that the use of this technique is not liable to damage the scope."
15825025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15825025/,"BACKGROUND: Adenovirus infections are associated with significant rates of morbidity and mortality among children after bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Many transplantation units use molecular virological methods, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), for surveillance for adenovirus infection and give preemptive antiviral therapy to children with evidence of disseminated adenovirus infection. This treatment strategy has never been evaluated in clinical trials.
METHODS: We retrospectively tested blood samples obtained from a cohort of children who had undergone BMT before the introduction of regular weekly surveillance for adenovirus infection. A total of 273 samples collected from 26 patients between May 1998 and June 2002 were tested for adenovirus infection by quantitative PCR. Virus load was quantified for each sample yielding positive test results, and the clinical notes and virological records of each child were reviewed.
RESULTS: Evidence of adenovirus infection was found in 11 children (42%), 7 of whom had not previously had positive test results. Receipt of T cell-depleted transplants was associated with a significantly higher incidence of adenovirus infection during the posttransplantation period. The 2 children who died from adenovirus disease developed infection within 2 weeks after transplantation, and both had very low absolute lymphocyte counts at the time of diagnosis. Seven of 11 children with blood samples that were found to be positive for adenovirus by PCR cleared the virus without antiviral therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Surveillance for adenovirus by PCR is better than symptomatic testing for detecting adenovirus infection. Antiviral therapy may not be necessary for all children who develop adenovirus viremia after BMT."
15825038,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15825038/,"BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to identify the frequency and characteristics of patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection who had spontaneously achieved viremia below the detection limit of either 400 or 500 copies/mL (depending on the test used) and to describe the duration of undetectable viremia without antiretroviral therapy (ART).
METHODS: In the French Agence Nationale de Recherches sur le SIDA SEROCO cohort, 426 patients with HIV seroconversion (i.e., seroconverters) enrolled between 1988 and 1995 had serial measurement of HIV RNA levels during follow-up (with a cutoff date of 31 December 2002). Factors that distinguished those patients who had spontaneously achieved undetectable viremia (> or =2 consecutive viral loads <400 or <500 copies/mL while not receiving ART) were identified by logistic regression. A Cox model was used to estimate the predictive value of factors related to the duration of undetectable viremia.
RESULTS: Undetectable viremia had been spontaneously achieved in 36 of 426 seroconverters. Women (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-5.80) and subjects with baseline HIV RNA level < or =3.76 log10 copies/mL (aOR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.11-0.82), baseline HIV DNA level < or =2.61 log10 copies/mL (aOR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.04-0.44), and high baseline CD4+ cell count (aOR, 1.18 for each 100 cells/mm3; 95% CI, 1.03-1.35]) were more likely to have achieved undetectable viremia. The sustainability of this phenomenon (median duration, 11.9 months; range, 4.6-62.8 months) was associated with low baseline HIV DNA and RNA levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Achieving undetectable viremia without ART was not rare, because 6.7% of seroconverters still had a viral load of <400 or <500 copies/mL 5 years after seroconversion. These data should be considered when assessing virologic outcome for patients who interrupt highly active ART initiated during primary infection."
15825580,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15825580/,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between adherence to antidepressant medications and HbA1c levels among patients with diabetes in a managed care setting.
METHOD: The analysis included measures of HbA1c levels before, during, and after initial antidepressant use among 568 patients with diabetes enrolled in the Harvard Pilgrim Health Care insurance plan from 1991-1995. Adherence was defined as four refills in a six-month period after the first antidepressant prescription. General linear models using SAS PROC MIXED were used to estimate the effects of covariates including antidepressant adherence on HbA1c levels over time, comparing patients who were adherent to antidepressant medications to those patients who were non-adherent to antidepressant medications.
RESULTS: Adherence to antidepressant treatment was not significantly associated with HbA1c levels among diabetic patients who are antidepressant users. Younger age, use of insulin and oral medications, and female gender were all significantly associated with HbA1c levels over time.
CONCLUSIONS: Although we did not observe any association between level of adherence to antidepressant therapy among diabetic patients and levels of glucose control, our results confirm previously established associations between patient characteristics and glycemic control. Further research is needed to disentangle the complex relationship among antidepressant treatment adherence and diabetes outcomes."
15826341,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15826341/,"OBJECTIVES: It has been suggested that temperaments such as 'hypomanic personality' (HYP) have an explanatory role in affective disorders. Similarly, the impulsive nonconformity scale, originally designed to assess psychosis proneness, was recently found to augment the prediction of manic episodes. Conversely, research indicates that 'rigidity', a central feature of Typus Melancholicus (TMEL; von Zerssen, 1996), may characterize the premorbid personality of depressives.
DESIGN: The present study combines these three scales to prospectively predict manic and depressive symptoms diagnosed 2 years later in a non-college student population.
METHOD: Structured clinical interviews for DSM-IV were conducted with 114 individuals (60% female, mean age = 19 . 9 years), 2 years after an initial screening.
RESULTS: It was found that none of the predictors predicted purely depressive symptoms. As expected, HYP emerged as the strongest predictor of (hypo-)manic symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: While rigidity did not predict depression, people with a hypomanic temperament are at risk of developing symptoms of bipolar disorder, especially (hypo-)manic ones. It is noteworthy that this was evident in our young sample, still in the earlier stages of the high-risk period."

OBJECTIVE: To know the prevalence of BF among a group of women and to study the relationship with health education.
DESIGN: Observational and analytic study.
SETTING: Dr. Pujol i Capsada Primary Health Center (El Prat de Llobregat); Casagemes CAD's afterbirth group in Badalona, and Alba Lactancia Women's group. SUBJECTS OF THE STUDY: 135 women with babies born between the 1st of March 2002 and the 28th of February 2003.
METHOD: Mother's motivation for breast-feeding and the type of information she has got were evaluated. Breast-feeding period was measured from the second month of baby's life by means of a survey passed by nursing staff.
RESULTS: The average BF period was of 160 days, 22% breastfed their babies for less than a week, and 14% between a week and a month. The main variables in relation with the increase of BF are: to want to breast-feed (P=.05); mother sleeping with the baby (P=.03); to receive assistance from nursing staff while in hospital (P=.01); not to receive additional meals in hospital (P=.02); no problems during the first month of life (P<.0001); to receive information from health center (P=.009). If the first contact mother-baby (bringing the baby close to the breast) lasts more than 30 minutes 51% give up BF before the first month; but if the first contact is before of 30 minutes only give up 20.8% (P=.002).
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of BF increases among the women that got health education and support from the health professionals."
15826747,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15826747/,"OBJECTIVE: Repeated biopsies in patients with a high risk of prostate cancer only allow a small proportion of new cancer diagnosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of combined MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging (MRSI) for these patients.
METHODS: Between April 2003 and April 2004, 42 patients with negative multiple cores prostatic biopsies and serum PSA>4 ng/ml underwent a combined MRI/MRSI analysis. Suspicious zones on standard MRI included low intensity signals on T2 weighted images. A high choline+creatine-to-citrate ratio defined a MRSI suspicious zone. A 10 cores following peripheral biopsy scheme was done to which were added supplementary biopsies on the MRI/MRSI suspicious zones.
RESULTS: The mean age was 62.3 years (51-74), the mean pre-biopsy serum PSA was 12 (3.87-35), the mean free/total PSA ratio was 11% (5-20). The mean number of previous prostate biopsy rounds was 2.04. 15 prostate cancers were diagnosed (35.7%). In 9 cases, abnormal MRI/MRSI findings and positive biopsy sites were located on the same prostatic zones. In 5 cases, MRSI alone located the positive biopsy zones. Sensitivity of combined MRI/MRSI in this study was 73.3%; specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy were 96.3%, 91.6%, 86.6% and 88% respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study shows that the combination of MRI and MRSI might be able to guide and therefore limit the number of iterative biopsies and cores for patients who are at high risk of having a prostate cancer. In some cases, MRSI alone allows identification of neoplasic prostatic zones. Other studies are needed to confirm these data."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A consecutive series of 20 patients (16 females and 4 males) undergoing prolonged sacral neuromodulation testing using permanent leads between September 2000 and March 2004 were evaluated retrospectively. 10 suffered from urgency-frequency syndrome, 3 from urge incontinence and 7 from non-obstructive chronic urinary retention. Key bladder diary variables at baseline, after the usual and prolonged evaluation period and at the last follow-up were compared.
RESULTS: The median age was 52 years (interquartile range (IQR) 38-59) and the median evaluation period 28 days (IQR 18-29). 16 of the 20 patients (80%) had successful prolonged sacral neuromodulation testing and underwent the implantation of the IPG that was placed in the anterior abdominal wall in 6 and in the upper buttock in 10 patients. The eligibility for IPG implantation was significantly (p=0.031) increased from 50% after the usual to 80% after the prolonged evaluation period. At a median follow-up of 22 months (IQR 12-34), sacral neuromodulation was successful in 14 (88%) of the 16 IPG implanted patients but failed in 2.
CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged sacral neuromodulation testing using permanent leads is more reliable for accurate patient selection than the usual evaluation period. Therefore, this method is strongly recommended and suggested to become the standard test procedure."
15826764,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15826764/,"INTRODUCTION: Complete repair of classic bladder exstrophy in male newborns has been successful with minimal morbidity. However, the technique may create hypospadias in some cases. We have recently adopted a modification to obtain an orthotopic meatus in bladder exstrophy boys.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between November 1998 and December 2002 complete repair of classic bladder exstrophy was carried out in 27 boys. Complete penile disassembly was performed in 22 boys including 4 newborns and 18 older children; mean age 3+/-2 years old. Modified disassembly was used in the last 5 boys including 4 newborns and a 9-month-old boy. During repair of epispadias, the dissection starts on the ventral aspect of the penis as usual. The urethral plate is separated from both corpora cavernosa to allow ventral transposition of the plate. In the complete disassembly technique, the urethral plate is completely separated from both hemiglans. In this modification, while the urethral plate is completely separated from both corpora cavernosa, the extreme distal end of the urethral plate remains attached to the distal ends of both hemiglans. Thus, when the plate is tubularized with fine interrupted sutures the meatus ends up at the tip of the glans penis. The symphysis pubis is re-approximated as usual and corpora cavernosa are approximated dorsally in the midline.
RESULTS: There was no major complication. Mean follow-up was 43+/-7 and 7+/-4 months for complete and modified disassembly groups respectively. Of the 22 boys, who underwent complete disassembly, 15 (68%) ended up with hypospadias and 7 (32%) had an orthotopic meatus. Modified disassembly has resulted in an excellent cosmetic appearance and orthotopic meatus in the 5 boys. Penile length was not shorter than boys who underwent complete disassembly. Parents of the 5 boys noticed normal straight morning erection.
CONCLUSION: Although complete penile disassembly allows ventral placement of the urethra, hypospadias is created in approximately two thirds of the cases. When the extreme distal end of the urethral plate remains attached to the distal ends of both hemiglans (modified disassembly), orthotopic meatus can be obtained in all boys. With modified disassembly, posterior mobilization of the bladder and urethra does not result in corporal angulations or shortening because of the proportionate inward movement of the corpora that accompanies symphyseal approximation. The modification is feasible in newborns and infants. These short-term results may obviate the need for later penile reconstructive procedure."
15826846,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15826846/,"OBJECTIVE: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is proposed for the treatment of drug-resistant depression. Studies performed in accordance with evidence-based medicine (EBM) are scarce, particularly in seeking optimal treatment and evaluation parameters. We aimed to test various types of rTMS in a large sample of depressed patients following EBM rules and to investigate treatment-related changes in plasma levels of neurotransmitters involved in depression.
METHODS: Seventy-one drug-resistant depressed patients were randomly assigned to low (1 Hz) or high (17 Hz) rate TMS, applied for 5 days over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC). Patients were separated into two study designs. One group (20 patients) received only active treatment, while the other entered a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Pre- and post-treatment blood samples were taken for evaluation of plasma levels of dopamine and serotonin.
RESULTS: After a week of treatment patients had a measurable benefit. However, overall the placebo stimulation did not differ significantly from real stimulation, nor were differences observed between the two rates of rTMS. The only difference emerged when the real stimulation was applied at 17 Hz following placebo treatment. Plasma levels of neurotransmitters between active and placebo rTMS were similar.
CONCLUSIONS: Using the treatment schedule of 1 week, although a clinical improvement after active treatment was indeed observed, this was both clinically and biochemically indistinguishable from that seen in the placebo arm.
SIGNIFICANCE: This suggests that most of the previous emphasis, for short period of treatment, should be tempered down and that further work is required in order to verify whether optimal stimulation and evaluation parameters for TMS-treatment of depression beyond the placebo effect may be found following EBM rules."
15827690,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15827690/,"PURPOSE: In invasive bladder cancer, several groups have reported the value of organ preservation by a combined-treatment approach, including transurethral resection (TUR-BT) and radiochemotherapy (RCT). As more experience is acquired with this organ- sparing treatment, patient selection needs to be optimized. Clinical factors are limited in their potential to identify patients most likely to respond to RCT, thus, additional molecular markers for predicting treatment response of individual lesions are sorely needed.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The apoptotic index (AI) and Ki-67 index were evaluated by immunohistochemistry on pretreatment biopsies of 134 patients treated for bladder cancer by TUR-BT and RCT. Expression of each marker as well as clinicopathologic factors were then correlated with initial response, local control and cancer-specific survival with preserved bladder in univariate and multivariate analysis.
RESULTS: The median AI for all patients was 1.5% (range 0.2-7.4%). The percentage of Ki-67-positive cells in the tumors ranged from 0.2% to 85% with a median of 14.2%. A significant correlation was found for AI and tumor differentiation (G1/2: AI = 1.3% vs. G3/4: AI = 1.6%; p = 0.01). A complete response at restaging TUR-BT was achieved in 76% of patients. Factors predictive of complete response included T-category (p < 0.0001), resection status (p = 0.02), lymphovascular invasion (p = 0.01), and Ki-67 index (p = 0.02). For local control, AI (p = 0.04) and Ki-67 index (p = 0.05) as well as T-category (p = 0.005), R-status (p = 0.05), and lymphatic vessel invasion (p = 0.05) reached statistical significance. Out of the molecular markers only high Ki-67 levels were associated to cause-specific survival with preserved bladder. On multivariate analysis, T-category was the strongest independent factor for initial response, local control and cancer-specific survival with preserved bladder.
CONCLUSION: The indices of pretreatment apoptosis and Ki-67 predict a favorable outcome in bladder cancer patients treated with TUR-BT and RCT. Molecular markers may help to select patients for an organ-sparing approach."
15827695,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15827695/,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There is no evidence in the literature about the incidence of synchronous brain metastases in patients with choroidal metastases. This is of major importance, because the radiation fields of choroidal metastases and, later on, brain metastases, if treated consecutively, are partly overlapping, thus potentially increasing the rate of late side effects such as brain necrosis. The goal of this study was to determine the frequency of synchronous brain metastases.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: 50 patients with choroidal metastases were enrolled into a study of the ""Arbeitsgemeinschaft Radiologische Onkologie"" of the German Cancer Society (ARO 95-08) with standardized 40 Gy radiotherapy, 2 Gy single dose. All patients were staged before treatment with a computed tomography of the brain (CCT). No patient showed clinical signs of brain metastases.
RESULTS: 13 out of 50 patients (26%) had brain metastases in the CCT leading to radiotherapy of the brain and choroidal metastases in one volume.
CONCLUSION: A CCT is indicated at the diagnosis of choroidal metastases for screening of synchronous brain metastases. The incidence is about 25%, and the diagnosis of brain metastases results in a different target volume: the whole brain including the posterior parts of the eyes compared to the posterior parts of the eyes alone. Therefore, the risk of late side effects could be reduced compared with an additional later radiotherapy of the whole brain with partly overlapping fields."
15827696,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15827696/,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Radiotherapy can induce tissue reactions with an edema leading to increased breast volume. The aim of the present study was to quantify this increase and analyze its effect on the electron boost technique.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: 140 patients with breast cancer treated with breast-conserving surgery underwent CT planning before, during and/or after radiotherapy in order to evaluate breast volume changes due to radiotherapy. CT data were analyzed using the HELAX planning system and dose distribution was assessed. Determination of the breast volume was achieved using an interpolation algorithm. Three subgroups were analyzed: group 1 (n = 47): < or = 670 cm(3), group 2 (n = 46): 671-999 cm(3), and group 3 (n = 47): > or = 1000 cm(3) breast volume.
RESULTS: The mean initial breast volume was 907 cm(3) (100-3073 cm(3)). After radiotherapy, mean breast volume increased by 81 cm(3) to 988 cm(3) (109-3185 cm(3)). Significant changes in volume were observed after a dose of 40 Gy. According to the subgroups mean volume increase was as follows: group 1: 53 cm(3) (3-120 cm(3)), group 2: 85 cm(3) (20-200 cm(3)), and group 3: 105 cm(3) (5-340 cm(3)). This difference was statistically significant for all subgroups (p < 0.001). Corresponding to the volume increase, depth of the boost target volume changed up to 1.0 cm.
CONCLUSION: As radiotherapy may lead to a significant increase in breast volume, it seems appropriate to perform a second planning CT after about 40 Gy in order to optimize dose distribution for boost irradiation."
15827774,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15827774/,"BACKGROUND: The widespread use of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) to replace axillary dissection has broadened the indications for axillary staging in breast cancer. Recent studies have demonstrated a finite risk of lymphedema and sensory morbidity associated with SLNB. We undertook this study to determine whether SLNB could be omitted in clinically node-negative patients with favorable-histology breast cancer.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of a prospective database of SLNBs performed at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center from 1996 to 2003 to determine the incidence of lymph node metastases by histological subtype. For the favorable subtypes, the patient's age, tumor size, estrogen receptor status, lymphovascular invasion, nuclear grade, and histological grade were compared by nodal status to determine their predictive value.
RESULTS: A total of 196 cases with favorable breast cancer subtypes were identified with a 4.1% (8 of 196) sentinel lymph node (SLN) positivity rate. Each of the histological subtypes included patients with positive SLNs, with the exception of adenoid cystic (n = 4) and secretory (n = 1) breast carcinoma, which were quite rare in our series. When compared by nodal status, the patient's age, tumor size, estrogen receptor status, lymphovascular invasion, nuclear grade, and histological grade failed to predict those with positive SLNs.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with favorable breast cancer histology have a small risk of axillary SLN metastases. The use of SLNB in these patients should be individualized, taking into consideration the small incidence of axillary metastases and the risks and benefits associated with the SLN procedure."
15827792,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15827792/,"BACKGROUND: Despite recently increasing numbers of reports on intraductal papillary mucinous tumors (IPMTs), difficulties still remain in terms of diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. The purpose of this multicenter study was to evaluate the clinicopathologic features of IPMT in Korea and to suggest predictive criteria for malignancy in IPMT.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinicopathologic data of 208 patients who underwent operations for IPMT between 1993 and 2002 at 28 institutes in Korea.
RESULTS: Of the 208 patients (mean age, 61 years), 147 were men and 61 were women. A total of 124 patients underwent pancreatoduodenectomy, 42 underwent distal pancreatectomy, 17 underwent total pancreatectomy, and 25 underwent limited pancreatic resection. There were 128 benign cases (adenoma, n = 62; borderline, n = 66) and 80 malignant cases (noninvasive, n = 29; invasive, n = 51). A significant difference in 5-year survival was observed between the benign and malignant groups (92.6% vs. 65.3%; P = .006). Of the six factors (age, location, duct dilatation, mural nodule, main duct type, and tumor size) that showed statistical differences by univariate analysis between the benign and malignant groups, three were significant by multivariate analysis--namely, mural nodule (P = .009), tumor size (P = .023), and a dilated duct size (P = .010).
CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of IPMTs are malignant, although the overall prognosis of IPMT is superior to that of ordinary pancreatic cancer. Radical surgery is recommended for IPMT with the predictors of malignancy: mural nodule, tumor size (> or =30 mm), and dilated duct size (> or =12 mm)."
15827814,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15827814/,"BACKGROUND: Delayed gastric emptying (DGE) occurs in 14% to 61% of patients after pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy, but its pathogenesis is unclear. We hypothesized that DGE may be due to pylorospasm secondary to vagal injuries at operation and may be preventable by the addition of pyloromyotomy.
METHODS: Patients operated on consecutively between April 2000 and August 2003 were studied. Pyloromyotomy was of the Fredet-Ramstedt type combined with antroplasty. DGE-free recovery was defined as tolerance of a diet for three successive days by postoperative day 8. The symptom of nausea was used as a basis for nasogastric tube removal and diet resumption. A gastric emptying test (GET) with solid food was obtained. Patients with difficulty swallowing were fed via a feeding tube.
RESULTS: There were 47 patients. Two patients were excluded because of death (n = 1) and ileus with pancreatic fistula (n = 1). Diagnoses were pancreatic cancer (n = 23), chronic pancreatitis (n = 11), ampullary cancer (n = 5), mucinous cystic neoplasm (n = 5), and duodenal villous adenoma (n = 3). Median times to nasogastric tube removal, start of liquid diet, and start of solid diet were postoperative days 2, 3, and 5, respectively. Two patients had tube feedings. Preoperative GET was abnormal in 51%, and postoperative GET was abnormal in 37%. The average length of stay was 9.5 days (median, 7 days). DGE occurred in only one patient (2.2%). There were no late complications during a 6-month follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: The addition of pyloromyotomy to pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy is effective in preventing DGE. Results are supportive of the hypothesis that DGE may be caused by operative injuries of the vagus innervating the pyloric region."
15827819,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15827819/,"BACKGROUND: Parathyroid carcinoma is a rare malignancy with a wide range of aggressiveness. There is no current staging system. Our primary aim was to review the presentation, diagnosis, surgical treatment, and outcomes of patients, with the goal of assessing the incidence of death related to parathyroid carcinoma.
METHODS: The authors present a retrospective chart review on patients with parathyroid carcinoma from 1975 to 2004, identified by the tumor registry of a single tertiary-care center. Diagnoses were confirmed histologically, clinical and radiographical data were recorded, and statistical analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Twenty-three cases were identified. The mean patient age was 54 years. The female:male ratio was 1.5:1. Follow-up ranged from 1 month to 23 years (median, 134 months). Mean preoperative calcium was 12.9 mg/dL. Median parathyroid hormone was 290 pg/mL. Two patients (9%) had an asymptomatic presentation, and five (22%) presented with a palpable neck mass. Only nine (39%) underwent initial comprehensive en-bloc resection. Median survival was 22 years. Five- and 10-year survival was 85.9% and 69.4%, respectively. Five- and 10-year survival with en-bloc resection was 90% and 67.5%, respectively. Local resection resulted in survival rates of 82.5% and 70.7%. Three of ten deaths were attributed to parathyroid carcinoma. In recurrent disease, computed tomography and scintigraphy had localization rates of 53% and 67%, respectively, with a concordance of 22%.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term survival is possible with parathyroid carcinoma. Death associated with parathyroid carcinoma was uncommon. A staging may be warranted despite the rarity of this disease."
15827921,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15827921/,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the gait of older adults with knee osteoarthritis (OA) to an age-, sex-, and weight-matched healthy cohort that would provide preliminary data to examine the hypothesis that adults with knee OA have abnormal knee joint moments and place greater loads on the knee joint during walking compared with healthy adults.
DESIGN: Nonrandomized, descriptive study of healthy and osteoarthritic older adults.
SETTING: University clinical research laboratory.
PARTICIPANTS: Ten older adults with tibiofemoral and/or patellofemoral radiographic evidence and pain and disability attributed to knee OA and 10 age-, sex-, and weight-matched healthy adults.
INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Three-dimensional gait analysis to calculate knee joint forces and hip, knee, and ankle joint moments; an analysis of covariance adjusted for differences in walking speed between the groups; electromyographic data to verify our interpretation of the knee joint moment data.
RESULTS: The joint forces and moments did not differ statistically between the OA and healthy groups. Nonsignificant differences in the OA group relative to the healthy group included between 7% and 8% greater knee joint compressive (OA group, 3.67+/-0.24 body weight [BW]; healthy group, 3.40+/-0.24 BW) and shear (OA group, 0.47+/-0.04 BW; healthy group, .44+/-.04 BW) forces, 33% higher knee extension moments (OA group, .32+/-.07 Nm/kg; healthy group, .24+/-.07 Nm/kg), and 24% lower knee internal abduction moments (OA group, .25+/-.06 Nm/kg; healthy group, .33+/-.06 Nm/kg).
CONCLUSIONS: Previous research suggests that mechanical overload may be associated with knee OA. Our results do not provide statistical evidence to support this hypothesis. Nevertheless, the trends in the data, along with previous results, suggest the need to investigate further the possible existence of a biomechanical pathway to knee OA."
15828462,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15828462/,"BACKGROUND: Primary stenting leads to a better short-term outcome than balloon angioplasty for acute myocardial infarction in randomised trials. However few data are available about the long-term outcome of primary stenting in acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the three-year outcome after primary stenting versus balloon angioplasty in patients with acute myocardial infarction.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study including 157 patients with AMI in a single center. Patients underwent balloon angioplasty (N = 48) or primary stenting (N = 109) within six hours after the onset of chest pain. We looked at the outcome during three years focusing on global mortality, major adverse cardiac events (MACE), reinterventions and target vessel revascularization (TVR).
RESULTS: The two groups are similar for their baseline characteristics. No difference was noted for in-patient mortality in the balloon angioplasty group and the primary stenting group (2.1 vs 2.8%; P = ns). The three-year mortality was not significantly different in the two groups. Regarding MACE (27.8 vs 31.7; P = 0.95), reinterventions (20.4 vs 24.7%; P = 0.98) and TVR (18.6 vs 17.8%; P = 0.69), both groups were statistically not different.
CONCLUSION: In the long-term patients treated with stent placement have similar rates of MACE, reinterventions or TVR than patients undergoing balloon angioplasty. If few studies noted a benefit in short-term outcomes, primary stenting doesn't improve the prognosis of acute myocardial infarction on long-term follow-up, which is dependent on atherosclerosis."
15828703,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15828703/,"BACKGROUND: Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are common, but it is not clear whether they improve care.
METHODS: Quality indicators for processes and outcomes of care were obtained from a computerized system-wide database by patient administration and utilization management personnel unaware of this study and without connection to or interests in guideline implementation. These indicators were compared before and after guideline implementation.
RESULTS: After the asthma CPG, nebulizer treatments, emergency department visits, and admissions decreased significantly (p < 0.001 for all three) and education increased significantly (p < 0.001). Periodic measurements of lung function and controller medication prescriptions were unchanged. After the diabetes mellitus CPG, microalbumin screens and education increased significantly (p < 0.001). Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor prescriptions and yearly foot examinations decreased significantly, along with the percentage of patients with blood pressure of < or = 130/85 mm Hg (p < 0.001). Mean hemoglobin A(1C) levels did not change significantly. After the tobacco cessation CPG, screening and education increased significantly (p < 0.001 and p = 0.04, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: The asthma CPG improved some processes and all outcomes. The diabetes CPG improved two of the eight measured processes but had no effect on outcomes. Education and screening, but not counseling, improved with the tobacco CPG. CPGs appear to improve diagnostic and educational processes more than provider-dependent treatment processes. Outcomes were improved after implementation of the asthma CPG but not after the diabetes CPG."

METHODS: This prospective masked observational study included 72 eyes of 36 consecutive subjects with normal ocular motility. The disc-foveal angle was measured by two masked investigators using a slitlamp stereo-biomicroscopic and fundus photographic technique.
RESULTS: The mean age was 13.7 years (6 - 44 years), and 15 (41.6%) were males. The average torsion using the slitlamp technique was 5.5 +/- 3.3 degrees and 6.1 +/- 4.3 degrees with fundus photographic technique. Clinical agreement between the two techniques for 5 degree and 6 degree torsion was 81% and 90% respectively. The average difference between the two techniques was 3.0 +/- 2.6 degrees . The mean inter-ocular difference was 3.3 +/- 2.7 degrees (SD, 2.77) and 5.5 +/- 4.6 degrees using the slitlamp and fundus photographic technique respectively. The Pearson correlation coefficient (r2) was 0.5.
CONCLUSION: The fundus photographic technique remains the gold standard test for the measurement of ocular torsion. The slitlamp biomicroscopic method can be useful where a fundus camera is unavailable. Further studies are required to test the repeatability of these tests."
15829836,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15829836/,"PURPOSE: Media campaigns are used to achieve public health goals but few studies have documented whether the goals were met.
METHODS: Two communities received community-wide efforts to increase the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) rate in defined pneumococcal disease-risk groups. One community also received a media campaign consisting of television and newspaper advertisements. A random-digit-dial telephone survey was conducted before and after the media campaign in both of the designated media markets. In addition to direct mailings to a sample of Medicare beneficiaries whose Medicare billing records did not indicate a PPV billing claim after 1991, community-wide campaigns consisting of table tents, brochures, flyers, and posters occurred in both markets. A 29-day television campaign and a 5-week newspaper campaign occurred in one of the markets.
RESULTS: We were unable to detect a significant effect of the media campaign on either PPV awareness or self-reported receipt of pneumococcal vaccine.
CONCLUSION: While it is important to evaluate community health intervention efforts, evaluations can be very difficult. Because of financial and other limitations, most feasible evaluation methods will not have the power to detect changes attributable to the intervention nor to provide confidence that there was no important change."

OBJECTIVE: To verify the association between MTHFR and apolipoprotein E (APOE) polymorphisms and Alzheimer's disease.
METHOD: This work was conducted as a case-control study. Cases included thirty patients with probable AD. Controls were constituted by 29 individuals without dementia according to neuropsychological tests paired to age, sex, race and educational level. DNA was isolated from peripheral leukocytes of anticoagulated venous blood. Genotyping of APOE and MTHFR were performed by DNA amplification and digestion. The frequences of APOE and MTHFR genotypes were submitted by chi-square test corrected by Fisher test; the APOE genotypes, to chi-square linear tendency test and the frequences of MTHFR mutant and AD, by stratificated analysis adjust by Mantel-Haenszel method.
RESULTS: There was significant difference about APOE4 and APOE2 in the groups. (p=0.002) The odds ratio increased exponentially with the increased number of E4 allele (chi2 linear tendency test). No significant difference was detected on MTHFR genotypes in both case and control groups.
CONCLUSION: The APOE4 is a risk factor and demonstrated a dose-dependent effect while APOE2 allele conferred a protection to AD. The MTHFR mutation had no correlation with AD."

METHOD: Between 1992 and 2000, we studied 104 patients submitted to embolization as the main treatment. Patients were followed until hemorrhage or death.
RESULTS: Follow-up ranged from 1.6 months to 8 years. The most frequent presentations were hemorrhage (50%) and seizures (38%). In addition, 40% were small (<30 mm); 56% were medium (30-60 mm). Obliteration was < or =1/3 in 11% of the cases; from 1/3 to < or = 2/3 in 49%; >2/3 in 36%; complete in 5%. The risk of death was 1%/year, and of bleeding, 5.4%/year. Presentation with hemorrhage and low obliteration rate were the main factors associated with hemorrhage.

METHODS: 145 pacemaker specialists worldwide were asked about their pacemaker experience and arrhythmia induction due to asynchronous stimulation.
RESULTS: 102/145 physicians (70 %) answered. Pacing experience: 3 - 40 y, mean 20 +/- 8 y, cumulative 1,974 y. Pacemaker follow-ups: 50 - 12,000/y, mean 2,326 +/- 2,082, overall 230,305/y. No data: 3. Arrhythmia induction was reported by 34/102 physicians (33 %) in 48 cases. 23 cases were major complications: In 13 pts VT or VF was induced. 4 of these had an ejection fraction < 30 %, one patient died. 10 additional cases without detailed information were included. 4 of these occurred 15 to 20 years ago. No case occurred in the last 7 years. 25 events were induced secondary, or clinically not relevant: 14 cases had asymptomatic PVCs or short runs. 5 cases 20 - 25 years ago, were due to anodal stimulation. 5 events happened during acute myocardial ischemia or electrolyte imbalance immediately after cardiac surgery. One patient had spontaneous VTs as well.
CONCLUSION: Inducement of ventricular tachyarrhythmias during asynchronous ventricular pacing is an extreme rarity. Patients at risk for these rare events are only those with acute myocardial ischemia or severe electrolyte imbalance, and those with organic cardiac disease, reduced left ventricular function and spontaneous ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Asynchronous ventricular pacing can be considered as safe."
15830396,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15830396/,"PURPOSE: To assess the relation between the pharmacists' opinions and the decision to dispense drugs without medical prescription and to recommend a visit to a doctor.
METHODS: We carried out a cohort study on a sample of 166 pharmacists in North-West Spain. Pharmacists' opinions on prescription practice of the doctors, on pharmacists' qualification to dispense drugs without medical prescription, on their responsibility about dispensed drugs, on clients' qualification for self-medication, and pharmacists' perception of their work were collected through a personal interview. Dispensing and the recommendation to the patient to visit their doctor were measure in the follow-up. We constructed logistic regression models.
RESULTS: The response rate to the first questionnaire was 98.8% and the participation rate in the follow-up was 60%. Pharmacists who considered that doctors prescribed excessively were less likely to dispense without medical prescription (OR = 0.48) and to send the client to the doctor more often (OR = 2.33). On the other hand, those who considered themselves to be capable to dispense without prescription do so frequently (OR = 1.24). A major appreciation of the pharmacist as a health educator was associated with a higher dispensing (OR = 3.81). Pharmacists who considered that customers' qualification for self-medication was good recommended, more frequently visiting a doctor (OR = 1.58).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the pharmacists' opinions are associated with their practice of counseling. Therefore, any program designed with the purpose of changing dispensing habits of the pharmacists should identify and take into account their opinions."
15831106,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15831106/,"BACKGROUND: The same mechanisms by which ultrasound enhances thrombolysis are described in connection with non-beneficial effects of ultrasound. The present safety study was therefore designed to explore effects of beneficial ultrasound characteristics on the infarcted and non-infarcted myocardium.
METHODS: In an open chest porcine model (n = 17), myocardial infarction was induced by ligating a coronary diagonal branch. Pulsed ultrasound of frequency 1 MHz and intensity 0.1 W/cm2 (ISATA) was applied during one hour to both infarcted and non-infarcted myocardial tissue. These ultrasound characteristics are similar to those used in studies of ultrasound enhanced thrombolysis. Using blinded assessment technique, myocardial damage was rated according to histopathological criteria.
RESULTS: Infarcted myocardium exhibited a significant increase in damage score compared to non-infarcted myocardium: 6.2 +/- 2.0 vs. 4.3 +/- 1.5 (mean +/- standard deviation), (p = 0.004). In the infarcted myocardium, ultrasound exposure yielded a further significant increase of damage scores: 8.1 +/- 1.7 vs. 6.2 +/- 2.0 (p = 0.027).
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest an instantaneous additive effect on the ischemic damage in myocardial tissue when exposed to ultrasound of stated characteristics. The ultimate damage degree remains to be clarified."

SETTING: Tertiary referral centre.
PARTICIPANTS: All patients presenting with STEMI randomly assigned to stenting or balloon angioplasty. No exclusion criteria were applied.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary end point was combined death or reinfarction at one year's follow up.
RESULTS: 1683 consecutive patients with STEMI were randomly assigned before angiography to stenting (n = 849) or balloon angioplasty (n = 834). A total of 785 patients (92.5%) in the stent group and 763 patients (91.5%) in the balloon group actually underwent primary angioplasty. The groups were comparable in terms of postprocedural TIMI (thrombolysis in myocardial infarction) flow, myocardial blush grade, and distal embolisation. No difference was observed in clinical outcome at both intention to treat (14% v 12.5%, not significant) and actual treatment analyses (12.4% v 11.3%, not significant).

15831694,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15831694/,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: International variation in the outcomes of patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) has been well reported. The relative contributions of patient, hospital, and country level factors on clinical outcomes, however, remain unclear, and thus, was the objective of this study.
DESIGN: Multilevel logistic regression models were developed for death/(re)infarction (MI) at 30 days and death in one year, with patients (1st level) nested in hospitals (2nd level) and hospitals in countries (3rd level).
SETTINGS: The GUSTO IV ACS clinical trial was carried out at 458 hospital sites in 24 countries.
PATIENTS: 7800 non-ST segment elevation (NSTE) ACS patients.
MAIN RESULTS: There were substantial variations among countries in the processes and outcomes of care at 30 days, ranging from 5.4% to 50.0% for percutaneous coronary intervention, 4.3% to 21.2% for coronary artery bypass graft surgery, 5.0% to 13.9% for 30 day death/(re)MI, and 4.9% to 14.8% for one year mortality. However, the residual inter-country variations in 30 day death/(re)MI and one year mortality became non-significant and nearly disappeared (p > 0.500 for both) after adjusting for key baseline patient characteristics and hospital factors, which became significant (p < 0.01 for both). Patient level factors accounted for 96%-99% of total variation in these end points, leaving the remaining 1% and 4% of variance attributable to hospital level factors.
CONCLUSION: The international differences in clinical outcomes in this study of NSTE ACS are primarily accounted for by the patient level factors, with hospital level factors playing a minor part, and the country level factors a negligible one. These findings have significant policy and research implications involving international collaboration and comparisons."
15832039,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15832039/,"BACKGROUND: Although the majority of papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC) have an excellent prognosis, certain aggressive variants do occur. The tall cell variant (TCV) of PTC, which tends to occur in elderly patients, is the most common among the aggressive variants and the most aggressive of all variants.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the age of patients with major variants of PTC and correlate age with certain cytomorphological features of diagnostic importance.
METHODS: 53 PTC cases with available information on age and diagnosed by fine needle aspiration cytology were categorized into various variants following a review of smears. There were 6 TCV (>or=30% tall cells) cases, 8 cases with a significant tall cell component (sig. TCC; 10-29% tall cells), 16 usual variants (UV), 17 follicular variants (FV), and 6 miscellaneous variants. These groups were compared with respect to age (mean+/-SD, median). Further, the age of all patients with PTC was correlated with cytological features such as tall cell count and count of cells with reddish cytoplasm, intranuclear cytoplasmic inclusion, and nuclear grooves.
RESULTS: The median age of patients with TCV, PTC with a sig. TCC, UV, FV and miscellaneous variants was 47.5, 44.5, 31.5, 34.0 and 42.0 years, respectively. The age of PTC (TCV) cases (52.0+/-17.84 years) and of those with a sig. TCC (45.9+/-12.12 years) was significantly higher than the age of PTC (FV) cases (34.2+/-8.21 years) (p=0.004 and 0.027, respectively). The combined age of PTC (TCV) and PTC (sig. TCC) cases (48.5+/-14.54 years) was significantly higher than the age of PTC (UV) cases (p=0.038) as well as of PTC (FV) cases (p=0.005). Six (42.9%) of the patients with PTC (TCV and sig. TCC) were >or=50 years of age as opposed to 3 (9.1%) of PTC (UV and FV) cases (p=0.0134). The age of patients with PTC in general showed a significant correlation with tall cell count (p<0.01).
CONCLUSION: The age of the patients with PTC seems to play a role in the morphological manifestations of the neoplasm, which is related to the prognostic outcome."
15832048,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15832048/,"BACKGROUND: Human life expectancy is constantly increasing: the challenge for modern geriatric medicine is to identify the means to reach successfully extreme longevity.
OBJECTIVE: To determine which are the survival determinants in centenarians using a neural network.
METHODS: Sample of 110 centenarians living in Rome, mean age 101.6 years (SD=1.8) with a sex ratio males:females of 1:3. We administered an extensive health interview (lasting 1-2 h) to each subject. The questionnaire, carried out according to the Geriatric Multidimensional Assessment, is made up of 100 items including a comprehensive health and psychosocial assessment aimed at various topics of general health and well-being and some scales used in geriatric practice. We applied several three-layered feed-forward neural networks by mixing in different ways the most important of the 100 items.
RESULTS: The most predicting powered net is the one constructed with 23 variables regarding comorbidity, cardiovascular risk factors, cognitive status, mood, functional status and social interactions, which therefore are strictly related to survival in centenarians.
CONCLUSION: Survival in longevity is a complex biological phenomenon, which is an ideal field for using the neural network as a statistic method. The net shows us that the maintenance of social relationships even in presence of disability is of major importance for survival in the oldest old."
15832099,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15832099/,"BACKGROUND: The National Cholesterol Education Program defines a fasting triglyceride level below 150 mg/dL as normal. However, observational data suggest that triglyceride levels above 100 mg/dL may predict coronary heart disease (CHD) events.
METHODS: To determine the prevalence of systemic inflammation with a normal triglyceride level (100-149 mg/dL), data obtained from the population-based cross-sectional study of 4412 men and women in the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were reviewed. Measurements included fasting lipids and lipoproteins and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level measured using a Behring Nephelometer Analyzer System.
RESULTS: High CRP level was equally prevalent whether the designated triglyceride cutpoint was greater than or equal to 100 (unadjusted OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.7-2.3) or greater than or equal to 150 (unadjusted OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.6-2.2). After adjustment for other covariates, the triglyceride range of 100 to 149 mg/dL remained independently associated with elevated CRP level (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.02-1.67). In addition, an approximately fivefold higher likelihood of elevated CRP level was observed with triglyceride levels between 100 and 149 mg/dL and normal body mass index (BMI; 24-24.9) compared with lower triglyceride level (<65 mg/dL) and BMI (<22) (P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that ""normal"" triglyceride levels (100-150 mg/dL) are associated with systemic inflammation and that lower fasting triglyceride levels (eg, <100 rather than <150 mg/dL) may be a more optimal cutpoint in CHD risk assessment."
15832250,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15832250/,"BACKGROUND: Although it is known that after surgery of the nose and/or the paranasal sinuses serious complications can arise for patients suffering from Sleep-Apnea-Syndrome (SAS), there exists no general recommendation for postoperative care of these patients. This retrospective analysis is dealing with the question whether it is generally necessary to observe SAS-patients after nasal surgery including intubation in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: 24 Patients of the ORL-Dept., Marienkrankenhaus Hamburg, suffering from SAS underwent surgery of the nose, the paranasal sinuses and/or the pharynx including total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) during the period of 1. 10. 2000 until 1. 5. 2004. SAS was diagnosed in 6 cases due to defined clinical criteria and in 18 cases due to the polysomnographic findings in the sleeping laboratory's examination. All patients were observed postoperatively for one night in an ICU. The anesthesia protocol and the intensive care curve of each patient were systematically evaluated with special regard of the following parameters: Risk factors (Body Mass Index; other diseases, ASA-classification), premedication drugs, duration of the surgery, drugs for pain relief, lowest O2-saturation of blood, lowest heartrate, highest systolic blood pressure, adverse effects, intensive care interventions.
RESULTS: Intensive care interventions were never needed. 2 patients received a low dosage of oxygeninsufflation via a face mask, in 5 cases calcium-antagonist drugs were administered due to high blood pressure and in 1 case Metamizole administration was necessary due to high temperatures. An accompanying bradycardia of the same patient was treated by administration of Atropine. The lower average O2-saturation was 93.6 +/- 1.7 % (Minimum value: 89 %). The maximum systolic blood pressure was 165.8 +/- 21.2 mm Hg and the lowest average heart rate was 65.4 +/- 13.2 bpm.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients suffering from a mild to moderate SAS do not need a general postoperative surveillance in an ICU if the chosen form of anesthesia is considered concerning this sickness."
15832432,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15832432/,"BACKGROUND: Fellowships in advanced laparoscopy with emphasis in laparoscopic gastric bypass (LGBP) are available for obtaining experience in performing LGBP. The following is the first report in the literature prospectively documenting a single surgeon's experience with LGBP outcomes following completion of an advanced laparoscopic surgical fellowship.
METHODS: Outcomes measured prospectively included length of stay, length of operation, complications, reduction in obesity-related co-morbidities, and percentage excess weight loss. Outcomes were analyzed by quartile to see if there was difference over time. Complications were also compared to outcomes in the literature.
RESULTS: 175 patients (147 female, 28 male) underwent LGBP. The mean BMI was 49.2. Mean operative time was 123 minutes, and mean length of stay was 2.2 days. The percentage excess weight loss at 1 year was 73% (n = 79). One patient developed an internal hernia (0.6%) and 1 patient developed an anastomotic leak (0.6%). Post operative transfusion rate was 4.6%. There were no deep venous thromboses or pulmonary emboli detected. There were no conversions to open, and there was no mortality. Upon quartile analysis, there was no difference in complication rates. Complication rates were comparable to published outcomes in the literature.
CONCLUSION: Fellowships in advanced laparoscopy with emphasis on LGBP provide the optimal training environment for acquisition of skills necessary to safely and effectively perform LGBP. With fellowship training, complication rates were comparable to published outcomes in the literature without a period of higher complications (the learning curve)."
15833258,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15833258/,"OBJECTIVE: To test the possible link between first investigation and development of spastic diplegia.
METHOD: A long-term retrospective study was carried out in the Neonatal Medicine Department of Arras Hospital, the C.A.M.S.P. of that town and with corresponding therapists.
RESULTS: The study undertaken from January 1, 1991, to December 31, 1997, involved 56 children suspected of developing spastic diplegia and requiring a specialized course of treatment during the evolution of disease. In 32, evolution of disease was favourable, and in 24 spastic diplegia developed. An unfavourable evolution was significantly associated with late intervention of rehabilitation.
CONCLUSION: Although few pre- or neonatal factors differentiated the two groups of children in their opposite evolution, haemorrhage during pregnancy and early detection seem to be determining factors in spastic diplegia."
15833511,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15833511/,"OBJECTIVES: To elucidate the respective prognostic implications of vascular, lymphatic, and perineural invasion noted on the pathologic analyses of radical cystectomy specimens. Controversy still exists on whether the pathologic features of vascular, lymphatic, and perineural invasion have any role as prognostic indicators for bladder cancer.
METHODS: A retrospective review of 125 patients with bladder cancer treated with radical cystectomy was conducted. Patients who received either preoperative or postoperative chemotherapy, those with lymph node metastasis confirmed on postoperative pathologic analysis, those who did not undergo standard bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection, and those receiving palliative treatment were excluded from the study.
RESULTS: The mean patient age was 62.5 years (range 39 to 84), and the median follow-up duration was 41.0 months (range 1 to 146). Vascular, lymphatic, and perineural invasion was present in 8.8%, 20.8%, and 8.8% of specimens, respectively, and 28% of patients had at least one of the three pathologic features in the specimen. Univariate analysis revealed that vascular invasion, lymphatic invasion, and perineural invasion were significant prognostic predictors of overall survival. However, only the tumor stage and vascular invasion proved to be independent prognostic predictors of disease-specific survival on multivariate analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study have shown that the pathologic tumor stage and the pathologic presence of vascular invasion are independent prognostic predictors for disease-specific survival in patients who have undergone radical cystectomy for bladder cancer. Additional study should be performed on the prognostic implications of lymphatic and perineural invasion."

PURPOSE: The purpose was to determine if differences in (a) subjective evaluation; (b) short-term retention of material; and (c) long-term retention of material occurred with the use of static overheads versus computerized, animated PowerPoint for a presentation to medical students.
METHODS: All students rotating on a required clerkship attended a standard lecture presented by 1 faculty member. The content of the presentation remained the same, but the instructional media varied (overheads on even months, animated PowerPoint on odd months). Students completed a posttest and subjective evaluation immediately following the lecture and repeated the posttest 1 year later. Unpaired t tests were used to compare the 2 groups.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the groups on any parameter.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, students rated both types of presentation equally and displayed no differences in short- or long-term retention of material."
15833750,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15833750/,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether routinely collected data from hospital episode statistics could be used to identify the gynaecologist Rodney Ledward, who was suspended in 1966 and was the subject of the Ritchie inquiry into quality and practice within the NHS.
DESIGN: A mixed scanning approach was used to identify seven variables from hospital episode statistics that were likely to be associated with potentially poor performance. A blinded multivariate analysis was undertaken to determine the distance (known as the Mahalanobis distance) in the seven indicator multidimensional space that each consultant was from the average consultant in each year. The change in Mahalanobis distance over time was also investigated by using a mixed effects model.
SETTING: NHS hospital trusts in two English regions, in the five years from 1991-2 to 1995-6. Population Gynaecology consultants (n = 143) and their hospital episode statistics data.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Whether Ledward was a statistical outlier at the 95% level.
RESULTS: The proportion of consultants who were outliers in any one year (at the 95% significance level) ranged from 9% to 20%. Ledward appeared as an outlier in three of the five years. Our mixed effects (multi-year) model identified nine high outlier consultants, including Ledward.
CONCLUSION: It was possible to identify Ledward as an outlier by using hospital episode statistics data. Although our method found other outlier consultants, we strongly caution that these outliers should not be overinterpreted as indicative of ""poor"" performance. Instead, a scientific search for a credible explanation should be undertaken, but this was outside the remit of our study. The set of indicators used means that cancer specialists, for example, are likely to have high values for several indicators, and the approach needs to be refined to deal with case mix variation. Even after allowing for that, the interpretation of outlier status is still as yet unclear. Further prospective evaluation of our method is warranted, but our overall approach may be potentially useful in other settings, especially where performance entails several indicator variables."
15833988,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15833988/,"PURPOSE: To retrospectively determine how changes in utilization of computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and other imaging technologies between 1996 and 2002 influenced costs of inpatient hospital care at one large academic medical center.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board did not require its approval or patient informed consent for studies with use of billing data. Patient anonymity was protected by removal of potentially identifying information. Data on hospital costs for 17 139 patients admitted to Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Mass, between 1996 and 2002 were downloaded from hospital cost-accounting system; sample was restricted to inpatients with diagnoses in diagnosis-related groups 014-015 (Stroke and TIA [transient ischemic attack]), 164-167 (Appendectomy), 082 (Lung Cancer), 182-183 (Upper Gastrointestinal Conditions), 148-149 (Colon Cancer), and 243 (Back Problems). For each patient, data on demographics, all products and services used, and costs associated with each product or service were obtained. By using institutional codes, we calculated costs of CT, MR imaging, and total imaging relative to total hospital costs. Statistical analyses were performed with Student t test and multiple linear regression analysis.
RESULTS: Between 1996 and 2002, number of inpatient CT and MR images obtained at the hospital more than doubled. In 2002, hospital costs were 155% those of 1996 levels; inpatient imaging costs were 151% those of 1996 levels. Total costs increased an average of 7.8% per year; imaging costs increased 8.3% per year. Although highly variable over the study period, as a percentage of total imaging costs, CT and MR imaging costs appeared to remain stable relative to costs of other imaging modalities.
CONCLUSION: Despite substantial increases in utilization of inpatient CT, MR imaging, and other imaging technologies, diagnostic imaging costs increased at approximately same rate as did total costs for inpatients with several diagnoses. CT and MR imaging do not appear to be driving the cost increases seen between 1996 and 2002."
15834272,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15834272/,"OBJECTIVE: To assess whether nocturnal blood pressure fall in people of African (Black) and South Asian descent differs from that of the European origin white populations (White).
METHODS: A systematic literature review was carried out using Medline 1966-2003 and Embase 1980-2003, and citations from references. The meta-analysis was performed using Cochrane review manager software (RevMan version 4.2; The Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK).
RESULTS: Seventeen studies were identified; 11 studies from the USA, one from the USA and Canada, and six studies from the United Kingdom. The mean percentage systolic blood pressure (SBP) nocturnal fall was below 10% (non-dipping) in 10 of 17 studies (59%) and the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) nocturnal fall was below 10% in four of 16 studies (25%) in Blacks compared with four of 17 studies (24%) in SBP and none in DBP nocturnal falls in Whites. Compared with Whites, Blacks had a significantly lower mean percentage nocturnal fall; the overall weighted mean difference in SBP was -3.07 (95% confidence interval, -3.81, -2.33; P < 0.00001) and in DBP was -2.98 (95% confidence interval, -3.97, -2.00; P < 0.00001). Two studies on South Asians showed a higher SBP but a similar mean DBP nocturnal fall compared with Whites.
CONCLUSION: Smaller nocturnal blood pressure falls and a higher prevalence of non-dipping may contribute to the higher levels of hypertension complications seen in Black people. No such phenomenon was seen in South Asians but more research is needed to explore their higher stroke mortality."
15835098,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15835098/,"OBJECT: Most surgical procedures are associated with a learning curve in which the success rate is lower early in the experience before mistakes have been identified and modifications made to the procedure. Negative results obtained early in a trial's learning curve may be a matter of timing rather than a reflection of the procedure's effectiveness. The recently published results of the Endoscopic Shunt Insertion Trial (ESIT) represent the notion that endoscopically placed shunts were no more likely to survive than conventionally placed shunts. This negative result may be due to inexperience in performing endoscopic surgeries.
METHODS: . Surgical experience was assessed in two ways. Shunt survival rates were compared between cases treated endoscopically in the 1st and last years of the ESIT. The effect of center volume was evaluated using a Cox proportional hazard model in which the following variables were analyzed: age at registration, the diagnosis of myelomeningocele, head size, method of shunt placement (endoscopic compared with conventional), and center volume. There was no difference in survival (endurance) of the shunt between patients enrolled in the 1st and last years (log rank = 0.08, p = 0.77). Likewise, no variable in the Cox multivariate model, including center volume, was a significant factor in predicting shunt survival.
CONCLUSIONS: The primary result of the ESIT was found to be internally valid. The fact that endoscopic shunt placement did not benefit patients evaluated in the study was not due to early timing of the trial. Any learning curve among the participating surgeons did not adversely affect the results."
15835228,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15835228/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the use of a skin cleanser on the skin surrounding pressure ulcers helps to promote healing.
METHOD: The study was conducted over a two-year period in patients with stage II or more pressure ulcers. All subjects were at least 65 years of age and resident in a long-term care hospital. During the first year, skin was cleansed with normal saline. In year two, a pH-balanced cleanser was used. The healing times for the two methods were then compared.
RESULTS: Healing time was shorter in the group using the cleanser for every stage of ulcer, with an especially significant difference for stage II ulcers (p=0.002). Analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model found a 1.79-fold improvement in the healing rate of stage II ulcers when the surrounding skin was washed with the cleanser.
CONCLUSION: Cleaning the surrounding skin with a cleanser rather than normal saline promotes the healing of pressure ulcers."
15836523,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15836523/,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess attitudes of patrons and medical school faculty about physicians with nontraditional facial piercings. We also examined whether a piercing affected the perceived competency and trustworthiness of physicians.
DESIGN: Survey.
SETTING: Teaching hospital in the southeastern United States.
PARTICIPANTS: Emergency department patrons and medical school faculty physicians.
INTERVENTIONS: First, patrons were shown photographs of models with a nontraditional piercing and asked about the appropriateness for a physician or medical student. In the second phase, patrons blinded to the purpose of the study were shown identical photographs of physician models with or without piercings and asked about competency and trustworthiness. The third phase was an assessment of attitudes of faculty regarding piercings.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Nose and lip piercings were felt to be appropriate for a physician by 24% and 22% of patrons, respectively. Perceived competency and trustworthiness of models with these types of piercings were also negatively affected. An earring in a male was felt to be appropriate by 35% of patrons, but an earring on male models did not negatively affect perceived competency or trustworthiness. Nose and eyebrow piercings were felt to be appropriate by only 7% and 5% of faculty physicians and working with a physician or student with a nose or eyebrow piercing would bother 58% and 59% of faculty, respectively. An ear piercing in a male was felt to be appropriate by 20% of faculty, and 25% stated it would bother them to work with a male physician or student with an ear piercing.
CONCLUSIONS: Many patrons and physicians feel that some types of nontraditional piercings are inappropriate attire for physicians, and some piercings negatively affect perceived competency and trustworthiness. Health care providers should understand that attire may affect a patient's opinion about their abilities and possibly erode confidence in them as a clinician."
15836688,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15836688/,"BACKGROUND: The Medical Emergency Team (MET) has evolved in some hospitals as a means of delivering effective treatment early enough to prevent cardiac arrests. Our aim was to analyze the effectiveness of observation practice to detect abnormalities in vital signs prior to cardiac arrest and to determine the need for a MET system in Finnish hospitals.
METHODS: The charts of patients who suffered cardiac arrest during 18 months in four hospitals were reviewed. The vital signs, symptoms and interventions during 8 h prior to arrest were recorded and analyzed against trigger criteria of the MET.
RESULTS: During the study period, 110 patients suffered cardiac arrest in hospitals, and 56 (51%) of the arrests occurred on the wards. Of those patients, 30 (54%) had an abnormal vital sign fulfilling the MET criteria, documented on average 3.8 h prior to the arrest. During this period, 13 patients did not receive any intervention (e.g. supplemental oxygen or medication), eight received intervention within 1 h and nine received intervention after more than 1 h. Response to the first intervention was not attained in any patient; nevertheless re-interventions took place in one patient only.
CONCLUSION: Significant physiological deterioration seems to be common in the hours before a cardiac arrest on the wards of Finnish hospitals, suggesting that implementation of a MET-system may be worthwhile. However, the practice of vital sign observation by the nursing staff should be improved before maximal benefit of a MET can be achieved."
15836750,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15836750/,"BACKGROUND: Previously published data established Blomia tropicalis, as the major source of allergic sensitization in asthmatic children in tropical Singapore. Objective To define the prevalence, clinical characteristics and risk factors of species-specific mite sensitization in paediatric allergic rhinitis (AR) patients in this unique environment.
METHODS: We performed a prospective evaluation of newly diagnosed AR patients, from 1 May 2003 to 30 April 2004, from the otolaryngology and allergy outpatient clinics of the Kendang Kerbau Children's Hospital in Singapore. Patients included in the study showed evidence of sensitization to at least one respiratory allergen source and completed a detailed questionnaire. Relative risk of sensitization and associated risk factors were calculated using logistic regression analysis with the forward stepwise model. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to adjust for confounding interactions. Continuous values were compared using anova, SPSS 9.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., 1999).
RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-five patients were included, 119 (68%) males, 142 (81%) Chinese, age mean 7.9 years (range 2-16). Sixty-eight patients (39%) reported a concomitant diagnosis and/or clinical complaints of bronchial asthma and 84 (48%) of atopic dermatitis. Skin prick test results were positive for traditional house dust mites (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus. and D. farinae mix) in 85% of patients and for B. tropicalis in 62%. Overall mite sensitization was 98%, household pets 10%, moulds 9% and food proteins 12%. By far the single most significant factor associated with Dermatophagoides sensitization in this group was the presence of allergic eczema (odds ratio (OR) 31.8%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.6-285, P=0.002). Allergic eczema was negatively associated with B. tropicalis sensitization (OR 0.26%, 95% CI 0.14-0.5).
CONCLUSIONS: Children with AR and concomitant atopic dermatitis show a preferential sensitization to the Dermatophagoides mites. In our population, B. tropicalis sensitization is more prominent in children with pure respiratory allergy."
15836856,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15836856/,"BACKGROUND: Peritoneal adhesions are pathological fibrotic bands developing after mesothelial damage. Transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-beta1) has mitogenic activities for macrophages and fibroblasts. Over-expression of TGF-beta1 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several fibrotic disorders. Angiotensin II increases the expression of the TGF-beta1 in fibroblasts. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE) on intraperitoneal adhesions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty male Wistar albino rats were divided into two groups. In the first procedure, laparotomy was performed through a 3-cm midline incision. Ileum was divided above 10 cm from ileocecal valve and a single-layer ileoileal anastomosis was performed. Although no treatment was given to rats in group 1, lisinopril (an ACE inhibitor) was given to rats in group 2 for postoperative 7 days in drinking water. Estimated amount of supplied lisinopril was 6.5 mg/kg/day. On postoperative 8th day, relaparotomy was performed and adhesions were evaluated. At the same time, blood samples were taken for TGF-beta1 measurements.
RESULTS: Adhesion severity was significantly less in the ACE inhibitor group (P < 0.001). While mean TGF-beta1 level was 860.3 +/- 108.1 pg/dl (mean +/- SD) in control group, it was 335.8 +/- 52.4 pg/dl in ACE inhibitor group (P < 0.001). There was a significant correlation between serum TGF-beta1 levels and grade of adhesions (r = 0.948).
CONCLUSION: It was concluded that ACE inhibitors might be useful for preventing peritoneal adhesions."
15837263,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15837263/,"OBJECTIVES: We sought to ascertain whether chronic oral therapy with atorvastatin protects against ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury.
BACKGROUND: We have recently shown that acute atorvastatin treatment protects against reperfusion-induced injury by activating the PI3K/Akt/eNOS pathway. However, many patients are on chronic statin therapy, and it is necessary to investigate whether this, in itself, provides a therapeutic advantage.
METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were orally treated for one day, three days, one week, or two weeks with 20 mg/kg of atorvastatin or vehicle, after which the hearts underwent 35 min of ischemia and 120 min reperfusion (IR). Two additional groups were treated for one or two weeks with atorvastatin and then received a supplementary dose of 40 mg/kg before IR. The risk zone was determined using Evans blue and infarct size (IR%) using triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining.
RESULTS: Treatment with atorvastatin for one and three days significantly reduced infarct size versus controls (38.9 +/- 3.1% vs. 56.4 +/- 2.3%; 39.3 +/- 2.4% vs. 61.3 +/- 3.8%, respectively). However, after one or two weeks of treatment, no protection was observed (52.6 +/- 3.8% vs. 58.6 +/- 4.3%; 58.3 +/- 2.7% vs. 52.4 +/- 5.7%, respectively). Surprisingly, a supplementary dose of atorvastatin recaptured the protection in the groups treated chronically (36.2 +/- 2.8% vs. 58.6 +/- 4.3%; 26.8 +/- 1.5% vs. 51.2 +/- 6.7%, at one and two weeks, respectively). Interestingly, we observed an increased level of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN), the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase inhibitor, in the chronic treated hearts.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, atorvastatin appears to have an acute protective effect that wanes with time associated with an increase in PTEN levels. This waning protection can be recaptured by an acute high dose given immediately before IR. These results may have protential clinical relevance."
15837886,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15837886/,"HYPOTHESIS: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is frequently used preoperatively in adult patients with suspected choledocholithiasis. Cholelithiasis occurs much less often in children, and the indications for ERCP are not established. We hypothesized that the natural history of choledocholithiasis in children is spontaneous passage of stones through the papilla and that these children can be managed without routine preoperative ERCP.
DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of patients treated over a 10-year period.
SETTING: Tertiary care children's hospital.
PATIENTS: All patients with cholecystectomy for biliary disease.
INTERVENTIONS: Cholecystectomy; intraoperative cholangiography for suspected choledocholithiasis: hyperbilirubinemia, gallstone pancreatitis, and ultrasonographic evidence of common bile duct dilation or common bile duct stones; and postoperative ERCP for symptomatic choledocholithiasis: pain and jaundice.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence and complications of choledocholithiasis and frequency of ERCP.
RESULTS: One hundred patients (63 females) were studied. Indications included acute cholecystitis (10%), chronic cholecystitis (59%), gallstone pancreatitis (26%), and choledocholithiasis (5%). An intraoperative cholangiography was performed in 45 patients, and common bile duct stones were identified in 13. Expectant management of asymptomatic common bile duct stones was associated with sonographic resolution within 1 week. One patient with intraoperative cholangiography-proven choledocholithiasis required ERCP for symptoms 24 hours after operation. One additional patient, who did not undergo intraoperative cholangiography, developed symptomatic choledocholithiasis and required ERCP. There were no choledocholithiasis- or ERCP-related complications.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that choledocholithiasis occurs frequently in children and that spontaneous passage of common bile duct stones is common. This could explain the relatively high incidence of gallstone pancreatitis. Conservative management of choledocholithiasis is successful in the majority of patients. Routine preoperative or postoperative ERCP is usually not indicated."

OBJECTIVE: To identify external signs of trauma that would assist medical crews in recognizing blast lung injury (BLI) and effectively triaging salvageable and nonsalvageable victims.
DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of all 15 suicide bombing attacks that occurred in Israel from April 1994 to August 1997.
SETTING: National survey.
PATIENTS: One hundred fifty-three victims died and 798 were injured as a result of 15 attacks. Medical records were reviewed for external signs of trauma, such as burns and penetrating injuries, and the presence of BLI. Main Outcome Measure The odds ratio for BLI and death.
RESULTS: Three settings were targeted: buses, semiconfined spaces, and open spaces. Sixty survivors (7.5%) suffered from BLI, which was more common in buses (37 of 260) than semiconfined spaces (14 of 279) and open spaces (9 of 259) (P<.001). Victims with BLI were more likely to suffer from penetrating injury to the head or torso, burns covering more than 10% of the body surface area, and skull fractures (odds ratios, 4, 11.6, and 55.8, respectively; P<.001). Victims who died at the scene were more likely to suffer from burns, open fractures, and amputations in comparison with survivors (odds ratios, 6.5, 18.6, and 50.1, respectively; P<.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Following a suicide bombing attack, external signs of trauma should be used to triage victims to the appropriate level of care both at the scene and in the hospital. Triage of salvageable and nonsalvageable victims should take into account the presence of amputations, burns, and open fractures."
15837939,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15837939/,"BACKGROUND: Obesity is associated with coronary artery calcification (CAC), a marker of the presence and extent of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis. Obesity adds incremental information in identifying those at higher risk of coronary heart disease to traditional risk factor assessment. The present study examined associations between obesity measures and progression of CAC in those at higher (> or =10%) and lower (<10%) 10-year coronary heart disease risk according to the Framingham risk equation.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, 443 asymptomatic white individuals >30 years of age (243 men) had baseline and follow-up CAC measurements an average of 8.9 years apart. Multivariable linear regression models were fit to determine associations of obesity measures at baseline with progression of CAC defined as log(e) of the difference between follow-up and baseline CAC area plus 1 divided by time (in years) between examinations, adjusting for baseline CAC quantity, age, sex, baseline hypertension status, and baseline cholesterol level. Among 329 participants (74.3%) in the lower-risk group, waist circumference (P=0.024), waist-to-hip ratio (P<0.001), body mass index (P=0.036), and being overweight compared with being underweight or of normal weight (P=0.008) were each significantly positively associated with progression of CAC. Among those at higher coronary heart disease risk, no baseline obesity measures were associated with CAC progression.
CONCLUSIONS: Various measures of obesity were associated with increased progression of CAC in those at lower risk of coronary heart disease. Future studies examining the effectiveness of weight reduction strategies in reducing CAC progression among those with an otherwise favorable risk factor profile may be warranted."
15837969,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15837969/,"PURPOSE: Familial clustering of endometrial carcinoma (EC) may occur as part of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), a multiorgan cancer syndrome with mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency. Clustering of EC alone, termed as familial site-specific EC, may constitute a separate entity. Because its genetic basis is unknown, our purpose was to characterize such families molecularly.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-three families with site-specific EC were identified among 519 consecutive patients diagnosed with EC during 1986 to 1997. Tumor tissues were examined for MMR protein expression by immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis, and MMR genes pinpointed by IHC changes were screened for germline mutations by exon-by-exon sequencing, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, and direct tests for mutations common in the population.
RESULTS: Among 33 ECs from 23 families, MLH1 protein was lost in seven tumors (21%), MSH2 together with MSH6 was lost in four tumors (12%), and MSH6 alone was lost in five tumors (15%). A truncating germline mutation in MSH6 (3261insC) was identified in one family and a likely pathogenic missense mutation in MSH2 (D603N) was identified in another family. Among the original 519 patients, nine (all with colon cancer in the family) were diagnosed with HNPCC at the outset-six with MLH1 and three with MSH2 mutations.
CONCLUSION: Our study gives a minimum overall frequency of 2.1% (11 of 519) for germline MMR defects ascertained through EC in the index patients. The fact that only two of 23 families with site-specific EC (8.7%) had germline mutations in MMR genes suggests another as yet unknown etiology in most families with site-specific EC."
15838408,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15838408/,"BACKGROUND: Health care delivery varies with the level of managed care activity (MCA) in an area, potentially affecting health care for those not participating in managed care programs. However, the extent to which MCA is associated with the use of cancer screening by fee-for-service beneficiaries (FFS) is unclear.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to study colorectal cancer screening among Medicare FFS beneficiaries in relation to levels of Medicare MCA.
RESEARCH DESIGN: This study linked 1999 Medicare denominator and Part B claims data with the 1998 Area Resource File. After categorizing MCA as low (<10%), moderate (10-29.99%), or high (> or =30%), we assessed the association between colorectal cancer screening among FFS beneficiaries and MCA, controlling for individual demographic variables and county-level attributes of socioeconomic status and physician resources.
SUBJECTS: We included Medicare FFS beneficiaries 65 years of age or older with both Part A and Part B coverage for the entire calendar year from large counties in the study.
MEASURES: We measured the likelihood of undergoing fecal occult blood testing (FOBT), flexible sigmoidoscopy (FLEX), or colonoscopy (COL).
RESULTS: Compared with Medicare FFS beneficiaries residing in counties with low MCA, those in high MCA counties were significantly more likely to undergo FOBT (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.16), FLEX (AOR 1.11, 95% CI 1.04-1.18), or colonoscopy, after receiving FOBT/FLEX (AOR 1.07, 95% CI 1.02-1.13).
CONCLUSIONS: From a public health perspective, an association between higher levels of MCA and colorectal cancer screening among those not enrolled in managed care may translate into modest increases in use of colorectal cancer screening and possibly earlier detection."
15839110,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15839110/,"PURPOSE: To investigate whether ultrasound can stimulate osteoconduction in the mandible, an attempt was made to stimulate the osteoconductive process with low-intensity pulsed ultrasound in rats.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 64 rats, a 5.0-mm diameter circular mandibular defect was made in the ramus and, subsequently, covered on both sides with collagen membranes. Two groups were studied, an ultrasound treatment group and a placebo treatment group. At 2 and 4 weeks, the remaining defect area was measured using microradiographs, and the amount of osteoconduction was expressed as the percentage of defect closure.
RESULTS: At 2 and 4 weeks, there was no significant difference in the percentage of defect closure between the groups.
DISCUSSION: An explanation may be that ultrasound does not exert an effect in an area where wound healing is already expected to be at an optimal level.
CONCLUSION: There was no evidence that low-intensity pulsed ultrasound stimulates osteoconduction in a bone defect in the rat mandible that is covered by a collagen membrane."
15839870,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15839870/,"OBJECTIVES: To assess, whether the EORTC questionnaires QLQ-C30 and QLQ-H&N35 give enough detailed information to study specific quality of life (QoL) related issues in laryngectomized individuals.
DESIGN: Multicentre, prospective clinical trial; baseline measurement with EORTC questionnaires and an additional questionnaire, focusing on specific postlaryngectomy problems.
SETTING: Head and Neck Department of one Comprehensive Cancer Center and three Academic Medical Hospitals in the Netherlands.
PARTICIPANTS: Eighty laryngectomized individuals, selected to participate in a prospective clinical trial on hands-free tracheoesophageal speech.
MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Comparison of QoL dimensions, as assessed with the standard EORTC questionnaires, with the information obtained with additional questions, aimed at discovering in more detail, e.g. voice and respiratory problems in laryngectomized individuals.
RESULTS: Based on the EORTC QoL questionnaires a good overall and voice specific QoL-level was found. However, the additional questionnaire showed that especially concerning voice and respiration more specific information was obtained. For example, despite an overall satisfaction with many aspects of the voice in more than three-quarters of the patients, speaking in a noisy environment was reported by 63% of the patients as being a serious problem, and a significant relation could be established between pulmonary and voicing problems (r = 0.28, P < 0.05), something also undetectable with the EORTC questionnaires.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings underline the necessity to develop and use more specific additional questionnaires as an adjunct to the existing EORTC questionnaires, when studying specific symptoms in laryngectomized individuals, especially in order to detect intervention related changes over time."
15839872,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15839872/,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of hyoscine butyl bromide (buscopan) in relieving oesophageal meat bolus obstruction.
DESIGN: Retrospective review of case notes.
SETTING: Secondary otorhinolaryngology care.
PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-nine patients who presented to the Accidents & Emergency department satisfying, inclusion criteria: (i) >or=16 years old, (ii) patients with only meat bolus obstruction and (iii) had either only buscopan or no medications. Exclusion criteria were: (i) <16 years of age, (ii) patients who received any medications other than or in addition to buscopan, (iii) other foreign body obstructions and (iv) any patient in whom the approximate time of resolution of obstruction was not documented.
RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients with 31 episodes of obstruction were analysed. Twenty-two episodes were treated with buscopan and in 18 (82%) the obstruction was relieved. Two had spontaneous relief >24 h later and two had surgical disimpaction. In nine episodes, where no medications were given, seven (78%) cleared spontaneously and two had surgical removal. Fisher's exact test failed to show any significant difference between the two groups. The study groups were too small and power calculation showed that the number required for statistically validated result would be 140 in each group.
CONCLUSION: Routine use of buscopan in oesophageal obstruction especially in the upper two-thirds needs to be reviewed because of the possibility of side-effects and lack of objective evidence of its efficacy."
15839915,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15839915/,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the role of a digital rectal examination (DRE) in the clinical diagnosis of prostate cancer and in predicting the pathological stage, as the diagnosis of early prostate cancer usually comprises prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, a DRE and transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS)-guided biopsies.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Over the 4 years between 2000 and 2004, 408 consecutive patients (mean age 63.8 years) referred with age-specific PSA levels of 2.5-10.0 ng/mL and who had a TRUS-guided 12-core prostate biopsy were included in the study. They had a DRE by either of two experienced consultant urologists. The results of the DRE and core biopsy histology were compared with the histology and the radical prostatectomy specimen in a subset (82 men) of the study population.
RESULTS: Cancer was detected on biopsy in 152 patients; of the 196 with an abnormal DRE, 47% had cancer on biopsy. In the patients with a normal DRE, 59 cancers were detected. Men with cancer were older and had a higher median PSA level. There was no correlation between the DRE and biopsy findings, and none between an abnormal DRE and histological diagnosis of cancer. Of the patients who had a radical prostatectomy, 38% had a normal DRE.
CONCLUSION: There was no correlation between the DRE, biopsy findings and pathological staging. The DRE did not contribute to managing patients with prostate cancer, but this does not mean that there is no longer a place for the DRE in assessing the urological patient. If patients are appropriately counselled before PSA testing, a DRE may not be essential for patients with a PSA level of 2.5-10 ng/mL."
15839932,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15839932/,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether there is any association between urinary or fecal incontinence and childhood bedwetting, and given such a relationship, to detect which type of urinary incontinence (UI) is associated with childhood bedwetting.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In all, 1021 patients who were admitted to the outpatient gynaecology clinics of the authors' institution for an annual gynaecological examination were included in this descriptive clinical study. A simple multi-choice screening questionnaire was used to collect data for analysis.
RESULTS: There was a history of bedwetting in childhood in 181 (21.1%) of women without and in 48 (29.6%) of those with UI; the difference was significant (chi-square, P < 0.05). Women with stress UI had significantly higher rates of enuresis in childhood (35.4%) than those without UI (21.1%; P = 0.003). Of women who had a history of bedwetting in childhood, 12.2% had stress UI, but only 6.4% of those with no such history had stress UI. Fecal incontinence was significantly more common in women with a history of bedwetting in childhood (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: A history of childhood bedwetting seems to increase the risk of having UI, stress UI and fecal incontinence. Being aware of this association may provide an opportunity to avoid exposing these women to additional risk factors for these condition."
15839967,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15839967/,"BACKGROUND: A case series of inverted papilloma of the urinary bladder and urethra is presented, together with a review of the literature with respect to multiplicity, recurrence rate and association with transitional cell carcinoma, and a discussion on surveillance of the lesion.
METHODS: Cases of inverted papilloma of the lower urinary tract in a single centre were reviewed. Patient and tumour characteristics, recurrence and associated transitional cell carcinoma are reported.
RESULTS: Twenty patients were included (18 male, two female). The mean age was 60.8 years (range 35-78 years). All had solitary tumours ranging from 3 mm to 30 mm in size. Median cystoscopic follow up was 30 months (range 2-140 months). There was no recurrence. One patient was associated with subsequent transitional cell carcinoma 44 and 76 months later. Together with the present 20 cases, review of the English literature with respect to inverted papilloma of the lower urinary tract identified a total of 322 cases reported, with a recurrence rate of 3.85%. Moreover, 1.55%, 5.90% and 1.54% were associated with previous, simultaneous and subsequent transitional cell carcinoma, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Recurrence is not uncommon and risk of subsequent transitional cell carcinoma is not rare, such that non-invasive surveillance with flexible cystoscopy is recommended for inverted papilloma of the lower urinary tract."
15839984,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15839984/,"PURPOSE: Modified TEI index is pointed to be more effective in the evaluation of global cardiac functions compared to systolic and diastolic measurements alone. We planned to determine its applicability in hypertension and relation with left ventricular mass index (LVMI).
METHODS: We studied 48 patients with mild/moderate hypertension and normal coronary angiograms. In total 22 patients (12 men, 10 women, mean age: 55 +/- 6) with normal LVMI were studied in group I, 26 patients (12 men, 14 women, mean age: 57 +/- 7) with increased LVMI in group II, and 20 patients (10 men, 10 women, mean age: 53 +/- 7) with normal blood pressure as a control group. Standard 2D, Doppler, and mitral annulus pulse wave tissue Doppler were used for all measurements. Modified TEI index was calculated as diastolic time interval measured from end of Am wave to origin of Em (a') minus systolic Sm duration (b') divided by b(a'-b'/b').
RESULTS: Modified TEI index was significantly higher in both groups than normal group and in group II than in group I. (
CONTROL GROUP: 0.33 +/- 0.05, group I: 0.51 +/- 0.17, group II: 0.68 +/- 0.16, P< 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Modified TEI index, a marker of left ventricular systolic and diastolic functions, is impaired in hypertensives before hypertrophy develops and impairment is more prominent in hypertrophy. Therefore, (1) modified TEI index in hypertensives is a safe, feasible, and sensitive index for evaluation of global ventricular functions. (2) Evaluation of hypertensives with this index periodically may guide interventions directed toward saving systolic and diastolic functions. (3) Modified TEI index is gaining importance as a complementary parameter to standard Doppler or in cases where standard Doppler has its limitations."
15840014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15840014/,"BACKGROUND: The number of individuals initiating renal replacement therapy in the United States population grew exponentially over the past two decades. Cases of end-stage renal diseae (ESRD) attributed to diabetes accounted for most of this increase. In this report we examined factors that may account for the increase to determine whether it truly represents an epidemic of ESRD due to diabetes.
METHODS: We reviewed time trends in data of the United States Renal Data system, the Diabetes Surveillance Program of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and diabetes literature.
RESULTS: Recent growth of the number of individuals with diabetes accounted for less than 10% of the increase in the number of diabetes-related ESRD. Instead, most of it was due to a threefold increase in risk of ESRD in people with diabetes and, therefore, qualifies as an epidemic. Curiously, this epidemic occurred despite widening implementation of effective renoprotective therapies. Individuals with type 2 diabetes, regardless of gender, age, or race, experienced the greatest increase in risk. There is no evidence that diabetic patients have been surviving longer, so the increased risk was not attributable to the high risk associated with long duration diabetes.
CONCLUSION: We hypothesize that an epidemic of ESRD has occurred in people with diabetes in the United States population over the last two decades. The nature of the factor responsible for the epidemic and the reasons it affects patients with type 2 diabetes particularly are unknown. Research efforts to identify the putative factor deserve high priority, as does a commitment of resources to provide care for the burgeoning number of patients with ESRD and type 2 diabetes."
15840173,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15840173/,"BACKGROUND: A sharp reduction in heroin supply in Australia in 2001 was followed by a large but transient increase in cocaine use among injecting drug users (IDU) in Sydney. This paper assesses whether the increase in cocaine use among IDU was accompanied by increased rates of violent crime as occurred in the United States in the 1980s. Specifically, the paper aims to examine the impact of increased cocaine use among Sydney IDU upon police incidents of robbery with a weapon, assault and homicide.
METHODS: Data on cocaine use among IDU was obtained from the Illicit Drug Reporting System (IDRS). Monthly NSW Police incident data on arrests for cocaine possession/use, robbery offences, homicides, and assaults, were obtained from the Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research. Time series analysis was conducted on the police data series where possible. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with representatives from law enforcement and health agencies about the impacts of cocaine use on crime and policing.
RESULTS: There was a significant increase in cocaine use and cocaine possession offences in the months immediately following the reduction in heroin supply. There was also a significant increase in incidents of robbery where weapons were involved. There were no increases in offences involving firearms, homicides or reported assaults.
CONCLUSION: The increased use of cocaine among injecting drug users following the heroin shortage led to increases in violent crime. Other States and territories that also experienced a heroin shortage but did not show any increases in cocaine use did not report any increase in violent crimes. The violent crimes committed did not involve guns, most likely because of its stringent gun laws, in contrast to the experience of American cities that have experienced high rates of cocaine use and violent crime."
15840466,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15840466/,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to (1) determine how often implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) system modifications were needed to obtain an adequate safety margin for defibrillation, (2) identify how often and for what indications defibrillation threshold (DFT) testing was not performed, and (3) identify factors predicting the need for modification.
BACKGROUND: Ventricular fibrillation (VF) typically is induced at the time of ICD insertion. Although DFT testing often is minimized, a safety margin of 10 J has been utilized as a standard of care. However, current devices offer technology such as biphasic waveforms and high outputs, and the need for testing has been questioned.
METHODS: We reviewed the records of the last 1,139 patients undergoing initial ICD placement, generator replacement, or revision.
RESULTS: Seventy-one patients (6.2%) were identified as having an unacceptably high DFT (<10 J safety margin) requiring intervention, and some required >1 modification. Use of a high-output device alone was not enough to obtain an adequate DFT in 48% (34/71) of patients who required modifications (3% of the total population). No arrhythmia inductions were performed in 54 patients (4.7%) because of well-defined clinical conditions. Patients who required system modification had a lower ejection fraction, were younger, were less likely to have coronary artery disease, were more likely to be undergoing upgrade/generator replacement, and were more likely to be taking amiodarone. Long-term mortality was not different between the group of patients who required modification compared with those who did not (17% vs 20%, P = NS).
CONCLUSIONS: Routine VF induction and documentation of effective defibrillation still remains a reasonable part of ICD placement because an inadequate safety margin may occur in >6% of patients. The incidence of patients who were inappropriate for testing based on well-defined clinical conditions is small (<5%) in this unselected large series. Although some clinical features may predict the need for system modification, additional studies are needed to better define ""acceptable efficacy"" of ICDs in preventing sudden death prior to altering these standards in selected patients."
15840623,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15840623/,"AIMS: The CAPTIM study randomized patients managed within 6 h of acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction to primary angioplasty or prehospital fibrinolysis (rt-PA), with immediate transfer to a centre with interventional facilities. It found a similar incidence of the primary endpoint of death, recurrent MI, or stroke at 30 days with both strategies. We report here the outcome in the diabetic subgroup.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The relationship of diabetic status (diabetics, n=103, non-diabetics, n=731) and treatment strategy with the occurrence of the primary endpoint and of death was analysed. Compared with non-diabetics, diabetics had a higher baseline risk profile, a higher rate of the primary endpoint (14.6 vs. 5.6%; P=0.002), and a high rate of mortality (8.7 vs. 3.1%; P=0.01) at 30 days. The incidence of the primary endpoint tended to be higher in diabetics randomized to prehospital fibrinolysis compared with those randomized to primary angioplasty [21.7 vs. 8.8% (10/46 vs. 5/57); RR: 2.47 (0.91-6.74); P=0.09]. This difference was driven by the higher mortality in the fibrinolysis group [13.0 vs. 5.3% (6/46 vs. 3/57); RR: 2.47 (0.7-9.4); P=0.29]. For non-diabetics, no such trend was observed. Compared with non-diabetics, diabetics had a much higher rate of rescue angioplasty (41.4 vs. 23.5%; P=0.01) and a higher mortality after rescue angioplasty [17.4 vs. 0% (4/23 vs. 0/90); P=0.001].
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that diabetic patients presenting within 6 h of an acute myocardial infarction may derive particular benefit from a strategy of primary angioplasty. However, the small number of diabetic patients in this subgroup analysis does not allow a final conclusion and a specifically designed study is warranted."
15840736,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15840736/,"BACKGROUND: Platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptors play an inevitable role in platelet aggregation. The GP IIIa gene is polymorphic (PlA1/PlA2) and the presence of a PlA2 allele might be associated with an increased risk for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
OBJECTIVE: To examine the prevalence of the PlA2 allele in patients with ACS and in subjects with or without aspirin resistance.
METHODS: The prevalence of the PlA2 allele was assessed in 158 patients with ACS and PlA2 compared with its prevalence in 199 healthy volunteers. The antiplatelet efficacy of aspirin was examined in all patients with ACS, as well as in 69 individuals who had suffered ischemic stroke and in 58 high-risk subjects without any known ischemic vascular events.
RESULTS: PlA2 prevalence was significantly higher in patients with ACS (59/158) than in the control group (51/199; p < 0.05). Carriers of the PlA2 allele had a significantly higher risk of developing ACS, even after an adjustment to the risk factors (OR 5.74; 95% CI 1.75 to 18.8; p = 0.004). The occurrence of the PlA2 allele was significantly higher among patients with aspirin resistance than in subjects who demonstrated an appropriate response to the drug (allele frequencies, 0.21 vs 0.14; p < 0.05). All patients homozygous for the PlA2 allele had an inadequate platelet response to aspirin.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the hypothesis that carriers of the PlA2 allele might have an increased risk for ACS. PlA2 homozygosity was associated with an inadequate response to aspirin therapy. Our data further suggest that patients with PlA2 allele homozygosity might benefit from antiplatelet therapy based on adenosine diphosphate antagonists throughout secondary treatment for prevention of ACS."
24299285,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24299285/,"INTRODUCTION: Diverticular disease management represents a very topical issue with many unanswered questions as yet. Laparoscopic lavage and drainage in patients with acute diverticulitis is one of the controversial areas. Miniinvasive approach presents a possible treatment alternative for CT-guided percutaneous drainage and also for radical colon resection in the form of Hartmanns procedure or resection with primary anastomosis. MATERIAL A METHODS: The authors aim was the evaluation of patients with Hinchey II, III or IV diverticulitis treated by laparoscopic lavage and drainage, or by laparoscopic suture of the perforation, in a retrospective cohort study. The inclusion criterion for the study was laparoscopic lavage and drainage indication in patients with Hinchey II, III or IV diverticulitis. The primary aim of the study was laparoscopic treatment evaluation focused on leakage, if applicable, and on postoperative morbidity and mortality.
RESULTS: During the study period (2007-2012), 12 patients operated on at our department (with a mean age of 71.7 years) were included into the study. The group comprised 7 men and 5 women with a BMI of 28.1 kg/m2. Laparoscopic exploration, lavage and drainage of the abdominal cavity with purulent peritonitis finding were performed in 10 patients. The site of bowel perforation was not located unambiguously in these patients. Two patients with faecal peritonitis and identified place of perforation underwent laparoscopic lavage, drainage and suture of the perforation. Postoperative leakage was not detected in any of the patients. The mean operating time was 65 minutes, postoperative morbidity reaching 27.7%, and postoperative mortality 0%. The mean length of hospital stay was 8.8 days. Elective laparoscopic resection was performed 6-15 weeks after the primary operation in 8 patients.
CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic exploration with thorough lavage, suture of the perforation and drainage presents a possible alternative in modern management of acute diverticulitis. The miniinvasive approach indication should be based both on careful, highly individualised and complex patient evaluation and on the departments experience."
24299424,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24299424/,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the differential response to amisulpride in patients with paranoid versus disorganized schizophrenia.
METHOD: We reanalyzed the original data from five different randomized drug trials comparing Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) scores in a database containing 427 paranoid and 296 disorganized patients with schizophrenia.
RESULTS: Both the disorganized and the paranoid group showed a substantial improvement of the BPRS total score within the first 4 weeks. In the paranoid group, mean (±SD) BPRS reduction was 16.9 (±14.6) (t = 24.06, df = 426, P < 0.001) and in the disorganized group 17.0 (±15.9) (t = 18.49, df = 295, P < 0.001). An analysis of covariance (ancova) controlling for BPRS at baseline and the influence of different trial protocols showed significant differences between diagnostic groups (F = 13.47, df = 1, P < 0.001), Cohen's D 0.31 (CI = 0.16-0.46). Paranoid patients improved by 4.8 BPRS points more than disorganized patients (adjusted means 18.90 (CI = 17.33-20.37) for the paranoid and 14.1 (CI = 12.04 - 16.11) for the disorganized group.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that amisulpride is effective in disorganized as well as in paranoid schizophrenia, but that symptom reduction in the disorganized subtype is less pronounced."
24299444,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24299444/,"AIM: To compare the risk of unplanned hospitalization in high-care nursing home residents taking Beers potentially inappropriate medications (PIM) against that of other elderly.
METHODS: Using an enhanced case-time-control design and conditional logistic regression applied to the pharmaceutical claims and other linked data of 245436 Western Australians aged ≥ 65 years (1993-2005), the study derived odds ratios for unplanned hospitalization in each group, from which attributable fractions, numbers, proportions and rates of PIM-related admissions were derived.
RESULTS: Overall, 383150 unplanned hospitalizations were identified. PIM exposure was associated with a similar proportional increase in unplanned hospitalizations in high-care nursing home residents as in other older people; adjusted OR 1.21 (95% CI 1.10-1.34; attributable fraction 17.5%) versus OR 1.19 (95% CI 1.16-1.21; attributable fraction 15.7%). However, high-care nursing home residents had much higher estimated rates of hospitalizations attributed to Beers medications than other elderly (3951 vs 1394 per 100000 person-years). The relative risk of unplanned hospitalization rose similarly in both groups with increasing numbers of different PIM taken (OR 5.1 for 10 vs 0 PIM), but was affected more markedly by 3-month PIM consumption in nursing home residents (OR 4.85, 95% CI 2.40-9.83 for 900 vs 0 PIM daily doses) than in other older adults (OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.73-2.55).
CONCLUSIONS: High-care nursing home residents do not appear to have a greater relative risk of unplanned hospitalization when given PIM, but do incur a higher absolute burden than other older adults. Physicians should exert caution with Beers medications in all older patients, restricting the number of different PIM and PIM quantity prescribed whenever possible."
24299921,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24299921/,"BACKGROUND: A busulfan concentration monitoring and dosing service has been provided by Christchurch Hospital since 1998. This study aimed to see (1) the percentage of patients with an area under the concentration time curve (AUC) outside the target range and had dose adjustment, (2) how busulfan clearance (CL) relates to body weight, and (3) if fewer samples could be used to predict doses.
METHODS: Blood samples were taken from patients after oral administration, usually at 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 6 hours, and after the start of a 2-hour intravenous (IV) infusion of busulfan, at 1, 2, 2.5, 3, 6, and 8 hours. Dose adjustment was made based on the AUC compared with the target range. The relationship of CL and body weight for the IV group was used to develop a revised IV dosing schedule. The bias and imprecision of AUCs estimated using fewer sampling points were examined to see if sampling could be economized.
RESULTS: Data were available for 150 patients but for 6 patients, data were incomplete and excluded. Of the remaining 144 patients (256 sample sets, 209 oral, 47 IV, 62% with repeats), 38% (IV) and 35% (oral) of patients had AUCs within the target range after the first dose. Dose adjustment was made in 47% and 34% of patients dosed IV and orally, respectively, after which there was a trend to more patients achieving the target AUC. A nonlinear relationship was found between CL and body weight. The initial IV dosing schedule was revised to take this into account. Sampling for busulfan concentration measurement at 3 points (2.5, 4, 8 hours) or 2 points (2.5, 8 hours) after the start of the infusion enabled accurate and precise estimates of AUC₀₋₂₄.
CONCLUSIONS: Around two thirds of patients treated with busulfan were outside the target AUC range after the first dose. Dose adjustment was made in 37% of patients. The relationship between CL and body weight was used to revise the initial IV dosing schedule. Sampling for AUC estimation could be reduced to 2 time points after IV dosing."
24299930,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24299930/,"BACKGROUND: Basic science studies suggest that perioperative immune impairment may augment the risk of cancer recurrence after otherwise potentially curative surgery. Despite its immunosuppressant properties, dexamethasone is commonly given to oncologic patients in an effort to reduce postoperative nausea and vomiting. We therefore tested the hypothesis that perioperative dexamethasone administration increases the risk of ovarian cancer recurrence.
METHODS: Women who had primary ovarian cytoreductive surgery between January 1997 and October 2007 were identified using a database maintained by the division of Gynecologic Oncology at Northwestern University. Tumor recurrence in women given perioperative systemic dexamethasone (4-10 mg) was compared with those who did not receive dexamethasone. The primary outcome was the propensity-matched time to cancer recurrence. Recurrence was defined by a carcinoantigen 125 >21 U/mL or computerized tomography evidence of the disease followed by tissue confirmation. Median difference and 95% confidence interval between the propensity-matched groups were calculated using a 10,000 sample bootstrap.
RESULTS: Among 260 women having primary cytoreductive surgery for ovarian cancer that met our inclusion criteria, 102 subjects were given perioperative systemic dexamethasone. Cancer recurrence was observed in 178 subjects, and the overall unadjusted median (IQR) time to recurrence was 18 (7-50) months. Eighty-seven cases and 87 controls were propensity matched to adjust for confounding covariates. After propensity matching the groups for confounding covariates, the median (IQR) time to recurrence in the dexamethasone group was 23 (6-46) compared with 18 (8-53) months in the control group (P = 0.63) with a median (95% confidence interval) difference of time to recurrence between the dexamethasone and the control group of 5 (-8 to 17) months.
CONCLUSION: We could not find evidence for an association between perioperative systemic dexamethasone administration and ovarian cancer recurrence after primary cytoreductive surgery. Our results do not support avoiding low-dose perioperative dexamethasone for prevention of postoperative nausea, vomiting, and pain in ovarian cancer patients."

However, it has the potential to introduce delays and corruption of information. The introduction of newer technologies to replace landlines, pagers and paper may ameliorate these issues.
AIM: To establish if the introduction of a Hospital at Night system supported by a wireless taskflow system affected the escalation of high Early Warning Scores (EWSs) to medical attention, and the time taken to medical review.
DESIGN: Prospective 'pre and post' observational study in a teaching hospital in the UK.
METHODS: Review of observation charts and medical records, and data extraction from the electronic taskflow system.
RESULTS: The implementation of a technology-supported Hospital at Night system was associated with a significant decrease in time to documentation of initial review in those who were reviewed. However, there was no change in the proportion of those with a high EWS that were reviewed, and throughout the study a majority of patients with high EWSs were not reviewed in accordance with guidelines.
CONCLUSION: Introduction of a Hospital at Night system supported by mobile technology appeared to improve the transfer of information, but did not affect the nursing decision whether to escalate abnormal findings."
24300320,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24300320/,"OBJECTIVES: Within health care, there are underserved groups. New Brunswick's French-speaking minority, which also mostly lives in rural communities, is one such group. A physician shortage potentially prevents this population from accessing health promotion and clinical prevention services. This study analyzes whether New Brunswick Francophone doctors with rural backgrounds are more likely than doctors from urban regions to set up practice in rural communities of the province.
METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to 390 New Brunswick Francophone physicians admitted in medicine between 1973 and 2000. It collected information on geographic origin and history of medical practice. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to identify whether a rural background is associated with the likelihood of ever and currently practicing in rural communities. We used the General Practice Rurality Index-simplified to quantify the rurality level of communities.
RESULTS: In total, 264 (67%) physicians participated. A rural background was positively associated with the establishment of a first medical practice in a rural community. This relationship was only significant among family physicians. There was no statistically significant relationship between rurality of community of origin and rurality of current community of practice among either family or specialty physicians.
CONCLUSION: Although Francophone doctors with a rural background were more likely than their urban counterparts to set up their first practice in a rural community, this effect was not sustained. This raises questions as to why they leave rural communities and highlights the importance of measures to retain doctors as a way to promote public health for underserved rural groups."
24300322,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24300322/,"OBJECTIVES: Language has been identified as a determinant of mental health. Within Canada, individuals may speak an official language and still belong within the linguistic minority (Francophones outside Quebec and Anglophones within Quebec). The objectives of this study were to compare mental health problems between minority and majority official language communities, and examine the association between official language minority and mental health problems.
METHODS: Data from the Canadian Community Health Survey, Cycle 1.2 were used to make two comparisons: Francophones to Anglophones within Quebec, and Francophones to Anglophones outside Quebec. Twelve-month and lifetime prevalences of mental disorders (major depressive episode, anxiety disorders, and alcohol/substance abuse/dependence) and mental health indices were compared. Logistic regression analysis examined whether official language minority status was a determinant of mental health.
RESULTS: Mental health between minority and majority language groups was similar. Official language minority status was not a significant determinant of mental health. Self-rated mental health indices varied between groups. In some cases, minority language groups reported lower levels of life satisfaction (minority Anglophones versus majority Francophones), while in other cases more majority Anglophones reported poor life satisfaction and mental health (majority Anglophones versus minority Francophones).
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, few differences were found between language groups, though variations in self-rated mental health indices were observed. In order to better understand the role of context in determining health outcomes, future research should examine mental health problems among official language minority groups provincially to help stakeholders in directing resources and programs to populations in most need."
24300443,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24300443/,"BACKGROUND: HIV infection and malaria co-infection is not uncommon among children in co-endemic regions, and evidence suggests that HIV is a risk factor for severe malaria among children. HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) are highly effective in pediatric HIV treatment regimens, however, their effectiveness against malaria has been mixed, with some PIs demonstrating in vitro activity against Plasmodium falciparum. Recent findings suggest lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r)-based treatment regimens reduce the incidence of malaria infection by over 40% in pediatric HIV patients compared to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based regimens.
METHODS: We assessed whether a significant reduction in malaria risk makes LPV/r-based ART regimens cost-effective compared to NNRTI-based regimens in co-endemic, low-resource settings. We modeled the difference in unit cost per disability adjusted life year (DALY) gained among two theoretical groups of HIV+ children under 5 years old receiving ART in a resource-limited setting co-endemic for malaria. The first group received standard NNRTI-based antiretrovirals, the second group received a standard regimen containing LPV/r. We used recent cohort data for the incidence reduction for malaria. Drug costs were taken from the 2011 Clinton Health Access Initiative Antiretroviral (ARV) ceiling price list. DALYs for HIV and malaria were derived from WHO estimates.
RESULTS: Our model suggests a unit cost of US$147 per DALY gained for the LPV/r-based group compared to US$37 per DALY gained for the NNRTI-based group.
CONCLUSION: In HIV and malaria co-endemic settings, considerations of PI cost effectiveness incorporating known reductions in malaria mortality suggest a nominal increase in DALYs gained for PIs over NNRTI-based regimens for HIV positive children under five on ART. Our analysis was based on several assumptions due to lack of sound data on malaria and HIV DALY attribution among pediatric populations. Further study in this area is required."
24300748,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24300748/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine if performance differences exist between male and female students on a 6-week obstetrics and gynecology (Ob/Gyn) clerkship and to evaluate potential variables that might underlie any observed variations.
STUDY DESIGN: Final clerkship grades and component scores (clinical evaluations, objective structured clinical examination [OSCE], oral examination, and National Board of Medical Examiners [NBME] subject examination) from July 2007 to June 2010 were matched by student and analyzed by gender. Basic science grade point average (GPA) and initial United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE) Step 1 scores were used to establish students' baseline medical knowledge. On a post-clerkship questionnaire, a subset of students reported the numbers of procedures they performed during the clerkship; students also completed online pre- and post-clerkship questionnaires reflecting their self-assessed confidence in women's health clinical skills.
RESULTS: Scores were analyzed for 136 women and 220 men. Final clerkship grades were significantly higher for females than for males (89.05 vs. 87.34, p=0.0004, η(2)=0.08). Specifically, females outscored males on the OSCE, oral, and NBME subject examination portions of the clerkship but not clinical evaluations. Males reported completing fewer breast examinations (p=0.001, η(2)=0.14). Pre-clerkship, males were significantly less confident than females in women's health clinical skills (p<0.01) but reached similar levels upon completion of the clerkship. No gender differences were detected for basic science GPA and USMLE Step 1 scores.
CONCLUSION: Student gender is associated with final grades on an Ob/Gyn clerkship. Further research regarding these differences should be explored."
24300989,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24300989/,"ABSTRACT OF REVIEWED ARTICLE: The warning-sign hierarchy between quantitative subcortical motor mapping and continuous motor evoked potential monitoring during resection of supratentorial brain tumors: clinical article.Seidel K, Beck J, Steiglitz L, Schucht P, Raabe A.J Neurosurg 2013; 118:287-296.
OBJECTIVE: Mapping and monitoring are believed to provide an early warning sign to determine when to stop tumor removal to avoid mechanical damage to the corticospinal tract (CST). The objective of this study was to systematically compare subcortical monopolar stimulation thresholds (1-20 mA) with direct cortical stimulation (DCS)-motor evoked potential (MEP) monitoring signal abnormalities and to correlate both with new postoperative motor deficits. The authors sought to define a mapping threshold and DCS-MEP monitoring signal changes indicating a minimal safe distance from the CST.
METHODS: A consecutive cohort of 100 patients underwent tumor surgery adjacent to the CST while simultaneous subcortical motor mapping and DCS-MEP monitoring were used. Evaluation was performed regarding the lowest subcortical mapping threshold (monopolar stimulation, train of 5 stimuli, interstimulus interval 4.0 milliseconds, pulse duration 500 microseconds) and signal changes in DCS-MEPs (same parameters, 4 contact strip electrode). Motor function was assessed 1 day after the surgery, at discharge, and at 3 months postoperatively.
RESULTS: The lowest individual motor thresholds (MTs) were as follows (MT in mA, number of patients): >20 mA, n = 12; 11 to 20 mA, n = 13; 6 to 10 mA, n = 20; 4 to 5 mA, n = 30; and 1 to 3 mA, n = 25. Direct cortical stimulation showed stable signals in 70 patients, unspecific changes in 18, irreversible alterations in 8, and irreversible loss in 4 patients. At 3 months, 5 patients had a postoperative new or worsened motor deficit (lowest mapping MT 20 mA, 13 mA, 6 mA, 3 mA, and 1 mA). In all 5 patients, DCS-MEP monitoring alterations were documented (2 sudden irreversible threshold increases and 3 sudden irreversible MEP losses). Of these 5 patients, 2 had vascular ischemic lesions (MT 20 mA, 13 mA) and 3 had mechanical CST damage (MT: 1 mA, 3 mA, and 6 mA; in the latter 2 cases, the resection continued after mapping and severe DCS-MEP alterations occurred thereafter). In 80% of patients with a mapping MT of 1 to 3 mA and in 75% of patients with a mapping MT of 1 mA, DCS-MEPs were stable or showed unspecific reversible changes, and none had a permanent motor worsening at 3 months. In contrast, 25% of patients with irreversible DCS-MEP changes and 75% of patients with irreversible DCS-MEP loss had permanent motor deficits.
CONCLUSIONS: Mapping should primarily guide tumor resection adjacent to the CST. Direct cortical stimulation-motor evoked potential is a useful predictor of deficits, but its value as a warning sign is limited because signal alterations were reversible in only approximately 60% of the present cases and irreversibility is a post hoc definition. The true safe mapping MT is lower than previously thought. The authors postulate a mapping MT of 1 mA or less where irreversible DCS-MEP changes and motor deficits regularly occur. Therefore, they recommend stopping tumor resection at an MT of 2 mA at the latest. The limited spatial and temporal coverage of contemporary mapping may increase error and may contribute to false, higher MTs."
24301519,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24301519/,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the screening accuracy of information obtained from parents of 4-5-year-old children for the purpose of identifying the children who have teacher-reported mental health problems when they are aged 6-7 years.
METHOD: The study used data from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC) obtained when children were aged 4-5 years and 6-7 years. The level of children's mental health problems was assessed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) completed by parents when children were aged 4-5 years and by teachers when children were aged 6-7 years (n=2163). When children were aged 4-5 years, parenting skills were assessed using three questionnaires developed for the parent-completed LSAC questionnaire and maternal mental health was assessed using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K6).
RESULTS: When the level of parent-reported childhood mental health problems at 4-5 years old was used to identify children with teacher-reported mental health problems (i.e. a score in the ""abnormal"" range of the teacher-reported SDQ Total Difficulties Scale) when the children were aged 6-7 years, sensitivity was 26.8%, positive predictive value was 22.8%, and specificity was 92.9%. The addition of further information about the characteristics of children and their parents made only a small improvement to screening accuracy.
CONCLUSIONS: Targeted interventions for preschool children may have the potential to play an important role in reducing the prevalence of mental health problems during the early school years. However, current capacity to accurately identify preschoolers who will experience teacher-reported mental health problems during the early school years is limited."
24302587,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24302587/,"PURPOSE: Wider retinal venular caliber is shown to be associated with an increased risk of stroke, and smoking is associated with a wider retinal venular caliber. However, the impact of smoking cessation on the retinal vessels has not been previously reported. We examined this issue in an adult cohort of atomic bomb survivors.
METHODS: In the Adult Health Study of Japanese atomic bomb survivors, 1664 subjects had retinal photographs taken from 2006 to 2008. The central retinal artery and vein equivalents (CRAE and CRVE) were calculated using a semiautomated software program. Multiple surveys have assessed the effects of smoking since 1963. The associations between smoking, the time since cessation, and the retinal vessel caliber were determined using linear mixed effects models.
RESULTS: The CRVE was associated with an increased number of cigarettes smoked per day among women after adjusting for potential confounding factors (age, sex, blood pressure, hypertensive medications, white blood cell count, diabetes, body mass index, lipids, and radiation dose). Females who smoked 10 cigarettes per day had a 6.9-μm wider mean CRVE (P = 0.001) than nonsmokers. Females who had stopped smoking for 10 or more years had a mean CRVE similar to those who had never smoked (191.8 vs. 194.4 μm; P = 0.23). These associations were not observed in males or for CRAE.
CONCLUSIONS: Wider retinal venular caliber is associated with smoking in Japanese females; however, this association becomes nonsignificant after 10 or more years of smoking cessation, suggesting that the impact of smoking on retinal venular dilation is reversible following long-term smoking cessation."

METHODS: We recruited 60 African-American adults with type 2 diabetes who completed a 2.5-year empowerment-based diabetes self-management education and support intervention. Primary healthcare use outcomes included acute care visits, non-acute care visits and days lost to disability. Acute care was a composite score calculated from the frequency of urgent care visits, emergency department visits and hospitalizations. Non-acute care measured the frequency of scheduled outpatient visits. To examine change in patterns of healthcare use, we compared the frequency of healthcare visits over the 6-month period preceding the intervention with that in the last 6 months of the intervention.
RESULTS: No significant changes in patterns of healthcare use were found for acute care, non-acute care or days lost to disability. Multiple regression models found higher levels of depression (P = 0.001) to be associated with a greater number of non-acute healthcare visits, and found longer duration of diabetes (P = 0.019) and lower levels of diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.025) to be associated with fewer days lost to disability.

METHODS: Frequencies and levels of involvement in interactions with classmates were observed and compared in 22 students with ASD and 84 of their classmates in mainstream schools, using a standardized protocol. Self-reported participation measurements regarding interactions with classmates and teachers from five questionnaire items were correlated with the observations. In total, 51,516 data points were coded and entered into the analyses, and correlated with 530 questionnaire ratings.

DATA SOURCE/STUDY SETTING: Health insurance claims data under a universal coverage system in Taiwan.
STUDY DESIGN: Seven years of longitudinal analysis was performed to examine the association between medication adherence of oral antihyperglycemic drugs and outcomes among patients with newly diagnosed T2DM. Generalized estimating equations were conducted to assess the temporal relationship while controlling for unobserved characteristics of patients.
RESULTS: Better medication adherence was associated with decreased hospitalization and emergency department (ED) visits for diabetes or related conditions. The results also revealed that medication adherence was negatively associated with the expenses of hospitalization and ED visits for diabetes or related conditions, but medication adherence was positively associated with patients' total healthcare expenses. However, the adherence-related differences in total healthcare expenses began to decrease 5 years after the time of diabetes onset.
CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to medication can improve healthcare outcomes but is associated with higher total healthcare expenses, especially during the years immediately following the onset of diabetes. Long-term follow-up is needed for further investigation."
24305508,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24305508/,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies suggested an impaired endothelial function in patients with diabetes. However, the validity of this finding may be limited by the lack of adequate adjustment for further cardiovascular confounders. We assessed endothelial function as measured by flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery in patients with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes in comparison with non-diabetic controls.
METHODS: The study population comprised 1487 subjects including 122 subjects with type 2 diabetes, aged 25 to 85, from the population-based Study of Health in Pomerania, and 65 outpatients, aged 23 to 75, with type 1 diabetes. FMD measurements were performed using standardized ultrasound techniques. Subjects with type 1 and type 2 diabetes were matched 1:4 to healthy controls using propensity score matching.
RESULTS: Neither type 1 diabetes (β = 0.142; SE = 0.568, p = 0.803) nor type 2 diabetes (β = 0.107; SE = 0.340, p = 0.752) were significantly associated with FMD in comparison with their non-diabetic controls after adjustment for major cardiovascular confounders like age, gender, body mass index, smoking status, hypertension, antihypertensive medication, LDL and HDL cholesterol levels.
CONCLUSIONS: In this population-based study comparing adjusted FMD values of diabetic individuals with adequately matched controls, propensity score analyses revealed no association between diabetes and endothelial function. Since these findings are in discordance with the majority of previous reports, we suggest performing similar analyses using data from other population-based studies."

METHODS: Four focus groups of 34 women were conducted. Discussions were transcribed verbatim and transcripts were analyzed separately by two investigators using an immersion-and-crystallization approach. Common risk factors were identified by consensus.
RESULTS: Participants were predominantly African American (82%) women of low income (77% with a household income <$20,000/year). Common risk factors included family history, environmental factors, trauma, and sexual activity. There also was a perception that breast cancer grows rapidly and causes detectable symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: Women voiced some accurate and numerous inaccurate beliefs regarding the causes of breast cancer, suggesting a lack of knowledge about the potential benefits and harms of screening mammography before undergoing examination. These findings highlight the importance of identifying women's underlying beliefs when initiating a discussion of breast cancer screening and prevention to ensure that messages are mutually understood."
24305597,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24305597/,"BACKGROUND: In 2010 more than 7.7 million children died before their fifth birthday. Over 98% of these deaths occurred in developing countries, and recent estimates have attributed hundreds of thousands of these deaths to suboptimal breastfeeding.
METHODS: This study estimated prevalence of suboptimal breastfeeding for 137 developing countries from 1990 to 2010. These estimates were compared against WHO infant feeding recommendations and combined with effect sizes from existing literature to estimate associated disease burden using a standard comparative risk assessment approach. These prevalence estimates were disaggregated by wealth quintile and linked with child mortality rates to assess how improved rates of breastfeeding may affect child health inequalities.
RESULTS: In 2010, the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding ranged from 3.5% in Djibouti to 77.3% in Rwanda. The proportion of child Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) attributable to suboptimal breastfeeding is 7.6% at the global level and as high as 20.2% in Swaziland. Suboptimal breastfeeding is a leading childhood risk factor in all developing countries and consistently ranks higher than water and sanitation. Within most countries, breastfeeding prevalence rates do not vary considerably across wealth quintiles.
CONCLUSIONS: Breastfeeding is an effective child health intervention that does not require extensive health system infrastructure. Improvements in rates of exclusive and continued breastfeeding can contribute to the reduction of child mortality inequalities in developing countries."

METHODS: Between 1986 and 2001, we assessed 551 patients who underwent thyroidectomy with prophylactic ipsilateral central compartment neck dissection, and 409 patients were followed-up completely. Thyroid lobectomy were performed in 281 and 128 patients, respectively. The patients were divided into two groups according to CLN metastasis. Clinicopathological profiles and follow-up details were investigated by retrospective chart review.
RESULTS: The CLN-positive and -negative groups were comprised of 43 (15.2 %) and 238 patients (84.8 %), respectively. The mean ages of the two groups were not significantly different (p > 0.05). The mean tumor size of the CLN-positive group (6.8 mm) was significantly larger than that of the CLN-negative group (5.6 mm; p < 0.05). Microscopic capsular invasion was significantly higher in the CLN-positive group (51.2 vs. 23.9 %; p < 0.05). Overall, 21 patients (7.4 %, 21/281) experienced recurrence. Among these, 2 (4.7 %, 2/43) and 19 (8.0 %, 19/238) were in the CLN-positive and -negative groups, respectively. There was no significant correlation between CLN metastasis and tumor recurrence.
CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative recurrence was lower in the CLN-positive group, and there was no significant correlation between CLN metastasis and tumor recurrence. Our results suggest that it is not necessary to perform completion thyroidectomy for PTMC patients who have undergone thyroid lobectomy and who have been pathologically diagnosed with CLN metastasis."
24306123,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24306123/,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate currently preferred treatment strategies as well as the acceptance of new arthroscopic techniques among German orthopaedic surgeons. We assumed that surgeons specialized in shoulder surgery and arthroscopy would treat acute acromioclavicular joint dislocations different to non-specialized surgeons.
METHODS: Seven hundred and ninety-six orthopaedic and/or trauma departments were found through the German hospital directory of 2012. Corresponding websites were searched for the email address of the chair of shoulder surgery (if applicable) or the department. Seven hundred forty-six emails with the request for study participation including a link to an online survey of 36 questions were sent. In 60 emails, the recipient was unknown.
RESULTS: Two hundred and three (30 %) surgeons participated in the survey. one hundred and one were members of the AGA (German-speaking Society for Arthroscopy and Joint-Surgery) and/or of the DVSE (German Association of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery) and regarded as specialists, while 102 were non-members and regarded as non-specialists. According to the treatment of Rockwood I/II and IV-VI injuries, no significant differences were found. Seventy-four % of non-specialists and 67 % of specialists preferred surgical treatment for Rockwood III injuries (P = 0.046). Non-specialists would use the hook plate in 56 % followed by the TightRope in 16 %; specialists would use the TightRope in 38 % followed by the hook plate in 32 % (P = 0.004).
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of German orthopaedic and trauma surgeons advise surgical treatment for Rockwood III injuries. Specialists recommend surgery less often. Non-specialists prefer the hook plate, whereas specialists prefer the arthroscopic TightRope technique.

24306164,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24306164/,"PURPOSE: The global incidence of spinal cord injuries varies with the developed world having improved survival and 1 year mortality in a poly-trauma setting. This improved survival has been estimated at 20 % in a recent Cochrane review of Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS).The aim of this audit is to evaluate the management of patients with suspected spinal cord injury by the trauma and orthopaedic team in three centres in South Wales.
METHODS: A retrospective case note review of the secondary survey was performed. Inclusion criteria were patients 18 years and above, with poly-trauma and presenting to Accident and Emergency department at the treating hospital. We used ATLS guidelines as an audit tool and reviewed the documentation of key components of the secondary assessment.
RESULTS: Forty-nine patients were included (29 males, 20 females) with an average age of 53.7 years (19-92 years). We found that completion of all components of the secondary survey for spinal injury was poor, 29 % receiving a digital per rectal examination despite suspected spinal injury. Paralysis level was not documented in 20.4 % of patients. Medical Research Council grade was only documented in 24.5 % although was assessed in 73.5 %.

24306424,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24306424/,"OBJECTIVES: In mass casualty incidents (MCI) a large number of patients need to be evaluated and treated fast. Well-designed radiological guidelines can save lives. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) radiological guidelines in the MCI of an aeroplane crash.
METHODS: Medical data of all 126 survivors of an aeroplane crash were analysed. Data included type and body region of the radiological studies performed on the survivors, Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS) and Injury Severity Score (ISS) codes and trauma care level of the hospitals.
RESULTS: Ninety patients (72 %) underwent one or more imaging studies: in total 297 radiographs, 148 CTs and 18 ultrasounds were performed. Only 18 % received diagnostic imaging of all four body regions as recommended by ATLS. Compliance with ATLS was highest (73.3 %) in severely injured victims (ISS ≥16); this group underwent two thirds of the (near) total body CTs, all performed in level I trauma centres.
CONCLUSION: Overall compliance with ATLS radiological guidelines was low, although high in severely injured patients. Level I trauma centres frequently used (near) total body CT. Deviation from ATLS guidelines in radiological work-up in less severely injured patients can be safe and did not result in delayed diagnosis of serious injury.
KEY POINTS: • Radiological imaging protocols can assist the management of mass casualty incidents needs. • Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) radiological guidelines have been developed. • But radiological guidelines have not frequently been applied in aeroplane crashes. • Aircraft accidents are of high energy so ATLS guidelines should be applied. • Following mass casualty incidents total body CT seems appropriate within ATLS protocols."

Clinical variables included preoperative laboratories and imaging, extent of neck exploration, number of glands excised, and intraoperative parathyroid hormone levels during surgery.
RESULTS: There were 374 (70 %) patients in the younger age group (YG) and 163 (30 %) patients in the older age group (OG). The mean age was 50 ± 0.5 and 71 ± 0.4 years, respectively. There was no difference between the groups in terms of gender or laboratory results. MGD was significantly more common in the OG (24 % vs. 12 %; p = 0.001) and similarly MIP was less commonly completed in the OG (49 % vs. 68 %; p < 0.001). Cure rates were comparable between the OG and YG (93 % vs. 95 %; p = 0.27). In the OG, patients with MGD had significantly smaller glands as compared to patients with single adenomas in this group (331 ± 67 vs. 920 ± 97 mg; p = 0.006, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: MGD in PHPT was found to be more prevalent in older patients. Planning a bilateral neck exploration should be considered in older patients, especially when a relatively small gland is suggested by imaging or encountered during surgery."
24307340,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24307340/,"INTRODUCTION: Quality assurance in psychosomatic medicine in Austria is currently based on a voluntary continuing medical education programme in psychosocial, psychosomatic and psychotherapeutic medicine. It is questionable whether psychosomatic care can be sufficiently provided in this manner. In addition, a broadly based proposal to create a subspecialty in psychosomatic medicine in order to facilitate quality assurance, is investigated.
METHODS: The necessity to reorganize psychosomatic care was explored through semi-structured qualitative interviews with experts. Data-based analyses probed the labour market of the proposed subspecialty, and the literature was reviewed to look into the cost-benefit ratio of psychosomatic treatment.
RESULTS: All experts expressed a need to restructure psychosomatic care in Austria. Examples exist for psychosomatic treatment with an efficient cost-benefit relation in diverse medical settings.
CONCLUSION: Establishing a subspecialty in Psychosomatic Medicine seems feasible and could contribute to increased quality assurance and the nationwide provision of psychosomatic care."
24307473,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24307473/,"BACKGROUND: Stress associated with concealing sexual orientation is a possible mechanism for health disparities among lesbian, gay, bisexual (LGB) individuals. However, disclosing one's sexual orientation might not be uniformly healthy across social contexts.
PURPOSE: The present study tested whether being out is less healthy for gay and bisexual men of lower socioeconomic status (SES) relative to higher SES men.
METHODS: Using longitudinal data on gay and bisexual men (N = 564, ages 18-72), we examined whether the association between outness and physical health differs by SES.
RESULTS: SES significantly moderated associations between outness and physician visits, nonprescription medication use, and physical symptoms. Outness predicted physical health benefits for higher SES men but health problems for lower SES men.
CONCLUSIONS: The common assumption that disclosing one's sexual orientation is uniformly healthy may be less accurate (or inaccurate) for lower status groups. Future research should explore SES as context for minority stress and LGB health disparities."
24307825,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24307825/,"BACKGROUND: Toothbrushes are over-the-counter products; therefore, no special instruction is given to users when they purchase. There are scarce published studies that have investigated about how often toothbrushes should be replaced. Thus, this study aimed to verify the impact of the Progressive Toothbrush Bristle Flaring on plaque control efficacy of toothbrush.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty six subjects were randomly selected and underwent complete oral prophylaxis 10 days prior to the Baseline plaque recording. All subjects were provided with new similar toothbrushes and were divided into two groups. New Brush Group changed toothbrush every month and Old month Group used single toothbrush for the whole period of the study. Both groups were assessed for plaque accumulation every month using Turesky et al, (1970) modification of the Quigley and Hein (1962) plaque index. Toothbrush head was photographed and assessed by measuring the brushing surface area on standardized photographs using National Institutes of Health Image Analysis Program (USA).
RESULTS: Both groups showed similar plaque scores at the 40(th) day; progressive increase in the plaque scores in group without changing the toothbrush were recorded at the 70(th) and 100(th) days. As toothbrush flaring increased, the plaque scores also increased in the Old Brush Group. Highest plaque accumulation was recorded in Mandibular Lingual aspects in Old Brush Group.
CONCLUSION: Progressive increase was seen in the plaque scores with increase in toothbrush bristle flaring."
24308511,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24308511/,"BACKGROUND: In selected patients, total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplantation (TPIAT) effectively relieves pain caused by chronic pancreatitis and ameliorates the brittle diabetes of the apancreatic state. Patients often undergo multiple endoscopic and surgical interventions prior to TPIAT, increasing the risk for pancreas colonization with enteric microorganisms. Little is known of the safety of transplanting islet cells with microbial contamination.
METHODS: A prospectively collected database of 80 patients submitted to TPIAT at the Medical University of South Carolina from March 2009 to February 2012 was retrospectively reviewed. Patient charts were reviewed for postoperative infectious complications and organisms identified were compared with those identified in pre-transplant islet cultures.
RESULTS: A total of 35 patients (43.8%) had a positive pre-transplant islet cell Gram stain or islet cell culture from the final islet preparation solution. Of these 35 patients, 33 (94.3%) were given antibiotics prophylactically post-transplant for a positive islet Gram stain or culture. Twenty patients (57.1%) receiving Gram stain- or culture-positive islets developed postoperative infectious complications, but only four patients (11.4%) developed infections that concorded with their pre-transplant islet product.
CONCLUSIONS: Islet transplant solutions are frequently culture-positive, presumably as a result of prior pancreas intervention. Microbial contamination of islet preparations should not preclude autotransplantation."
24308605,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24308605/,"OBJECTIVES: Recent studies of margin-related recurrence have raised questions on the necessity of ensuring wide resection margins in the resection of colorectal liver metastases. The aim of the current study was to determine whether resection margins of 10 mm provide a survival benefit over narrower resection margins.
METHODS: A total of 425 laparoscopic liver resections were carried out in 351 procedures performed in 317 patients between August 1998 and April 2012. Primary laparoscopic liver resections for colorectal metastases were included in the study. Two-stage resections, procedures accompanied by concomitant liver ablations and one case of perioperative mortality were excluded. A total of 155 eligible patients were classified into four groups according to resection margin width: Group 1, margins of < 1 mm [n = 33, including 17 patients with positive margins (Group 1a)]; Group 2, margins of 1 mm to < 3 mm (n = 31); Group 3, margins of ≥ 3 mm to <10 mm (n = 55), and Group 4, margins of ≥ 10 mm (n = 36). Perioperative and survival data were compared across the groups. Median follow-up was 31 months (range: 2-136 months).
RESULTS: Perioperative outcomes were similar in all groups. Unfavourable intraoperative incidents occurred in 9.7% of procedures (including 3.2% of conversions). Postoperative complications developed in 11.0% of patients. Recurrence in the resection bed developed in three (1.9%) patients, including two (6.1%) patients in Group 1. Rates of actuarial 5-year overall, disease-free and recurrence-free survival were 49%, 41% and 33%, respectively. Median survival was 65 months. Margin status had no significant impact on patient survival. The Basingstoke Predictive Index (BPI) generally underestimated survival. This underestimation was especially marked in Group 1 when postoperative BPI was applied.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with margins of <1 mm achieved survival comparable with that in patients with margins of ≥ 10 mm. When modern surgical equipment that generates an additional coagulation zone is applied, the association between resection margin and survival may not be apparent. Further studies in this field are required. Postoperative BPI, which includes margin status among the core factors predicting postoperative survival, seems to be less precise than preoperative BPI."
24308642,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24308642/,"BACKGROUND: The consumption of partially hydrogenated vegetable oils (PHVOs) high in trans fat is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and other non-communicable diseases. In response to high intakes of PHVOs, the Indian government has proposed regulation to set limits on the amount of trans fat permissible in PHVOs. Global recommendations are to replace PHVOs with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in order to optimise health benefits; however, little is known about the practicalities of implementation in low-income settings. The aim of this study was to examine the technical and economic feasibility of reducing trans fat in PHVOs and reformulating it using healthier fats.
METHODS: Thirteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with manufacturers and technical experts of PHVOs in India. Data were open-coded and organised according to key themes.
RESULTS: Interviewees indicated that reformulating PHVOs was both economically and technically feasible provided that trans fat regulation takes account of the food technology challenges associated with product reformulation. However, there will be challenges in maintaining the physical properties that consumers prefer while reducing the trans fat in PHVOs. The availability of input oils was not seen to be a problem because of the low cost and high availability of imported palm oil, which was the input oil of choice for industry. Most interviewees were not concerned about the potential increase in saturated fat associated with increased use of palm oil and were not planning to use PUFAs in product reformulation. Interviewees indicated that many smaller manufacturers would not have sufficient capacity to reformulate products to reduce trans fat.
CONCLUSIONS: Reformulating PHVOs to reduce trans fat in India is feasible; however, a collision course exists where the public health goal to replace PHVOs with PUFA are opposed to the goals of industry to produce a cheap alternative product that meets consumer preferences. Ensuring that product reformulation is done in a way that maximises health benefits will require shifts in knowledge and subsequent demand of products, decreased reliance on palm oil, investment in research and development and increased capacity for smaller manufacturers."
24308697,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24308697/,"BACKGROUND: Severe paediatric trauma is rare, and pre-hospital and local hospital personnel experience with injured children is often limited. We hypothesised that a higher proportion of paediatric trauma victims were taken to the regional trauma centre (TC).
METHODS: This is an observational follow-up study that involves one level I TC and seven local hospitals. We included paediatric (< 16 years) and adult (≥ 16-≤ 79 years) trauma patients with a driving distance to the TC > 30 minutes. The primary end-point was the proportion of trauma patients arriving in the TC.
RESULTS: We included 1934 trauma patients, 238 children and 1696 adults. A total of 33/238 children (13.9%) vs. 304/1696 adults (17.9%) were transported to the TC post-injury (P = 0.14). Among these, children were significantly less injured than adults [median Injury Severity Score (ISS) 9 vs. 14, P < 0.01]. There was no significant difference between the groups in the proportion of seriously injured trauma victims (ISS > 15) taken to the TC [8/11 (72.7%) vs. 139/182 (76.4%)]. The corresponding figures for ISS < 15 were 25/227 (11.0%) and 164/1509 (10.9%), respectively. No significant difference was found in intensive care unit length of stay or time to TC arrival. No paediatric vs. 36/1671 (2.2%) adult deaths were observed at 30-day follow-up (P = 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference in the proportion of paediatric and adult trauma patients transported to the TC, neither overall nor among severely injured patients. Paediatric trauma patients admitted to the TC were, however, significantly less injured than adults."
24308804,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24308804/,"OBJECTIVE: Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are first-line treatment for neuropathic pain. Despite widespread use, many health care providers do not know which patients are currently taking TCAs. The objective of this retrospective data analysis was to determine adherence rates to amitriptyline, nortriptyline, or imipramine. The rate at which patients used TCAs (confirmed by presence of TCA in the urine) but did not inform their health care provider is also reported (non-informed prescriber rate). Finally, the effects of age, sex, and number of prescriptions on adherence and non-informed prescriber rates were assessed.
METHODS: Urinary excretion data were obtained from 55,296 patients with pain and were analyzed using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry in a multiplex assay which included amitriptyline, nortriptyline, and imipramine.
RESULTS: The adherence rate was 66% (1,407/2,137); the rate of non-informed prescribers was 3% (1,547/55,296) among the general population, and 52% (1,547/2,954) when only TCA users were considered. While adherence was higher among older and female subjects, the number of other medications did not affect adherence rate.
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis reveals that many prescribers are not informed when patients start and stop using TCAs."
24308873,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24308873/,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to assess the suitability of emergency department (ED) discharge diagnosis for identifying patient cohorts included in the definitions of key performance indicators (KPIs) that are used to evaluate ED performance.
METHODS: Hospital inpatient episodes of care with a principal diagnosis that corresponded to an ED-defined KPI were extracted from the Queensland Hospital Admitted Patient Data Collection (QHAPDC) for the year 2010-2011. The data were then linked to the corresponding ED patient record and the diagnoses applied in the two settings were compared.
RESULTS: The asthma and injury cohorts produced favourable results with respect to matching the QHAPDC principal diagnosis with the ED discharge diagnosis. The results were generally modest when the QHAPDC principal diagnosis was upper respiratory tract infection, poisoning and toxic effects or a mental health diagnosis, and were quite poor for influenza.
CONCLUSIONS: There is substantial variation in the capture of patient cohorts using discharge diagnosis as recorded on Queensland Hospital Emergency Department data. WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT THE TOPIC? There are several existing KPIs that are defined according to the diagnosis recorded on ED data collections. However, there have been concerns over the quality of ED diagnosis in Queensland and other jurisdictions, and the value of these data in identifying patient cohorts for the purpose of assessing ED performance remains uncertain. WHAT DOES THIS PAPER ADD? This paper identifies diagnosis codes that are suitable for use in capturing the patient cohorts that are used to evaluate ED performance, as well as those codes that may be of limited value. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTITIONERS? The limitations of diagnosis codes within ED data should be understood by those seeking to use these data items for healthcare planning and management or for research into healthcare quality and outcomes."
24309235,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24309235/,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the interest of systematic endometrial biopsy at the time of vaginal reconstructive surgery with uterine preservation.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective monocentric study on all women who had vaginal reconstructive surgery with uterine preservation from 2005 to 2012. All following parameters have been studied: baseline characteristics (age, parity, BMI, hormonal status, medical history), prolapse stage using the POP-Q, preoperative pelvic ultrasound (endometrial thickness), and type of surgery. Women with previous hysterectomy were excluded.
RESULTS: Four hundred and fourteen patients were operated during this period, and 268 have uterine preservation (64.7%). Baseline characteristics were mean age 64.7±10.7 (39 to 92), mean parity 2.6±1.5, mean BMI 25.5±4.2, menopause 238 (88.8%), HRT 32 (12%), previous breast cancer 16 (6%), diabetes mellitus 31 (11.6%), and hypertension 87 (32.5%). Prolapse were at stage II in 127 (47.3%), stage III in 99 (36.9%) and stage IV in 17 (6.3%). Preoperative pelvic ultrasound has been done in 255 patients (95.2%), and mean endometrial thickness was 5.1mm (range 1.6-16). Overall, 152 intra-operative endometrial biopsies were assessable (56.7%). In 24 cases (15.8%), samples were too small to be interpretable. Finally, the 128 interpretable biopsies (82.2%) have shown one carcinoma (0.8%), four hyperplasia (3.2%), two endometrial polyps (1.6%), and 121 normal endometria (94.5%). The only cancer was discovered on a 77 year old patient, with a history of previous breast cancer, and with a preoperative endometrial thickness of 7 mm. No patient with normal preoperative ultrasound endometrial screening had abnormal endometrial biopsy.
CONCLUSION: Vaginal reconstructive surgery with uterine preservation implicates a preoperative endometrial evaluation by ultrasound. Intra-operative endometrial biopsy does not seem to be justified."
24309617,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24309617/,"BACKGROUND: Repeated heel raises have been proposed as a method of ankle plantar-flexor strength testing that circumvents the limitations of manual muscle testing (MMT).
OBJECTIVE: The study objective was to examine the relationships among ankle plantar-flexion isometric maximum voluntary contraction (MVC), repeated single-limb heel raises (SLHRs), and MMT in people with myositis.
DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study with a between-group design. The ability to complete 1 SLHR determined group assignment (SLHR group, n=24; no-SLHR group, n=19).
METHODS: Forty-three participants with myositis (13 women; median age=64.9 years) participated. Outcome measures included MVC, predicted MVC, Kendall MMT, and Daniels-Worthingham MMT.
RESULTS: The Kendall MMT was unable to detect significant ankle plantar-flexor weakness established by quantitative methods and was unable to discriminate between participants who could and those who could not perform the SLHR task. Ankle plantar-flexion MVC was not associated with the number of heel-raise repetitions in the SLHR group (pseudo R(2)=.13). No significant relationship was observed between MVC values and MMT grades in the SLHR and no-SLHR groups. However, a moderate relationship between MVC values and MMT grades was evident in a combined-group analysis (ρ=.50-.67).
LIMITATIONS: The lower half of both MMT grading scales was not represented in the study despite the profound weakness of the participants.
CONCLUSIONS: Both Kendall MMT and Daniels-Worthingham MMT had limited utility in the assessment of ankle plantar-flexor strength. Repeated SLHRs should not be used as a proxy measure of ankle plantar-flexion MVC in people with myositis."
24310051,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24310051/,"INTRODUCTION: Peripheral nerve blockade (PNB) is associated with superior outcomes compared with opioids; however, little is known regarding patients' perceptions of the care they have received. Patient satisfaction is emerging as an important indicator of quality of health care, and identifying deficiencies in discrete aspects of satisfaction may allow targeted interventions to improve quality. In this study, we analyze data relevant to patient satisfaction from the International Registry of Regional Anesthesia. The primary objective of this analysis was to report the results of a patient-satisfaction questionnaire and to determine predictors associated with unwillingness to have PNB repeated in the case of future surgery.
METHODS: The questionnaire used in this study was derived from this registry's results and from previously validated questionnaires and addressed 3 domains of importance, namely, provision of information, pain, and interaction with the anesthesiologist. The 11-item written, multidimensional questionnaire was given to patients within 2 days postoperatively. The primary outcome was willingness to have PNB repeated in the event of future similar surgery.
RESULTS: Data related to 9969 surgical procedures were collected between July 1, 2011, and March 31, 2013. The survey response rate was 61.6%. Most respondents-94.6% (95% confidence interval, 94.0%-95.1%)--stated that they were willing to have a repeat PNB. Ninety percent of respondents were satisfied or completely satisfied with the information provided about the nerve block, as well as the anesthesiologist-patient interaction. Patients who were dissatisfied with either of these domains (ie, information provision or professional interaction) were less willing to undergo repeat PNB, as were patients who reported significant pain during the nerve block procedure.
CONCLUSIONS: A high proportion of survey respondents were willing to undergo repeat PNB in case of future surgery and were satisfied with their anesthetic care. Targeted interventions to improve quality of PNB should be aimed at improving comfort, information provision, and physician-patient interaction."

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of White/Black live-born twins, 32 to 40 weeks of gestation, 1990 to 2005, Kansas City, MO. Data were analyzed by t-test, χ(2), linear and linear regression analyses.
RESULT: The cohort comprised 1190 twin pairs, 58% Whites and 55% ≥37 weeks. Smoking rate was 14.5% and similar by race (14.2% White vs 14.8%, P=0.772). The aggregate birthweight of twins of nonsmokers was greater, 5116 g ± 25 g vs 4870 g ± 59 g, P<0.001 (mean±s.d.) and the difference was 264 g (95% confidence interval, 156 to 372 g) after adjusting for other variables in linear regression analyses.
CONCLUSION: Smoking-associated growth restriction in twins is quantitatively similar to that of singletons. This finding is suggestive of dissipation or a ceiling effect to the growth-restricting effect of cigarette smoking."
24310446,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24310446/,"OBJECTIVE: As the antioxidant properties of human milk may be beneficial for very preterm-born infants, it is important to identify the association between total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and bio-active proteins.
STUDY DESIGN: Breast milk was prospectively collected (four times) on postpartum days 6 to 8, 13 to 15, 20 to 22 and 27 to 29 from 15 mothers who had delivered between 24 and 31 weeks of gestation. Skimmed milk was assayed to measure TAC and bio-active proteins (lysozyme, lactoferrin, leptin and adiponectin). The association between TAC and levels of bio-active proteins during the first month of lactation was analyzed in a regression model.
RESULT: Coefficient of determinations (R(2)) revealed an overall effect of bio-active proteins on breast milk TAC (R(2)=0.635+/-0.102, P<0.0001). Breast milk leptin, lysozyme and lactoferrin levels were identified as independent factors that significantly predict the concentration of TAC.
CONCLUSION: The identified enhancement of the antioxidant capacity of human milk by bio-active proteins that are lacking in commercial formula supports consideration of breast milk as ideal nutrition for preterm-born neonates."
24310455,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24310455/,"AIM: In demyelinating disease spectrum, tumor-like (tumefactive) demyelinating lesions (TDL) are rarely seen. Atypical imaging and clinical features of these lesions may cause misdiagnosis of tumor or abscess.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: 25 patients with TDL in our center were followed and clinical, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance spectroscopy, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings and disease course were retrospectively evaluated.
RESULTS: Mean age at symptom onset was 29 years. Motor and sensory deficits were most common symptoms and 18 of them were polysymptomatic. Mostly frontal and parietal regions were affected. 10/25 patients were initially misdiagnosed clinically as brain abscess, primary central nervous system tumor metastasis. T2-hypointense rim, incomplete ring enhancement of the lesions on post-gadolinium T1- weighted imaging on brain MRI enabled accurate diagnosis of TDLs. 13 of 21 patients with first-TDL presentation sustained a monophasic course, remaining 8 patients converted to multiple sclerosis (MS) at a mean 38.4 months follow-up. Clinical isolated syndrome (CIS) patients were older than patients who developed MS and Expanded Disability Status Scale was lower (0.96 vs 3.7).
CONCLUSION: Although MRI, CSF and pathologic examination help in differential diagnosis of the mass lesions, close follow-up is still crucial for the definite diagnosis. A higher MS conversion rate was found in patients with a younger TDL onset age."
24310990,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24310990/,"INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: Determine if women with fibromyalgia report increased bother from pelvic organ prolapse compared with women without fibromyalgia.
METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study of women with symptomatic prolapse on consultation with a private urogynecology practice within a 46-month period. After matching for age, women with a diagnosis of fibromyalgia were compared with a reference group of women without fibromyalgia. Demographic, POPQ examination, medical history, and pelvic floor symptom data (PFDI, PFIQ, and PISQ-12) were collected. Our primary outcome was to compare the mean Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI) scores of women with and without fibromyalgia.
RESULTS: The prevalence of fibromyalgia in women evaluated for initial urogynecology consultation during the study period was 114 out of 1,113 (7%). Women with fibromyalgia reported significantly higher symptom bother scores related to pelvic organ prolapse, defecatory dysfunction, urinary symptoms, and sexual function: PFDI (p = 0.005), PFIQ (p=0.010), and PISQ (p=0.018). Women with fibromyalgia were found to have a higher BMI (p=0.008) and were more likely to report a history of sexual abuse, OR 3.1 (95 % CI 1.3, 7.9), and have levator myalgia on examination, OR 3.8 (95% CI 1.5, 9.1). In a linear regression analysis, levator myalgia was found to be the significant factor associated with pelvic floor symptom bother.
CONCLUSIONS: In women with symptomatic prolapse, fibromyalgia is associated with an increased risk of levator myalgia and 50% more symptom bother from pelvic floor disorders."
24311393,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24311393/,"CONTEXT: Barriers to kidney transplant for African Americans are well documented in the literature. Little information on ownership of information and communication technology and use of such technology in transplant populations has been published.
OBJECTIVE: To characterize racial differences related to ownership and use of information and communication technology in kidney transplant patients.
DESIGN: A single-center, cross-sectional survey study.
SETTING: An urban Midwestern transplant center.
PARTICIPANTS: 78 pretransplant patients and 177 transplant recipients.
MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: The survey consisted of 6 demographic questions, 3 disease-related questions, and 9 technology-related questions. Dichotomous (yes/no) and Likert-scale items were the basis for the survey.
RESULTS: Cell phone use was high and comparable between groups (94% in African Americans, 90% in whites, P= .22). A vast majority (75% of African Americans and 74% of whites) reported being ""comfortable"" sending and receiving text messages. Computer ownership (94.3% vs 79.3%) and Internet access (97.7% vs 80.7%) were greater among whites than African Americans (both P< .01). Fewer African Americans were frequent users of the Internet (27.1% vs 56.3%) and e-mail (61.6% vs 79.3%) than whites (both P<.01). More African Americans than whites preferred education in a classroom setting (77% vs 60%; P< .005) and educational DVDs (66% vs 46%; P< .002).
CONCLUSION: The use of cell phone technology and text messaging was ubiquitous and comparable between groups, but computer and Internet access and frequency of use were not. Reaching out to the African American community may best be accomplished by using cell phone/text messaging as opposed to Internet-based platforms."
24311466,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24311466/,"OBJECTIVE: To ascertain the effect of a second delivery on pelvic floor anatomy.
METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of data obtained in two perinatal imaging studies. Women were invited for antenatal and two postnatal appointments. All had answered a standardized questionnaire and undergone a clinical examination and translabial four-dimensional ultrasound. Ultrasound volumes were acquired at rest, on Valsalva maneuver and on pelvic floor muscle contraction, and analyzed by postprocessing on a PC. Avulsion was diagnosed on tomographic ultrasound imaging. This study reports data obtained in those women who delivered a second child between the first and second postnatal assessments.
RESULTS: Of 715 participants, 94 reported a second birth at their second postnatal appointment on average 2.7 years after their first birth; 65 had a vaginal delivery and 29 a Cesarean section. There were nine attempts at vaginal birth after Cesarean section (VBAC), of which six were successful. When we analyzed the ultrasound findings before and after a second delivery, there was no significant change observed in bladder-neck descent, cystocele descent and hiatal area on Valsalva. Delivery mode of the second birth seemed to have little effect on changes observed between follow-ups, although there was a trend towards increased bladder-neck descent in women after vaginal delivery. On reviewing patients diagnosed with avulsion at their 2-3-year visit and comparing them with findings at the first follow-up visit, we found identical (normal) findings in 87 cases. In five there was an unchanged avulsion. In one case, findings had improved from complete to partial avulsion. There was one new avulsion, in a patient who had delivered her first baby by emergency Cesarean section and her second by vacuum delivery.
CONCLUSIONS: A second pregnancy and delivery do not seem to have a major effect on bladder support and/or levator function. However, we documented a case of major levator trauma after VBAC. The issue of pelvic floor trauma after VBAC may have to be investigated further."
24311892,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24311892/,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: It is well known that androgen deprivation relates to penile fibrosis, so we hypothesize that long-term treatment with 5-alphareductase inhibitors (5ARIs) may increase the risk of fibrosis of prostate.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-two BPH patients who underwent transurethral resection of the prostate were enrolled. The patients were divided into two groups: group one, 16 patients underwent TURP who had been treated with tamsulosin for 2 years; group two, 16 patients underwent TURP who had been treated with combination of tamsulosin and dutasteride for at least 1 year. We evaluated the expressions of nNOS, iNOS, eNOS, TGF-β1, TGF-β2, phosphorylated-Smad2/3 (p-Smad2/3), E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and α-smooth muscle actin in the resected prostate tissues by western blotting, and the TGF-β concentration was determined by ELISA kit.
RESULTS: The expressions of 3 isoforms of NOS were significantly increased in group 2 except of eNOS in lateral prostate, and the expressions of TGF-β1, TGF-β2, and p-Smad2/3 increased about 2-fold compared with group 1. In group 2, the E-cadherin expression decreased while N-cadherin expression increased significantly.
CONCLUSIONS: The overexpression of nNOS may contribute to prostate smooth muscle relaxation; however, long-time treatment with 5 ARI increases the risk of fibrosis of prostate."

In case eradication fails after antibiotic treatment, patients become chronically colonized with P. aeruginosa, with recurrent pulmonary exacerbation, for which patients typically are hospitalized for 2 weeks and receive intravenous antibiotic treatment. Normally, improvement of the patients' health is established.
AIM: Determination of the correspondence between patient improvement and changes of the P. aeruginosa and total bacterial load in the sputum.
METHODS: Eighteen CF patients with exacerbation were included for a total of 27 hospitalization episodes. At day 1, 8 and 15, inflammation and lung function parameters were determined, together with the P. aeruginosa load in the sputum using culture, quantitative PCR (qPCR) and propidium monoazide qPCR.
RESULTS: Patients improved during hospitalization (decrease in levels of C-reactive protein, white blood cell counts and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, increase of FEV1), reaching normal values already after one week. Also the P. aeruginosa load and the total bacterial load decreased during the first week of antibiotic treatment (p<0.05), except for patients with a low lung function (FEV1≤39.4%), for whom no significant decrease of P. aeruginosa was established. Comparison of culture-based and propidium monoazide qPCR-based quantification of P. aeruginosa showed that at the end of the treatment on average 62% of the P. aeruginosa cells are not cultivable, indicating that many cells are alive but dormant, or dead but still structurally intact.
CONCLUSION: Improvement of the clinical status is accompanied with a decrease of the P. aeruginosa load, whereby both occur mainly during the first week of antibiotic treatment. However, for patients with a low lung function, no decrease of the P. aeruginosa load is observed. Comparison of detection techniques shows that a large amount of noncultivable or dead bacteria are present in the samples."
24312192,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24312192/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the sensitivity and specificity of a physician's assessment that a patient ""appears chronically ill"" for the detection of poor health status.
METHODS: The health status of 126 adult outpatients was determined using the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12). Physician participants (n = 111 residents and faculty) viewed photographs of each patient participant and assessed whether or not the patient appeared chronically ill. For the entire group of physicians, the median sensitivity and specificity of ""appearing chronically ill"" for the detection of poor health status (defined as SF-12 physical health score below age group norms by at least 1 SD) were calculated. The study took place from February 2009 to January 2011.
RESULTS: Forty-two participants (33%) had an SF-12 physical health score ≥1 SD below age group norms, and 22 (18%) had a score ≥2 SD below age group norms. When poor health status was defined as an SF-12 physical score ≥1 SD below age group norms, the median sensitivity was 38.1% (IQR 28.6-47.6%), specificity 78.6% (IQR 69.0-84.0%), positive likelihood ratio 1.64 (IQR 1.42-2.15), and negative likelihood ratio 0.82 (IQR 0.74-0.87). For an SF-12 physical score ≥2 SD below age group norms, the median sensitivity was 45.5% (IQR 36.4-54.5%), specificity 76.9% (IQR 66.3-83.7%), positive likelihood ratio 1.77 (IQR 1.49-2.25), and negative likelihood ratio 0.75 (IQR 0.66-0.86).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that a physician's assessment that a patient ""appears chronically ill"" has poor sensitivity and modest specificity for the detection of poor health status in adult outpatients. The associated likelihood ratios indicate that this assessment may have limited diagnostic value."
24312516,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24312516/,"OBJECTIVE: The evidence on whether there is work stress related dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is equivocal. This study assessed the relation between work stress and diurnal cortisol rhythm in a large-scale occupational cohort, the Whitehall II study.
METHODS: Work stress was assessed in two ways, using the job-demand-control (JDC) and the effort-reward-imbalance (ERI) models. Salivary cortisol samples were collected six times over a normal day in 2002-2004. The cortisol awakening response (CAR) and diurnal cortisol decline (slope) were calculated.
RESULTS: In this large occupational cohort (N = 2,126, mean age 57.1), modest differences in cortisol patterns were found for ERI models only, showing lower reward (β = -0.001, P-value = 0.04) and higher ERI (β = 0.002, P-value = 0.05) were related to a flatter slope in cortisol across the day. Meanwhile, moderate gender interactions were observed regarding CAR and JDC model.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the associations of work stress with cortisol are modest, with associations apparent for ERI model rather than JDC model."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the levels of the novel marker ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) and albumin-adjusted IMA (Adj-IMA) in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) and look for the associations of these with the total antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidant status (TOS), and oxidative stress index (OSI).
METHODS: Forty patients with CRC (19 females and 21 males; mean age, 56.5±2.1 years) and 39 age- and sex-matched healthy people (22 females and 17 males; mean age, 56.0±1.7 years) were included in this study. Serum levels of IMA, TAS, and TOS were analyzed, and the OSI was calculated.
RESULTS: Serum IMA, TOS, and OSI levels were significantly higher in patients with CRC than in controls (p<0.0001), whereas TAS levels were significantly lower in CRC patients (p=0.03). There was no significant difference in serum Adj-IMA levels between groups (p=0.32).
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the oxidative/antioxidant status was impaired in favor of oxidative stress in CRC patients. This observation was not confirmed by IMA measurement. Further studies are needed to establish the relationship between IMA and oxidative stress parameters in CRC and other cancers."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From a prospectively collected tumor database, all patients that underwent a craniotomy for intracranial metastases between 2003 and 2011 at Oslo University Hospital were included.
RESULTS: One hundred and forty patients underwent resection for cerebellar metastases. Most common primary tumor sites were lung, colon/rectum, and breast in 45%, 19%, and 14%, respectively. None were prostate cancers. Melanoma metastases were significantly underrepresented, and colorectal cancer metastases significantly overrepresented in cerebellum, compared to the overall proportion of cerebellar/supratentorial metastases surgically resected (P < 0.05). Thirty-day post-operative mortality rate was 4.3%. Median OS was 7.7 months (95% CI 6.0-9.5 months) irrespective of post-operative adjuvant therapy. Median OS was 51.8, 8.4, and 3.4 months, respectively, for recursive partitioning analysis class 1(n = 11), 2 (n = 78) and 3 (n = 34). Significant negative prognostic factors were age ≥65 years, Karnofsky performance score (KPS) <70, extracranial metastases and uncontrolled systemic disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Melanoma metastases were significantly underrepresented in cerebellum, whereas colorectal cancer metastases were significantly overrepresented. Surgical mortality and OS after surgical treatment of cerebellar metastases were similar to the results of supratentorial metastases."
24313901,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24313901/,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) and brain atrophy frequently coexist in older people. However, it is unclear whether the association between these two brain lesions is dependent on the aging process, a vascular mechanism or genetic susceptibility. It was therefore investigated whether the association between load of WMHs and brain atrophy measures is related to age, vascular risk factors (VRFs) or the APOE-ε4 allele.
METHODS: This population-based study included 492 participants (age ≥60 years, 59.6% women) free of dementia and stroke. Data on demographics, VRFs and APOE genotypes were collected through interviews, clinical examination and laboratory tests. WMHs on magnetic resonance images were assessed using manual visual rating and automatic volumetric segmentation. Hippocampal and ventricular volumes were manually delineated, whereas total gray matter (GM) volume was measured by automatic segmentation. Data were analyzed with multivariate linear regression models.
RESULTS: More global WMHs, assessed using either a visual rating scale or a volumetric approach, were significantly associated with lower GM volume and higher ventricular volume; the associations remained significant after adjusting for age, VRFs and the APOE-ε4 allele. In contrast, the association between global WMHs and hippocampal volume was no longer significant after adjusting for age, whereas adjustment for VRFs and APOE-ε4 had no influential effect.
CONCLUSION: The association of global WMHs with lower GM volume and higher ventricular volume is independent of age, VRFs and APOE-ε4 allele, suggesting that the process of cerebral microvascular disease and neurodegeneration are associated independently of the normal aging process, vascular mechanisms or genetic susceptibility."
24314103,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24314103/,"INTRODUCTION: Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is a known precursor to Alzheimer disease, yet there is a lack of validated screening instruments for its detection among the Malaysian elderly.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the Bahasa Malaysia version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-BM) with the Malay version of the Mini Mental State Examination (M-MMSE) in the detection of MCI among the Malaysian elderly.
METHODOLOGY: This is a cross-sectional study conducted at the primary care centre of Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur from December 2011 to mid-January 2012. Subjects aged 60 and above were recruited using systematic sampling method. Cut-off scores of 22/23 for MoCA-BM and 25/26 for M-MMSE were adopted. Kappa value and Pearson's correlation coefficient were used to ascertain the correlation between MOCA-BM and M-MMSE. Data were analysed using Mann-Whitney and Chi Square tests.
RESULTS: The mean age of the 180 subjects enrolled was 65.3 years (SD=5.4). They had a median of 6 years (IqR 25-75=5-11) total formal education. The prevalence of MCI using MoCA-BM and M-MMSE was 55.6% and 32.8% respectively. The odds of developing MCI were 1.153 (95% CI=1.055, 1.261; p<0.05) for every 1 year increase in age, 0.813 (95% CI=0.690, 0.959; p<0.05) with every extra year of education. Increasing age and lower education level were significantly associated with MCI. The MoCA-BM showed good internal consistency with Cronbach's alpha of 0.80. It had moderate correlation with M-MMSE (Pearson correlation coefficient=0.770, p<0.001) and moderate agreement for detecting MCI with Kappa values of 0.497 (p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of MCI was higher using MoCA-BM compared to M-MMSE. Both instruments showed moderate concordance for screening MCI with correlation of their scores."
24314271,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24314271/,"BACKGROUND: Group medical visits (GMVs), clinical encounters with a medical component delivered to groups of patients, have emerged as an innovative approach to potentially increasing efficiency while enhancing the quality of primary health care (PHC). GMVs have created the need to pay explicit attention to patient confidentiality.
OBJECTIVE: What strategies are used by providers and patients to address issues of confidentiality within GMVs?
DESIGN: In-depth interviews were conducted with 34 PHC providers and 29 patients living in nine rural communities in British Columbia, Canada. Data were analysed using interpretive thematic analysis and a relational autonomy approach.
RESULTS: We found three main themes: (i) choosing to disclose: balancing benefits and drawbacks of GMVs, (ii) maintaining confidentiality in GMVs and (iii) gaining strength from interdependent relationships: patients learning from each other. Confidentiality can be addressed and was not a major concern for patients attending or providers facilitating GMVs in these rural communities.
DISCUSSION: Patients adopted strategies to address their own and others' concerns related to confidential health information. Providers used multiple strategies to maintain confidentiality within the group, including renegotiating what information is shared and providing examples of what information ought to be kept confidential.
CONCLUSIONS: Although GMVs are not for all patients, a relational autonomy approach is useful in drawing attention to the context and structures which may influence their patients' ability to act autonomously. Successful delivery of GMVs requires both patients and providers to negotiate between maintaining confidentiality and an appropriate level of disclosure."
24314315,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24314315/,"BACKGROUND: Young adult patients (pts) with repaired tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) remain at risk for arrhythmias (Ar) and sudden cardiac death (SCD). Based on past studies with earlier pt subsets, Ar/SCD events were associated with right ventricular (RV) systolic pressures >60 mm Hg, outflow tract gradients >20 mm Hg, and QRS duration >180 ms. However, there are limited recent studies to evaluate these risk factors in the current patient generation.
METHODS: Patients with TOF followed over the past 50 years were grouped by presence of any arrhythmias (group 1), absence of arrhythmias (group 2), and presence of SCD or significant ventricular arrhythmias (group 3) and correlated with current pt age, gender, age at repair, repair types, echocardiogram, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, electrocardiogram/Holter, hemodynamics, and electrophysiology findings.
RESULTS: Of 109 pts, 52 were male aged 17-58 years. Of these, 59 (54%) had Ar, two of whom had SCD. These 59 pts were chronologically older at the time of analysis, with repair at an older age and wider QRS duration (78-240, mean 158 ms) when compared with those without Ar. However, there was no correlation with surgical era, surgical repair, gender, RV pressure >60 mm Hg, right ventricular outflow tract gradient >20 mm Hg, or RV end-diastolic volume on CMRI.
CONCLUSIONS: Ar/SCD risk continues to correlate with repair age and advancing pt age. QRS duration is longer in these patients but at a shorter interval (mean 158 ms) and less RV pressure (mean 43 mm Hg) than previously reported. In the current TOF patient generation, neither surgical era, type of repair, RV outflow gradient nor RV volume correlate with Ar/SCD. Electrophysiologic testing to verify and identify arrhythmias remains clinically effective."
24314319,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24314319/,"BACKGROUND: Hip fractures are a common and serious consequence of osteoporosis, and hip fracture patients are at high risk for recurrence. Appropriate pharmacotherapy reduces this risk and is associated with reduced mortality after hip fracture, but a care gap exists for fracture prevention in these patients. This evaluation determined rates of osteoporosis treatment and bone mineral density (BMD) testing in hip fracture patients following discharge from a rehabilitation unit.
METHODS: A prospective cohort study of hip fracture patients aged ≥ 50 on an inpatient rehabilitation unit in 2008 and 2011. Patients were seen by a nurse specialist, and encouraged to see their family physician for further assessment and treatment. Physicians were sent a letter indicating the need to follow up with their patient. Patients were contacted following discharge from hospital to determine treatment rates.
RESULTS: Of 310 eligible hip fracture patients admitted to the rehabilitation unit in the years studied, 207 patients were reached post-discharge and provided data. Of patients who were not previously taking osteoporosis medication, 59% of patients from the 2008 cohort, and 42% of patients from the 2011 cohort had osteoporosis treatment initiated by six months following discharge. By 2 months following discharge, 46% of patients in the 2008 cohort had a new BMD performed or scheduled, while this was true for 14% of patients from the 2011 cohort. 35% of patients in 2011 had not seen their family physician by 2 months following discharge.
CONCLUSIONS: Rates for osteoporosis treatment and BMD testing were higher than those reported in the literature for patients not enrolled in case manager programs. BMD testing declined from 2008 to 2011. Lower treatment rates may be due to concerns regarding reports of possible association between bisphosphonate use and atypical fractures. Improving rates of patient follow-up with family physicians will be important for increasing hip fracture treatment rates after discharge."

METHODS: Retrospective audit, using a phone interview was performed to establish links between results of imaging undertaken in the diagnostic work-up of patients with lateral hip pain and clinical outcomes for these patients. Patient perceptions of the effectiveness of interventions were also assessed.
RESULTS: Forty-five patients were included (82% female, mean age 69.6 years). Sixty-nine percent underwent radiological work-up, including plain X-rays (55%), computed tomography scans (64%), magnetic resonance imaging (48%) and ultrasound (90%). Coexistent trochanteric bursitis (TB) and gluteal tendinopathy were the most commonly elucidated pathologies accounting for the symptomatic presentation of 40% of patients. Forty-one patients underwent some form of intervention, most commonly injection of local anesthetic and corticosteroid (LACS) into the region of the TB (87%), two-thirds of which were undertaken under radiological guidance. Pain reduction was maximal following the third injection, with a significantly better response to unguided interventions and levels of symptomatic relief following the first injection being a good indicator of the probability of complete remission. Radiological demonstration of isolated TB correlated with a greater reduction in lateral hip symptoms following LACS TB injections both in the immediate post-injection phase and in the long-term.
CONCLUSION: The results of this audit suggest that the management of GTPS has reasonable patient outcomes; however, a prospective study with greater patient numbers is needed to confirm these results."
24314360,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24314360/,"BACKGROUND: Patients with increased numbers of cholesterol-depleted apolipoprotein B (apoB) particles frequently have multiple other abnormalities, which might confound the comparison of apoB and non-high-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C) as markers of cardiovascular risk.
OBJECTIVE: We wanted to determine whether the superiority of apoB over non-HDL-C as a marker of cardiovascular risk in the INTERHEART study is due to such variables that act as confounders of the primary comparison.
METHODS: To test for confounding, cases and controls were first separated into 3 groups on the basis of the percentile levels within the study of non-HDL-C and apoB with discordance defined as a difference of 5 percentile points. Logistic regression was used to compute odds ratio of myocardial infarction (as an outcome) for different categories, assuming concordance as reference adjusted for other confounders.
RESULTS: Plasma triglyceride and non-HDL-C levels were highest in the discordant group with lowest risk and lowest in the discordant group with highest risk, whereas apoB was highest in the discordant group with the highest risk and lowest in the discordant group with the lowest group. Moreover, no significant change was found in the odds ratio for either discordant group when adjusted for the effect of any of the variables examined, evidence that none confounded the primary comparison.
CONCLUSION: Factors such as hypertriglyceridemia do not confound the comparison of apoB and non-HDL-C, further evidence that apoB is superior to non-HDL-C as a marker of the importance of the apoB atherogenic lipoproteins in cardiovascular risk."

METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of the efficacy and safety of sertraline for the treatment of depression in individuals with Alzheimer disease in five clinical research sites across the United States. Participants were caregivers of patients enrolled in the Depression in Alzheimer's Disease Study 2 (N = 131). All caregivers received standardized psychosocial support throughout the study. Caregiver outcome measures included depression (Beck Depression Inventory), distress (Neuropsychiatric Inventory), burden (Zarit Burden Interview), and quality of life (Medical Outcomes Study Short Form Health Survey).
RESULTS: Fifty-nine percent of caregivers were spouses, 63.4% were women, and 64.1% were white. Caregivers of patients in both treatment groups had significant reductions in distress scores over the 24-week study period, but there was not a greater benefit for caregivers of patients taking sertraline. However, caregivers of patients whose depression was in remission at week 12 had greater declines in distress scores over the 24 weeks than caregivers of patients whose depression did not remit by week 12.
CONCLUSION: Patient treatment with sertraline was not associated with significantly greater reductions in caregiver distress than placebo treatment. Distress but not level of depression or burden lessened for all caregivers regardless of remission status and even more so for those who cared for patients whose depression remitted. Results imply an interrelationship between caregiver distress and patient psychiatric outcomes."
24315152,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24315152/,"BACKGROUND: Although a large isolated surface area of the left atrium (LA) may improve the success rate of catheter ablation (CA) for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF), little is known about the relation between clinical outcomes and the amount of atrial mass reduction (AMR: ratio of total isolated and ablated areas to LA surface area) in different ablation strategies for patients with long-standing persistent AF (L-PeAF).
METHODS: We randomly assigned 119 consecutive L-PeAF patients to adjunctive linear ablation (n=60) or complex fractionated atrial electrogram (CFAE)-guided ablation (n=59) after circumferential antral pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). Linear lesions included roof and anterior lines with conduction block. LA defragmentation was performed with an automated CFAE-detection algorithm. Cavotricuspid isthmus block was performed in all patients. Creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) and troponin-T levels were measured 1 day post-CA.
RESULTS: CK-MB and troponin-T levels were higher, ablation time was longer, and AMR was greater in the CFAE-guided ablation group than in the linear ablation group. AF termination during CA was more frequently observed in the linear ablation group than in the CFAE-guided ablation group (P=0.031). Twelve months after a single procedure, recurrence occurred in 16 (26.7%) patients with linear ablation and 27 (45.8%) patients with CFAE-guided ablation (P=0.023). On multivariate analysis, LA volume and ablation method were the only independent risk factors for arrhythmia recurrence.
CONCLUSION: Conduction block through linear lines+PVI was an efficient ablation strategy for L-PeAF, whereas the AMR amount did not influence clinical outcomes."

OBJECTIVES: To describe the IPD cases. To assess the most prevalent causative serotypes and to evaluate the missed opportunities for vaccination.
METHODS: This is a descriptive retrospective study of the incidence of IPD cases in Elche during 5 years. It was reviewed the vaccination status and the visits to specialized care prior to disease. It was also calculated the vaccine effectiveness with the 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine in our population.
RESULTS: Between 2007 and 2011 were notified 181 of IPD, the most frequent medical conditions were pneumonia and sepsis, with a mortality rate of 12%. 80% of the causative serotypes are included in the vaccine. More than the half of the cases had at least one of the risk factor for indicating the vaccination. This percentage decreases by 6.2% in cases below 65 years of age with any risk factor.
CONCLUSIONS: After 10 years of introducing the vaccine into the adult immunization schedule the coverage it is still low among the patients with risk factors. In our study, 75% of the cases were not vaccinated. Taking in count the vaccine effectiveness for preventing IPD, among the patients attended at the hospital by the specialist prior their IPD, it could have been prevented in the best assumption (85% vaccine effectiveness) 60 IPD cases."
24315304,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24315304/,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (NADT) on the outcomes for primary whole gland prostate cryoablation (CRYO). NADT before CRYO has sometimes been used for prostate volume reduction, with some theoretical benefit toward improving disease control. NADT has been shown to be beneficial for biochemical disease-free survival (bDFS) with radiotherapy but not in conjunction with radical prostatectomy.
METHODS: We retrospectively compared risk-stratified cohorts according to whether they had received NADT. bDFS was defined using the Phoenix criteria, and postoperative morbidity and complications were compared.
RESULTS: A total of 1761 men had undergone NADT before CRYO and 2727 had not. No differences were found in the incidence of postoperative incontinence, pad use, potency, or fistula formation. The rate of urinary retention at 12 months was slightly lower for those who had not undergone NADT (0.8% vs 1.2%, P = .015). No difference was found in bDFS between the NADT and non-NADT men (66.9% vs 66.5% at 5 years). When stratified by risk, however, a statistically significant difference was found between the NADT and non-NADT men only in the intermediate-risk cohort (71.3% vs 65.9%; P < .013).
CONCLUSION: bDFS was statistically similar between the NADT and non-NADT men, except in the intermediate-risk cohort, with slightly improved survival for those undergoing NADT. No significant difference was found in the complication rates. These data do not support the routine use of NADT for men undergoing primary whole gland cryoablation, although its use could be considered for men with larger prostates or men in the intermediate-risk category."
24315312,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24315312/,"PURPOSE: To assess the differences in facial skin temperature after mandibular third molar removal when patients received methylprednisolone and placebo, respectively and to assess the correlation between patient-reported swelling using a visual analog scale (VAS) and facial skin temperature measured using thermography.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study involved patients with 2 mandibular third molars with an indication for removal. The patients received either methylprednisolone or placebo in a randomized, crossover study design. Thermograms and the swelling VAS score were recorded 2 days after surgery. The outcome variable was the temperature difference (Δt) between the operated and control sides. A 2-sample t test analyzed the difference in Δt between the first and second operations. Spearman's rank correlation analysis was used to assess the correlation between the swelling VAS scores and the Δt.
RESULTS: A total of 124 patients (67 males, 57 females, mean age 25 years) had both mandibular third molars removed on 2 separate occasions. No difference in Δt was found when methylprednisolone and placebo were given (P = .07). In addition, the correlation between the swelling VAS score and Δt was 0.30 (P = .001) and 0.09 (P = .3) after the first and second operation, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Thermography does not seem sensitive enough to detect differences in the inflammatory response when patients received methylprednisolone or placebo. The correlation between the Δt and patient-reported swelling was low (≤0.3)."
24315504,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24315504/,"BACKGROUND: People who inject drugs (PWID) are at risk of hepatitis C virus (HCV). It is plausible that PWID who receive a diagnosis of HCV will reduce their injecting risk out of concern for their injecting partners, although evidence for this is currently limited. The aim of this study was to investigate whether informing PWID of their HCV diagnosis was associated with a change in injecting behaviour.
METHODS: Prospective, longitudinal study of PWID recruited from street drug markets across Melbourne, Australia. Interviews and HCV testing were conducted at 3-monthly intervals. The association between receiving a diagnosis of HCV and (i) injecting frequency and (ii) injecting equipment borrowing, was examined using generalized estimating equations (GEE) analysis.
RESULTS: Thirty-five individuals received a diagnosis of HCV during the study period. Receiving a diagnosis of HCV was associated with a decrease of 0.35 injections per month (p=0.046) but there was no change in injecting equipment borrowing (p=0.750).
CONCLUSIONS: A small reduction in injecting frequency was observed in PWID who received a diagnosis of HCV. This finding should be investigated further in larger studies examining a wider range of injecting risk behaviours."
24315883,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24315883/,"OBJECTIVES: Data are limited on whether providers understand parental attitudes to recommended childhood immunizations. We determined parental attitudes and assessed how accurately providers estimated parental opinions.
METHODS: Survey of parents and providers (pediatricians, nurses, medical assistants) in randomly selected practices in Houston, Texas. Surveys assessed demographics, perceptions of immunization importance, safety and efficacy, and acceptability of vaccine delivery. Providers estimated parental responses.
RESULTS: 401 parents (82% mothers, 12% fathers, 6% other) and 105 providers participated. Parents thought vaccines were important for health (median score 9.5; 0=not important, 10=extremely important) but also were concerned regarding vaccine safety and side effects (8.9 on 0-10 scale). 309 (77%) agreed that vaccines effectively prevent disease. Route of administration mattered to 147 (37%), who preferred injection (9.0) over oral (7.3) or intranasal (4.8) routes. Although parents would prefer three or fewer injections per visit, preventing more diseases (189 [47.6%]) was more important than number of injections (167 [42.3%]) when deciding the number of vaccines allowed per visit. White parents rated vaccines less important in preventing some illnesses than did non-white (P≤0.006 for meningitis, hepatitis, HPV, influenza and rotavirus) and rated number of injections per visit more important than number of diseases prevented (51.6% white versus 34.2% non-white; P 0.002). Providers underestimated parental attitudes toward vaccine importance (particularly influenza and HPV), and overestimated the proportion of parents who thought route of administration mattered (63%) and that number of injections per visit was the most important factor (76%) around parental vaccine decisions (P<0.001 for parent-provider mismatch).
CONCLUSIONS: Most surveyed parents believe vaccines are important for child health and rate disease prevention higher than number of injections entailed. Providers underestimate the importance of some vaccines to parents and overestimate parental concerns regarding route of administration. Future research should focus on how this mismatch impacts parental vaccine decisions."
24316001,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24316001/,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to determine between-country differences and changes over time in the portrayal of youth risk behaviors in films rated for youth in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and the United States.
METHODS: Content and ratings were analyzed for 362 films that were popular across all four countries from 2002 to 2009. Country-specific ratings were classified as either youth or adult, and Generalized Estimating Equations were used to determine between-country differences in the presence of tobacco, alcohol, drugs, sexual content, and violence in youth-rated films. Within-country differences in this content over time were also assessed, comparing films released from 2002 to 2005 with those released from 2006 to 2009.
RESULTS: In the US, films rated for youth were less likely to contain all five risk behaviors than in youth-rated films in Argentina, Brazil, and, when the ""15 and older"" rating was considered a youth rating, in Mexico. All three Latin American countries ""downrated"" films that received an adult rating in the US. Nevertheless, tobacco and drug use in youth-rated films declined over time in all countries, whereas moderate to extreme alcohol use and violence involving children or youth increased in all countries.
CONCLUSIONS: Tobacco and drug use have declined in popular US films, but these behaviors are still prevalent in films rated for youth across the Americas.

METHODS: Two hundred and eighty-three video-recorded diagnostic-treatment decision consultations between breast surgeons and women with breast cancer were assessed using the Decision Analysis System for Oncology (DAS-O) coding system designed for assessing SDM behaviors. Women completed a questionnaire at pre-consultation, one-week post-consultation and one-month post-surgery. Patient outcomes included decision conflict, patient satisfaction with medical consultation, and decision regret.
RESULTS: Overall, the level of SDM behaviors was low. The extent of SDM behavior within consultation was related to greater consultation duration (p<0.001), more than one treatment being offered (p<0.001), and fewer questions raised by patients/companions (p<0.05). While use of SDM consultation did not influence post-consultation decision conflict, it increased satisfaction with information given and explained, patients' feelings of trust and confidence in their surgeons, and reduced post-surgical decision regret.
CONCLUSION: These breast surgical consultations mostly adopted informed treatment decision-making approaches. Using SDM improved patient consultation and decision satisfaction.
PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The study findings highlight a need to reinforce the importance of SDM in consultations among breast surgeons."
24316116,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24316116/,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Denosumab (XGeva) is a receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL)-antibody that was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2010 for the prevention of skeletal fractures in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors. Although there is a widespread use of such drug in patients under risk of pathological fractures, the compatibility of denosumab therapy with percutaneous vertebroplasty (an interventional procedure commonly used for pain control in such population) has not yet been established.
PURPOSE: To present the serial imaging findings and technical report of an attempted percutaneous vertebroplasty in a patient with refractory pain and a lytic pathological vertebral fracture related to small cell lung cancer spinal metastasis and who was actively under medical treatment with denosumab.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review and case report.
METHODS: The authors present the imaging findings and technical report of an attempted percutaneous vertebroplasty in the only patient found to be actively under treatment with denosumab after a retrospective review of the databank of patients with pathological fractures referred to the Department of Radiology of the Ohio State University for percutaneous vertebroplasty (a total sample of 20 patients) since the FDA approval of denosumab (November 2010) until June 2013 (a 30-month period).
RESULTS: Although the computed tomography scan of the thoracic spine, performed 6 weeks after the initiation of the treatment with denosumab, presented a remarkable remodeling of the previously lytic vertebral lesion (which became markedly sclerotic in appearance), the clinical response in terms of pain improvement was not satisfactory. At the time of the percutaneous vertebroplasty (which was indicated for pain control), after advancing the 11-gauge needle through the pedicle with extreme difficulty, the needle repeatedly deviated laterally and, despite several attempts, it was not possible to penetrate the vertebral body and perform the cement injection.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of the technical peculiarities of percutaneous vertebroplasty in patients under medical treatment with denosumab. According to our experience, because of its RANKL-mediated effects on osteoclasts activity, denosumab has been shown to induce a fast and marked sclerotic response on vertebral bodies that may not be accompanied by a satisfactory improvement in pain control (especially in patients with mechanical type of pain) and which may actually prevent the successful performance of percutaneous vertebroplasty. Therefore, it is of paramount importance that future studies evaluating patients with vertebral fractures under treatment with denosumab include long-term pain outcome measures. Additionally, further investigation is warranted to determine the optimal order of treatment and the best timeframe for combining percutaneous vertebroplasty and denosumab therapy in patients presenting with acute vertebral compression fractures and refractory axial pain."

This study further examined GHI utilization and costs.
METHODS: Using two-part model, we compared those outcomes immediately after injuries for which accepted WC medical claims made zero or positive medical payments.
RESULTS: Controlling for pre-injury GHI utilization and costs and other covariates, our results indicated that post-injury GHI utilization and costs increased regardless of whether a WC medical claim was zero or positive. The increases were highest for zero-cost WC medical claims.
CONCLUSION: Our national estimates showed that zero-cost WC medical claims alone could cost the GHI $212 million per year."
24316892,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24316892/,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the prevalence of subclinical atherosclerosis in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in comparison to controls with similar cardiovascular risk factors.
METHODS: Forty-two consecutive patients with AS and 42 controls matched for age (43.3 ± 11.7 vs. 43.7 ± 11.3, P = 0.89), gender, smoking, diabetes mellitus and arterial hypertension were enrolled. Participants were excluded if a personal cardiovascular disease (CV) history was present. A questionnaire recording demographic data, medical and medication history was fulfilled. Blood pressure, abdominal circumference, height and weight were measured. Lipid profile was determined in a 12-hour fastened blood sample. Ultrasound analysis of the common carotid artery was performed by one blind observer. The distance between the lumen-intima interface and the leading edge of the media-adventitia interface (IMT) was measured and participants were also evaluated for the presence of plaques.
RESULTS: The comparative analysis of demographic and cardiovascular risk factors between AS patients and controls did not reveal statistically significant differences. Also, no significant differences between groups were observed for TC, HDL-C, T-C/HDL-C, LDL-C, triglycerides, or dyslipidemia frequency. IMT measures were not different in AS and controls (0.62 ± 0.09 vs. 0.61 ± 0.09, P = 0.39) as well as plaques frequencies (19% vs. 17%, P = 0.78).
CONCLUSIONS: Subclinical atherosclerosis assessed through carotid ultrasound imaging was not more prevalent in the AS group when compared to controls with similar cardiovascular risks. Our observations may imply that CV risk factors may have more influence on the CV system than AS itself. These findings should be confirmed in a larger population with a prospective study design."
24316945,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24316945/,"BACKGROUND: A multimodality approach to patients with locally recurrent rectal cancer that includes surgery is associated with a significant survival advantage when tumor-free margins are achieved. Patients with advanced tumors will require extended sacropelvic resection to optimize oncologic outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the safety, feasibility, and oncologic outcomes of extended sacropelvic resection for locally recurrent rectal cancer at our institution.
DESIGN: A retrospective review identified 406 patients who had surgery for locally recurrent rectal cancer between 1997 and 2007. From this group, all patients who underwent a curative-intent sacropelvic resection were analyzed.
SETTINGS: This investigation was conducted at an academic tertiary referral center.
PATIENTS: Thirty patients (24 male) were identified. Median age was 59 years (range, 25-84). Operations were performed for a first local recurrence (n = 24), a second recurrence (n = 5) and for a third recurrence (n = 1).
INTERVENTIONS: Twenty-six patients underwent neoadjuvant radiation, and 20 received intraoperative radiation therapy. All patients underwent extended sacropelvic resection.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes measured were early (<30 days) and late (>30 days) surgical complications. Overall and disease-free survivals were estimated by using the Kaplan-Meier technique.
RESULTS: Margin-negative resection was achieved in 93%. The most proximal level of spinal transection was the fourth lumbar space, and 4 patients underwent lower extremity amputation. There was no mortality, and early morbidity was seen in 76%. Median follow-up was 2.7 years (range, 2 months to 10.8 years). Overall survival at 2 and 5 years was 86% and 46%. Disease-free survival at 2 and 5 years was 79% and 43%.
LIMITATIONS: This study was limited by its retrospective nature and the limited number of patients.
CONCLUSIONS: We found extended sacropelvic resection for locally recurrent rectal cancer to be feasible and safe with overall and disease-free survival rates in comparison with survival rates seen in patients undergoing nonsacropelvic resections for locally recurrent rectal cancer."

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify whether clinical features of pouch Crohn's disease are associated with pouch retention.
SETTINGS: The study was conducted in a tertiary referral center.
DESIGN AND PATIENTS: All patients diagnosed with clinically active pouch Crohn's disease during follow-up after IPAA for ulcerative colitis or indeterminate colitis were identified from an ileal pouch registry. The definition of early vs late diagnosis was based on the median time interval to diagnosis of Crohn's disease after pouch creation. The associations between pouch retention and the clinical features and treatments of pouch Crohn's disease were analyzed.
OUTCOME MEASURE: The long-term pouch retention rate was estimated by using the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze independent factors for pouch failure.
RESULTS: From 1993 to 2009, a total of 65 (28 males) patients developed de novo pouch Crohn's disease during a mean 7.9 years of follow-up after pouch creation. The overall pouch retention rate was 57%. The median time from pouch creation to pouch Crohn's disease diagnosis was 3.6 years. Univariate analysis demonstrated that early diagnosis of pouch Crohn's disease, disease location, and clinical manifestations at the time of diagnosis were associated with pouch outcomes, whereas medical therapy or perianal surgery was not. Multivariate analysis showed that fistula at the time of diagnosis (OR = 17.5, p = 0.002) and early diagnosis (OR = 5.70, p = 0.011) were independent risk factors for pouch failure, whereas afferent limb disease was associated with pouch retention (OR = 0.07, p = 0.018).
LIMITATIONS: The retrospective nature of this study and referral bias were limitations.
CONCLUSIONS: Disease characteristics of de novo pouch Crohn's disease heavily influence pouch retention. The interval from pouch construction, fistulizing disease, and disease location can be used as prognostic indicators when ileal pouch Crohn's disease is diagnosed."
24316954,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24316954/,"BACKGROUND: Sedation with propofol is gaining popularity. It is unclear whether sedation with propofol is associated with colonoscopic perforation.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare perforation rates during colonoscopy using sedation with or without propofol.
DESIGN: This was a retrospective case series study.
SETTINGS: Data from a tertiary center were analyzed. Demographics, method of sedation, and type of endoscopic procedure performed were collected.
PATIENTS: Patients who underwent a colonoscopy from January 2003 to October 2012 were analyzed.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Perforation rate expressed per 10,000 colonoscopies was measured.
RESULTS: A total of 118,004 colonoscopies were performed during the study period, with 48 perforations (0.041% or 4.1 per 10,000). Overall, the use of propofol was associated with a 2.5 times increased rate of perforation (6.9 vs 2.7 per 10,000; p = 0.0015). Similarly, in patients undergoing therapeutic colonoscopies, there was a 3.4-times increased risk of perforation associated with the use of propofol (8.7 vs 2.6 per 10,000; p = 0.0016). However, in patients undergoing diagnostic colonoscopies, there was no significantly increased risk of perforation with the use of propofol (4.2 vs 2.9 per 10,000; p = 0.64). In univariate and multivariate analyses, there were no differential perforation risks on the basis of sex, but each decade increase in age was associated with an increased risk of perforation. In those patients having a therapeutic colonoscopy, age (per decade) and propofol use were independently and significantly associated with an increased perforation risk, with adjusted ORs of 1.32 (p = 0.04) and 3.38 (p = 0.001).
LIMITATIONS: This was a retrospective study with the potential for selection bias.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that propofol administration is associated with an increased risk of colonoscopic perforation among patients undergoing a therapeutic colonoscopy; however, this association was not evident in patients undergoing a diagnostic colonoscopy. Further studies, such as a prospective, randomized clinical trial, should be done to further evaluate this association."
24316955,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24316955/,"BACKGROUND: Sham feeding has been shown to hasten the return of GI function following colorectal surgery, before the advent of enhanced recovery after surgery protocols. Few data exist regarding the efficacy of sham feeding in the modern era, with rapid postoperative feeding.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to perform a meta-analysis on the effect of sham feeding in colorectal surgery, with a separate analysis on trials that used rapid postoperative feeding.
DATA SOURCES: Cochrane, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, and PubMed were searched by using the terms gum OR sham feeding OR chew AND (colorect OR resect).
STUDY SELECTION: All studies were randomized controlled trials (in any language) performed on adults, comparing standard care with gum chewing following colorectal resection. From 439 citations, 10 articles were included.
INTERVENTION: The intervention was sham feeding by means of gum chewing.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome measures were time to return of flatus, time to first bowel movement, complication rates, length of hospital stay, readmission rates, and reoperation rates.
RESULTS: Ten randomized controlled trials (n = 612) were included. Sham feeding resulted in a reduction in time to flatus of 31 minutes (p = 0.003) and time to first bowel movement of 30 minutes (p = 0.05). Sham feeding also resulted in a reduction in length of stay by 0.5 days (p = 0.007), and a reduction in complication rates (relative risk = 0.687, p = 0.017), although this appeared to be associated with publication bias. Analysis of trials that used rapid postoperative feeding (n = 282) revealed no difference in postoperative GI function.
LIMITATIONS: This review was limited by the heterogeneity of postoperative feeding regimes, in addition to limited reporting by trials of postoperative morbidity.
CONCLUSIONS: Sham feeding following colorectal surgery is safe, results in small improvements in GI recovery, and is associated with a reduction in the length of hospital stay. It confers no advantage if patients are placed on a rapid postoperative feeding regime."
24317286,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24317286/,"INTRODUCTION: Prehospital termination of resuscitation (TOR) rules have not been widely validated outside of Western countries. This study evaluated the performance of TOR rules in an Asian metropolitan with a mixed-tier emergency medical service (EMS).
METHODS: We analysed the Utstein registry of adult, non-traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCAs) in Taipei to test the performance of TOR rules for advanced life support (ALS) or basic life support (BLS) providers. ALS and BLS-TOR rules were tested in OHCAs among three subgroups: (1) resuscitated by ALS, (2) by BLS and (3) by mixed ALS and BLS. Outcome definition was in-hospital death. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value and decreased transport rate (DTR) among various provider combinations were calculated.
RESULTS: Of the 3489 OHCAs included, 240 were resuscitated by ALS, 1727 by BLS and 1522 by ALS and BLS. Overall survival to hospital discharge was 197 patients (5.6%). Specificity and PPV of ALS-TOR and BLS-TOR for identifying death ranged from 70.7% to 81.8% and 95.1% to 98.1%, respectively. Applying the TOR rules would have a DTR of 34.2-63.9%. BLS rules had better predictive accuracy and DTR than ALS rules among all subgroups.
CONCLUSIONS: Application of the ALS and BLS TOR rules would have decreased OHCA transported to the hospital, and BLS rules are reasonable as the universal criteria in a mixed-tier EMS. However, 1.9-4.9% of those who survived would be misclassified as non-survivors, raising concern of compromising patient safety for the implementation of the rules."
24317287,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24317287/,"BACKGROUND: Mortality may be higher for admissions at odd hours than during daytime, although for trauma patients results are conflicting. The objective of this study was to assess whether diurnal differences in mortality among severely injured trauma patients in Denmark were present.
METHODS: This observational cohort study was conducted between 1 December 2009 and 30 April 2011 involving one level 1 trauma centre and seven local emergency departments in eastern Denmark. Patients were consecutively included if received by a designated trauma team. Night-time patients (20:00-07:59) were compared with daytime patients (20:00-07:59). An injury severity score (ISS) >15 defined severe injury. Patients with burns and patients who upon arrival were declared non-trauma patients were not included. The primary outcome measure was 30-day mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 1985 patients were recorded, of whom 576 were admitted at night-time, 1369 at daytime and 40 not included due to missing data. There were 142 patients with ISS >15 in the daytime group and 64 at night-time. The 30-day mortality was 14.1% for admittance at night-time versus 21.3% at daytime (p=0.22). Logistic regression analysis revealed that odd-hour admission was not a significant predictor of mortality for patients with ISS >15 when adjusted for age, ISS and initial treatment facility (OR 0.71 (95% CI 0.27 to 1.90); p=0.50).
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we found no diurnal differences in 30-day mortality for severely injured trauma patients."
24317343,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24317343/,"BACKGROUND: When using the change-in-estimate criterion, a cutoff of 10% is commonly used to identify confounders. However, the appropriateness of this cutoff has never been evaluated. This study investigated cutoffs required under different conditions.
METHODS: Four simulations were performed to select cutoffs that achieved a significance level of 5% and a power of 80%, using linear regression and logistic regression. A total of 10 000 simulations were run to obtain the percentage differences of the 4 fitted regression coefficients (with and without adjustment).
RESULTS: In linear regression, larger effect size, larger sample size, and lower standard deviation of the error term led to a lower cutoff point at a 5% significance level. In contrast, larger effect size and a lower exposure-confounder correlation led to a lower cutoff point at 80% power. In logistic regression, a lower odds ratio and larger sample size led to a lower cutoff point at a 5% significance level, while a lower odds ratio, larger sample size, and lower exposure-confounder correlation yielded a lower cutoff point at 80% power.
CONCLUSIONS: Cutoff points for the change-in-estimate criterion varied according to the effect size of the exposure-outcome relationship, sample size, standard deviation of the regression error, and exposure-confounder correlation."

METHODS: The data of four cases with fetal IVH were analyzed retrospectively. Antenatal risk factors, clinical features, postnatal outcome, and the presence of COL4A1/A2 mutations were evaluated.
RESULTS: Eight cases of fetal IVH were diagnosed between 2005 and 2012 in Erciyes University. Of these, four were eligible for genetic analysis. Mean gestational age at diagnosis was 30 weeks 5 day (min-max: 28-34 weeks); two cases had grade III hemorrhage and two cases had grade IV hemorrhage according to fetal magnetic resonance imaging. Three cases had severe neurodevelopmental delay and one case had mild deficit. In all cases, postnatal evaluation revealed no underlying cause, and no retinal hemorrhagia and hematuria were detected. The mean postnatal follow-up was 19 months, and no recurrent hemorrhages and porencephalic cyst formation were observed. The whole exome sequencing showed no pathological mutations of COL4A1 and COL4A2 in the four patients.
CONCLUSION: Our data showed that fetal intraventricular hemorrhage is not associated with COL4A1 and COL4A2 mutations in the absence of porencephaly, recurrent hemorrhage, and other organ bleeding."
24318040,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24318040/,"BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: A previous publication from the New Canadian Children and Youth Study, a national study of immigrant children and youth in Canada, showed a gradient of levels of emotional distress with children from Hong Kong (HK) at the most severe end, Filipino children at the least severe, and children from the People's Republic of China (PRC) in between. Based on the premise that country of origin can be regarded as an index for differing immigration trajectories, the current study examines the extent to which arrival characteristics, resettlement contingencies and cultural factors account for country of origin variations in immigrant children's mental health. Arrival characteristics included child's age at arrival, parental education, parental fluency in English or French, and assistance from family at arrival. Resettlement contingencies included parental mental health, intra-familial conflict, settlement stress, separations from parents and child's age when mother started working outside the home. Cultural factors included one-child family composition and parenting styles.
METHODS: A national survey of 2,031 families with at least one child between the ages of 4 and 6 or 11 and 13 from HK, the PRC and the Philippines was conducted with the Person Most Knowledgeable (PMK) in snowball-generated samples in 6 different cities across Canada. Predictors of the dependent variable, emotional problems (EP), were examined in a hierarchical block regression analysis. EP was regressed on ethnic and country of origin group in model 1; arrival characteristics were added in model 2; resettlement contingencies in model 3 and cultural factors in model 4.
RESULTS: The final set of predictor variables accounted for 19.3 % of the variance in EP scores among the younger cohort and 23.2 % in the older. Parental human and social capital variables accounted for only a small amount of the overall variance in EP, but there were statistically significant inverse relationships between EP and PMK fluency in English or French. Settlement contingencies accounted for a significant increase in the explanatory power of the regression equation, net of the effects of country of origin and selection characteristics. This block of variables also accounted for the Filipino mental health advantage. Levels of parent's depression and somatization, harsh parenting, intrafamilial conflict, and resettlement stress each varied directly with levels of children's EP. Cultural variables made a significant contribution to explaining the variance in EP scores. Harsh parenting was significantly associated with increased levels of EP in both age groups, and supportive parenting was a mental health protective factor for younger children.
CONCLUSIONS: Immigrant family human and social capital, according to which immigrants are selected for admission to Canada, play a relatively small role in determining children's mental health. These effects are overshadowed by resettlement contingencies and cultural influences. Concentrating on trying to find a formula to select the ""right"" immigrants while neglecting settlement and culture is likely to pay limited dividends for ensuring the mental health of children."
24318731,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24318731/,"PURPOSE: The goal of complex tasks can be maintained despite variability in the movements of the multiple body segments involved in the task (VAR(elements)). This variability increases in acute pain and may enable the nervous system to search for less painful/injurious movement options. It is unclear whether VAR(elements) increases when pain challenges simple tasks with fewer movement options, yet maintain successful attainment of the goal. We hypothesised that during acute pain related to a simple movement: (1) the task goal would be maintained; (2) VAR(elements) would be increased; and (3) if VAR(elements) increased during pain, it would decrease over time.
METHODS: Movements of the right wrist/forearm were recorded with a three-dimensional motion analysis system and during a repetitive radial-ulnar deviation task between two target angle ranges (the task goal). We measured success of attaining the goal (repetitions that reached the target range and total absolute error in degrees), and variability in the motion of wrist flexion-extension and forearm pronation-supination (VAR(elements)). Fourteen healthy participants performed the task in one session before, during, and after wrist extensor muscle pain induced with hypertonic saline, and in another session without pain.
RESULTS: The task goal was maintained during acute pain. However, VAR(elements) in other motion planes either reduced (pronation-supination) or did not change (flexion-extension). Thus, variability of task elements is constrained, rather than increased, in simple tasks.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest the nervous system adapts simple tasks with limited degrees of freedom by reduction of VAR(elements) rather than the increase observed for more complex tasks."
24319039,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24319039/,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the risks of continuously administered IV anesthetic drugs (IVADs) on the outcome of adult patients with status epilepticus (SE).
METHODS: All intensive care unit patients with SE from 2005 to 2011 at a tertiary academic medical care center were included. Relative risks were calculated for the primary outcome measures of seizure control, Glasgow Outcome Scale score at discharge, and death. Poisson regression models were used to control for possible confounders and to assess effect modification.
RESULTS: Of 171 patients, 37% were treated with IVADs. Mortality was 18%. Patients with anesthetic drugs had more infections during SE (43% vs 11%; p < 0.0001) and a 2.9-fold relative risk for death (2.88; 95% confidence interval 1.45-5.73), independent of possible confounders (i.e., duration and severity of SE, nonanesthetic third-line antiepileptic drugs, and critical medical conditions) and without significant effect modification by different grades of SE severity and etiologies. As IVADs were used after first- and second-line drugs failed, there was a correlation between treatment-refractory SE and the use of IVADs, leading to insignificant results regarding the risk of IVADs and outcome after additional adjustment for refractory SE.
CONCLUSION: Our findings heighten awareness regarding adverse effects of IVADs. Randomized controlled trials are needed to further clarify the association of IVADs with outcome in patients with SE.
CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class III evidence that patients with SE receiving IVADs have a higher proportion of infection and an increased risk of death as compared to patients not receiving IVADs."

To assist in the real-world provision of PrEP, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has released guidance documents for PrEP use.
METHODS: Adult infectious disease physicians were surveyed about their opinions and current practices of PrEP through the Emerging Infections Network (EIN). Geographic information systems analysis was used to map out provider responses across the United States.
RESULTS: Of 1175 EIN members across the country, 573 (48.8%) responded to the survey. A majority of clinicians supported PrEP but only 9% had actually provided it. Despite CDC guidance, PrEP practices were variable and clinicians reported many barriers to its real-world provision.
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of adult infectious disease physicians across the United States and Canada support PrEP but have vast differences of opinion and practice, despite the existence of CDC guidance documents. The success of real-world PrEP will likely require multifaceted programs addressing barriers to its provision and will be assisted with the development of comprehensive guidelines for real-world PrEP."
24319854,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24319854/,"OBJECTIVE: Good pain management can improve the outcome of patient care after cardiac surgery. The intensity of pain after cardiac surgery is often underrated. Inadequate pain control can result in increased morbidity and length of hospital stay as well as lead to chronic pain. Therefore, the authors conducted a study to identify the prevalence and risk factors of moderate to severe pain after cardiac surgery including treatment and complication.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: The present study was prospectively performed in the patients undergoing cardiac surgery with median sternotomy in Siriraj Hospital, a tertiary care center between July 2009 and November 2010. Pain was assessed by numerical rating scale (NRS, 0-10) whilst NRS >4 was defined as moderate to severe pain. Pain score was recorded until 48 hours after surgery. Demographic data, history ofprevious cardiac and non-cardiac surgery, chronic pain history, details of the operation, and intra-and postoperative analgesia were recorded, including complication ofpain treatment. In addition, pain expectation and experience were compared and the patient satisfaction was evaluated
RESULTS: Two hundred ninety patients were enrolled, 95.5% ASA physical status III, with mean duration of surgery 243.8 minutes (95-600) and cardiopulmonary bypass time 112.8 minutes (33-500). The prevalence of moderate to severe pain in the patients after cardiac surgery was 61.4%. The duration of cardiopulmonary bypass less than 60 minutes decreased numbers of patients with moderate to severe pain with adjusted OR ratio of 0.40, 95% CI = 0.16,1.004, (p<0.001). Complications of pain treatment were respiratory depression (0.7%), nausea (25.6%), vomiting (11.4%), pruritus (4.1%), and urinary retention (0.3%). The majority of the patients were satisfied with pain control (81.4%).
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of moderate to severe pain in the present study was high and duration of cardiopulmonary bypass was the only factor affected Still, most patients were satisfied with the pain treatment."

METHODS: This prospective study consisted of 102 patients with FMF in attack-free period, and 40 matched healthy controls. Of the patients, nine were diagnosed as amyloidosis. The patients were divided into two groups according to eGFR as below 120 mL per minute and above 120 mL per minute. Also, patients were divided into three groups according to the degree of urinary albumin excretion as normoalbuminuric, microalbuminuric, and macroalbuminuric. The serum levels of IL-18 (sIL-18) and NGAL (sNGAL), and urinary levels of IL-18 (uIL-18) and NGAL (uNGAL) were measured by using ELISA kits.
RESULTS: The levels of sIL-18, sNGAL, uIL-18, and uNGAL were detected significantly higher in FMF patients, particularly in patients with amyloidosis, when compared to controls. sNGAL, uIL-18, and uNGAL were significantly higher in patients with eGFR < 120 mL per minute than in patients with eGFR ≥ 120 mL per minute. sNGAL, uIL-18, and uNGAL were correlated significantly with urinary albumin excretion, additionally, were inverse correlated with eGFR. The most remarkable findings of this study are of the higher values of sIL-18, sNGAL, uIL-18, and uNGAL in both normoalbuminuric FMF patients and patients with eGFR ≥ 120 mL per minute.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that sIL-18, uIL-18, sNGAL, and uNGAL are reliable markers of early renal disfunction in FMF patients, and may let us take measures from the early stage of renal involvement."

In framing treatment plans, cancer specialists tend to intimate that elderly patients are like the children living in Garrison Keillor's mythical Lake Wobegon: above average and thus likely to exceed expectations. In this article, we use the story of our mother's death from lung cancer to investigate the consequences of elderly people's inability to reconcile the grave reality of their illness with the overly optimistic predictions of their physicians.
METHODS: In this narrative analysis, we examine the routine treatment of elderly, terminally ill cancer patients through alternating lenses: the lens of a historian of medicine who also teaches ethics to medical students and the lens of an actuary who is able to assess physicians' claims for the outcome of medical treatments.
FINDINGS: We recognize that a desire to instill hope in patients shapes physicians' messages. We argue, however, that the automatic optimism conveyed to elderly, dying patients by cancer specialists prompts those patients to choose treatment that is ineffective and debilitating. Rather than primarily prolong life, treatments most notably diminish patients' quality of life, weaken the ability of patients and their families to prepare for their deaths, and contribute significantly to the unsustainable costs of the U.S. health care system.
CONCLUSIONS: The case described in this article suggests how physicians can better help elderly, terminally ill patients make medical decisions that are less damaging to them and less costly to the health care system."
24320433,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24320433/,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the usefulness of a six-degrees-of freedom (6D) correction using ExacTrac robotics system in patients with head-and-neck (HN) cancer receiving radiation therapy.
METHODS: Local setup accuracy was analyzed for 12 patients undergoing intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Patient position was imaged daily upon two different protocols, cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), and ExacTrac (ET) images correction. Setup data from either approach were compared in terms of both residual errors after correction and punctual displacement of selected regions of interest (Mandible, C2, and C6 vertebral bodies).
RESULTS: On average, both protocols achieved reasonably low residual errors after initial correction. The observed differences in shift vectors between the two protocols showed that CBCT tends to weight more C2 and C6 at the expense of the mandible, while ET tends to average more differences among the different ROIs.
CONCLUSIONS: CBCT, even without 6D correction capabilities, seems preferable to ET for better consistent alignment and the capability to see soft tissues. Therefore, in our experience, CBCT represents a benchmark for positioning head and neck cancer patients."
24320704,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24320704/,"AIM: We aimed to determine the relationship between eating attitudes and psychiatric symptoms in women with hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) and to compare these women with healthy control subjects.
METHODS: The study sample included 48 women with HG, and the control group had 44 pregnant women. The patients were selected from women with HG hospitalized in the obstetric inpatient clinic. All of the participants were in the first trimester of pregnancy. The participants' sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were recorded in the obstetric clinic. All of the participants completed a Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Eating Attitudes Test (EAT) and Body Image Scale (BIS).
RESULTS: Women with HG were more likely to have had a history of HG during their previous pregnancy (P<0.05). There was no significant difference between the study and control groups regarding obstetric history. Women with HG were more influenced by food that induced nausea. There was no significant difference between the study and control groups for pre-pregnancy nausea, food craving and the initial BMI (P>0.05). Depression and anxiety scores were significantly higher in women with HG (P<0.05). However, there was no significant difference between the study and control groups for body image score and eating attitude test scores (P>0.05).
CONCLUSION: We suggest that HG appears to be associated with depression and anxiety symptoms rather than deterioration of eating attitudes and body image. However, these results should be confirmed by prospective and clinical studies."
24320787,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24320787/,"OBJECTIVE: A recent pharmacokinetic study with buprenorphine transdermal patches showed similar systemic exposures of buprenorphine in subjects aged ≥75 and 50-60 years. The current prospective, open-label study aimed to verify this in a clinical setting by evaluating efficacy and safety of buprenorphine patches in patients with chronic osteoarthritis (OA) pain.
METHODS: Patients with chronic, moderate to severe osteoarthritic pain (hip and/or knee) were enrolled: 50-60 years (younger group, N = 65) and ≥75 years (elderly group, N = 57). After 2 weeks on paracetamol only, patients received buprenorphine patches (5-40 µg/h) for 12 weeks. Paracetamol rescue was provided. Primary endpoint was the Box-Scale-11 (BS-11) score for pain on average over the last week. WOMAC OA Index, EQ-5D, Patients' and Investigators' Global Assessment of Pain Relief, rescue medication use, sleep disturbance and quality of sleep were secondary efficacy endpoints.
RESULTS: Both groups showed a statistically significant (p < 0.0001) and clinically relevant change from baseline to last visit in BS-11 score, with no significant difference between groups. The least squares (LS) mean change from baseline was 2.20 in elderly and 1.87 in younger patients, with an age group difference of 0.33 (95% CI: -0.42, 1.07). Non-inferiority of the elderly versus the younger group was shown. Both age groups showed a significant improvement in WOMAC total score, patients' overall health state (EQ-5D visual analogue scale) and sleep quality, and a significant reduction in rescue use and nights woken due to pain, with no significant differences between groups. Elderly patients tolerated buprenorphine patches at least as well as younger patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Efficacy and tolerability of buprenorphine patches was demonstrated in chronic pain patients, regardless of age, supporting the conclusion that no age-related dose adjustment of transdermal buprenorphine is needed. A study limitation is lack of active control but no other opioid was appropriate in elderly patients or this indication."
24321223,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24321223/,"PURPOSE: This prospective study was aimed at assessing cleft lip and palate (CLP) patients' opinions and attitudes towards their upper lip and nose and the number of secondary corrective surgical interventions electively undertaken to upper lip and nose that were carried out during a 2 year follow-up period.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: During a 2 year follow-up period CLP outpatients were recruited for the study who attended follow-up examinations at a cleft lip and palate craniofacial center and received a recommendation for secondary corrective facial surgery. The participants filled in a questionnaire that included questions regarding the patients' opinions and attitudes towards appearance of lip and nose and need for secondary corrective facial surgery. During an additional interval of 2 years the rate of patients who underwent secondary corrective surgery to lip and nose was documented.
RESULTS: Out of 362 CLP patients 37 (mean age 13.6 ± 7.6 years) received a recommendation for secondary corrective surgery to upper lip and/or nose. 22 patients (mean age 12.6 ± 6.3 years) filled in the questionnaire (response rate of 62.1%). The satisfaction with the overall facial appearance following the first corrective operation was statistically significantly better than the satisfaction with the nose (p = .016). The satisfaction with facial symmetry (5.6 ± 2.0) did not differ statistically significantly from the overall satisfaction with the facial appearance (6.2 ± 1.8; p = .093). Significantly fewer patients (n = 9) opted for corrective surgery compared to the number of patients who got the recommendation to have secondary corrective surgery done (n = 22, p < .0005).
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study may reflect a high overall patient satisfaction with the primary treatment outcome following surgery for CLP. Perceived patient need for secondary operation for the lip/nose may be as low as 5%."
24321266,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24321266/,"BACKGROUND: The objective was to evaluate the difference in timing (if any) of in-hospital carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or outcomes of CEA based on sex among men and women hospitalized for carotid artery disease.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cross-sectional study using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample Database. All patients from 2000-2009 who underwent CEA during their hospitalization were examined. International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision codes were used to identify patients who underwent CEA during hospitalization, stratify asymptomatic and symptomatic patients, determine time in days from admission to CEA, and examine in-hospital complications, including perioperative stroke, cardiac events, and death. Statistical analysis was performed with chi-squared and t-tests. Linear and logistic regression models were used to evaluate relationships between sex and outcomes. The main outcome measures were time from admission to surgery, in-hospital mortality, complications, mean duration of stay, and discharge disposition.
RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-one thousand two hundred fifty three patients underwent CEA during hospitalization. More than 9% (9.2%) had symptomatic carotid artery disease. Among symptomatic patients, bivariate analysis found that women had a longer mean time from admission to surgery (2.8 vs. 2.6 days; P < 0.001) and a longer duration of hospital stay (6.4 vs. 5.9 days; P < 0.001) than their male counterparts. However, there was no difference between men and women with regard to rates of perioperative stroke, cardiac complications, myocardial infarction, or death. Among asymptomatic patients, women had a longer mean time from admission to surgery (0.53 vs. 0.48 days; P < 0.001) and a trend toward increased perioperative stroke (0.6% vs. 0.5%; P = 0.06), but a lower rate of cardiac complications (1.5% vs. 1.7%; P = 0.01) and in-hospital mortality (0.26% vs. 0.31%; P = 0.05). However, on multivariable analysis adjusting for differences in age, elective status, insurance, race, hospital location, hospital region, and hospital teaching status, there was no sex disparity in time from admission to surgery, regardless of symptomatic status. In addition, asymptomatic women were less likely than men to have a cardiac complication (odds ratio [OR]: 0.90; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.83-0.97) or in-hospital mortality (OR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.70-0.98). Symptomatic women were also less likely than men to have a cardiac complication (OR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.63-0.97).
CONCLUSIONS: In this decade-long national population-based study of hospitalized patients undergoing CEA, women had lower perioperative cardiac morbidity and mortality rates than men. After adjusting for patient, clinical, and hospital factors, there is no discernible difference in timing of CEA based on sex."
24321400,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24321400/,"OBJECTIVE: In Denmark, the proportion of women with ovarian cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) has increased, and the use of NACT varies among center hospitals. We aimed to evaluate the impact of first-line treatment on surgical outcome and median overall survival (MOS).
METHODS: All patients treated in Danish referral centers with stage IIIC or IV epithelial ovarian cancer from January 2005 to October 2011 were included. Data were obtained from the Danish Gynecological Cancer Database, the Danish National Patient Register and medical records.
RESULTS: Of the 1677 eligible patients, 990 (59%) were treated with primary debulking surgery (PDS), 515 (31%) with NACT, and 172 (10%) received palliative treatment. Of the patients referred to NACT, 335 (65%) received interval debulking surgery (IDS). Patients treated with NACT-IDS had shorter operation times, less blood loss, less extensive surgery, fewer intraoperative complications and a lower frequency of residual tumor (p < 0.05 for all). No difference in MOS was found between patients treated with PDS (31.9 months) and patients treated with NACT-IDS (29.4 months), p = 0.099. Patients without residual tumor after surgery had better MOS when treated with PDS compared with NACT-IDS (55.5 and 36.7 months, respectively, p = 0.002). In a multivariate analysis, NACT-IDS was associated with increased risk of death after two years of follow-up (HR: 1.81; CI: 1.39-2.35).
CONCLUSIONS: No difference in MOS was observed between PDS and NACT-IDS. However, patients without residual tumor had superior MOS when treated with PDS, and NACT-IDS could be associated with increased risk of death after two years of follow-up."
24321695,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24321695/,"OBJECTIVES: Previous studies have reported inconsistent evidence on associations between adolescents involved in different bullying subgroups (victims, offenders and offender-victims) and alcohol use. In addition, little is known about the underlying mechanisms between these bullying subgroups and alcohol use. The aim of this study was to clarify the association between the different bullying subgroups and alcohol use by investigating whether it is mediated by drinking motives.
METHODS: Structural equation models were estimated based on a nationally representative sample of 2548 alcohol-experienced 12 to 17-year-olds who participated in the 2010 Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children survey in Switzerland.
RESULTS: Consistent for both alcohol outcomes (drunkenness and drinking volume), male and female offenders presented higher levels of alcohol use than those not involved in bullying, not only per se (direct link) but also due to higher levels of enhancement and social drinking motives (indirect link). Victims, meanwhile, presented lower levels of alcohol use through an indirect link, with lower levels of enhancement (boys and girls) and social motives (boys). The higher levels of alcohol use among offender-victims were mediated by all four drinking motives among girls, and in particular by coping motives among boys.
CONCLUSIONS: In most cases, different levels of alcohol use in the bullying subgroups are due to differences in drinking motives. For prevention, it is important to take account of the differences in drinking motives and problems of offenders, victims and offender-victims."
24321702,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24321702/,"BACKGROUND: Cosmetic skin lightening is practiced worldwide. Mercury is a well-documented melanotoxin added to some lightening products. However, mercury can cause many dermatologic, renal, and neurologic problems. The Food and Drug Administration limits the amount of mercury in cosmetic products to trace amounts, 1 ppm.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to quantitatively evaluate a large international sample of lightening products for mercury content, focusing on products available to US consumers either online or in stores.
METHODS: A total of 549 skin-lightening products, manufactured in 32 countries, were purchased online in the United States, Taiwan, and Japan and in stores in the United States, China, Taiwan, Thailand, Japan, and Sri Lanka. Cosmetics were screened for mercury content above 200 ppm using a low-cost portable x-ray fluorescence spectrometer.
RESULTS: Of the 549 tested products, 6.0% (n = 33) contained mercury above 1000 ppm. In all, 45% of mercury-containing samples contained mercury in excess of 10,000 ppm. Of lightening products purchased in the United States, 3.3% were found to contain mercury in excess of 1000 ppm.
LIMITATIONS: Our study did not evaluate creams for other melanosuppressive ingredients. Only 1 sample of each product was tested.
CONCLUSION: Our study confirms the national and global presence of mercury in skin-lightening products."

DESIGN: Cross-sectional bottom-up cost of illness study nested within the multicenter German AgeCoDe-cohort.
SETTING: Community and nursing homes.
PARTICIPANTS: One hundred twenty-eight community-dwelling dementia patients and 48 dementia patients living in nursing homes.
INTERVENTION: None.
MEASUREMENTS: Utilization and costs of medical care and long term care, including formal and informal social and nursing care based on proxy interviews. Informal care was valued using the replacement cost method.
RESULTS: Unadjusted mean annual total costs including informal care were €29,930 ($43,997) for community-dwelling patients and €33,482 ($49,218) for patients living in nursing homes. However, multiple regression analysis controlling for age, sex, deficits in basic and instrumental activities of daily living and comorbidity showed that living in the community significantly increased total costs by €11,344 ($16,676; P < .01) compared with living in a nursing home, mainly due to higher costs of informal care (+€20,585; +$30,260; P < .001).
CONCLUSION: From the societal perspective care for dementia patients living in the community tends to cost more than care in nursing homes when functional impairment is controlled for."
24322063,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24322063/,"BACKGROUND: Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) suffer from impaired gait and mobility. These changes in motor function have been associated with cognitive deficits that also commonly co-occur in PD, especially executive function (EF) and attention.
OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that a cognitive remediation program would enhance gait and mobility.
METHODS: The 18 PD patients in this study were assessed at baseline and again one and four weeks after completion of a 12 week long, home-based computerized cognitive training program. Subjects were asked to ""play"" computer games designed to improve EF and attention for 30 minutes a day, three times per week for 12 weeks, while seated. The Timed Up and Go (TUG), gait speed, and stride time variability quantified mobility. A previously validated, computerized neuropsychological battery quantified global cognitive function and its sub-domains.
RESULTS: Compared to pre-training values, global cognitive scores and time to complete the TUG significantly improved after the training. TUG components of turning speed and duration also improved. Other TUG components, gait speed, and variability did not change after training.
CONCLUSIONS: These initial findings suggest that computerized cognitive training can improve cognitive function and has a beneficial carryover effect to certain aspects of mobility in patients with PD. Additional studies are required to replicate these findings and more fully assess the underlying mechanisms. Nonetheless, the present results underscore the motor-cognitive link in PD and suggest that computerized cognitive training may be applied as a therapeutic option to enhance mobility in patients with PD."
24322177,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24322177/,"BACKGROUND: The worldwide introduction of multimodal enhanced recovery programs has also changed perioperative care in patients who undergo liver resection. This study was performed to assess current perioperative practice in liver surgery in 11 European HPB centers and compare it to enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) principles.
METHODS: In each unit, 15 consecutive patients (N = 165) who underwent hepatectomy between 2010 and 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. Compliance was classified as ""full,"" ""partial,"" or ""poor"" whenever ≥ 80, ≥ 50, or <50 % of the 22 ERAS protocol core items were met. The primary study end point was overall compliance with the ERAS core program per unit and per perioperative phase.
RESULTS: Most patients were operated on for malignancy (91 %) and 56 % were minor hepatectomies. The median number of implemented ERAS core items was 9 (range = 7-12) across all centers. Compliance was partial in the preoperative (median 2 of 3 items, range = 1-3) and perioperative phases (median 5 of 10 items, range: 4-7). Median postoperative compliance was poor (median 2 of 9 items, range = 0-4). A statistically significant difference was observed between median length of stay and median time to recovery (7 vs. 5 days, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Perioperative care among centers that perform liver resections varied substantially. In current HPB surgical practice, some elements of the ERAS program, e.g., preoperative counselling and minimal fasting, have already been implemented. Elements in the perioperative phase (avoidance of drains and nasogastric tube) and postoperative phase (early resumption of oral intake, early mobilization, and use of recovery criteria) should be further optimized."
24322187,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24322187/,"CONTEXT: Hepatopathies can significantly influence both veins and arteries, these changes may cause some cutaneous stigmas, such as spider angioma (SA) and some systemic vascular changes, such as those observed in hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS). Based on this common pathophysiological root we can assume that the SA can be skin markers of HPS.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to assess whether there is a relationship between the presence of SA and HPS.
METHODS: Records of 40 patients with liver cirrhosis who underwent contrast echocardiography were evaluated, in which we researched the description of SA, physical examination, and other clinical and laboratory data. For diagnosis of HPS we use these signs of the disease: presence of liver disease (cirrhosis in the case), abnormalities in gas exchange by arterial blood gases, and evidence of pulmonary vasodilations by the contrast echocardiography.
RESULTS: The SA were found in 21/40 (52.5%) patients and hepatopulmonary syndrome in 9/40 (22.5%). The HPS was observed in 8/21 (38.1%) of patients with SA and 1/19 (5.3%) patients were without this sign (P<0.01). We found no statistically significant difference between the SA and the presence of HPS with sex or age. Patients with SA had a higher hypoxemia [PaO2 84.8 ± 11.5 mmHg and 19.8 ± 14.7 mmHg alveolar-arterial gradient of oxygen (AAG)] than those without SA (PaO2 90.8 ± 10.7 mmHg and 10.9 ± 11.7 AAG mmHg) (P<0.05).
CONCLUSION: Our findings show a correlation between the presence of SA and HPS, suggesting that the SA may be cutaneous markers of HPS."

METHODS: From July 2009 to January 2011, 88 cases with off-pump CABG were divided into 4 groups:group C including 19 cases without preoperative aspirin or local administration of TA, group A including 23 cases with preoperative aspirin alone, group T including 19 cases with local administration of TA alone, and group AT including 27 cases with both preoperative aspirin and local administration of TA.
RESULTS: The bleeding volume after 24 hours in group A was significantly larger than that in group C(p=0.0085). The bleeding volume in group AT was significantly smaller than that in group A (p<0.0001), and the bleeding volume in group T was also significantly smaller than that in group C (p=0.0054). There was no significant difference between group T and AT.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of local administration of tranexamic acid indicated the reduction of postoperative bleeding even in patients with preoperative aspirin use."
24322801,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24322801/,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between pathologic myopia and the dry eye syndrome.
METHODS: Forty-five patients with a spherical equivalence (SE) greater than -6.0 diopters (D) and an axial length (AL) >26.5 mm were assigned to the pathological myopia group (group 1). Forty-four healthy individuals were selected from subjects with emmetropia whose SE values ranged from -1.0 to +1.0 D (group 2). Ocular surface disease index (OSDI) scores of all the patients were determined. All the participants underwent the following: Schirmer 1 test without anesthesia, corneal staining, tear break-up time (TBUT), Schirmer 1 test with anesthesia, and AL measurement.
RESULTS: The mean age of group 1 and group 2 patients was 40.2 ± 12.3 and 38.8 ± 9.3 years. The mean values of SE, keratometry, and AL were -9.6 ± 3.8 D, 43.9 ± 1.1 D, and 27.4 ± 0.6 mm in group 1 and -0.1 ± 0.5 D, 42.3 ± 1.4 D, and 23.0 ± 0.2 mm in group 2. The mean values of the Schirmer 1 test without and with anesthesia were 14.4 ± 6.1 and 9.5 ± 4.5 mm in group 1 and 16.7 ± 6.2 and 11.4 ± 6.0 mm in group 2. The mean TBUT in group 1 was 7.2 ± 3.4 seconds, whereas that in group 2 was 13.6 ± 3.7 seconds. There was a significant difference between the groups in SE, keratometry, AL, TBUT, and OSDI scores (P < 0.001).

24323687,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24323687/,"BACKGROUND: For hip and knee arthroplasties, an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score greater than 2 is associated with an increased risk of medical and surgical complications. No study, to our knowledge, has evaluated this relationship for total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) or reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (reverse TSA).
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We aimed to assess the relationship between the ASA score and (1) surgical complications, (2) medical complications, and (3) hospitalization length after TSA, reverse TSA, and revision arthroplasty.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed all patients who had undergone TSAs, reverse TSAs, or revision arthroplasties by the senior author (EGM) from November 1999 through July 2011 who had at least 6 months' followup. Of the 485 procedures, 452 (93.2%) met the inclusion criteria. Data were collected on patient demographics, comorbidities, hospitalization length, and short-term (≤ 6 months) medical and surgical complications. Logistic regression analysis modeled the risk of having postoperative complications develop as a function of the ASA score.
RESULTS: Patients with an ASA score greater than 2 had a greater risk of having a surgical complication develop (p < 0.001; OR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.36-3.70) and three times the risk of prosthesis failure (ie, component dislocation, component loosening, and hardware failure) (p < 0.001; OR, 3.23; 95% CI, 1.54-6.67). Higher ASA scores were associated with prolonged length of hospitalization (effect size 0.46, p < 0.001), but not medical complications.
CONCLUSIONS: ASA score is associated with surgical, but not medical, complications after TSA and reverse TSA. The ASA score could be used for risk assessment and preoperative counseling.

The purpose of this study was to compare the outcomes of supraglottoplasty in premature infants with congenital laryngomalacia (LM) with that of term infants.
STUDY DESIGN: Case series with chart review.
SETTING: Tertiary-care pediatric institution.
METHODS: Analysis was performed on 325 consecutive patients undergoing SGP between 2004 and 2012. Patients older than 12 months age or with syndrome, neurologic, or cardiac comorbidities were excluded. Resolution of airway symptoms after SGP was considered successful while revision SGP and tracheostomy were considered failures. The rates of secondary airway lesions (SAL), dysphagia, and gastrostomy tube (GT) placement were also compared.
RESULTS: A total of 176 infants (136 term, 40 preterm) were identified. SGP was successful in 92.7% term and 90% preterm infants with no significant difference (P = .5865). Incidence of revision SGP and tracheostomy was similar among the groups. The outcomes of SGP were the same in all groups stratified by age. Incidence of SAL was significantly higher in preterm (72.5%) compared to term infants (34.6%, P = .0002). Dysphagia rates in the follow-up were higher in preterm (32.5%) versus term infants (6.6%, P < .001). The rate of GT insertion was significantly greater (P = .003) in preterm (27.5%) than term infants (6.6%). The preoperative dysphagia, persistent dysphagia, and GT in follow-up was significantly higher when gestation age <32 weeks (25%, P = .0168).
CONCLUSION: Supraglottoplasty outcomes in term and preterm infants were similar irrespective of gestation age. Higher rates of dysphagia in follow-up are seen when gestation age <32 weeks."
24325267,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24325267/,"BACKGROUND: Use of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), such as artemether-lumefantrine (AL), requires a strict dosing schedule that follows the drugs' pharmacokinetic properties. The quality of malaria case management was assessed in two areas in rural Tanzania, to ascertain patient characteristics and facility-specific factors that influence correct dosing of AL for management of uncomplicated malaria.
METHODS: Exit interviews were conducted with patients attending health facilities for initial illness consultation. Information about health workers' training and supervision visits was collected. Health facilities were inventoried for capacity and availability of medical products related to care of malaria patients. The outcome was correct dosing of AL based on age and weight. Logistic regression was used to assess health facility factors and patient characteristics associated with correct dosing of AL by age and weight.
RESULTS: A total of 1,531 patients were interviewed, but 60 pregnant women were excluded from the analysis. Only 503 (34.2%) patients who received AL were assessed for correct dosing. Most patients who received AL (85.3%) were seen in public health facilities, 75.7% in a dispensary and 91.1% in a facility that had AL in stock on the survey day. Overall, 92.1% (463) of AL prescriptions were correct by age or weight; but 85.7% of patients received correct dosing by weight alone and 78.5% received correct dosing by age alone. In multivariate analysis, patients in the middle dosing bands in terms of age or weight, had statistically significant lower odds of correct AL dosing (p < 0.05) compared to those in the lowest age or weight group. Other factors such as health worker supervision and training on ACT did not improve the odds of correct AL dosing.
CONCLUSION: Although malaria treatment guidelines indicate AL dosing can be prescribed based on age or weight of the patient, findings from this study show that patients within the middle age and weight dosing bands were least likely to receive a correct dose by either measure. Clinicians should be made aware of AL dosing errors for patients aged three to 12 years and advised to use weight-based prescriptions whenever possible."
24325290,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24325290/,"CONTEXT: Low knowledge of long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARC) and restrictive counseling practices have been documented among contraceptive care clinicians. However, little is known about health educators' counseling on LARC, how their practices compare with clinicians' and their specific training needs.
METHODS: A survey conducted in 2011-2012 assessed knowledge and practices related to LARC counseling and provision among 410 staff at 40 Planned Parenthood clinics. Clinicians' and health educators' knowledge and practices were compared via chi-square tests; use of evidence-based criteria was assessed in multivariable logistic regression analyses.
RESULTS: At least half of both types of staff routinely discussed LARC with clients, and nearly all considered the methods safe. Health educators considered a smaller proportion of clients candidates for LARC than did clinicians (57% vs. 77%), and they were less likely to consider IUDs for teenagers (79% vs. 96%), nulliparous women (82% vs. 98%) and unmarried clients (90% vs. 99%). In a multivariable model, health educators were less likely than clinicians to counsel clients using the least restrictive evidence-based criteria (odds ratio, 0.1). Sixty-four percent of health educators and 40% of clinicians desired additional LARC training.
CONCLUSION: Even in clinics that specialize in reproductive health care, health educators are less likely than clinicians to apply current evidence-based criteria in counseling about LARC. To provide evidence-based contraceptive counseling, health educators need training on LARC eligibility and indications."
24325349,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24325349/,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Participation in leisure and play activities is recognised as an important outcome in occupational therapy for children. To investigate whether children's psychological self-concept are predictive of their activity preferences and leisure participation.
METHOD: A group of 38 healthy children aged 10-14 years from Victoria, Australia completed the Piers-Harris Self Concept Scale (Piers Harris-2) and the Children's Assessment of Participation and Enjoyment/Preferences for Activities of Children (CAPE/PAC). Correlation and regression analyses were completed to investigate the predictive relationships between the Pier Harris-2 and the CAPE/PAC.
RESULTS: The Piers Harris-2 Intellectual and School Status subscale was found to be predictive of children's Overall Enjoyment of Participation as measured on the CAPE, explaining 21.9% of the total variance (β = 0.566, P < 0.01). The Piers Harris-2 Freedom from Anxiety subscale made a unique contribution to children's preferences for skill-based activities as measured by the PAC, explaining 18.9% of the total variance (β = -.435, P < 0.01). Children's gender accounted for 22.7% of the total variance of the PAC Physical Activities subscale (β = -.476, P ≤ 0.01) and 14.6% of the PAC Preferences for Skill-Based Activities subscale (β = 0.382, P ≤ 0.05) while age made unique contributions to the PAC Social Activities subscale (β = -0.418, P ≤ 0.01) explaining 17.5% of its total variance.
CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that children's psychological self-concept, age and gender are predictive of components of children's activity preferences and leisure participation. In particular, participation enjoyment is influenced by their perceived self-esteem and how well they do at school. Further investigation of this topic is recommended."
24325639,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24325639/,"BACKGROUND: Students in German medical schools frequently complain that the subject 'clinical examination' is not taught in a satisfying manner due to time constraints and lack of personnel resources. While the effectiveness and efficiency of practice-oriented teaching in small groups using near-peer teaching has been shown, it is rarely used in German medical schools. We investigated whether adding a new near-peer teaching course developed with student input plus patient examination under supervision in small groups improves basic clinical examination skills in third year medical students compared to a traditional clinical examination course alone.
METHODS: Third year medical students registered for the mandatory curricular clinical examination course at the medical faculty of the Technische Universität München were invited to participate in a randomised trial with blinded outcome assessment. Students were randomised to the control group participating in the established curricular physical examination course or to the intervention group, which received additional near-peer teaching for the same content. The learning success was verified by a voluntary objective structured clinical examination (OSCE).
RESULTS: A total of 84 students were randomised and 53 (63%) participated in the final OSCE. Students in the control group scored a median of 57% (25th percentile 47%, 75th percentile 61%) of the maximum possible total points of the OSCE compared to 77% (73%, 80%; p < 0.001) for students in the intervention group. Only two students in the intervention group received a lower score than the best student in the control group.
CONCLUSION: Adding a near-peer teaching course to the routine course significantly improved the clinical examination skills of medical students in an efficient manner in the context of a resource-constrained setting."
24326010,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24326010/,"OBJECTIVES: To identify new susceptibility loci for Behçet's disease (BD), we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using DNA pooling.
METHODS: Two replicate pools of 292 Iranian BD cases and of 294 age- and sex-matched controls were allelotyped in quadruplicate on the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0. Of the 51 top markers, 47 were technically validated through individually genotyping. Replication of validated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was performed in an independent Iranian dataset (684 cases and 532 controls).
RESULTS: In addition to the well-established HLA-B locus, rs7528842 in a gene desert on chromosome 1p21.2, and rs632111 at the 3'UTR of FUT2 were associated in both the discovery and replication datasets (individually and in combination). However, only the FUT2 SNP was associated in a previous GWAS for BD in Turkish people. Fine-mapping of FUT2 in the full Iranian dataset showed additional associations in five coding SNPs (2.97E-06<pcombined<1.34E-04), including the rs601338 nonsense (W143X) variant which, in Caucasians, determines the secretion of the H antigen (precursor of the ABO blood group antigens) in body fluids and on the intestinal mucosa. Meta-analysis with the published Turkish GWAS data strengthened the FUT2 associations (4.78E-09<pmeta<1.66E-07).
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests for the first time a putative link between a specific gene and environment in the aetiopathogenesis of BD. The non-secretor phenotype affects mucosal glycosylation, which may explain its known association with dysbiosis and altered susceptibility to infections. A different antigenic stimulation in early life and consequent increased propensity for autoimmunity and inflammation may contribute to BD development."
24326018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24326018/,"PURPOSE: Although the bilateral sagittal split osteotomy (BSSO) is a routinely performed procedure, exact control of the lingual fracture line remains problematic. The purpose of this study was to determine the various lingual splitting patterns in cadaveric human mandibles after a BSSO and the possible influence of the mandibular canal and mylohyoid groove on the lingual fracture line.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The investigators designed and implemented a case series to compare different lingual fracture lines. A standardized SSO was performed on 40 cadaveric hemimandibles using elevators and splitting forceps. The primary outcome variable during this study was the lingual fracture pattern possibly influenced by independent variables: the mandibular canal, the mylohyoid groove, and dental status. Descriptive and analytic statistics were computed for each study variable.
RESULTS: Most lingual fractures (72.5%) ended in the mandibular foramen. Only 25% of fractures were ""true"" Hunsuck fractures, and no ""bad splits"" occurred. In addition, 35% of lingual fractures ran more than halfway or entirely through the mandibular canal, whereas only 30% of fractures ran along the mylohyoid groove. However, when the lingual fracture ran along this groove, it had a 6-fold greater chance of ending in the mandibular foramen.
CONCLUSIONS: The hypothesis that the mandibular canal or mylohyoid groove would function as the path of least resistance was only partly confirmed. The use of splitters and separators did not increase the incidence of bad splits compared with the literature."
24326029,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24326029/,"PURPOSE: We tested the hypothesis that whiplash trauma leads to changes of the signal intensity of cervical discs in T2-weighted images.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: 50 whiplash patients (18-65 years) were examined within 48h after motor vehicle accident, and again after 3 and 6 months and compared to 50 age- and sex-matched controls. Signal intensity in ROI's of the discs at the levels C2/3 to C7/T1 and the adjacent vertebral bodies were measured on sagittal T2 weighted MR images and normalized using the average of ROI's in fat tissue. The contrast between discs and both adjacent vertebrae was calculated and disc degeneration was graded by the Pfirrmann-grading system.
RESULTS: Whiplash trauma did not have a significant effect on the normalized signals from discs and vertebrae, on the contrast between discs and adjacent vertebrae, or on the Pfirrmann grading. However, the contrast between discs and adjacent vertebrae and the Pfirrmann grading showed a strong correlation. In healthy volunteers, the contrast between discs and adjacent vertebrae and Pfirrmann grading increased with age and was dependent on the disc level.
CONCLUSION: We could not find any trauma related changes of cervical disc signal intensities. Normalized signals of discs and Pfirrmann grading changed with age and varied between disc levels with the used MR sequence."
24326153,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24326153/,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity in term and late preterm babies with severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and its relationship to the severity and treatment of this disorder, regardless of level of G6PD activity (deficient/normal).
METHODS: A total of 529 term and late preterm (≥35 weeks) infants (228 female, 301 male) who were diagnosed with severe hyperbilirubinemia were included in this study. In each case, serum was collected to evaluate blood group, direct Coombs' test, complete blood cell count, total and direct bilirubin, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and G6PD activity. A partial correlation analysis was carried out to assess the relationship between G6PD activity and total bilirubin levels.
RESULTS: A significant correlation was found between the severity of hyperbilirubinemia and G6PD activity in both males and females. Male neonates who had G6PD levels <12 U/g Hb required more phototherapy time than neonates who had G6PD levels ≥12 U/g Hb; and female neonates who had G6PD levels <16 U/g Hb required more phototherapy time than neonates who had G6PD levels ≥16 U/g Hb (p < 0.0001). When we analyzed only breastfed infants, a significant difference also emerged in both sexes. Decreased G6PD activity was associated with increased phototherapy time and the need for exchange transfusion.
CONCLUSION: Routine checks of G6PD level in hyperbilirubinemic neonates are very important in providing proper medical management to prevent bilirubin-induced neurological dysfunction. Appropriate identification of G6PD (<12 U/g Hb for male infants and <16 U/g Hb for female infants) raises awareness of the severity of the condition and the necessity for immediate care of severe hyperbilirubinemic infants."
24326179,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24326179/,"BACKGROUND: A novel data warehouse based on automated retrieval from an institutional health care information system (HIS) was made available to be compared with a traditional prospectively maintained surgical database.
METHODS: A newly established institutional data warehouse at a single-institution academic medical center autopopulated by HIS was queried for International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis codes for pancreatic neoplasm. Patients with ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes for pancreatic neoplasm were captured. A parallel query was performed using a prospective database populated by manual entry. Duplicated patients and those unique to either data set were identified. All patients were manually reviewed to determine the accuracy of diagnosis.
RESULTS: A total of 1107 patients were identified from the HIS-linked data set with pancreatic neoplasm from 1999-2009. Of these, 254 (22.9%) patients were also captured by the surgical database, whereas 853 (77.1%) patients were only in the HIS-linked data set. Manual review of the HIS-only group demonstrated that 45.0% of patients were without identifiable pancreatic pathology, suggesting erroneous capture, whereas 36.3% of patients were consistent with pancreatic neoplasm and 18.7% with other pancreatic pathology. Of the 394 patients identified by the surgical database, 254 (64.5%) patients were captured by HIS, whereas 140 (35.5%) patients were not. Manual review of patients only captured by the surgical database demonstrated 85.9% with pancreatic neoplasm and 14.1% with other pancreatic pathology. Finally, review of the 254 patient overlap demonstrated that 80.3% of patients had pancreatic neoplasm and 19.7% had other pancreatic pathology.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that cautious interpretation of administrative data rely only on ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes and clinical correlation through previously validated mechanisms."

It was observed that those individuals who accrued more LTM from adolescence to adulthood had significantly greater adult bone structural strength at the hip.
INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to identify whether young adult bone cross-sectional area (CSA), section modulus (Z), and outer diameter (OD) at the hip were associated with adolescent LTM accrual.
METHODS: One hundred three young adult participants (55 males, 48 females) were tertiled into adolescent LTM accrual groupings. LTM accrual was assessed by serial measures using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) from adolescence to young adulthood (21.3 ± 1.3 years). CSA, Z, and OD at the narrow neck (NN) and femoral shaft (S) sites of the proximal femur were assessed in young adulthood (21.3 ± 4.5 years), using hip structural analysis. Group differences were assessed using an analysis of covariance, controlling for adult height, weight, sex, and physical activity levels.
RESULTS: It was found that individuals with higher adjusted adolescent LTM accrual had significantly greater adult adjusted values of NNCSA (2.49 ± 0.06 vs 2.77 ± 0.07 cm(2)), NN Z (1.18 ± 0.04 vs 1.37 ± 0.04 cm(3)), NN OD (3.07 ± 0.04 vs 3.21 ± 0.04 cm), SCSA (3.45 ± 0.08 vs 3.88 ± 0.09 cm(3)), and SZ (1.77 ± 0.05 vs 2.00 ± 0.05 cm(3)) than individuals with lower LTM accrual (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the amount of LTM accrued from adolescence to young adulthood has a positive influence on adult bone structural strength at the proximal femur."
24327371,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24327371/,"BACKGROUND: The Institute of Medicine recommended that survivors of cancer and their primary care providers receive survivorship care plans (SCPs) to summarize cancer treatment and plan ongoing care. However, the use of SCPs remains limited.
METHODS: Oncology providers at 14 National Cancer Institute Community Cancer Centers Program hospitals completed a survey regarding their perceptions of SCPs, including barriers to implementation, strategies for implementation, the role of oncology providers, and the importance of topics in SCPs (diagnosis, treatment, recommended ongoing care, and the aspects of ongoing care that the oncology practice will provide).
RESULTS: Among 245 providers (response rate of 70%), 52% reported ever providing any component of an SCP to patients. The most widely reported barriers were lack of personnel and time to create SCPs (69% and 64% of respondents, respectively). The most widely endorsed strategy among those using SCPs was the use of a template with prespecified fields; 94% of those who used templates found them helpful. For each topic of an SCP, although 87% to 89% of oncology providers believed it was very important for primary care providers to receive the information, only 58% to 65% of respondents believed it was very important for patients to receive the information. Furthermore, 33% to 38% of respondents reported mixed feelings regarding whether it was the responsibility of oncology providers to provide SCPs.
CONCLUSIONS: Practices need additional resources to overcome barriers to implementing SCPs. We found resistance toward SCPs, particularly the perceived value for the survivor and the idea that oncology providers are responsible for SCP dissemination."
24327469,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24327469/,"PURPOSE: To examine the relationship between cardiac tissue Doppler and peripheral vascular Doppler measurements in fetal anemia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed high frame rate cardiac Tissue Doppler Imaging (TDI) data files of 26 anemic fetuses. The peak systolic tissue velocity (PSV), peak systolic displacement (PD), and peak systolic strain (PS) were determined in the mid-segment of the ventricular walls (ROI 1 right ventricle (RV), ROI 2 left ventricle (LV)) and in the basal segment of the ventricular walls (ROI 3 tricuspid annulus, ROI 4 mitral annulus). TDI parameters were correlated with established fetal vascular Doppler parameters (peak systolic blood flow velocity (Vmax) in the middle cerebral artery (MCA), pulsatility index (PI) in the MCA, in the umbilical artery (UA), and in the venous duct (DV)).
RESULTS: The PSV in the LV correlated significantly negatively with the PI in the MCA. Both the PSV and PD in the LV correlated significantly negatively with the PI in the UA. The PS in the RV correlated significantly negatively with the PI in the UA. The left ventricular PSV and PD correlated significantly positively with the PI in the DV. The Vmax in the MCA did not correlate with any systolic myocardial TDI parameter.
CONCLUSION: In fetal anemia, peak systolic myocardial TDI parameters correlate with vascular Doppler parameters, confirming that TDI is a promising method to evaluate myocardial function in the anemic fetus. This suggests combining both techniques to quantify fetal myocardial function in anemia even more accurately, possibly allowing for the determination of the indication for intrauterine transfusion."
24328497,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24328497/,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this paper was to review the types of approaches currently utilized in the analysis of multi-country survey data, specifically focusing on design and modeling issues with a focus on analyses of significant multi-country surveys published in 2010.
METHODS: A systematic search strategy was used to identify the 10 multi-country surveys and the articles published from them in 2010. The surveys were selected to reflect diverse topics and foci; and provide an insight into analytic approaches across research themes. The search identified 159 articles appropriate for full text review and data extraction.
RESULTS: The analyses adopted in the multi-country surveys can be broadly classified as: univariate/bivariate analyses, and multivariate/multivariable analyses. Multivariate/multivariable analyses may be further divided into design- and model-based analyses. Of the 159 articles reviewed, 129 articles used model-based analysis, 30 articles used design-based analyses. Similar patterns could be seen in all the individual surveys.
CONCLUSION: While there is general agreement among survey statisticians that complex surveys are most appropriately analyzed using design-based analyses, most researchers continued to use the more common model-based approaches. Recent developments in design-based multi-level analysis may be one approach to include all the survey design characteristics. This is a relatively new area, however, and there remains statistical, as well as applied analytic research required. An important limitation of this study relates to the selection of the surveys used and the choice of year for the analysis, i.e., year 2010 only. There is, however, no strong reason to believe that analytic strategies have changed radically in the past few years, and 2010 provides a credible snapshot of current practice."
24328826,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24328826/,"INTRODUCTION: Auditory hallucinations occur in schizophrenia and also in the general population. However, evidence points to differences in the nature and the mechanisms of clinical and non-clinical hallucinations, challenging the dominant assumption that they represent the same phenomenon. The current study extended this evidence by examining voice identity perception in hallucination-prone individuals. In schizophrenia, deficiencies discriminating between real (external) voices have been linked to basic acoustic cues, but voice discrimination has not yet been investigated in non-clinical hallucinations.
METHODS: Using a task identical to that employed in patients, multidimensional scaling of voice dissimilarity judgements was used to examine how healthy individuals differing in hallucination-proneness (30 high and 30 low hallucination-prone individuals) distinguish pairs of unfamiliar voices. The resulting dimensions were interpreted with reference to acoustic measures relevant to voice identity.
RESULTS: A two-dimensional ""voice space"", defined by fundamental frequency (F0) and formant dispersion (Df), was derived for high and low hallucination-prone groups. There were no significant differences in speaker discrimination for high versus low hallucination-prone individuals on the basis of either F0 or Df.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest voice identity perception is not impaired in healthy individuals predisposed to hallucinations, adding a further challenge to the continuum model of psychotic symptoms."
24328937,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24328937/,"PURPOSE: What is known about physician handoffs is almost entirely limited to resident practice, but attending physicians ultimately determine care plans and goals of care. This study sought to understand what is unique about attending intensivist handoffs, to identify perceptions of the ideal content and format of intensive care unit (ICU) attending handoffs, and to understand how ideal and reported practices are aligned in the delivery of care.
METHODS: Intensivists in active practice in U.S. adult academic ICUs were purposively sampled and interviewed over 9 months in 2011 to 2012.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Thirty attendings from 15 institutions in nine U.S. states were interviewed. Subjects' specialties included anesthesiology, emergency medicine, internal medicine, and surgery. The ""perfect handoff"" was described as succinct, included verbal plus written communication, and took place in person. Respondents believed that the attending handoff should be less detailed than resident handoffs. Most attendings participated in handoffs at the end of each ICU rotation (n = 26). Standardized handoff practice was rare (n = 1). Media used for handoffs included combinations of telephone conversations (n = 25), in-person communications (n = 11), e-mail (n = 9), or text message (n = 2). Handoff duration varied from 10 to 120 minutes for 5 to 42 patients. Five of 30 respondents had undergone formal training in how to conduct handoffs.
CONCLUSIONS: A national sample of academic intensivists identified common ideal attributes of attending handoffs, yet their reported handoff practices varied widely. Ideal handoff practices may form the basis of future interventions to improve communication between intensivists."
24329026,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24329026/,"OBJECT: Patients with bilateral auditory nerve destruction may perceive some auditory input with auditory brainstem implants (ABIs). Despite technological developments and trials in new stimulation sites, hearing is very variable and of limited quality. The goal of this study was to identify advantageous and critical factors that influence the quality of auditory function, especially speech perception.
METHODS: The authors conducted a prospective study on ABI operations performed with the aid of multimodality neuromonitoring between 2005 and 2009 in 18 patients with neurofibromatosis Type 2. Outcome was evaluated by testing word recognition (monotrochee-polysyllabic word test at auditory-only mode [MTPa]) and open speech perception (Hochmair-Schulz-Moser [HSM] sentence test), both in pure auditory mode. The primary outcome was the HSM score at 24 months. The predictive meaning of general clinical data, tumor volume, number of active electrodes, duration of deafness, and early hearing data was examined.
RESULTS: In 16 successful ABI activations the average score for MTPa was 89% (SD 13%), and for HSM it was 41% (SD 32%) at 24 months. There were 2 nonresponders, 1 after radiosurgery and the other in an anatomical variant. Direct facial nerve reconstruction during the same surgery was followed by successful nerve recovery in 2 patients, with a simultaneous very good HSM result. Patients' age, tumor extension, and tumor volume were not negative predictors. There was an inverse relationship between HSM scores and deafness duration; 50% or higher HSM scores were found only in patients with ipsilateral deafness duration up to 24 months. The higher the deafness sum of both sides, the less likely that any HSM score will be achieved (p = 0.034). In patients with total deafness duration of less than 240 months, higher numbers of active electrodes were significantly associated with better outcomes. The strongest cross-correlation was identified between early MTPa score at 3 months and 24-month HSM outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: This study documents that open-set speech recognition in pure auditory mode is feasible in patients with ABIs. Large tumor volumes do not prevent good outcome. Positive preconditions are short ipsilateral and short bilateral deafness periods and high number of auditory electrodes. Early ability in pure auditory word recognition tests indicates long-term capability of open speech perception."
24329481,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24329481/,"BACKGROUND: Gold-standard assessment of acute wound healing has traditionally been through histological analysis of biopsied tissue. However, this process is invasive with recognized side-effects. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a noninvasive technique generating high-resolution real-time images of cutaneous architecture.
OBJECTIVES: To compare OCT with histological assessment of in vivo acute wound healing and ascertain the level of agreement between modalities for measurement of defined cutaneous structures.
METHODS: Punch biopsies (5 mm) were harvested from 50 healthy volunteers. Wounds healed by secondary intention until they were re-excised 7, 14, 21 or 28 days later depending on random group allocation. Wounds were assessed weekly for 6 weeks using OCT and compared with histological findings derived from time-matched biopsies. Dimensions of four cutaneous structures were measured using both modalities and the level of agreement was established by Bland-Altman analysis. The mean greyscale value (MGV) of the upper reticular dermis was derived from OCT images at all time points.
RESULTS: Both techniques showed anatomical congruity in normal and wounded skin with correlating architectural changes associated with inflammatory, proliferative and remodelling wound healing phases. MGV was significantly increased 6 weeks after wounding (P = 0·001) and may represent a novel measure of wound fibrosis. Despite good association of histomorphometric values with low but consistent bias (range -4·181 to 0·431 μm), Bland-Altman plots demonstrated poor agreement between OCT and histology.
CONCLUSIONS: Optical coherence tomography enabled accurate assessment of healing tissue comparable with histological analysis of biopsy specimens. This noninvasive tool is highly suited to wound assessment and may represent a diagnostic alternative to punch biopsies."

METHODS: Interviews were conducted with 11 residents and nine family/friends. Interpretive descriptive methodology was used in the data analysis. The value of the café for the participants was established according to five major themes: ""A place to go"", ""opportunities for relating"", ""opportunities for being and doing"", ""a sense of the ordinary"", and ""a sense of self"".
RESULTS: As a place the cafe was valued for both its pleasant environment and warm friendly atmosphere where participants experienced a sense of belonging to a community. The café generated a hub of activity, which provided stimulation and the activity of choosing, buying, and sharing food and drink contributed to the maintenance of life roles, family life, and connections to the community.
CONCLUSIONS: The café provided a myriad of opportunities for participation in relationships and the creation and maintenance of social networks. This participation reinforced a sense of self and of being ordinary."
24329538,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24329538/,"BACKGROUND: Hypospadias and urethral strictures are conditions requiring additional tissue for reconstruction. Due to a limited source of tissue, autologous skin and oral mucosa are frequently used. However, long-term follow-up studies demonstrated significant complications and diminished quality of life. Recently, a variety of tubular biodegradable biomaterials have been used. Cell seeding seems to be important to improve the host acceptance and neovascularization.
OBJECTIVE: To compare in vivo performance of smooth muscle cell (SMC)-seeded and unseeded tubular collagen-based scaffolds in a rabbit urethral reconstruction model.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixteen New Zealand rabbits underwent an open-bladder biopsy for SMC harvesting. The SMCs were cultured for 3 weeks and labeled with ethynyldeoxyuridine (EdU). A 1-cm-length tubular collagen-based 0.5 wt% scaffold was seeded and cultured with SMCs and implantation in a rabbit model. Eight rabbits received SMC-seeded scaffolds for a 1-cm-length circumferential urethral repair, situated 1.5 cm from the meatus. After 1 and 3 months, four rabbits underwent a urethrography and were sacrificed. The penises underwent hematoxylin and eosin, immunohistochemistry, and EdU fluorescence staining. In the control group eight rabbits received acellular scaffolds.
RESULTS: The SMC-seeded group presented one stricture at 1 month and one fistula at 3 months. Three strictures were present in the unseeded group at 1 month and one at 3 months. In the seeded group, more SMC expression and neovascularization was observed, and less mononuclear and giant cells could be found. All scaffolds showed luminal urothelial cell revetment. The detection of EdU-labeled SMCs revealed SMC transplantation survival.
CONCLUSION: SMC-seeded tubular collagen scaffolds improved urethral regeneration in this rabbit model. Such constructs may be valuable for repair of severe urethral diseases."
24329573,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24329573/,"INTRODUCTION: Numerous strategies have been suggested to increase recruitment of family physicians to rural communities and smaller regional centers. One approach has been to implement distributed postgraduate education programs where trainees spend substantial time in such communities. The purpose of the current study was to compare the eventual practice location of family physicians who undertook their postgraduate training through a single university but who were based in either metropolitan or distributed, non-metropolitan communities.
METHODS: Since 1998, the Department of Family Practice at the University of British Columbia in Canada has conducted an annual survey of its residents at 2, 5, and 10 years after completion of training. The authors received Ethics Board approval to use this anonymized data to identify personal and educational factors that predict future practice location.
RESULTS: The overall response rate was 45%. At 2 years (N=222), residents trained in distributed sites were 15 times more likely to enter practice in rural communities, small towns and regional centers than those who trained in metropolitan teaching centers. This was even more predictive for retention in non-urban practice sites. Among the subgroup of physicians who remained in a single practice location for more than a year preceding the survey, those who trained in smaller sites were 36 times more likely to choose a rural or regional practice setting. While the vast majority of those trained in metropolitan sites chose an urban practice location, a subgroup of those with some rural upbringing were more likely to practice in rural or regional settings. Trainees from distributed sites considered themselves more prepared for practice regardless of ultimate practice location.
CONCLUSIONS: Participation in a distributed postgraduate family medicine training site is an important predictor of a non-urban practice location. This effect persists for 10 years after completion of training and is independent of other predictors of non-urban practice including gender, rural upbringing, and rural undergraduate training. It is hypothesized that this is due not only to a curriculum that supports preparedness for this type of practice but also to opportunities to develop personal and professional roots in these communities."

DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Secondary analysis of data from a case-control study in a community setting between 1994 and 1997 among men below the age of 70 years, using in-person interviews and categorisation of baldness, with subsequent completion of a questionnaire by the participant. We analysed risk factors for baldness using unconditional logistic regression.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Baldness; history of ejaculations between the ages of 20 and 49 years; total number of sexual partners.
RESULTS: There was no significant association between baldness and the frequency of ejaculations, but bald men were significantly less likely to have had more than four female sexual partners.
CONCLUSIONS: In the population studied, bald men appear to be no more virile than their well thatched contemporaries."

METHODS: Among 35,099 radical prostatectomy cases in the Japanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination database 2007-2012, those where a rectal injury occurred were stratified into a preoperative mechanical bowel preparation group (polyethylene glycol electrolyte, magnesium citrate solution and sodium picosulfate) and a non-mechanical bowel preparation group. The associations between mechanical bowel preparation and rectal injury were evaluated by multivariate regression analysis for: (i) subsequent infectious complications; (ii) requirement of delayed colostomy formation after primary closure; (iii) postoperative length of stay; and (iv) total costs. Covariates were age, surgical approach, Charlson Comorbidity Index, T and N category, hospital volume, hospital academic status, and colostomy formation.
RESULTS: Overall, 151 rectal injury cases (0.43%) were identified. Of those, 73 patients (48%) received mechanical bowel preparation. Multivariate analyses showed that all four outcomes were not statistically different between mechanical bowel preparation and non-mechanical bowel preparation groups (infectious complication rate: 12% vs 10%, P = 0.80; delayed colostomy rate: 21% vs 31%, P = 0.34; length of stay: 28 vs 30 days, P = 0.84; and total costs: $24,665 vs $23,837, P = 0.81).
CONCLUSION: Our analysis did not detect a beneficial impact of mechanical bowel preparation on perioperative morbidity associated with rectal injury during radical prostatectomy. This finding suggests that mechanical bowel preparation might be safely omitted before radical prostatectomy."
24330113,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24330113/,"INTRODUCTION: The 1964 revision of the Hippocratic Oath addressed the disconnection in language and context between the classical doctrine and 20th century medicine. Now, 50 years later, we argue that any revision of the Oath must be responsive to the significant social, technical and political changes that have occurred in health care.
THE CONTEXT FOR THE HIPPOCRATIC OATH: This paper examines the ways in which health care and the health professions have changed over the last half-century and describes a range of environmental and contextual features that expose the inadequacies of the 1964 Oath in the worlds of today and the future. We note the constancy of the doctor-patient dyad in contemporary ethical codes and consider from the perspective of patient safety those aspects of care that might fall short of the optimum if the focus on the doctor is retained. We ask whether there is any merit in maintaining a focus on the ethics or professionalism of doctors, or whether more of our attention should be directed towards the ethics of health care itself.
CONCLUSIONS: Patient safety is widely acknowledged as a major health issue. Being open about the interdependency of doctors, the complex socio-political nature of health care, and the inevitability of errors and adverse events need not challenge the authority of the doctor. Rather, openness about both the ways in which medicine has changed and the harms that doctors may (inadvertently) cause might afford medicine the opportunity to build a different relationship with patients (and with society more broadly), that recognises complexity, human fallibility and the uncertainty of medicine."
24330114,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24330114/,"CONTEXT: Given the power and pervasiveness of technology, this paper considers whether it can help doctors to access, use and share knowledge and thus contribute to their ability to uphold the part of the Hippocratic Oath concerned with respecting 'the hard-won scientific gains of those physicians in whose steps I walk' and sharing 'such knowledge as is mine with those who are to follow'. How technology supports connections between doctors and knowledge is considered by focusing on the use of mobile technology in the workplace and Web 2.0 tools.
METHODS: Sfard's 'acquisition' and 'participation' models are employed to help develop an understanding of what these uses of technology mean for learning and knowledge sharing.
DISCUSSION: The employment of technology is not neutral in its effects. Issues relate to knowledge ownership, information overload, quality control and interpretations attached to the use of mobile devices in the workplace. These issues raise deeper questions about the nature of knowledge and social theory and socio-material research questions about the effect of technology on workplace learning.
CONCLUSION: Although the empirical and theoretical evidence presented shows how technology has clear potential to contribute both to accessing evidence and sharing knowledge, there is need for further research that applies theoretical frameworks to the analysis of the impact of technology on workplace learning."
24330251,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24330251/,"AIM: Increasing evidence suggests that atherosclerosis contributes to the initiation or progression of osteoarthritis (OA). It has been suggested that atherosclerosis may cause vascular insufficiency which may lead to or progress OA. In this study, the association between the severity of radiologic hand OA and atherosclerosis was analyzed in women.
METHODS: Sixty-one women, ≥ 50 years of age, free of hand symptoms were enrolled in the study. Postero-anterior views of both hands were obtained using digital radiography. A total of 14 joints were assessed for radiographic OA according to Kellgren/Lawrence (K/L) score. An OA-affected joint was defined as K/L score of ≥ 2. Hand OA was defined as ≥ 3 joints of both hands affected with OA and severity of hand OA was defined as total K/L scores of all 14 joints of both hands. Gensini scoring was used to evaluate the patients for atherosclerosis severity.
RESULTS: The patient characteristics such as presence of diabetes, smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia and medications used were similar for patients with and without hand OA (P > 0.05) and did not correlate with Gensini or hand OA scores. The mean Gensini scores of patients with hand OA was 21.5 ± 17.1 and without hand OA was 11.8 ± 9.2 (P = 0.017). The degree of osteoarthritic joint involvement and Gensini scores showed a positive correlation (r = 0.332, P = 0.009).
CONCLUSION: Hand OA may be a benign clinical finding that may suggest a possible serious underlying atherosclerosis. Patients with significant hand OA should be screened for atherosclerosis to prevent serious coronary artery disease and related comorbidities."
24330323,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24330323/,"OBJECTIVE: The prevalence of chronic pain ranges from 40% to 80% in long-term care facilities, and it is especially high among older adults who are unable to communicate due to cognitive impairments. Although validated assessment tools exist, pain detection in this population is often done by interdisciplinary evaluation (IE), which largely relies on the subjective impression of health care providers. The aim of this study was to examine the agreement between the IE and validated observational pain tools.
SETTING: We recruited 59 residents with limited ability to communicate. The pain behaviors of each participant were assessed with two validated tools, the Pain Assessment Checklist for Seniors with Limited Ability to Communicate (PACSLAC) and the Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia (PAINAD), during transfer or mobilization. The results were then compared with the findings of the IE.
RESULTS: The correlation between the PACSLAC and PAINAD was high (r = 0.79 [95% CI: 0.67-0.87]). However, we found a low to moderate association between the PACSLAC and the IE (r = 0.34 [95% CI: 0.09-0.55]), and a weaker association was observed between the PAINAD and the IE (r = 0.25 [95% CI: -0.02-0.48]). When the IE concluded that there was an absence of pain behavior, the PAINAD and the PACSLAC detected the presence of pain in 13.6% and 27.1% of the cases respectively.
CONCLUSION: These results may be explained by an inability of IE to assess pain correctly or by instruments providing false positive results. Nevertheless, as detection of pain is difficult in this population, our research supports the use of validated tools to complement assessment of pain by the IE and make sure that no pain goes undetected."
24330466,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24330466/,"BACKGROUND: Timing, spacing and limiting of pregnancy are key outcomes of family planning (FP) whose role in promoting health of mothers and babies is evidence based. Despite the evidence, recent studies in Tanzania have reported a trend towards child birth in older age, non-adherence to standard inter-pregnancy spacing, and preference of large families in the background of a rising national contraceptive prevalence rate. We explored if the use of modern FP promotes healthy timing and spacing of pregnancy among women seeking antenatal services.
DESIGN: Analytical Cross-sectional study
METHODS: Women seeking antenatal services at Muhimbili National Hospital, Tanzania (August-October, 2012) were enrolled. We used a semi-structured questionnaire to obtained information from the women. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 19. Outcomes of interest were adherence to timing of first pregnancy and to inter-pregnancy spacing after normal childbirth. Use of modern FP prior to index pregnancy was the independent variable of primary interest. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to obtain odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) as estimates risk and clinical importance respectively. Ethical approval was obtained from the Research and Publications Committee at Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences.
RESULTS: In total 427 women were interviewed. Ages ranged 15-45 years, mean 29.2 (SD ± 5.1). Among all, 129 (30.2%) were primigravida, 298 (69. 8%) multigravida. Of these 298 women, 51 (17.1%) lost pregnancies preceding the index. Overall, 179 (41.9%) had ever used modern FP, 103 (24.1%) were on modern FP just prior to index pregnancy.Non-adherence to timing was increased for primigravida (AOR = 4.5, 95% CI: 2.1-9.6) and for women older than 29 years (AOR = 7.6 95% CI: 3.8-15.2). Non-adherence to spacing was increased with loss of the immediate past pregnancy (AOR = 2.5; 95% CI: 1.3-4.7). Use of modern FP was neither associated with adherence to timing (AOR = 1.0; 95% CI: 0.5-1.9) nor spacing (AOR = 1.0; 95% CI: 0.6-1.8).
CONCLUSION: Modern FP does not promote adherence to timing and spacing of pregnancy among women seeking antenatal services at MNH. Past obstetric experience was key to women's decisions on spacing. There is need to promote educational messages on timing and spacing of pregnancy for healthy outcomes."
24330502,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24330502/,"BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies show that vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency are common worldwide and associated with many diseases including asthma. Our aim was to evaluate vitamin D insufficiency and its clinical consequences.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was carried out on 170 children consisted of 85 who were asthmatic and 85 who were not, aged 2 to 14 years in Tekirdag, Turkey, from September 2009 to May 2010. Children's basal serum D vitamin levels were determined, and their eating habits, vitamin D intake, exposure to sunlight and use of health services during the previous year were investigated. The severity of asthma and levels of asthma control were assessed according to the Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines.
RESULTS: The difference between mean vitamin D levels in the asthmatic group (mean +/- SD) 16.6 +/- 8.5 ng/mL and the healthy control group (mean +/- SD) 28.2 +/- 19.5 ng/mL was found to be statistically significant (p < 0.001). Children in the asthma group had less exposure to sunlight and ate a diet less rich in vitamin D (p < 0.001). A significant difference was observed between the groups regarding the frequency of respiratory tract infections leading to emergency unit admissions and number of hospitalizations (p < 0.001). It was also shown that a decrease in vitamin D level increased the severity of asthma (p < 0.001) and decreased the frequency of controlled asthma (p = 0.010).
CONCLUSION: This study has demonstrated the correlation between plasma 25 (OH) D levels and childhood asthma. Evidently, this relationship being influenced by multiple factors other than vitamin D, further studies should be conducted to explore the interrelation between all such factors."
24330688,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24330688/,"INTRODUCTION: Although regression is widely used for reading and publishing in the medical literature, no instruments were previously available to assess students' understanding. The goal of this study was to design and assess such an instrument for graduate students in Clinical and Translational Science and Public Health.
METHODS: A 27-item REsearch on Global Regression Expectations in StatisticS (REGRESS) quiz was developed through an iterative process. Consenting students taking a course on linear regression in a Clinical and Translational Science program completed the quiz pre- and postcourse. Student results were compared to practicing statisticians with a master's or doctoral degree in statistics or a closely related field.
RESULTS: Fifty-two students responded precourse, 59 postcourse , and 22 practicing statisticians completed the quiz. The mean (SD) score was 9.3 (4.3) for students precourse and 19.0 (3.5) postcourse (P < 0.001). Postcourse students had similar results to practicing statisticians (mean (SD) of 20.1(3.5); P = 0.21). Students also showed significant improvement pre/postcourse in each of six domain areas (P < 0.001). The REGRESS quiz was internally reliable (Cronbach's alpha 0.89).
CONCLUSION: The initial validation is quite promising with statistically significant and meaningful differences across time and study populations. Further work is needed to validate the quiz across multiple institutions."
24330750,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24330750/,"INTRODUCTION: Patients receiving a bone-anchored hearing aid have well-documented improvements in their quality of life and audiometric performance. However, the relationship between audiometric measurements and subjective improvement is not well understood.
METHODS: Adult patients enrolled in the Nova Scotia bone-anchored hearing aid programme were identified. The pure tone average for fitting the sound-field threshold, as well as the better and worse hearing ear bone conduction and air conduction levels, were collected pre-operatively. Recipients were asked to complete the Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing questionnaire; their partners were asked to complete a pre- and post-bone anchored hearing aid fitting Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults questionnaire.
RESULTS: Forty-eight patients who completed and returned the Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing questionnaire had partners who completed the Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults questionnaire. The results from the Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing questionnaire correlated with the sound-field hearing threshold post-bone-anchored hearing aid fitting and the pure tone average of the better hearing ear bone conduction (total Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing Scale to the pre-operative better hearing ear air curve (r = 0.3); worse hearing ear air curve (r = 0.27); post-operative, bone-anchored hearing aid-aided sound-field thresholds (r = 0.35)). An improvement in sound-field threshold correlated only with spatial abilities. In the Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults questionnaire, there was no correlation between the subjective evaluation of each patient and their partner.
CONCLUSION: The subjective impressions of hearing aid recipients with regards to speech reception and the spatial qualities of hearing correlate well with pre-operative audiometric results. However, the overall magnitude of sound-field improvement predicts an improvement of spatial perception, but not other aspects of hearing, resulting in hearing aid recipients having strongly disparate subjective impressions when compared to those of their partners."
24330753,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24330753/,"INTRODUCTION: Prehospital endotracheal intubation (ETI) following traumatic brain injury in urban settings is controversial. Studies investigating admission arterial blood gas (ABG) patterns in these instances are scant.
HYPOTHESIS: Outcomes in patients subjected to divergent prehospital airway management options following severe head injury were studied.
METHODS: This was a retrospective propensity-matched study in patients with isolated TBI (head Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) ≥ 3) and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of ≤ 8 admitted to a Level 1 urban trauma center from January 1, 2003 through October 31, 2011. Cases that had prehospital ETI were compared to controls subjected to oxygen by mask in a one to three ratio for demographics, mechanism of injury, tachycardia/hypotension, Injury Severity Score, type of intracranial lesion, and all major surgical interventions. Primary outcome was mortality and secondary outcomes included admission gas profile, in-hospital morbidity, ICU length of stay (ICU LOS) and hospital length of stay (HLOS).
RESULTS: Cases (n = 55) and controls (n = 165) had statistically similar prehospital and in-hospital variables after propensity matching. Mortality was significantly higher for the ETI group (69.1% vs 55.2% respectively, P = .011). There was no difference in pH, base deficit, and pCO2 on admission blood gases; however the ETI group had significantly lower pO2 (187 (SD = 14) vs 213 (SD = 13), P = .034). There was a significantly increased incidence of septic shock in the ETI group. Patients subjected to prehospital ETI had a longer HLOS and ICU LOS.
CONCLUSION: In isolated severe traumatic brain injury, prehospital endotracheal intubation was associated with significantly higher adjusted mortality rate and worsened admission oxygenation. Further prospective validation of these findings is warranted."
20731793,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20731793/,"OBJECTIVE: Depression among youth is a condition associated with serious long-term morbidity and suicide. The aim of this study was to investigate whether a HRQoL instrument, the short form 36 version 1.0 (SF-36), could be used to screen for depression in a clinical Youth Centre (YC). A second purpose was to describe self-reported health and depression.
SETTING: A clinical YC at a University hospital.
DESIGN: A sample of 660 youths, 14-20 years old was assessed with SF-36 and Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale, self-screening version (MADRS-S). Answers to all the questions in both instruments were given by 79% (519/660; 453 women and 66 men). Mean age in the sample was 17.5±1.6 years.
RESULTS: Strong correlations were found between all the SF-36 subscales and the depression ratio scale MADRS-S. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis confirmed that the SF-36 subscales mental health (MH) and vitality (VT) could correctly predict depression on the individual level with Area Under the ROC Curve values 0.87 and 0.84 in ROC curves. Individuals scoring 48 or lower on MH and 40 or lower on VT should be followed up with a clinical interview concerning possible depressive disorder. Mild to moderate depression was common (35.5%), especially among women (37.5%). Men scored higher than women on all SF-36 subscales except for physical functioning.
CONCLUSIONS: The SF-36 can be used to screen for suspect depression in a youth population followed by interview. This gives an opportunity to detect and treat emerging depressive symptoms early."
20731973,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20731973/,"OBJECTIVE: In a search for viable endophenotypes of alcoholism, this longitudinal study attempted to identify premorbid predictors of alcohol dependence that also predicted the course of alcoholism.
METHOD: The 202 male subjects who completed a 40-year follow-up were originally selected from a Danish birth cohort (N = 9,182). Two thirds of the subjects were high-risk biological sons of treated alcoholics. A large number of measures (361) were obtained at different periods before any subject had developed an alcohol-use disorder. At age 40, a psychiatrist provided mutually exclusive lifetime diagnoses of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence that were characterized as currently active or currently in remission according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition, Revised, course specifiers.
RESULTS: The majority of subjects with a diagnosis of alcohol abuse were in remission at age 40 compared with those with a diagnosis of alcohol dependence (88% vs. 58%). Treatment did not predict remission. Fourteen of the 18 predictors of remission that also predicted dependence were submitted to an exploratory factor analysis (varimax). Two premorbid dimensions were identified: cognitive efficiency and early behavioral dyscontrol in childhood. Both factors predicted the failure to remit (low cognitive efficiency and high behavioral dyscontrol) even when lifetime alcoholism severity was controlled.
CONCLUSIONS: This 4-decade study found a striking disconnect between measures that predicted alcohol dependence and measures that predicted remission from alcohol dependence. Reduced cognitive efficiency and increased behavioral dyscontrol may be basic to gaining a fuller understanding of the etiology of alcoholism."
20732493,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20732493/,"BACKGROUND: There is a popular perception that aortic valve replacement (AVR) in octogenarians carries a high risk related primarily to advanced age.
METHODS: Using the Department of Veterans Affairs Continuous Improvement in Cardiac Surgery Program, we identified patients who underwent AVR between 1991 and 2007. A prediction model was constructed using stepwise logistic regression methodology for outcome comparisons.
RESULTS: Compared with younger patients (age < 80 years; n = 6,638), older patients (age > or = 80; n = 504) had a higher prevalence of baseline comorbidities. In a comparison of patients propensity-matched by risk profile (459 from each group), the older group had a higher morbidity rate (21.1% vs 15.5%; p < 0.03) but a similar mortality rate (5.2% vs 3.3%; p = 0.19) compared with the younger group.
CONCLUSIONS: After risk adjustment, age of 80 years or greater was independently associated with higher AVR-related morbidity but not mortality. Further work is needed to identify ways to reduce operative morbidity in the extremely elderly."
20732495,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20732495/,"BACKGROUND: This study examined the long-term durability of the Hancock II bioprosthesis (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) in the aortic position.
METHODS: From 1982 to 2004, 1134 patients underwent aortic valve replacement (AVR) with Hancock II bioprosthesis and were prospectively monitored. Mean patient age was 67 +/- 11 years; 202 patients were younger than 60, 402 were 60 to 70, and 526 were older than 70. Median follow-up was 12.2 years and 99.2% complete. Valve function was assessed in 94% of patients. Freedom from adverse events was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method.
RESULTS: Survival at 20 and 25 years was 19.2% +/- 2% and 6.7% +/- 2.8%, respectively, with only 34 and 3 patients at risk. Survival at 20 years was 54.9% +/- 6.4% in patients younger than 60 years, 22.7% +/- 3.3% in those 60 to 70, and 2.4% +/- 1.9% in those older than 70 (p = 0.01). Structural valve deterioration developed in 67 patients aged younger than 60, in 18 patients aged 60 to 70, and in 2 patients older than 70. The freedom from structural valve deterioration at 20 years was 63.4% +/- 4.2% in the entire cohort, 29.2% +/- 5.7% in patients younger than 60 years, 85.2% +/- 3.7% in patients aged 60 to 70, and 99.8% +/- 0.2% in patients older than 70 (truncated at 18 years). Repeat AVR was performed in 104 patients (74 for structural valve failure, 16 for endocarditis, and 14 for other reasons). At 20 years, the overall freedom from AVR was 65.1% +/- 4% for any reason, 29.8% +/- 5.4% in patients younger than 60 years, 86.8% +/- 3.3% in patients 60 to 70, and 98.3% +/- 0.6% in patients older than 70.
CONCLUSIONS: Hancock II bioprosthesis is a very durable valve in patients 60 years and older and is probably the gold standard of bioprosthetic valve durability in this patient population."
20732628,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20732628/,"OBJECTIVE: Many investigators now routinely classify children with fragile X syndrome (FXS) according to whether or not they also meet diagnostic criteria for autism. To determine whether this classification is appropriate, we examined the profiles of autistic behaviors shown by boys and girls with FXS.
METHOD: Individuals with FXS, aged 5 to 25 years, were assessed on two established measures of autism, the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS).
RESULTS: We found that 35.1% of boys and 4.3% of girls with FXS scored in the ""autism"" category on both instruments. Analysis of the symptom profile indicated that both boys and girls with FXS showed lower rates of impairment on communication and reciprocal social interaction items than the reference autism samples on the measures. Furthermore, a regression model showed that IQ was significantly negatively associated with the SCQ total score in both boys and girls with FXS, when controlling for age, medication use, and FMRP levels.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that there are significant differences in the profile of social and communicative symptomatology in FXS compared with individuals diagnosed with idiopathic autism. Given these differences, the implementation of standard autism interventions for individuals with FXS may not be optimal. Maintaining the conceptual distinction between FXS (an established biological disease) and idiopathic autism (a phenomenologically defined behavioral disorder) may also facilitate the development of more targeted and thus effective interventions for individuals with FXS in the future."
20732683,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20732683/,"OBJECTIVE: The link between periodontal disease and atherosclerosis has not yet been clarified, though systemic inflammation seems to be the common soil for both conditions. Inflammation influences also hemodynamic forces, that act as local risk factors for carotid plaques. It is not known if the link between periodontitis and carotid atherosclerosis is mediated, at least in part, by physical forces. Therefore, aim of the present study was to evaluate the association between carotid shear stress force and periodontal disease.
METHODS: Thirty-three subjects underwent complete cardiovascular screening, carotid hemodynamic evaluation and dental inspection. Presence of classical risk factors for atherosclerosis, common carotid peak and mean wall shear stress values and periodontal indices of disease (plaque index, gingival index and pocket deep) have been evaluated.
RESULTS: Worse periodontal health was associated to the presence of carotid atherosclerosis. Patients with carotid plaques (n=19) had higher periodontal indices compared with subjects without plaques (n=14) (gingival index: 1.40 ± 0.71 vs. 0.69 ± 0.64, p=0.006). These relations were independent of the presence of cardiovascular risk factors in multiple logistic regression analysis. In the 66 examined common carotids, wall shear stress was inversely related to all periodontal indices (r=0.54, p<0.00001 for peak wall shear stress and gingival index). These relations remained significant also in multiple regression analysis, after correction for cardiovascular risk factors, gender and age.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study identifies for the first time a link between periodontal indices and wall shear stress, suggesting that an alteration of hemodynamic profile might contribute to atherosclerosis in subjects with periodontal disease."
20732769,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20732769/,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the value of adding involved field radiotherapy (IFRT) to patients with relapsed/refractory Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) undergoing high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) and stem cell transplantation (SCT).
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Ninety-two patients with relapsed/refractory HL undergoing HDCT and SCT from 1995 to 2008 were analyzed in a case-control design. Forty-six HL patients treated with IFRT within 2 months of SCT were matched to 46 HL patients who did not receive IFRT based on age, stage at relapse, timing of relapse, histology, and year of SCT. All were evaluated for response, survival, and toxicity with a median followup of 63.5 months.
RESULTS: There was a trend for better disease control in patients receiving IFRT. Specifically, 10/46 IFRT patients (22%) relapsed/progressed after SCT compared with 17/46 control patients (37%). Of the failures after IFRT, 70% were inside the radiation field, all in sites of bulky disease. In patients with nonbulky disease, IFRT also resulted in significantly improved outcomes (failure rate 6% vs. 33%, respectively). When stratified by disease bulk, the use of IFRT was found to significantly improve DFS (p=0.032), but did not affect OS. In addition, IFRT and nonbulky disease were found to be positive prognostic indicators for DFS with hazard ratios of 0.357 (p=0.032) and 0.383 (p=0.034), respectively. Grade IV/V toxicities were significantly higher in the IFRT vs. non-IFRT group (28% vs. 2%; p<0.001), observed only in patients receiving a busulfan-based conditioning regimen.
CONCLUSION: Patients with refractory or relapsed HL undergoing HDCT and SCT have a high risk of relapse in sites of prior disease involvement, especially in sites of bulky disease. The use of IFRT is associated with a lower risk of disease progression in these sites; however bulky disease sites are still difficult to control. Toxicity risk is significant, particularly when busulfan-based conditioning is combined with IFRT, and alternative chemotherapy conditioning regimens should be considered."
20733272,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20733272/,"INTRODUCTION: We investigated the efficacy and necessity of repeat transurethral resection (Re-TUR) in T1 bladder cancer.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: From September 2004 to September 2009, 62 patients with pathologically confirmed T1 bladder tumours were investigated. Re-TUR was routinely performed within 3-6 weeks following the initial resection. The pathological results of the Re-TUR were reviewed, and the risk of recurrence was investigated.
RESULTS: Of the 62 patients who underwent Re-TUR, 22 had a residual tumour pathologically. Visible residual tumours were detected in 9 patients (14.5%). The risk of having a residual tumour was directly correlated with the diameter of the initial tumour in T1 tumours (p = 0.007).
CONCLUSIONS: Upstaging to T2 of the disease led to radical cystectomy in 11.29% of the patients in our series. Re-TUR should be routinely performed on all patients, especially on patients with high-grade tumours and with tumour diameters greater than 3 cm in T1 bladder cancer."
20733276,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20733276/,"OBJECTIVE: Palliative transurethral prostatectomy (TURP) is the mainstay of treatment for lower urinary tract symptoms, (LUTS) in men with prostate cancer. Functional outcomes, however, can often be unsatisfactory. Here the value of preoperative urodynamics was investigated in these men.
METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of 41 men with prostate cancer and LUTS who were investigated by urodynamics prior to TURP. All were treated solely by primary androgen deprivation. 19 men with urodynamic proven bladder outflow obstruction (BOO) proceeded to palliative TURP.
RESULTS: Of the 41 men investigated by cystometry, the urodynamic diagnosis was BOO in 12 (29%) men, detrusor overactivity in 12 (29%) men with 7 (17%) having both diagnoses. 6 (15%) men were found to have underactive or acontractile detrusors while 4 (10%) had normal studies. In men who proceeded to TURP, all demonstrated improved flow rates (p = 0.003). At 12 months, 95% were voiding spontaneously with only 1 man requiring permanent re-catheterisation. These results compared very favourably to published outcomes which have not used urodynamics to select men for surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: Urodynamics may help identify objective BOO prior to palliative TURP. Further prospective trials are justified to assess the role of urodynamics in this context."
20733298,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20733298/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine if the association between high peritoneal protein clearance (PrC) and increased all-cause mortality is explained by inflammation and volume overload in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 216 incident patients were enrolled. Demographics, biochemistry, inflammatory and volume status, peritoneal transport rate, fluid and solute removal were collected at baseline.
RESULTS: The median PrC was 57.2 ml/day. A high PrC was associated with more severe inflammation and volume overload. Using a multivariate regression model, for every 1-ml/day increase in PrC, the adjusted HR was 1.06 (1.00-1.12; p = 0.046) for all-cause death adjusted for age, diabetes, hemoglobin and D/Pcr. The predictability of PrC for all-cause death remained the same or mildly changed after additionally adjusted for inflammatory and volume overload markers with HR of 1.07 (1.00-1.14; p = 0.043) and 1.05 (0.99-1.12; p = 0.08), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Peritoneal PrC, although correlated with volume overload and inflammation, is largely an independent predictor of mortality."

We first observed the normal human traffic pattern in our Pediatric Orthopedic ORs, and then examined the effect of surveillance on that traffic pattern.
METHODS: This study consisted of 2 phases: phase I sought to observe the OR traffic pattern (number of door swings, maximum and minimum number of OR personnel, number of OR personnel at 30-minute intervals, or changes in nursing, anesthesia, or surgeon staff) during surgical cases without OR personnel being notified, and for phase II, the same traffic pattern was monitored with their knowledge.
RESULTS: Two thousand four hundred forty-two minutes of surgical time were observed in phase I, and 1908 minutes were observed in phase II. There was no difference (P=0.06) in the time between door swings between phase I (1.39 min) and phase II (1.70 min), no difference (P=1.000) in the maximum number of people in the OR between phase I (11.5 people, range: 7-15 people) and phase II (11.5 people, range: 8-20 people), and no difference (P=1.000) in the minimum number of people in the OR between phase I (4.67 people, range: 4-6 people) and phase II (4.71 people, range: 3-6 people). There was a difference in the time between door swings (P=0.03) and maximum number of people in the OR (P=0.005) based on the length of the surgery (less or more than 120 min). There was no difference in the time between door swings (P=0.11), but there was a difference in the maximum number of people in the OR (P=0.002) based on type of surgery (spine vs. others).
CONCLUSIONS: There was no role of surveillance of human traffic in the OR. To achieve any change in the OR traffic pattern, monitoring alone may not be sufficient; other novel techniques or incentives may need to be considered."
20734054,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20734054/,"PURPOSE: After 25 years of practice and positive results of the Rehbein-procedure (RB) for children with Hirschsprung Disease (HD), we changed to the less invasive transanal endorectal pull through (TERPT). The aim of this study was to compare short- and mid-term complications of these two procedures in our patients with HD.
METHODS: Retrospective data of 50 HD patients were analyzed. Of these patients, 25 underwent RB (2000-2006) and in 25 the TERPT was performed (2005-2009). Medical records were reviewed to score complications and outcomes. Differences were analyzed using Chi-Square and Mann-Whitney U tests.
RESULTS: All RB patients (100%) were given a colostomy compared with four patients (16%) in the TERPT group (p < 0.001). The average age at surgery in the RB group was 191 days whereas this was 72 days in the TERPT group (p < 0.01). The mean length of time of surgery in the RB group (158 min) was not significantly different from that in the TERPT group (183 min). Ganglion cells were located in all specimens at the proximal end of the specimens. The median time to first feeding significantly decreased from 2 days (range 1-11) in the RB group to 1 day (range 1-3) in the TERPT group (p < 0.01). The median length of hospital stay decreased in the TERPT group (8 days) compared with the RB group (10 days) (p < 0.001). There was a significant reduction in postoperative obstructive symptoms during the first 6 months in the TERPT group (48%) compared with the RB group (84%) (p = 0.016). Postoperative enterocolitis decreased from 40% in the RB group to 24% in the TERPT group although this was not statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of TERPT reduced the need for colostomies; it shortened days to first feeding after surgery and reduced hospital stay. It also improved short-term outcome with less obstructive symptoms. We recommend TERPT surgery as a first choice in children with HD. we consider the RB now to be obsolete."
20734344,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20734344/,"OBJECTIVES: To compare the outcomes of fetuses with apparently isolated macrocephaly and those with associated findings, and to compare prenatal findings with postnatal diagnoses in children with syndromic macrocephaly.
METHODS: We reviewed the files of all patients referred for suspected fetal macrocephaly, during a 10-year period from 2000, to a large prenatal diagnosis unit with expertise in fetal neurology counseling. Macrocephaly was defined as head circumference (HC) > 2 SDs of the norm. Patients with confirmed HC > 2 SD were identified and contacted, and their development was evaluated.
RESULTS: Adequate data for analysis were available for 98 patients, in 82 of whom the fetal macrocephaly was considered isolated (Group A), and in 16 of whom associated fetal anomalies were identified (Group B). Macrocephaly was diagnosed earlier in Group B patients (28.4 vs. 32.3 weeks, P = 0.069), and the HC in Group B patients was larger (Z-score 2.95 vs. 2.3, P < 0.001). From Group A there were 81 liveborn; one of whom was diagnosed as having infantile autism. From Group B, there were nine liveborn. The associated central nervous system findings, as demonstrated by ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging, included mild ventriculomegaly, malformations of cortical development, callosal abnormalities, overdeveloped sulcation, large cavum septi pellucidi, large subarachnoid spaces, mega cisterna magna, periventricular pseudocyst, open operculum and vermian dysgenesis. Syndromic diagnosis was made in utero in five fetuses and after birth in three. In eight patients, associated malformations were confirmed after birth but a specific diagnosis was not reached.
CONCLUSIONS: When fetal macrocephaly is associated with other brain or systemic anomalies, syndromic macrocephaly can be diagnosed in utero. Fetuses with syndromic macrocephaly have a significantly larger HC, usually > 2.5 SD above the mean. Isolated macrocephaly, particularly when the HC is < 2.5 SD above the norm, may be clinically benign."
20734347,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20734347/,"OBJECTIVES: Evaluation of the clinical utility of systematically performing autopsy after termination of pregnancy (TOP) due to chromosomal abnormalities.
METHODS: A retrospective study of cases of TOP due to chromosomal abnormalities was performed between 1 January 2002 and 30 September 2007, in a tertiary referral hospital. A comparative study between prenatal ultrasonographic findings and postmortem findings was performed.
RESULTS: There were 57 cases of TOP due to chromosomal abnormalities. The median gestational age at TOP was 17 (range 14-24 weeks). There were 46 trisomies, 4 monosomies, 4 triploidies and 3 cases of structural anomalies. In 25 cases (43.9%) there was at least one major anomaly detected by ultrasound. In 15 cases (26.3%) additional information was obtained after fetal autopsy: in 7 cases further major structural anomalies were detected, and in 8 cases the presence of a major abnormality was not confirmed by the autopsy.
CONCLUSION: Fetal autopsy may provide additional information to the ultrasonographic morphological evaluation of the fetus submitted to TOP due to chromosomal abnormalities. The combination of prenatal ultrasound and pathological examination can broaden our knowledge of the natural history of chromosomal anomalies in the earlier stages of development and eventually contribute to improve the quality of perinatal care."
20734672,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20734672/,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study is to establish the influence of r-hu-EPO treatment for anemia of prematurity on changes in blood count values and the number of inevitable blood transfusions in premature infants.
STUDY DESIGN: The study includes 148 newborn babies--birth weight < or =1400 g, gestational age < or =34 g.w. They were divided in 2 groups: group I--treated with r-hu-EPO 1000 E/kg/week and Fe++ 3-6 mg/kg/day from week 3 after birth; group II--controls, treated only with transfusions of red blood cells. The changes in blood count values (Hb, Ht, Ery, Ret) from day 15-25 until day 60-70 were followed and analyzed, as well as the number of inevitable blood transfusions.
RESULTS: A significant increase in Hb and Ht values was established with r-hu-EPO treated babies. At day 60-70 mean values of Hb are: in r-hu-EPO group 111.1 +/- 11.06 g/l; in control group 99.20 +/- 10.77 g/l (p < 0.001). At the end of the period Ht is 32.02 +/- 3.28% in babies treated with r-hu EPO versus 29.10 +/- 2.87% with controls (p < 0.005). Ret count is significantly higher from day 25-30 in r-hu-EPO group (5.16 +/- 3.23%) versus controls (2.75 +/- 1.33%). Mean number of inevitable blood transfusions in r-hu-EPO treated group is significantly lower (2.06 +/- 1.62) versus controls--3.75 +/- 1.95 (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: r-hu EPO treatment has effect on changes in Hb, Ht, Ret and reduces the number of inevitable blood transfusions for anaemia of prematurity."
20735857,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20735857/,"BACKGROUND: The annual number of pediatric appendectomies in Ontario was stable throughout the study period, but with a significant level of regional variations across regions. The objective of this study is to use population-based data to measure the associations and to explain the variations of appendectomy rates with population socio-demographic indicators.
METHODS: Appendectomy rates in children aged less than 19 years were calculated from Ontario hospital discharge data from 1993 to 2000. Small area variations in appendectomy and correlations between socio-demographic indicators were studied. Multiple logistic regression was used to measure the risk of negative appendectomy and perforation while adjusting for socio-demographic factors.
RESULTS: The rate of positive primary appendectomy has been stable since 1993 with an average rate of 93.2 per 100,000 children. The negative appendectomy rates showed a significant decline over time from a high of 16.0 in 1994 to 10.2 per 100,000 in 2000 (p < 0.0001). There was a 4-fold regional variation in negative appendectomy with the highest rate of 26.0 per 100,000 in the northern regions of Ontario. After adjusting for socio-economic status, areas of higher percentages of rural living remained a single significant factor associated with a higher chance of negative and perforated appendectomy (OR = 1.28, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.61, p < 0.01 and OR = 1.11, 95% CI: 0.96, 1.28, p = 1.682 respectively). Areas with higher ultrasound use were associated with a lower risk of perforated appendectomy (OR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.72, 0.95, p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The higher rates of negative and perforated appendectomy in rural populations underpin the influence of access to preventive and primary health care in modifying the odds of appendicitis resulting in surgery."
20735907,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20735907/,"INTRODUCTION/OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to review our experience with lower urinary tract leiomyomata to determine if presentation, exam and imaging allows for stratification of the treatment of this rare lesion.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of current practice was performed from the Mayo Clinic Rochester database identifying 13 female patients and 10 males from 1995-2008, focusing on the clinical presentation, cystoscopic findings, imaging and operative approaches.
RESULTS: Symptomatic patients had larger lesions, were more likely to be females, or had midline periurethral or bladder neck lesions. Cystoscopic findings were uniformly described as submucosal polypoid lesions without surrounding erythema or mucosal involvement, a hallmark in the differential. There were no cases of rapid growth of these lesions. There were no recurrences after complete excision with follow up ranging in some cases for up to 4 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Lower urinary tract urethral leiomyomata are benign lesions that can be clearly differentiated on the basis of modern imaging from malignant or other benign lesions. While these lesions can cause obstructive voiding symptoms, resection or excision is required only for relief of symptoms, and not for tissue confirmation. In comparison to the presentation of leiomyosarcoma, this benign mass presents with slowly progressive symptoms, is firm but with rounded contours on exam, mucosal ulceration is absent. Imaging confirms benign appearing, albeit, ectopic muscle tissue. Rare forms of metastatic uterine smooth muscle tumors are also easily differentiated from this lesion. Adoption of a conservative approach for the asymptomatic and benign appearing lesion appears prudent."
20736253,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20736253/,"BACKGROUND: Ion exchange resins have been reported to bind copper and zinc. As the phosphate binder sevelamer hydrochloride is an ion exchange resin, we audited trace element levels in our haemodialysis cohort to determine whether sevelamer prescription affected trace element levels compared with other phosphate binders.
METHODS: Samples for zinc, copper and selenium were taken in special tubes and measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy or inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry from 211 patients attending an inner city university hospital main dialysis centre.
RESULTS: Of the patients, 12.9% were prescribed oral or intravenous trace element supplementation. Of the remainder, 5.5% of patients had low plasma copper, 37.4% low zinc and 45.6% low selenium. There was no difference in copper (16.7 ± 0.2 vs 16.8 ± 0.4 μmol/L, respectively) and zinc (12.0 ± 0.3 vs 11.6 ± 0.2 μmol/L) comparing patients prescribed sevelamer compared with other phosphate binders. Despite a high prevalence of statin prescription, total cholesterol (3.42 ± 0.12 vs 3.89 ± 0.08, P < 0.01), LDL-cholesterol (1.46 ± 0.1 vs 2.00 ± 0.07, P < 0.01) and total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratio (2.82 ± 0.15 vs 3.5216.7 ± 0.2 vs 16.8 ± 0.4 μmol/L, P < 0.01) were lower in the sevelamer group compared with those prescribed other phosphate binders. On logistic regression analysis, serum zinc levels were associated with serum albumin (F 20.36, β 0.174, CL 0.086-0.265, P < 0.001) and dialysis vintage (F 8.1, β 0.008, CL 0.002-0.013, P = 0.005), copper levels with log CRP (F 31.4, β 3.04, CL 0-1.97, P < 0.001) and urine volume (F 5.1, β - 0.01, CL - 0.002-0, P = 0.024), and selenium levels with serum albumin (F 23.2, β 0.016, CL 0.02-0.1, P < 0.001) and race (F 31.4, β 3.62, P = 0.032), with selenium levels being greater in non-Caucasoids (0.9 ± 0.02 vs 0.76 ± 0.02 μmol/L, P < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Trace element and micronutrient deficiencies were relatively common in this inner city population of outpatient haemodialysis patients. However, the prescription of different phosphate binders did not have an observable effect on serum copper and zinc levels, but those prescribed sevelamer did have lower lipid profiles compared with those prescribed other phosphate binders. Trace element concentrations were more associated with albumin, a marker of general nutritional status, with some differences according to ethnicity, most likely due to differences in dietary intake."
20736416,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20736416/,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationships among cerebral palsy (CP) phenotypes and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) severity and, in the process, to generate hypotheses regarding causal pathways linking BPD to CP.
STUDY DESIGN: We studied 1047 infants born before the 28th week of gestation. Receipt of supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA), with or without the need for mechanical ventilation (MV) at 36 weeks PMA, defined two levels of BPD. At 24 months, the children underwent neurologic examinations and CP diagnoses were made using an algorithm based on topographic localisation.
RESULTS: The 536 infants with BPD were at increased risk of all three CP phenotypes. In time-oriented multivariable analyses that adjusted for potential confounders, receipt of supplemental oxygen without MV at 36 weeks PMA (BPD) was not associated with increased risk of any CP phenotype. In contrast, BPD accompanied by MV at 36 weeks PMA (BPD/MV) was associated with a nearly sixfold increased risk of quadriparesis and a fourfold increased risk of diparesis.
CONCLUSIONS: Combined treatment with both MV and supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks PMA strongly predicts the more common bilateral CP phenotypes. BPD without MV at 36 weeks PMA was not significantly associated with any form of CP."
20736487,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20736487/,"BACKGROUND: Characteristics associated with low socioeconomic status neighbourhoods may put children at risk for unique chronic stressors that affect cortisol levels. This research sought to explore whether neighbourhood stressor exposure affected serum cortisol levels among children.
METHODS: A total of 148 African and European-American children with an average age of 8.28 years participated in a longitudinal study evaluating ethnic differences in body composition and disease risk. Five waves of data were included in analyses. Mixed modelling was used to explore neighbourhood stressors, which was a composite index of five items for zip code level poverty and physical disorder, and serum cortisol outcomes for the full sample, by race/ethnicity and gender. Adjustments were made for individual level correlates age, pubertal status, gender and total fat mass.
RESULTS: Neighborhood disorder was predictive of lower serum cortisol levels among African-American children (p<0.05), such that higher neighbourhood stressor exposure resulted in lower serum cortisol over time compared with individuals in socially ordered neighbourhoods. Neighbourhood disorder was marginally significant and predictive of higher serum cortisol among European-American children (p<0.10). Transition to a higher pubertal status, nested in age was also predictive of lower serum cortisol levels (p<0.01) among European-American children.
CONCLUSION: Children who are exposed to negative socioenvironmental climates over time are more likely to have altered serum cortisol levels. This may be an adaptive mechanism to cope with stress; however, disrupted cortisol levels may have negative effects on general physical and mental health."
20736679,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20736679/,"PURPOSE: To investigate the association between physician participants' levels of engagement in a Web-based educational intervention and their patients' baseline diabetes measures.
METHOD: The authors conducted a randomized trial of online CME activities designed to improve diabetes care provided by family, general, and internal medicine physicians in rural areas of 11 southeastern states between September 2006 and July 2008. Using incidence rate ratios derived from negative binomial models, the relationship between physicians' engagement with the study Web site and baseline proportion of their patients having controlled diabetes (hemoglobin A1c < or = 7%) was explored.
RESULTS: One hundred thirty-three participants (intervention = 64; control = 69) provided information for 1,637 patients with diabetes. In the intervention group, physicians in practices in the worst quartiles of A1c control were least engaged with the study Web site in nearly all dimensions. Total number of pages viewed decreased as quartile of A1c control worsened (137, 73, 68, 57; P = .007); similarly, for a given 10% increase in proportion of patients with controlled A1c, participants viewed 1.13 times more pages (95% CI: 1.02-1.26, P = .02). In the control group, engagement was neither correlated with A1c control nor different across quartiles of A1c control.
CONCLUSIONS: Engagement in Web-based interventions is measurable and has important implications for research and education. Because physicians of patients with the greatest need for improvement in A1c control may not use online educational resources as intensely as others, other strategies may be necessary to engage these physicians in professional development activities."
20736801,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20736801/,"OBJECTIVES: Local antibiotic delivery is a viable and attractive option for preventing infection. Unfortunately, the current options are limited and often necessitate surgical removal. This study evaluates the ability of a biodegradable and biocompatible chitosan sponge to minimize infection by delivering local antibiotics within the wound.
METHODS: A complex musculoskeletal wound was created on the hindlimb of goats and contaminated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (lux) or Staphylococcus aureus (lux) bacteria. These bacteria are genetically engineered to emit photons, allowing for quantification with a photon-counting camera system. The wounds were closed and similarly débrided and irrigated with 9 L normal saline using bulb-syringe irrigation 6 hours after inoculation. Goats were assigned to different treatment groups: a control group with no adjunctive treatment and an experimental group using a chitosan sponge loaded with either amikacin (for wounds contaminated with P. aeruginosa) or vancomycin (for wounds contaminated with S. aureus). The wounds were closed after the procedure and evaluated 48 hours after initial contamination. Serum levels of the antibiotics were also measured at 6, 12, 24, 36, and 42 hours after treatment was initiated.
RESULTS: The wounds treated with the antibiotic-loaded chitosan sponge had significantly less bacteria than the untreated wounds (P < 0.05). The highest serum levels were 6 hours after treatment but remained less than 15% of target serum levels for systemic treatment. At study end point, all sponges were between 60% and 100% degraded.
CONCLUSIONS: The chitosan sponges are effective delivering the antibiotic and reducing the bacteria within the wounds."
20736862,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20736862/,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine if toe pressures (TPs) obtained by a registered nurse using a portable photophlethysmograph (PPG) were equivalent to TPs obtained by a registered vascular technologist (RVT) using standard laboratory equipment.
DESIGN: A within-subjects, comparative design was used for the study.
SETTING AND SUBJECTS: Thirty subjects referred to a vascular laboratory for arterial studies were recruited. All tests were performed in the outpatient vascular laboratory of a large, urban medical center.
METHODOLOGY: Toe pressures were measured on subjects by the same RN and RVT during the same visit. Data were analyzed using the Bland-Altman method that compares bias (mean difference) and precision (limits of agreement) of measurements to previously determined criterion for clinically important limits of difference (±15 mm Hg) in order to assess equivalence and repeatability of measurements. Kappa statistic was calculated to assess RVT/RN agreement to detect lower extremity arterial disease (LEAD) (ie, TP<50 mm Hg). Sensitivity and specificity of the portable PPG measures were determined.
RESULTS: Precision for RVT-RN TPs exceeded the previously determined cutoff criteria (±15 mm Hg), but precision for repeated RN PPG measures fell within the clinically important limits. Kappa statistic calculation (κ=0.76) revealed substantial agreement (90%) between the RVT and RN measures to detect LEAD (<50 mm Hg). The portable PPG technique had good sensitivity (79%) and high specificity (95%) for detection of LEAD.
CONCLUSION: Although TPs obtained by the portable PPG were not equivalent to standard laboratory tests, the portable technique agreed sufficiently with the RVT to detect LEAD. The good sensitivity and high specificity of the portable PPG make it suitable for nurses and other primary care providers to use for high-risk patients or patients with wounds, when the ankle brachial index either is elevated above 1.3 or cannot be performed. Photophlethysmograph is also suitable to assess healing potential and the need for referrals to the vascular laboratory, surgeon, or the need for adjunctive therapies."
20737303,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20737303/,"BACKGROUND: Several studies have reported that the transverse acetabular ligament (TAL) can be used to orient the acetabular component during total hip arthroplasty and that it can be identified in nearly all patients.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We attempted to determine how often the TAL could be identified during primary THA and its accuracy as a guide for acetabular component positioning.
METHODS: In a prospective series of 63 patients (64 hips) undergoing primary THA, two surgeons attempted to identify the TAL and, if it was found, to use it for acetabular component orientation. Patients in whom the TAL was identified served as the study group and the ligament was used for cup orientation in those patients; the remaining patients in whom the ligament could not be identified served as a control group and had free-hand cup positioning. Anteversion was determined by radiographic measurement from true lateral views.
RESULTS: The TAL was identified in only 30 hips (47%) and was more likely to be found in patients who did not have inferior acetabular osteophytes. Acetabular position was not improved using this ligament for reference.
CONCLUSIONS: The TAL could not be routinely identified at surgery and when used for cup orientation it was no more accurate for cup positioning than free-hand technique."
20737572,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20737572/,"BACKGROUND: This study evaluated whether progression-free interval (PFI) following primary chemotherapy (PCT) was predictive of overall survival (OS) after second-line chemotherapy in advanced/recurrent endometrial cancer (EC).
METHODS: This is a pooled analysis of patients who recurred after PCT and were treated with second-line chemotherapy on Gynecologic Oncology Group trials. PFI-1 measured from initiation of PCT to recurrence or treatment-free interval (TFI) measured from completion of PCT to initiation of second-line chemotherapy was evaluated in relation to clinical outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 586 patients treated on 5 phase 3 PCT protocols were included. Baseline factors in primary setting associated with clinical outcome after PCT were also predictive of OS after second-line chemotherapy, including race, Gynecologic Oncology Group performance status, grade, and prior radiation therapy (P<.01). PFI-1 was the most significant factor predictive of survival after second-line chemotherapy, with a 30% reduction in the risk of death for PFI-1>6 months compared with ≤6 months (hazard ratio [HR], 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.59-0.84 [P<.0001]) and median OS after second-line chemotherapy of 10 versus 5 months. A total of 275 patients treated on 9 phase 2 second-line chemotherapy protocols were also evaluated, and TFI>3 months was associated with a 25% reduction in the risk of death (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.57-0.97 [P=.030]) and median OS after second-line chemotherapy of 10 versus 7 months compared with TFI≤3 months. The tumor response to second-line chemotherapy was 9.6% versus 5.8%; the difference was not statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: Time to recurrence after PCT is predictive of survival after recurrence in advanced/recurrent EC. However, there is no evidence that this variable can be used in selecting salvage chemotherapy."
20737608,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20737608/,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present double-blind, sham-controlled, balanced randomized cross-over study was to disentangle effects of electromagnetic fields (EMF) and non-EMF effects of mobile phone base stations on objective and subjective sleep quality.
METHODS: In total 397 residents aged 18-81 years (50.9% female) from 10 German sites, where no mobile phone service was available, were exposed to sham and GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications, 900 MHz and 1,800 MHz) base station signals by an experimental base station while their sleep was monitored at their homes during 12 nights. Participants were randomly exposed to real (GSM) or sham exposure for five nights each. Individual measurement of EMF exposure, questionnaires on sleep disorders, overall sleep quality, attitude towards mobile communication, and on subjective sleep quality (morning and evening protocols) as well as objective sleep data (frontal EEG and EOG recordings) were gathered.
RESULTS: Analysis of the subjective and objective sleep data did not reveal any significant differences between the real and sham condition. During sham exposure nights, objective and subjective sleep efficiency, wake after sleep onset, and subjective sleep latency were significantly worse in participants with concerns about possible health risks resulting from base stations than in participants who were not concerned.
CONCLUSIONS: The study did not provide any evidence for short-term physiological effects of EMF emitted by mobile phone base stations on objective and subjective sleep quality. However, the results indicate that mobile phone base stations as such (not the electromagnetic fields) may have a significant negative impact on sleep quality."
20737818,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20737818/,"OBJECTIVES: Most ""homestay"" high school students come to Canada from East Asian countries such as China, Korea and Japan to attend school while living with another family. Our objectives were to examine: 1) the characteristics of homestay youth compared to immigrant and Canadian-born East Asian youth and 2) whether their health risk behaviours are similar to immigrant or Canadian-born East Asian youth.
METHODS: We used the 2003 British Columbia Adolescent Health Survey to examine characteristics of East Asian youth and their health risk behaviours, including sexual behaviours, substance abuse, abuse history, and health status. Homestay students were those not born or raised in Canada and not living with their parent(s) or in foster care. Multivariate models tested for the independent association of student group, controlling for age.
RESULTS: Homestay students (weighted n = 3,085) were older, on average, than immigrant or Canadian-born youth and spoke a language other than English at home (p < 0.001). Multivariate analyses showed that homestay students were more likely to engage in sexual behaviours than other youth and over 4 times more likely to have used cocaine. Female homestay students were 3 times more likely to be a victim of sexual abuse and were also 3 times more likely to use a substance prior to sex.
CONCLUSION: Homestay students remain a forgotten and extremely vulnerable group of youth, in part because they have special living arrangements. No one is currently held accountable for their health or safety. In the absence of health policy about homestay students, public health officials and providers have a central role in ensuring the former's health is not threatened."
20738058,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20738058/,"BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence that hospitals are failing to meet the needs of older people. As a consequence acute care needs to be adapted to meet the needs of older people. Although initially developed for chronic conditions the Chronic Care Model (CCM) provides useful strategies for improving continuity and quality of care. METHOD/AIM: This paper describes the elements of the CCM and discusses how a chronic care approach can improve models of care delivery for older persons in the acute care hospital settings.
DISCUSSION: The CCM provides a potentially useful approach to improve health care for older people in the acute care setting. Positive policy environments, interdisciplinary care collaboration, evidence-based practice, an emphasis on self-management strategies and empowered communities are essential elements for driving development of effective models of care.
CONCLUSION: Models of care require a multifaceted collaborative approach for sustainability. Implementing elements of the CCM in developing models of acute care may improve patient outcomes and decrease unnecessary admissions to hospital for older people.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This paper provides suggestions for models of care to improve care of the older person in the acute care setting."

METHOD: Four groups were formed: a victimised CP group (n=17), a non-victimised CP group (n=41), a victimised comparison group (n=10) and a non-victimised comparison group (n=46). Self-concept was measured using the Self-Perception Profile for Children (SPPC, Harter The Self-Perception Profile for Children. Unpublished manual.

20738750,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20738750/,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies reported alterations in salivary flow rate and biochemical parameters of saliva in cerebral palsy (CP) individuals; however, none of these considered the type of neuromotor abnormality among CP individuals, thus it remains unclear whether the different anatomical and extended regions of the brain lesions responsible for the neurological damage in CP might include disruption of the regulatory mechanism of saliva secretion as part of the encephalopathy. The aim of this study was to evaluate salivary flow rate, pH and buffer capacity in saliva of individuals with CP, aged 3-16 years, with spastic neuromotor abnormality type and clinical patterns of involvement.
METHODS: Sixty-seven individuals with CP spasticity movement disorder, were divided in two groups according to age (3-8- and 9-16-years-old) and compared with 35 sibling volunteers with no neurological damage, divided in two groups according to age (3-8- and 9-16-years-old). Whole saliva was collected under slight suction and pH and buffer capacity were determined using a digital pH meter. Buffer capacity was measured by titration using 0.01N HCL, and flow rate was calculated in ml/min.
RESULTS: In both age groups studied, whole saliva flow rate, pH and buffer capacity were significantly lower in the spastic CP group (P<0.05). The clinical patterns of involvement did not influence the studied parameters.
CONCLUSION: These findings show that individuals with spastic cerebral palsy present lower salivary flow rate, pH and buffer capacity that can increase the risk of oral disease in this population."
20738753,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20738753/,"BACKGROUND: Because of delays in diagnosis, oral cancer usually presents for therapy at a late stage. Patients are unaware of having lesions as they are mostly asymptomatic and physicians generally do not examine the mouth sufficiently. People in rural areas or are underserved may not frequently visit the dentist who can easily pick up these lesions early. Screening programs are useful in that regard. Such programs in general are conducted by either inviting people to come to a screening center or by health care workers visiting the individual households. However, those who work during the day may not visit screening centers or be at home during the day of the screening by a visiting health care worker. Workplace screening overcomes these challenges.
METHODS: To assess the feasibility of a screening program to detect potentially pre-malignant oral disorders in a workplace in India, clinically visible mucosal lesions were compared with the clinical photographs of the same lesions assessed by an expert. Role of smoking, alcohol, and chewing betel quid and tobacco in the etiology of those lesions were assessed.
RESULTS: Sixty-nine percent of the eligible subjects participated in the screening (n=1613). Prevalence of leukoplakia was 5%. Bidi (OR=35.6), and cigarette smoking (OR=22.8), alcohol (OR=17.6), and tobacco and areca nut chewing (OR=7.5), were significantly associated with leukoplakia and erythroplakia (all P< 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Conduction of a screening program by valid visual inspection to detect potentially malignant oral disorders within a workplace is not only feasible but also effective."

The aim of the study was to assess whether ethnicity modified the association between glucose levels and HbA1c and to compare diabetes prevalence according to diagnostic method among Greenland Inuit, Inuit migrants in Denmark, and a general Danish population.
METHODS: Data from two population-based surveys conducted from 1999-2002 were compared with a total of 7957 individuals, 1173 Inuit participants from the Greenland Population Study, including 256 Inuit migrants in Denmark, and 6784 Danish participants in the Inter99 study. The participants received a standard 75-g OGTT. HbA1c was analyzed by an ion-exchange HPLC Bio-Rad variant (Hercules, California). All analyses were performed in the laboratory at Steno Diabetes Centre.
RESULTS: The Inuit had significantly higher levels of HbA1c than the Danish participants at any given level of fasting and 2-h glucose and for each category of glucose tolerance: normal glucose tolerance, impaired fasting glycemia, and impaired glucose tolerance. The prevalence of diabetes diagnosed by OGTT was 11.2% among Inuit residents in Greenland, 9.8% among Inuit migrants, and 4.2% among Danes vs. 31.7% among Inuit residents in Greenland, 21.3% among Inuit migrants, and 6.7% among Danes diagnosed by HbA1c. OGTT-defined diabetes was associated with increased cardiovascular risk factors compared to HbA1c-defined diabetes.
CONCLUSION: The association between glucose and HbA1c is not the same in the two populations. The mechanism behind this difference is unknown, and studies on long-term consequences associated with HbA1c are needed."
20739788,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20739788/,"BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is mostly diagnosed clinically, but the diagnosis has significantly improved through the use of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), testing of cerebrospinal fluid, and multimodal evoked potentials (MEPs). Even though MRI is the superior method in diagnosing this illness, MEPs remain important because they can detect clinically silent lesions in the sensory and motor pathways of the central nervous system (CNS).
AIM: The aim of the study is to test the diagnostic sensitivity of MEPs and MRI and the ratio of their sensitivity in patients with MS.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study subjects included 293 patients with MS with disease duration of two to six years: 249 patients with relapsing-remitting (RR) MS and 44 with primary-progressive (PP) MS. All patients were subjected to an MRI brain scan, visual evoked potentials (VEPs), median somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs), tibial somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs), and auditory evoked potentials (AEPs). Abnormal Findings Included : changed wave morphology, interside difference in wave amplitude, absolute and interwave latency increased by 2.5 SD as compared with the control group. The control group comprised of 35 healthy subjects. Results : In this study the most abnormal findings were tibial SEPs, median SEPs, and VEPs. Our results suggest different sensitivity of MEPs in patients suffering from different forms of MS. In RR-MS the sensitivity of tibial SEPs was statically significant (Fischer's exact probability test) as compared to other evoked potential modalities. Similarly VEPs were more sensitive as compared to AEPs. In the PP-MS, median SEPs have been found to be more sensitive than VEPs, while tibial SEPs have been found to be more sensitive than AEPs. There was no significant difference in the sensitivity of MRI and MEPs both the forms of MS.
CONCLUSION: Tibial SEPs produce the most abnormal results and the highest sensitivity in the RR-MS. We propose that this test as useful criterion for the diagnosis of MS."
20739845,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20739845/,"OBJECTIVE(S): Profiling of hospitals using risk-adjusted mortality rates as a measure of quality is becoming increasingly frequent. We sought to determine the validity of this approach by comparing the risk-adjusted predicted mortality to the findings of concurrent peer review and retrospective chart review of deaths that occur on a general surgery service.
METHODS: Consecutive patients admitted to a busy general surgery service from January 2000 to January 2006 were prospectively entered into the Surgical Activity Tracking System. Rigorous, systematic peer review was performed concurrently by service members on all deaths. Adjudication was later validated by an independent senior surgeon. Three methodologies of risk adjustment (University Health Consortium, Physiological and Operative Severity Score for the enUmeration of Mortality, and the Charlson index) were used and compared the ""excess mortality"" predicted by each to the number of potentially preventable deaths determined by peer review.
RESULTS: A total of 9623 patients were admitted and 75 died (0.7%). University Health Consortium and Physiological and Operative Severity Score predicted an excess mortality of 62 and 65 deaths, respectively; Charlson predicted that 73% of the cohort would be dead in 1 year. Concurrent and retrospective peer review found that death was potentially preventable in only 22 and 21 patients, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Peer adjudication and extensive clinical review adds much to the analysis of an adverse outcome, similar to the ""black box"" in an airplane crash. Although methods of risk adjustment may be helpful in identifying patients for peer review, they should be used for internal process improvement and not published as metrics of hospital or provider performance."
20740339,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20740339/,"BACKGROUND: The stability of Clostridium difficile toxins is an important factor in determining the accuracy of the enzyme immunoassay (EIA). The Centers for Disease Control has stated that C. difficile toxins may become undetectable in unrefrigerated stool specimens within 2 h after collection.
PURPOSE: The purpose of our study was to determine how the unrefrigerated handling time of human fecal specimens affects the results of C. difficile infection (CDI) testing.
METHODS: A retrospective review of CDI testing with Premier™ Toxins A and B kit was conducted in northern New Jersey, USA. Stool collection times and receiving times were recorded for each specimen. The unrefrigerated handling time was calculated for each.
RESULTS: A total of 1126 fecal specimens were submitted. We excluded 72 fecal specimens due to incomplete documentation. We included 1054 fecal specimens collected from 636 hospitalized patients. A total of 132 out of 1054 specimens (12.5%) tested positive for C. difficile toxins. Nine hundred and fifty-four specimens were unrefrigerated for 13 h or less, of which 127 (13.3%) tested positive. Five (5%) of the 100 specimens that were unrefrigerated for more than 13 h tested positive (p = 0.02).
CONCLUSION: C. difficile toxins can still be detected up to 13 h after collection in unrefrigerated human fecal specimens. However, fecal specimens should be processed according to the current recommendations to ensure the reliability of EIA testing until the results of our study are confirmed with prospective studies."
21678288,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21678288/,"BACKGROUND: Identification of individual factors associated with high defibrillation threshold (DFT) seems to be of high clinical importance. Impedance cardiography (ICG) may be used for non-invasive evaluation of the haemodynamic status. Whether ICG parameters may improve identification of patients with high DFT has not yet been examined.
AIM: To evaluate clinical risk factors of high DFT including ICG parameters.
METHODS: The study group included 69 patients with heart failure (aged 62.7 ± 9.5 years, NYHA class: I-III) selected for implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). Clinical assessment included physical examination, echocardiography and ICG monitoring before and after defibrillation.
RESULTS: Initial defibrillation was unsuccessful in 17 (36.6%) patients. High DFT group was characterised by higher left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD ≥ 5.6 cm: 100.0% vs 70.2%; p = 0.01), lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF < 30%: 76.5% vs 44.7%; p = 0.024), higher baseline thoracic fluid content (one of ICG parameters) (TFC ≥ 35 1/kOhm: 29.4% vs 6.4%; p = 0.014) and more frequent amiodarone treatment (41.2% vs 14.9%; p = 0.025). A proposed algorithm based on predefined values of TFC, LVEF and LVEDD was shown to be effective in predicting high DFT (area under curve: 0.771).
CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors of high DFT include left ventricular enlargement, low LVEF, high TFC and amiodarone treatment. An algorithm including TFC measurement by ICG increases the efficacy of identification of patients with high DFT."
21678840,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21678840/,"BACKGROUND: Antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies are thought to be present in at least 25% of immune thrombocytopenia patients. Conversely, more than 25% of patients with aPL antibody syndrome (APLAS) present with thrombocytopenia.
AIMS: To identify the rate of a PL antibody positivity in patients with isolated thrombocytopenia and correlate this finding with the occurrence ofthromboembolic (TE) events or equivalents.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: By performing prospective andretrospective analysis of a series of 64 consecutive patients with moderate persistent thrombocytopenia, we established the serologic evidence of APLAS and performed the existing clinico-laboratory correlations. The presence of aPL antibodies in patients with thromocytopenia was tested for statistical significance using chi2 test of independence for categorical variables (one degree of freedom, 95% confidence) as well as Fisher's exact test for small numbers of observations.
RESULTS: We detected the presence of aPL antibodies in nine of 64 (14%) of patients with isolated thrombocytopenia and four of nine APLAS patients (approximately 44%) also tested positive for antiplatelet antibodies. Five of nine APLAS patients (approximately 56%) had a consistently increased mean platelet volume (MPV). Although the numbers are small, the values proved statistically significant. Two of nine APLAS patients (approximately 22%) developed TE events or equivalents, and two patients were subsequently diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus.
CONCLUSIONS: We believe that patients with isolated thrombocytopenia should be tested for the presence of aPL antibodies, as our findings have shown a correlation between the presence of aPL antibodies and occurrence of TE events. Identification of an APLAS subset in this context appears justified in terms of early institution of antiplatelet therapy, especially in patients with additional cardiovascular risk factors."
21679078,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21679078/,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the usefulness of a new transfemoral device to avoid major complications related to residual type A aortic dissection following ascending aortic replacement.
CASE REPORTS: Three men (aged 60, 61, and 72 years, respectively) with a residual type A aortic dissection following replacement of the ascending aorta 1, 4, and 5 years prior, respectively, were treated with the Djumbodis Dissection System. The residual dissection developed at the distal anastomosis of the aortic graft and involved all the aortic arch. The Djumbodis Dissection System is an uncovered steel stent, available in 3 lengths (40, 90, 140 mm), pre-mounted on a low pressure (0.3 bars) balloon catheter. The mesh of the device is sufficiently large to bring together the dissected layers without occluding main vital branches. The device was implanted through the femoral artery over a stiff guidewire to exclude the residual false lumen. Satisfactory aortic remodeling was documented in all cases at 1 year.
CONCLUSION: The Djumbodis Dissection System might be a purely endovascular treatment to replace open surgery for residual type A aortic dissection. More cases and longer follow-up are required."
21679187,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21679187/,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Complex relationships exist between diabetes and periodontal disease. Diabetes is accepted as a risk factor for periodontal disease, and recent evidence supports the existence of a bidirectional relationship between these two diseases. It has been hypothesized that inflammation, lipids and adipokines may mediate these relationships. However, research regarding the above relationships with respect to aggressive periodontitis is very limited. This pilot study aimed to investigate whether patients with aggressive periodontitis (not previously diagnosed with diabetes) have evidence of diabetes and have altered serum levels of inflammatory mediators, lipids and adipokines.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Glycaemic control markers (random plasma glucose and glycated haemoglobin), inflammatory mediators (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, tumour necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, interferon-γ and interleukin-18), lipids (triglycerides, total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol) and adipokines (leptin, adiponectin and resistin) were measured in serum samples from 30 patients with aggressive periodontitis and 30 age- and sex-matched periodontally healthy control subjects, none of whom had a previous diagnosis of diabetes.
RESULTS: Levels of glycaemic control markers, inflammatory mediators, lipids and adipokines were not significantly different (p > 0.05) between the aggressive periodontitis patients and healthy subjects for unadjusted and adjusted analyses (adjusting for body mass index, smoking, ethnicity, age and sex). The p-value for the adjusted analysis of adiponectin in female aggressive periodontitis patients compared with the female control subjects reached 0.064, the mean adiponectin level being lower in the female aggressive periodontitis patients (4.94 vs. 5.97 μg/mL).
CONCLUSION: This pilot study provided no evidence to suggest that patients with aggressive periodontitis (not previously diagnosed with diabetes) have evidence of diabetes or altered serum levels of inflammatory mediators, lipids and adipokines."
21679194,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21679194/,"BACKGROUND: Isopropyl alcohol is a secondary alcohol, a structural isomer of propanol, that is widely used as an industrial solvent and as a preservative and antiseptic in the clinical environment. It is known to be a mild irritant for the eyes and mucous membranes, but is considered to be a weak and infrequent sensitizer.
OBJECTIVES: To show that isopropyl alcohol should be considered as a potential allergen in patients with eczema who have contact with this substance.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We present a series of 1450 patients patch tested with isopropyl alcohol during the period 1992-2011.
RESULTS: Forty-four patients showed an allergic response to isopropyl alcohol. Four cases presented as occupational hand eczema. Fourteen cases were seen in patients with leg ulcers. Twenty-six patients presented with eczematous lesions following the use of products containing isopropyl alcohol to disinfect previous skin lesions. Eighty-four per cent of the patients showed sensitization to three or more allergens. Relevance was present in 84% of the patients.
CONCLUSIONS: We report here the first large case series of contact allergy to isopropyl alcohol, which demonstrates that sensitization to this substance might not be as uncommon as previously thought."

BACKGROUND: The harbouring of negative attitudes by nurses towards any patient can have implications for recovery. To gather robust evidence upon which to base information and education aimed at fostering acceptance, support and general positivity towards people with mental health illness, a valid and reliable system of data collection is required.
METHOD: A confirmatory factor analysis of both the original Community Attitudes towards the Mentally Ill scale and two modified versions of the scale were carried out during May - June 2007 using a data set representing the responses of 858 European nurses to the scale. Data were subjected to three different confirmatory factor analyses using Maximum Likelihood estimation in the software package, Analysis of Moment Structures 7. A number of absolute, relative and incremental fit statistics were used to assess the fit of the original Community Attitudes towards the Mentally Ill scale and two modified versions to the European nursing data.
FINDINGS: A modification of the scale was found to be most suitable for use in the investigation of European nurses' attitudes towards mental illness and people with mental illness.
CONCLUSION: Further research is recommended to develop a valid and reliable research tool to specifically measure the attitudes of 'nurses' working across different mental healthcare facilities towards this vulnerable patient group."
21679257,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21679257/,"BACKGROUND: Motivations for tattoo removal include employment reasons, stigmata, changes in lifestyles or partners, incompatibility with present attitudes and values and clothing problems. Most studies on the motivations for tattoo removal have focused on patients seeking laser therapy. We hypothesized that patients seeking surgical tattoo removal would present with different motivations.
OBJECTIVE: We analysed the characteristics and motivations of patients specifically requesting surgical tattoo removal.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 16 patients in Helsinki, Finland, from 2005 to 2011. Demographic, clinical data, number of tattoos, location and size, time elapsed since tattooing, reason(s) for wanting surgical tattoo removal and surgical operations were analysed and compared with the other literature on tattoo removal.
RESULTS: Patients were mainly Caucasian females (ratio 3 : 1, median age of 26 years). Tattoos were all done by studio artists, most measured less than 30 cm², and were quite recent (median 5.3 years). Personal reasons accounted for 42.8% of all reasons, professional/social reasons for 37.5% and miscellaneous for 18.8%. Personal concerns were usually marital status changes, with few expressing dissatisfaction with the actual design of the tattoo. Tattoos were excised during a single procedure in 70% of the cases with only one case producing a hypertrophic scar.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients seeking surgical removal were aware of the limits and risks of the technique. They expressed intense personal reasons for wanting radical surgical removal. The possibility of surgical tattoo removal should be accessible to patients if the tattoo is small and discussion reveals strong personal motivation."
21679287,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21679287/,"CONTEXT: The debate over primary care reform in France, as in most OECD countries, centres on questions about efficacy and accessibility. Do these reforms actually respond to the users' concerns?
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to identify the importance that users attribute to different aspects of general practice (GP) care.
DESIGN: The method used was a variant of the classical Delphi approach, called Delphi 'ranking-type'. Between May and September 2009, 74 experts aged over 18 were recruited by 'snowballing' sampling. Three iterative rounds were required to identify the core aspects through a consensus-building approach.
RESULTS: It is shown that users attribute a very high importance to the 'doctor-patient relationship' dimension. The following aspects 'GP patient information about his/her illness', 'Clarity of communication and explanation', and 'Whether the GP seemed listen to the patient' were evaluated by 96% of the experts as being of high importance. The coordination of GP was also considered as a very important aspect for 85% of the experts. In contrast, the aspects that belong to the organizational dimension appeared to be of relatively low importance for users.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results support a comprehensive approach of care and argue in favour of care reorganization following the patient-centred model. To promote organizational care reforms through the prism of the doctor-patient relationship could thus be a fruitful way to insure a better quality of care and the social acceptability of the reforms."
21679999,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21679999/,"PURPOSE: The risk of biochemical recurrence is inversely related to the relapse-free interval after radical prostatectomy. We examined predictors of late biochemical recurrence, and the relationship between timing of biochemical recurrence and long-term survival outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Of 10,609 men treated with radical prostatectomy 1,684 had biochemical recurrence. We examined predictors of late biochemical recurrence (more than 10 years after radical prostatectomy), and calculated metastasis-free and cancer specific survival rates from the time of biochemical recurrence. In the subset of 1,583 men with an undetectable prostate specific antigen at 10 years we calculated actuarial metastasis-free and cancer specific survival estimates at 20 years after radical prostatectomy.
RESULTS: Of the biochemical recurrence studied 77.0%, 16.6%, 4.9% and 1.5% occurred at 5 or less, greater than 5 to 10, greater than 10 to 15 and more than 15 years postoperatively. Late recurrence was associated with more favorable pathological features, as well as higher metastasis-free and cancer specific survival rates. For men with an undetectable prostate specific antigen at 10 years the actuarial probability of biochemical recurrence and metastasis at 20 years varied by stage and grade, with no metastases in patients with a prostatectomy Gleason score 6 or less. A single patient with an undetectable prostate specific antigen at 10 years died of prostate cancer within 20 years after radical prostatectomy.
CONCLUSIONS: Men with an undetectable prostate specific antigen for more than 10 years have a low risk of subsequent biochemical recurrence, with correspondingly lower rates of metastasis and death. These patients should be counseled that their risk of subsequent cancer related morbidity and mortality is low. Furthermore, these results suggest that annual prostate specific antigen testing may be safely discontinued after 10 years for men with a prostatectomy Gleason score 6 or less and/or limited life expectancy."
21680121,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21680121/,"BACKGROUND: The impact of mechanical ventilation on the incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants is unknown, simply because the vast majority of these infants have been routinely intubated and mechanically ventilated. There is a growing interest in the use of early nasal continuous positive airway pressure (ENCPAP) and avoiding mechanical ventilation.
OBJECTIVES: To examine the role of mechanical ventilation since delivery room in determining severe IVH in VLBW infants in two neonatal units that follow the same strategy of respiratory management using ENCPAP.
METHODS: We collected data on delivery room intubation and mechanical ventilation during the first 3 days of life in VLBW infants. Logistic regression model was constructed to test the relationship between early mechanical ventilation and the diagnosis of severe IVH after controlling for significant confounding variables, such as BW, gender, duration of mechanical ventilation, and partial pressure of CO(2) (PCO(2)).
RESULTS: Of the studied 340 VLBW, 35 infants had severe IVH; most of them received mechanical ventilation that started either in the delivery room (n=12) or during the first (n=10) and second (n=3) days of life. Severe IVH was independently associated with lower BW, mechanical ventilation in the delivery room, and the cumulative duration of mechanical ventilation during the first 3 days. The adjusted odds ratio for severe IVH in infants intubated in delivery room was (OR=2.7, CI: 1.1-6.6, P=0.03). Severe IVH was not associated with gender, prenatal steroids, early sepsis, or patent ductus arteriosus.
CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical ventilation plays a role in predicting severe IVH. Both the time at which ventilation was initiated and the duration of ventilation are important determinants of severe IVH. Risk for severe IVH in infants who were never intubated in delivery room or during the first 3 days of life is miniscule."
21680679,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21680679/,"UNLABELLED: White blood cell (WBC) scintigraphy is considered the nuclear medicine imaging gold standard for diagnosing osteomyelitis in the diabetic foot. Recent papers have suggested that the use of (18)F-FDG PET/CT produces similar diagnostic accuracy, but clear interpretation criteria have not yet been established. Our aim was to evaluate the role of sequential (18)F-FDG PET/CT in patients with a high suspicion of osteomyelitis to define objective interpretation criteria to be compared with WBC scintigraphy.
METHODS: Thirteen patients whom clinicians considered positive for osteomyelitis (7 with ulcers, 6 with exposed bone) were enrolled. The patients underwent (99m)Tc-exametazime WBC scintigraphy with acquisition times of 30 min, 3 h, and 20 h and sequential (18)F-FDG PET/CT with acquisition times of 10 min, 1 h, and 2 h. A biopsy or tissue culture was performed for final diagnosis. Several interpretation criteria (qualitative and quantitative) were tested.
RESULTS: At final biopsy, 7 patients had osteomyelitis, 2 had soft-tissue infection without osteomyelitis, and 4 had no infection. The best interpretation criterion for osteomyelitis with WBC scintigraphy was a target-to-background (T/B) ratio greater than 2.0 at 20 h and increasing with time. A T/B ratio greater than 2.0 at 20 h but stable or decreasing with time was suggestive of soft-tissue infection. A T/B ratio of no more than 2.0 at 20 h excluded an infection. Thus, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy for osteomyelitis were 86%, 100%, 100%, 86%, and 92%, respectively. For (18)F-FDG PET/CT, the best interpretation criterion for osteomyelitis was a maximal standardized uptake value (SUVmax) greater than 2.0 at 1 and 2 h and increasing with time. A SUVmax greater than 2.0 after 1 and 2 h but stable or decreasing with time was suggestive of a soft-tissue infection. An SUVmax less than 2.0 excluded an infection. (18)F-FDG PET at 10 min was not useful. Using these criteria, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy for osteomyelitis were 43%, 67%, 60%, 50%, and 54%, respectively. Combining visual assessment of PET at 1 h and CT was best for differentiating between osteomyelitis and soft-tissue infection, with a diagnostic accuracy of 62%.
CONCLUSION: (18)F-FDG PET/CT, even with sequential imaging, has a low diagnostic accuracy for osteomyelitis and cannot replace WBC scintigraphy in patients with diabetic foot."
21680866,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21680866/,"PURPOSE: Mass treatment with azithromycin for trachoma endemic communities typically excludes infants under age 6 months, whose parents are provided with tubes of tetracycline to administer daily over 4 to 6 weeks. The authors sought to determine whether infants aged <6 months are a source of re-emergent infection in their families after mass treatment in trachoma-endemic communities.
METHODS: In a longitudinal study of all children aged less than 10 years in four communities, the authors identified 91 infants aged <6 months living in 86 of 1241 households. All children aged <ten years in all households were examined for trachoma and ocular infection with C. trachomatis at baseline, and 6 months after mass drug administration.
RESULTS: The prevalence of infection at baseline in the infants was 5.9%. At 6 months post mass drug administration, the rate of infection among children older than 6 months and less than 10 years who resided in households with infants was 6.0% compared with 11.1% in children in households without infants (P = 0.18). After adjustment for age, sex, baseline infection status, and treatment, residing in a household with an infant was not associated with infection at 6 months (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] 0.50 [0.20-1.22]).
CONCLUSIONS: This prospective study did not find evidence that living in a household with an infant increased the risk of infection 6 months post mass drug administration in other children residing in the household."

METHODS: An 11-year database of consecutive ruptured intracranial aneurysms treated with endovascular coiling or craniotomy and clipping was analyzed. Outcome was measured by the modified Rankin Scale at 6 months. Our policy is to treat all cases within 24 hours of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Treatment delays are due to nonclinical logistical factors.
RESULTS: Two hundred thirty cases were coiled or clipped within 24 hours of subarachnoid hemorrhage and 229 at >24 hours. No difference in age, gender, smoking, family history of subarachnoid hemorrhage, aneurysm size, or aneurysm location was found between the groups. Poor World Federation of Neurological Surgeons clinical grade patients were overrepresented in the ultra-early group. Increasing age and higher World Federation of Neurological Surgeons clinical grade were predictors of poor outcome. Eight point zero percent (16 of 199) of cases treated within 24 hours of SAH (ultra-early) were dependent or dead at 6 months compared with 14.4% (30 of 209) of those treated at >24 hours post-SAH (delayed; (χ2, P0.044) [corrected]. A total of 3.5% of cases coiled within 24 hours were dependent or dead at 6 months compared with 12.5% of cases coiled at 1 to 3 days, an 82% relative risk reduction and a 10.2% absolute risk reduction (χ2, P=0.040). These groups did not differ in age, World Federation of Neurological Surgeons clinical grade, aneurysm size, or aneurysm location.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of ruptured aneurysms within 24 hours is associated with improved clinical outcomes compared with treatment at >24 hours. The benefit is more pronounced for coiling than clipping."

DESIGN: Tissue samples were obtained from the upper portion of the descending trapezius muscle in three female patients (PAT) with clinically diagnosed myalgia and assessed for a spectrum of properties related to substrate use, energy production, and excitation-contraction coupling and were compared with samples from three healthy controls.
RESULTS: At the level of organization of the metabolic pathways, all PAT generally displayed normal activities of enzymes representing the potential for oxidative phosphorylation, glucose phosphorylation, glycolysis, and lactate oxidation. In contrast, a reduced potential was observed in PAT for both fat oxidation (-20%) and high-energy phosphate transfer (-38%). For excitation-contraction coupling, PAT had a compromised sarcoplasmic reticulum maximal Ca-ATPase activity (-21%), Ca uptake (-44%), and sarcoplasmic endopleasmic reticulum (SERCA) expression for both SERCA1a (-16%) and SERCA2a (-17%), which were accompanied by a lower phase 2 Ca release (-45%). The Na-K-ATPase concentration, the enzyme-regulating membrane excitability via active Na and K seemed elevated (+25%) in PAT.
CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the feasibility of analyzing tissue samples for a wide range of properties and provide a rationale for studies examining the cellular basis of myalgia with particular emphasis on sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca cycling, given the latter's role in regulating a wide range of cellular functions."
21681134,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21681134/,"STUDY DESIGN: Prospective consecutive multicenter case series.
OBJECTIVE: To compare fixation type and amount to curve correction controlled for curve flexibility.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The enhanced spinal purchase from segmental fixation should increase the force implants can exert without failure. This study evaluates whether this translates into correction beyond that expected from preoperative bending radiographs in thoracic curves where maximum correction was feasible (1A, 1B, and nonselective 1C fusions).
METHODS: One hundred seventy-one Lenke type 1 curves (118 1A, 36 1B, 23 1C) with 2-year follow-up were evaluated for the number and type of fixation points within the main curves compared to the correction obtained on preoperative bend films. SRS scores were compared to the amount of correction.
RESULTS: The number of fixation points both within the curve (P = 0.01) and for each vertebral body (P = 0.002) was larger for curves with greater correction compared to the bend films than those with less correction. Overall absolute correction was best for all screw and screw and wire constructs, followed by hook and screw, and least with hooks. However, compared to the bend films, these differences were not significant (P = 0.132). For all groups, the SRS scores significantly improved (P < 0.001), and was slightly more notable for the all screw constructs than other instrumentation patterns (P = 0.023). However, there were no significant difference in this improvement between those correcting more and those correcting less than the bend films (P = 0.578).
CONCLUSION: Absolute curve correction improved most with all pedicle screw and screw and wire constructs, but, when compared to bending films, the number of fixation points is more important than fixation type for curve correction. Although SRS scores improved the most in those with all screw constructs, the significance of this improvement is uncertain, and the SRS scores did not relate to whether curve correction was more or less than the bend films."

Baseball is played also by blind subjects that participate in many other sports. In this study, we evaluated the role of the Italian modified version of baseball for blind subjects on balance.
METHODS: This modified version of baseball maintains the fast-moving characteristic ensuring the athlete safety. Forty total blind subjects were enrolled: 20 baseball athletes and 20 sedentary participants, as control. The balance was evaluated using the Fukuda Test and Tinetti Test, both in silence and in noise.
RESULTS: This baseball game may help to improve the balance ability in blind subjects. The balance was significantly improved in blind athletes as compared with blind sedentary subjects.
CONCLUSION: Given the peculiar characteristics of play, this modified version of baseball seems effective in improving various motor skills that, once transferred into daily activities, may significantly ameliorate the quality of life of blind subjects."
21681777,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21681777/,"BACKGROUND: African-Americans (AA) are at risk for benign ethnic neutropenia (BEN), which has been implicated as a potential source of disparity in cancer outcomes among AAs. Since AAs with prostate cancer (PCa) are more likely to have aggressive pathological features, this investigation sought to determine if absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is associated with adverse pathologic findings at radical prostatectomy (RP) within a cohort of AA men.
METHODS: A single-institution, retrospective review was conducted of all AA patients undergoing RP who had a pre-operative CBC with differential and known RP pathology. Neutropenia was defined as ANC ≤1.5 × 10(9) /L (1.5). Clinical and pathologic variables were characterized for the study cohort, and Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses performed to evaluate the association between ANC and adverse pathology.
RESULTS: A total of 336 patients were included, and 18 patients (5.4%) had ANC ≤1.5. Mean age was 59.8 ± 7.5 years; mean follow-up time 47.4 ± 43.3 months. Neutropenic patients had significantly higher clinical stages and pathologic Gleason scores (P < 0.05). On multivariable analysis, ANC ≤1.5 was significantly predictive of high tumor grade (HR 1.22, CI 1.01-1.48).
CONCLUSIONS: Neutropenia in AAs predicts high tumor grade at prostatectomy. Further studies are necessary to further characterize the importance of these findings with regard to the pathogenesis of PCa, particularly as it relates to the AA population."
21681849,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21681849/,"OBJECTIVES: High sitting height ratio (SHR) is a characteristic commonly associated with Inuit morphology. Inuit are described as having short leg lengths and high trunk-to-stature proportions such that cutoffs for obesity derived from European populations may not adequately describe thresholds of disease risk. Further, high SHR may help explain the reduced impact of BMI on metabolic risk factors among Inuit relative to comparison populations. This study investigates the relationship between SHR and body mass index (BMI) in Inuit.
METHODS: Subjects are 2,168 individuals (837 males and 1,331 females) from 36 Inuit communities in the Canadian Arctic. Mean age is 42.63 ± 14.86 years in males and 41.71 ± 14.83 years in females. We use linear regression to examine the association between age, sex, height, sitting height, SHR, waist circumference (WC), and BMI. We then evaluate the efficacy of the relative sitting height adjustment as a method of correcting observed BMI to a population-standardized SHR.
RESULTS: Mean BMI is significantly higher than among non-Inuit Canadians. Obesity prevalence is high, particularly among Inuit women. In the regression, only age and WC are significant predictors of BMI. While SHR is significantly greater than that of the US population, there is substantial agreement between overweight and obesity prevalence using observed and corrected BMI.
CONCLUSIONS: We find no consistent relationship between SHR and BMI and suggest the unique anthropometric and metabolic profile observed in Inuit arise from factors not yet delineated. More complex anthropometric and imaging studies in Inuit are needed."

The purpose of this study was to understand the prevalence of major depression among English-speaking individuals worldwide looking for information on depression online.
METHODS: An automated online Mood Screener website was created and advertised via Google AdWords, for 1 year. Participants (N = 24,965) completed a depression screening measure and received feedback based on their results. Participants were then invited to participate in a longitudinal mood screening study.
RESULTS: Of the 24,965 who completed the screening, 66.6% screened positive for current major depression, 44.4% indicated current suicidality, and 7.8% reported a recent (past 2 weeks) suicide attempt. Of those consenting to participate in the longitudinal study (n = 1,327 from 86 countries), 77.4% screened positive for past depression, 64.6% reported past suicidality, and 17.5% past suicide attempt. Yet, only 25% of those screening positive for current depression, and only 37.2% of those reporting a recent suicide attempt are in treatment.
CONCLUSION: Many of the consumers of Internet health information may genuinely need treatment and are not ""cyberchondriacs."" Online screening, treatment, and prevention efforts may have the potential to serve many currently untreated clinically depressed and suicidal individuals."

STUDY DESIGN: This was an Institutional Review Board-approved retrospective review of all AGC Pap smears performed at University Hospital, Newark, New Jersey, between January 1, 2001, and July 30, 2008. We defined significant pathology as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 (CIN 2) or greater, endocervical adenocarcinoma in situ or greater, or simple hyperplasia or greater of the endometrium.
RESULTS: Medical records of 126 patients were reviewed. Forty did not meet inclusion criteria; 86 patients were included in the analysis. Thirty of the 86 (34.9%) patients were found to have significant pathology.

21682175,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21682175/,"OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates emergency physicians' perceptions of the malpractice risk posed by utilization of physician assistants (PAs) in emergency departments (EDs) in 2004 and again in 2009.
METHODS: A 16-question survey was mailed to a random sample of 1,000 active members of the American College of Emergency Physicians in 2004 and again in 2009.
RESULTS: In both 2004 and 2009, 70% of the emergency physicians did not believe that PAs, when properly supervised, are more likely to commit malpractice than any other clinician. In both surveys, 80% of the respondents did not believe PAs were more likely to be sued for malpractice. A significant negative correlation was found between perceived risk of malpractice by PAs and the number of years physicians had worked with PAs or had worked in emergency medicine. From 2004 to 2009, the number of respondents practicing with PAs increased by 26%, the number directly supervising a PA in the ED increased by 19%, the number who thought PAs decreased patient wait times increased by 13%, and the number who reported that PAs increased patient satisfaction increased by 10%.
CONCLUSION: As physicians gain clinical experience with PAs, their perceived risk of malpractice tends to decrease. These results may have implications for the utilization of PAs, particularly as EDs become more utilized for noncritical situations."
21682578,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21682578/,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate, in primary health care, differentiated levels of prevention directed at skin cancer, and how the propensity of the patients to change sun habits/sun protection behaviour and attitudes towards sunbathing were affected, three years after intervention. Additionally, the impact of the performance of a phototest as a complementary tool for prevention was evaluated.
DESIGN: Randomized controlled study. Setting and subjects. During three weeks in February, all patients ≥ 18 years of age registering at a primary health care centre in southern Sweden were asked to fill in a questionnaire mapping sun exposure habits, attitudes towards sunbathing, and readiness to increase sun protection according to the Transtheoretical Model of Behaviour Change (TTM) (n = 316). They were randomized into three intervention groups, for which sun protection advice was given, in Group 1 by means of a letter, and in Groups 2 and 3 orally during a personal GP consultation. Group 3 also underwent a phototest to demonstrate individual skin UV sensitivity.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Change of sun habits/sun protection behaviour and attitudes, measured by five-point Likert scale scores and readiness to increase sun protection according to the TTM, three years after intervention, by a repeated questionnaire.
RESULTS: In the letter group, almost no improvement in sun protection occurred. In the two doctor's consultation groups, significantly increased sun protection was demonstrated for several items, but the difference compared with the letter group was significant only for sunscreen use. The performance of a phototest did not appear to reinforce the impact of intervention.
CONCLUSION: Sun protection advice, mediated personally by the GP during a doctor's consultation, can lead to improvement in sun protection over a prolonged time period."
21682986,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21682986/,"BACKGROUND: Intubation and mechanical ventilation can impair mucociliary clearance and cause secretion retention, airway occlusion, atelectasis, and pneumonia. Animal and laboratory work has demonstrated that mechanical ventilator settings can generate a flow bias (inspiratory or expiratory) that may result in mucus movement either away from the ventilator (deeper into the lungs) or toward the ventilator (toward the mouth), respectively. An absolute difference of 17 L/min, and a relative difference of ≥ 10%, between the expiratory and inspiratory flow have been reported as thresholds for mucus movement.
METHODS: We measured baseline peak inspiratory and expiratory flows during quiet mechanical ventilation in a convenience sample of 20 intubated and ventilated adult patients.
RESULTS: Nineteen patients had an inspiratory flow bias of ≥ 10%. Eight patients had an absolute mean inspiratory flow bias of ≥ 17 L/min.
CONCLUSIONS: Commonly used mechanical ventilator settings generate an inspiratory flow bias that may promote secretion retention."
21683210,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21683210/,"PURPOSE: Children treated for perforated appendicitis can have significant morbidity. Management often includes looking for and draining postoperative fluid collections. We sought to determine if drainage hastens recovery.
METHODS: Children with perforated appendicitis treated with appendectomy from 2006 to 2009 were reviewed. Patients with postoperative fluid that was drained were compared with patients with undrained fluid with regard to preoperative features and postoperative outcomes. Statistical analyses included paired Student's t tests, Mann-Whitney U test, and linear regression.
RESULTS: Five hundred ninety-one patients were reviewed. Seventy-one patients had postoperative fluid, of whom 36 had a drainage procedure and 35 did not. There was no significant difference in white blood cell count at the time of assessment for drainage (16.4 ± 4.0 vs 14.6 ± 4.9, P = .14), days with fever (3.5 ± 3.0 vs 2.9 ± 2.5, P = .35), or readmission rate (19% vs 31%, P = .28). After multivariate linear regression, larger fluid volumes were associated with prolonged length of stay (LOS) (P = .03). For fluid collections between 30-100 mL, there was no significant difference in LOS between the drain and no-drain groups (9.8 ± 3.5 vs 10.9 ± 5.2 days, P = .51).
CONCLUSION: After appendectomy for perforated appendicitis, larger postoperative fluid collections are associated with prolonged LOS. Drainage of collections less than 100 mL may not hasten recovery."
21683374,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21683374/,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, the medical literature has shown that statin treatment before and in the acute phase of ischemic stroke has a positive impact on outcome. The possible effect of statins during the acute phase has never been assessed in thrombolysed patients, and the few studies investigating a possible association between prior statin use and outcome after thrombolysis have reported controversial results. The aim of the present study was to assess whether statin treatment started in the acute phase of stroke (within 24h) or before stroke and continued during the acute phase may influence short- and long-term outcome in patients receiving intravenous (IV) thrombolysis.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 250 patients treated with IV thrombolysis. Outcome measures were 3-month good functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale ≤ 2); neurological improvement (reduction ≥ 4 points on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS]) between 24 and 72 h; and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (brain hematoma associated with NIHSS deterioration ≥ 4 points) within 72 h.
RESULTS: Multivariate analysis showed that statin treatment started in the acute phase of stroke was associated with both good functional outcome (OR: 6.18; 95% CI: 1.43-26.62; P=0.015) and neurological improvement (OR: 9.47; 95% CI: 1.98-45.37; P=0.005), whereas statin treatment started before stroke and continued in the acute phase was associated with symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (OR: 6.65; 95% CI: 1.58-29.12; P=0.010).
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that statin treatment started within 24h after IV thrombolysis, but not statin treatment started before stroke and continued in the acute phase, may improve short- and long-term outcome."
21683391,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21683391/,"PURPOSE: The American Urological Association In-Service Examination and the American Board of Urology Qualifying Examination are written multiple choice tests that cover all domains in urology. We investigated whether In-Service Examination performance could identify chief residents who scored in the lowest quartile on the Qualifying Examination.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All urology chief residents in the United States and Canada in 2008 and 2009 were eligible to participate in this study. In-Service Examination 2008 and Qualifying Examination 2009 performance data were obtained from the American Urological Association and American Board of Urology, respectively. Data were analyzed with the Pearson correlation and descriptive statistics.
RESULTS: Of the 257 American and Canadian chief residents who completed the Qualifying Examination 2009, 194 (75%) enrolled in this study and were included in analysis. Overall In-Service Examination 2008 scores correlated significantly with Qualifying Examination 2009 scores (r=0.55, p<0.001), accounting for 30% of score variance. Substantial variability in In-Service Examination-Qualifying Examination rankings was notable among individual residents. An In-Service Examination 2008 cutoff percentile rank of 40% identified chief residents in the lowest quartile on the Qualifying Examination 2009 with 71% sensitivity, 77% specificity, and a likelihood ratio of 3.1 and 0.4 (positive and negative likelihood ratios, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: The substantial variability of In-Service Examination-Qualifying Examination performance among individual chief residents limits In-Service Examination predictive utility. A single In-Service Examination score should not be used to make a high stakes judgment about an individual resident. In-Service Examination scores should be used as 1 part of an overall evaluation program to prospectively identify residents who could benefit from additional educational support."
21683474,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21683474/,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: Children evaluated in the emergency department (ED) with minor blunt head trauma, defined by initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores of 14 or 15, are frequently hospitalized despite normal cranial computed tomography (CT) scan results. We seek to identify the frequency of neurologic complications in children with minor blunt head trauma and normal ED CT scan results.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective, multicenter observational cohort study of children younger than 18 years with blunt head trauma (including isolated head or multisystem trauma) at 25 centers between 2004 and 2006. In this substudy, we analyzed individuals with initial GCS scores of 14 or 15 who had normal cranial CT scan results during ED evaluation. An abnormal imaging study result was defined by any intracranial hemorrhage, cerebral edema, pneumocephalus, or any skull fracture. Patients with normal CT scan results who were hospitalized were followed to determine neurologic outcomes; those discharged to home from the ED received telephone/mail follow-up to assess for subsequent neuroimaging, neurologic complications, or neurosurgical intervention.
RESULTS: Children (13,543) with GCS scores of 14 or 15 and normal ED CT scan results were enrolled, including 12,584 (93%) with GCS scores of 15 and 959 (7%) with GCS scores of 14. Of 13,543 patients, 2,485 (18%) were hospitalized, including 2,107 of 12,584 (17%) with GCS scores of 15 and 378 of 959 (39%) with GCS scores of 14. Of the 11,058 patients discharged home from the ED, successful telephone/mail follow-up was completed for 8,756 (79%), and medical record, continuous quality improvement, and morgue review was performed for the remaining patients. One hundred ninety-seven (2%) children received subsequent CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); 5 (0.05%) had abnormal CT/MRI scan results and none (0%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0% to 0.03%) received a neurosurgical intervention. Of the 2,485 hospitalized patients, 137 (6%) received subsequent CT or MRI; 16 (0.6%) had abnormal CT/MRI scan results and none (0%; 95% CI 0% to 0.2%) received a neurosurgical intervention. The negative predictive value for neurosurgical intervention for a child with an initial GCS score of 14 or 15 and a normal CT scan result was 100% (95% CI 99.97% to 100%).
CONCLUSION: Children with blunt head trauma and initial ED GCS scores of 14 or 15 and normal cranial CT scan results are at very low risk for subsequent traumatic findings on neuroimaging and extremely low risk of needing neurosurgical intervention. Hospitalization of children with minor head trauma after normal CT scan results for neurologic observation is generally unnecessary."
21684070,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21684070/,"BACKGROUND: Controversy exists regarding the optimal extent of lymphadenectomy and the number of lymph nodes to be retrieved at radical cystectomy (RC).
OBJECTIVE: To compare the disease-free survival of patients with standard lymphadenectomy (endopelvic region composed of the internal, external iliac, and obturator groups of lymph nodes) versus extended lymphadenectomy (up to the level of origin of the inferior mesenteric artery) at RC in a prospective cohort of patients at a single, high-volume center.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective data were collected from 400 consecutive patients treated with RC for bladder cancer by two high-volume surgeons at Mansoura Urology and Nephrology Center. Of the 400 patients, 200 (50%) received extended lymphadenectomy and the other 200 (50%) underwent standard lymphadenectomy at RC. The patients did not receive any neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy.
MEASUREMENTS: Patient characteristics and outcomes are evaluated.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Median patient age for the entire group was 53.0 yr. Ninety-six patients (24.0%) had lymph node metastases. Median follow-up was 50.2 mo. Estimates of 5-yr disease-free survival in the extended lymphadenectomy group were 66.6% compared with 54.7% for patients with standard lymphadenectomy (p = 0.043). Extended lymphadenectomy was associated with better disease-free survival after adjusting for the effects of standard pathologic features (p = 0.02). When restricting the analyses to lymph node-positive patients, patients with extended lymphadenectomy had much better 5-yr disease-free survival compared with patients with standard lymphadenectomy (48.0% vs 28.2%; p = 0.029). The study was nonrandomized.
CONCLUSIONS: Extended lymphadenectomy is associated with better disease-free survival for bladder cancer patients with endopelvic lymph node involvement and should be considered in these patients."
21684176,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21684176/,"PURPOSE: To determine whether traffic court appearances and different court verdicts were associated with risk of subsequent speeding citations and crashes.
METHODS: A cohort of 29,754 Maryland drivers ticketed for speeding who either went to court or paid fines by mail in May/June 2003 was followed for 3 years. Drivers appearing in court were categorized by verdicts: 1) not guilty, 2) suspension of prosecution/no prosecution (STET/NP), 3) case dismissed, 4) probation before judgment (PBJ) and fines, or 5) fines and demerit points. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (AHR).
RESULTS: Court appearances were associated with lower risk of subsequent speeding citations (AHR = 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.88-0.96), but higher risk of crashes (AHR = 1.25; 95% CI, 1.16-1.35). PBJ was associated with significantly lower repeat speeding tickets (AHR = 0.83; 95% CI, 0.75-0.91) and a non-significant decrease in crashes (AHR = 0.87; 95% CI, 0.75-1.02). Both repeat speeding tickets and subsequent crashes were significantly lower in the STET/NP group.
CONCLUSIONS: PBJ and STET/NP may reduce speeding and crashes, but neither verdict eliminated excess crash risk among drivers who choose court appearances. Randomized, controlled evaluations of speeding countermeasures are needed to inform traffic safety policies."
21684389,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21684389/,"OBJECTIVE: We determine whether (1) an audiocomputer-delivered tailored feedback intervention increases emergency department (ED) patient uptake of opt-in, nontargeted rapid HIV screening; and (2) uptake is greater among patients who report more HIV risk and among those whose self-perceived HIV risk increases from baseline after completion of an HIV risk assessment.
METHODS: ED patients aged 18 to 64 years were randomly assigned to receive either an assessment about reported and self-perceived HIV risk or an identical assessment plus feedback about their risk for having or acquiring an HIV infection, tailored according to their reported risk. All participants were offered a fingerstick rapid HIV test. Two-sample tests of binomial proportions were used to compare screening uptake by study arm. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the relationship of reported HIV risk and an increase in self-perceived HIV risk with uptake of HIV screening.
RESULTS: Of the 566 participants, the median age was 29 years, 62.2% were women, and 66.9% previously had been tested for HIV. Uptake of HIV screening was similar in the intervention and no intervention arms (54.1% versus 55.5% [Δ=-0.01%; 95% confidence interval {CI} -0.09% to 0.07%]). An increase in self-perceived HIV risk predicted greater uptake of HIV screening for women (odds ratio 2.15; 95% CI 1.08 to 4.28) but not men (odds ratio 1.61; 95% CI 0.60 to 4.30). Uptake of HIV screening was not related to reported HIV risk.
CONCLUSION: Uptake of rapid HIV screening in the ED was not improved by this feedback intervention. Other methods need to be investigated to improve uptake of HIV screening by ED patients."
21684475,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21684475/,"BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Non-invasive predictors of medium/large oesophageal varices (LOVs) could reduce the number of screening endoscopies. As portal hypertension is a consequence of liver fibrosis, serum fibrosis markers were evaluated together with other variables as possible non-invasive predictors of medium OV/LOV.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 154 cirrhotic patients with splenomegaly and 30 healthy control subjects were recruited in a prospective study in two gastroenterology centres in Upper Egypt. Clinical parameters assessed included Child-Pugh class, liver size and ascites. Laboratory parameters included complete blood count, liver function tests, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/platelet ratio. Transforming growth factor-β(1) (TGF-β(1)), alpha(2) macroglobulin (A(2)M) and hyaluronic acid (HA) were assayed. Ultrasonographic examination was done for assessment of liver span, portal vein diameter and detection of minimal ascites. Oesophageal varices were diagnosed and graded by oesophagogastroduodenoscopy.
RESULTS: Fifty-four patients (35%) had no or small varices and 100 (65%) patients had medium OV/LOV by endoscopy. On multivariate analysis, the independent predictors of medium OV/LOV were the presence of ascites (β=0.258, p=0.047) and serum HA (β=0.449, p=0.009). The receiver operating characteristic curve for HA showed the area under the curve to be 0.916. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and diagnostic accuracy of HA at a cut-off value of 207μgl(-1) were 94%, 77.8%, 88.7%, 87.5% and 88.3%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of ascites and serum HA level higher than 207μgl(-1) can predict the presence of medium OV/LOV in cirrhotic patients. This would help physicians to identify patients who would most likely benefit from screening endoscopy and thus, reduce costs and discomfort from unnecessary endoscopic procedures."
21684585,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21684585/,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies on the significance of hCG to predict gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) have been too small for robust conclusions to be reached. Our aim in this study was to analyse the significance of urine hCG in predicting GTN in a large population.
METHODS: Details of 3926 patients were available for analysis. Information regarding age, dates of diagnosis and registration, urine hCG levels, antecedent pregnancy and chemotherapy were prospectively collected and used for analyses. Patients were stratified into different groups according to urine hCG level (IU/L); < 50, 50-99, 100-249, 250-499, 500-999, 1000-9999 and ≥10,000. Multivariate analyses were used to identify the prognostic indicators of GTN.
RESULTS: Urine hCG and antecedent pregnancy were the most powerful indicators for developing GTN (P<0.01). None of the patients with partial mole and urine hCG <50 IU/L (Normal level=40 IU/L) developed GTN. The risk of GTN was >35% in all patients with urine hCG ≥500 IU/L. GTN developed in 70% of patients with complete mole and urine hCG ≥10,000 IU/L.
CONCLUSION: Urine hCG is sensitive test for GTN. Urine hCG level is a powerful prognostic indicator for the GTN. Patients with partial mole could be safely discharged from the surveillance programme once their hCG have normalised. Patients with urine hCG ≥249 IU/L, whether partial or complete molar pregnancy, appear to benefit from intensive surveillance. Prophylactic chemotherapy could be considered when there are problems with surveillance."
21684620,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21684620/,"OBJECTIVES: This study analysed 112 municipalities enforcing municipal smoking restrictions on streets in Japan to examine anti-smoking measures implemented in urban settings from a health perspective and derive lessons for future tobacco control.
METHODS: Municipal governments implementing ordinances which restrict smoking on streets were identified through grey literature review. Implementation period, characteristics, scope, and department responsible were examined.
RESULTS: Since the first municipal regulation was introduced in 1997, many other municipalities have followed. Enforcement of fines started in 2002, which is now a common practice nationwide. Nevertheless, the health impact of exposure to secondhand smoke is not clearly articulated in the ordinances. Street smoking bans have been developed in connection with ""beautification"" and littering prevention for environmental purposes, and local health departments do not have responsibility for these ordinances.
CONCLUSIONS: There is potential to further prevent secondhand smoke exposure if such measures are expanded to indoor environments and integrated into broader policies. For policy-makers and advocates, the Japanese experience provides information on an additional tobacco control intervention as well as clues in the process of design, implementation and enforcement of such municipal measures. A more comprehensive and health-driven approach is required to effectively address the harm of secondhand smoke in Japan."
21684653,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21684653/,"PURPOSE: Although endoscopically assisted transoral open reduction and internal fixation of condylar mandible fractures is currently a popular technique, the need for it and its benefits remains unclear. This prospective study evaluated the efficacy and safety of open reduction and rigid internal fixation of subcondylar fractures of the mandible using a new small angulated screwdriver system without endoscopic assistance.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients with 15 linear subcondylar fractures were treated using this intraoral approach from June 2007 through March 2010 at the Division of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Kagawa Prefectural Central Hospital, Kagawa, Japan. The anatomic reduction of the displaced condylar segments and rigid fixation with 2 2.0-mm locking miniplates were performed using a small angulated screwdriver system, with an average follow-up of 13 months (range, 6 to 30 months).
RESULTS: Correct anatomic reduction of the condylar segments at centric occlusion followed by immediate functional recovery was achieved in all patients. Mean operating time was 50 minutes (range, 35 to 70 minutes) when performed by the consultant surgeon and the residents. In addition, all patients had good temporomandibular joint articular function, with no harmful clinical symptoms or deviation.
CONCLUSIONS: The surgical treatment of linear subcondylar fractures of the mandible can be achieved with an intraoral approach alone, using a small angulated screwdriver system, without endoscopic assistance, offering reliable clinical results and safe and minimally invasive surgery."
21684786,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21684786/,"OBJECTIVE: The aim was to examine the relationship between gestational age and birthweight and adult chronic widespread pain (CWP).
DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: A prospective cohort study of 18,558 participants recorded birthweight and gestation at birth.
EXPOSURE: Participants were categorised by gestation (fullterm ≥37 weeks; preterm <37 week) and birthweight (full birthweight (FBW) ≥2.5 kg; low birthweight (LBW) 1.5-2.5 kg; and very low birthweight (VLBW) <1.5 kg).
OUTCOME: The presence or absence of CWP was measured by self-completed questionnaire in 8572 participants at age 45 yrs. Risk ratios were calculated using Poisson regression. Adjustment was made for potential confounding factors.
RESULTS: Premature birth was associated with a 26% increase in the risk of CWP compared to fullterm birth, although this was not statistically significant (risk ratio 1.26, 95% confidence interval 0.95-1.67). This increased risk was robust to adjustment for sex, social class at birth and age 42 yrs, or birthweight, but was completely attenuated when adjusted for childhood behavioural problems and adult psychiatric disorder. LBW was not associated with an increased risk of CWP (RR 1.01, 95%CI 0.78-1.32). VLBW was associated with a non-significant increased risk (RR 1.48, 0.42-5.22) although there was insufficient study power to examine this relationship in the context of other factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Premature birth and VLBW are associated with increased risk of adult CWP although these effects are modest, and not statistically significant. Although not conclusive in itself, this study lends support to the theory that adult chronic pain may have its origins - at least in part - in very early life."
21684826,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21684826/,"UNLABELLED: Superficial radial nerve injury, incomplete release of the first extensor compartment, palmar subluxation of the tendons and painful scar are the main reasons for persistent pain and dysfunction after open release. We therefore asked whether the endoscopic release of the first extensor compartment is advantageous over the open release in terms of subjective pain and disability, complication and aesthetic appearance.
METHODS: Fifty wrists treated with either open release (26 wrists) or endoscopic release (24 wrists) of the first extensor compartment in case of de Quervain's disease were included. All patients were evaluated at a minimum of 1-year follow-up using visual analogue scale (VAS) pain ratings and the Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score.
RESULTS: The average operating time of endoscopic release was 4 min longer than that of open release. The mean VAS pain score was improved from an initial 6.4 to 0.5 in the open release group and from 6.7 to 0.1 in the endoscopic release group. The mean DASH score was improved from 60.1 to 6.8 in the open release group and from 64.4 to 1.5 in the endoscopic release group. No clinically significant difference was found between the two groups regarding subjective VAS pain and DASH scores at the last follow-up. In the open release group, superficial radial nerve injuries (five wrists), significant scar tenderness (three) and unsightly scar (six) were identified.
CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic release of the extensor compartment seems to be an effective and safe procedure in patients with de Quervain's disease who are unresponsive to non-operative treatments, despite a little increase in operation time."
21685145,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21685145/,"BACKGROUND: A group of non-cirrhotic chronic liver diseases, all with sustained portal hypertension and clinically mistaken as cirrhosis, have been described under various names, apparently because of differences in pathological features. The pathogenesis is uncertain and they were believed to have a good prognosis until it was recently shown, from study of explant livers, that they had progressed to end stage disease, needing liver transplantation.
AIMS: To describe detailed morphological features of such end stage non-cirrhotic disease and examine whether the diseases bearing various names are different or represent variable morphological expressions of one entity.
METHODS: Morphological features of 10 native explant livers from patients with pre-transplant diagnosis of end stage cirrhosis but finally categorised as non-cirrhotic portal fibrosis were analysed along with the relevant clinical information.
RESULTS: Besides absence of criteria for cirrhosis, variable grades of obliterative changes in portal vein branches and portal fibrosis were consistently seen in all livers. Fibrous intimal thickening with luminal compromise in some medium and large sized portal veins was randomly distributed but appeared characteristic of this disease, very likely representing organised mural thrombi. Areas of closely placed nodular hyperplastic parenchyma separated by compressed hepatocytes, megasinusoids and peliotic changes were seen only in a proportion of cases.
CONCLUSION: Non-cirrhotic portal fibrosis is a justifiable name for this disease that can progress to end stage liver disease. It represents a single entity that has been considered as different diseases and given various names on the basis of the dominant element in its heterogeneous morphological manifestation."
21685540,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21685540/,"BACKGROUND: Increasing efavirenz (EFV) dose from 600 mg to 800 mg daily has been suggested with concomitant rifampicin (RFN), as induction of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes may reduce EFV plasma concentrations.
METHODS: Individuals from the CIPRA-South Africa cohort taking EFV-based antiretroviral therapy with concomitant tuberculosis (TB) were dosed with either increased (800 mg) or standard (600 mg) dose EFV during TB treatment. After TB therapy, all individuals took 600 mg EFV. Two mid-dosing interval EFV concentrations were determined from each individual: after 4 weeks of concomitant EFV and RFN therapy, and ≥4 weeks after TB therapy completion. Mid-dosing interval EFV concentrations were compared within individuals using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.
RESULTS: Paired samples were collected from 72 individuals. Overall, 45 (63%) were women and median weight was 59 kg (IQR 52-67). At antiretroviral therapy start, median CD4(+) T-cell count was 114 cells/mm(3) (IQR 37-165), median viral load was 5.5 log (IQR 5.1-5.9). A total of 38 (53%) individuals took 800 mg EFV during TB treatment and 34 (47%) took 600 mg. EFV concentrations in the 800 mg group were higher with RFN (2.9 mg/l [IQR 1.8-5.6]) than without (2.1 mg/l [IQR 1.4-3.0]; P=0.0003). There was no significant difference in EFV concentrations with RFN (2.4 mg/l [IQR 1.2-5.1]) or without (2.2 mg/l [IQR 1.4-3.7]) in the 600 mg group. There was no increase in EFV-linked adverse effects in either group. The proportion of virologically suppressed individuals at 48 weeks was similar in both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: EFV concentrations were significantly increased in the EFV 800 mg group on RFN. There was no significant decrease in EFV concentrations when on RFN in the 600 mg group. Dose escalation of EFV 600 mg to 800 mg is not required during concomitant TB therapy in South Africa."
21687926,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21687926/,"OBJECTIVE: To discuss the importance of a thorough clinical examination and evaluation of symptoms in upper and lower motor neurone lesions.
DESIGN: Case report.
METHODS: Post-polio outpatient clinic, Danderyds University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. We describe here two patients with a past history of poliomyelitis, who were experiencing increasing muscular weakness. Clinical evaluation led to diagnoses of spinal cord injury and statin myopathy, respectively.
CONCLUSION: In order to make a correct diagnosis it is essential to distinguish between lower and upper motor neurone lesions. In the case of a lower motor neurone disorder a neurophysiological examination is necessary for a correct diagnosis, and is a prerequisite for adequate treatment and rehabilitation."
21688006,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21688006/,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the influence of background enhancement on the detection and staging of breast cancer using MRI as an adjunct to mammography or ultrasound.
METHODS: One hundred forty-six bilateral breast MRI examinations were evaluated to assess the extent of a known primary tumour and to problem solve after mammography or ultrasound without adjusting for the phase in the patients' menstrual cycle. The background enhancement was classified into four categories by visual evaluation: minimal, mild, moderate and marked.
RESULTS: In total, 131 histologically confirmed abnormal cases (104 malignant and 27 benign) and 15 normal cases were included in the analysis. There was no tumour size-related bias between the groups (p = 0.522). For the primary index tumour, the sensitivities of MRI with minimal/mild and moderate/marked background enhancement were 100% and 76% (p = 0.001), respectively. Thus, the degree of background enhancement did not affect the specificity. For evaluating tumour extent (n = 104), the accuracy of MRI with moderate/marked background enhancement (52%) was significantly lower than that with minimal/mild background enhancement (84%; p = 0.002).
CONCLUSION: The degree of background enhancement affected the detection and staging of breast cancer using MRI."
21688114,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21688114/,"BACKGROUND: Interventional pulmonology, in particular, tracheobronchial stent insertion, has been well described in the treatment of tracheobronchial malignant disease. Its benefits are particularly obvious in patients with inoperable malignancy or in those unfit for surgery and have been extensively described. Fewer data exist on the benefits of using self-expanding metal stents (SEMS) inserted via flexible bronchoscopy in the treatment of tracheobronchial stenosis due to extrinsic compression or infiltration from primary oesophageal malignancy.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all patients who had stent insertion via flexible bronchoscopy from 2002 to 2010 at our institution.
RESULTS: We found 14 patients who had Ultraflex™ self-expanding metal stent insertion for this condition. We analysed this group of patients with respect to their presentation; indications for stent insertion over surgery; size, location, and number of stents inserted; sedative dose; complications of therapy; and survival time.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that insertion of SEMS via flexible bronchoscopy is a safe and effective therapy for those individuals who require palliation or are too unfit for the general anaesthesia required for surgery. Moreover, this form of stent insertion may be performed by respiratory physicians in the bronchoscopy suite, rather than by their cardiothoracic counterparts in theatre."
21688913,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21688913/,"OBJECTIVE: This study examined associations between the degree of self-disclosure and changes in depressive symptoms in couples coping with colorectal cancer.
METHOD: Sixty-four newly diagnosed patients and their partners completed a measure of depressive symptoms (Center of Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale) 3 and 9 months postdiagnosis. Furthermore, approximately 2 months after the first assessment, they engaged in a cancer-related conversation in which the patient was asked to introduce a concern. Each partner's verbalizations of emotions, thoughts, and wishes (i.e., self-disclosures) were coded by independent observers.
RESULTS: Patients who reported more depressive symptoms at baseline showed more self-disclosures. Mutual self-disclosure was not associated with lower levels of depressive symptoms in patients and partners as compared with one-sided self-disclosure or low disclosure in both patients and partners. It is important to note that decreases in depressive symptoms over time were least prominent in couples in which the partner disclosed a lot whereas the patient disclosed little.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that mere disclosure of emotions and thoughts to one's intimate partner is not beneficial in reducing distress. Partners' self-disclosure toward patients who disclose few emotions and concerns even appears to be harmful both for patients and partners, given that it reduces the decrease of depressive symptoms over time. If there is a mismatch in the need for self-disclosure within couples, partners with a strong need to talk about their emotions and concerns may be recommended to confide in someone else in their social network or to consult a health care professional."
21689097,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21689097/,"OBJECTIVES: To compare changes in medication adherence between patients with high- or low-comorbidity burden after a copayment increase.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study at four Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers by comparing veterans with hypertension or diabetes required to pay copayments with propensity score-matched veterans exempt from copayments. Disease cohorts were stratified by Diagnostic Cost Group risk score: low- (<1) and high-comorbidity (>1) burden. Medication adherence from February 2001 to December 2003, constructed from VA pharmacy claims data based on the ReComp algorithm, were assessed using generalized estimating equations.
RESULTS: Veterans with lower comorbidity were more responsive to a U.S.$5 copayment increase than higher comorbidity veterans. In the lower comorbidity groups, veterans with diabetes had a greater reduction in adherence than veterans with hypertension. Adherence trends were similar for copayment-exempt and nonexempt veterans with higher comorbidity.
CONCLUSION: Medication copayment increases are associated with different impacts for low- and high-risk patients. High-risk patients incur greater out-of-pocket costs from continued adherence, while low-risk patients put themselves at increased risk for adverse health events due to greater nonadherence."
21689121,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21689121/,"BACKGROUND: Given the widespread use of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and other similar groups in the United States and the increasing membership of women, this study compares women with men on their meeting attendance and AA-prescribed behaviors, factors associated with that AA participation, and tests how these relate to women's and men's abstinence across time.
METHODS: All consecutive new admissions (age ≥ 18) from county-wide public and private treatment programs representing the larger population of treatment seekers were approached to be in the study at treatment entry. Those consenting at baseline (n = 926) were sought for follow-up interviews 1, 3, 5, and 7 years later. Generalized linear models were used to test whether various help-seeking factors were associated with AA participation differentially by gender and, controlling for AA and other confounders, whether women differ from men on abstinence.
RESULTS: At each follow-up interview, women and men attended AA at similar rates and similarly practiced specific AA behaviors, and they were alike on most factors associated with AA participation and abstention across time including abstinence goal, drink volume, negative consequences, prior treatment, and encouragement to reduce drinking. Relative to men, women with higher drug severity were less likely to participate in AA. Although higher AA participation was a predictor of abstinence for both genders, men were less likely to be abstinent across time. Men were also more likely to reduce their AA participation across time.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings add to an emerging literature on how women compare with men on factors related to AA participation and subsequent drinking outcomes across time. Findings have clinical implications for service providers referring clients to such groups."
21689320,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21689320/,"AIM: Little is known about the association of haemorrhoids and anorectal function. Moreover, available data on the impact of constipation on the presence of haemorrhoids are conflicting. The present study aimed to assess any potential relationship between haemorrhoids and anorectal dysfunction.
METHOD: All participants who attended the Austrian nationwide healthcare programme for colorectal cancer screening at four medical institutions were enrolled prospectively between 2008 and 2009. A colonoscopy and detailed anorectal examination were performed on all patients. Haemorrhoids were classified according to an international grading system. Faecal incontinence was defined as the involuntary loss of solid stool, liquid stool or gas, at least once a month. Constipation was recorded by a constipation scoring system.
RESULTS: Of 976 participants, 380 (38.9%) were found to have haemorrhoids. There was an association between healthy individuals, patients with symptomatic and patients with asymptomatic haemorrhoids and incontinence of liquid stool. No association was found regarding incontinence for solid stool and gas. The median constipation score was significantly higher in those patients with haemorrhoids (grade I-IV) compared with patients without haemorrhoids (2.5 points (range, 0-19) and 3 points (range, 0-19); P = 0.0113). 'Painful evacuation effort' and 'assistance for defaecation (stimulant laxatives, digital assistance or enema)' showed a significant correlation with haemorrhoids (P = 0.0394 and P = 0.0143).
CONCLUSION: Although the median constipation score was low in both groups, there was a significant association between constipation and haemorrhoids in adult patients."
21690452,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21690452/,"OBJECTIVES: Laparoscopy is increasingly used in colon and rectal procedures. However, little is known regarding the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in laparoscopic colorectal (LC) compared with that in open colorectal (OC) procedures. We aimed to compare the incidences and to highlight the risk factors of developing VTE after LC and OC surgery.
DESIGN: Analysis of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample data from 2002 through 2006.
SETTING: National database.
PATIENTS: Patients who underwent elective LC and OC surgery from 2002 through 2006.
MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURE: Incidence of VTE during initial hospitalization after LC and OC surgery; VTE classified by surgical site, pathology type, and at-risk patient population.
RESULTS: Over a 60-month period, 149,304 patients underwent LC or OC resection. Overall, the incidence of VTE was significantly higher in OC cases (2036 of 141,456 [1.44%]) compared with the incidence in LC cases (65 of 7848 [0.83%]) (P < .001). When stratified according to pathologic condition and surgical site, the overall rate of VTE was highest in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and in those undergoing rectal resections. Patients who underwent OC surgery were almost twice as likely to develop VTE compared with patients who underwent LC surgery. We also identified malignancy, obesity, and congestive heart failure as statistically significant (P < .05) risk factors for VTE in OC and LC surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of data from a large clinical data set, the incidence of perioperative VTE is lower after LC than after OC surgery. These findings may help colorectal surgeons use appropriate VTE prophylaxis for patients undergoing colorectal procedures."
21690607,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21690607/,"BACKGROUND: Unemployment has been negatively associated with psychological well-being. This study examines the effect of multiple unemployment spells, specifically whether people become sensitised or adapt to unemployment if they are previously employed or economically inactive.
METHODS: Data come from waves 1-17 of the British Household Panel Survey. Psychological well-being was measured using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), and employment status was self-reported. Multilevel modelling was used to examine the effects of unemployment, overall and by previous employment status, on well-being.
RESULTS: Without consideration of prior employment status, psychological well-being was poorer at each unemployment spell. Previously employed persons had significantly higher GHQ-12 scores at the first and second unemployment spells but not at the third spell (p(trend)<0.0001). Previously economically inactive persons had poorer psychological well-being at all unemployment spells, with significantly higher scores at the third spell than those at the first two spells (p(trend)=0.0004). Thus, those employed prior to all unemployment spells adapted, while those previously economically inactive became more sensitised with additional unemployment spells. Pre-study unemployment and average annual household income moderated the effects of unemployment; effects varied by previous employment status and unemployment spell number.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that initially employed people who experience repeated unemployment cope better psychologically if they are able to regain employment in between unemployment spells. Those who make several attempts to re-enter the labour market following economic inactivity have a more difficult time, becoming more distressed with each try. This has implications for people affected by welfare to work policies."
21691767,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21691767/,"PURPOSE: To analyse the significance of risk factors and the possibility of prediction of shoulder dystocia.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study. There were 9,767 vaginal deliveries at 37 and more weeks of gestation analysed during 2005-2007. Studied population included 234 deliveries complicated by shoulder dystocia. Shoulder dystocia was defined as a delivery that required additional obstetric manoeuvres to release the shoulders after gentle downward traction has failed. First, a univariate analysis was done to identify the factors that had a significant association with shoulder dystocia. Parity, age, gestation, induction of labour, epidural analgesia, birth weight, duration of second stage of labour and mode of delivery were studied factors. All factors were then combined in a multivariate logistic regression analysis. Adjusted odds ratios (Adj. OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.
RESULTS: The incidence of shoulder dystocia was 2.4% (234/9,767). Only mode of delivery and birth weight were independent risk factors for shoulder dystocia. Parity, age, gestation, induction of labour, epidural analgesia and duration of second stage of labour were not independent risk factors. Ventouse delivery increases the risk of shoulder dystocia almost 3 times, forceps delivery comparing to the ventouse delivery increases risk almost 3.4 times. Risk of shoulder dystocia is minimal with the birth weight of 3,000 g or less.
CONCLUSION: It is difficult to foretell the exact birth weight and the mode of delivery, therefore occurrence of shoulder dystocia is highly unpredictable. Regular drills for shoulder dystocia and awareness of increased incidence with instrumental deliveries are important to reduce fetal and maternal morbidity and mortality."
21691879,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21691879/,"BACKGROUND: The goal of this study was to explore the necessity of extensive surgical procedures in patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC).
METHODS: We analyzed the surgical outcomes and frequency of extensive procedures required for maximal cytoreductive surgery after NAC and primary debulking surgery (PDS) in 256 women with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer.
RESULTS: NAC was performed in 116 of 256 women (45.3%). In NAC group, complete cytoreduction rate and optimal cytoreduction rate were 60.3 and 92.2%, respectively. Although the NAC group comprised patients with higher risk of suboptimal cytoreduction, complete cytoreduction rate was similar to that of PDS group (57.9%, P = .69). Moreover, blood loss and surgical complexity significantly reduced in NAC group (P = .011 and .017). Extensive upper abdominal surgery (EUAS) was performed in 70 of 116 patients (60.3%) in the NAC group. The frequency of EUAS was similar between NAC and PDS group (P = .60). Among NAC group, gross upper abdominal metastasis requiring EUAS was found in 51 patients (44%, 95% confidence interval = 35.3-53.1%).
CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of patients who received NAC still have gross metastatic tumors requiring EUAS. Gynecologic oncologists should be familiar with EUAS and be ready to perform any required procedures together with multidisciplinary teams, even in the patients who have received NAC."
21691910,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21691910/,"BACKGROUND: Locking plate fixation of proximal humeral fractures improves biomechanical stability. It has expanded the indications of traditional open reduction internal fixation and become increasingly common for treating unstable, displaced proximal humeral fractures. Despite improved stability it is unclear whether these improve function and if so for which patients.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We therefore determined patient function after a locked plating technique for the treatment of unstable proximal humeral fractures based on age, time, fracture pattern, and associated injures.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 66 patients with 69 proximal humeral fractures treated with a locked proximal humeral plating technique from 2002-2006 using prospectively gathered data. Function was measured using the Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment (SMFA), Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH), and SF-36 at 6, 12, and 24 months. Fracture healing was determined radiographically and complication rates were determined from the medical records.
RESULTS: At 2 years, DASH scores were 26.5 and 37.4 for isolated and polytrauma patients, respectively. For age differences, DASH scores were 33.1 and 28.9 for ages younger than 60 and 60 years old or older, respectively. At 2 years, SMFA scores were higher (worse) in older compared with younger patients. Function, but not bother continues to improve in younger patients up to 2 years. More severe fracture patterns performed worse in all SMFA indices at 2 years. Polytrauma patients consistently experienced worse mobility than isolated injury patients at each time interval.
CONCLUSIONS: With locked plating of unstable proximal humeral fractures, older patients function as well as younger patients; improvement continues until 1 year postoperatively, the Neer fracture classification differentiates function, and polytrauma patients perform worse clinically. Long-term functional deficits persist.

21691924,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21691924/,"BACKGROUND: Although standard of care after most abdominal surgeries, post-operative pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis after major hepatectomy is commonly withheld due to bleeding risks. The objective of this retrospective study is to evaluate the benefits and risks of post-operative pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis after major hepatectomy at two high volume academic centers.
METHODS: Demographics, clinicopathologic data, treatments, and post-operative outcomes from patients who underwent major hepatectomy were reviewed.
RESULTS: From 2005 to 2010, 419 patients underwent major hepatectomy; 275 (65.6%) were treated with pharmacologicthromboprophylaxis beginning a median of 1 day after resection. Post-operative symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) occurred in 15 (3.6%) patients. Patients treated with pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis had lower rates of symptomatic VTE (2.2% vs. 6.3%, p = 0.03) and post-operative red blood cell (RBC) transfusion (16.7% vs. 26.4%, p = 0.02) with similar rates of overall RBC transfusion (35.0% vs. 30.6%, p = 0.36) compared to untreated patients. Specifically, isolated deep venous thrombosis (0% vs. 2.1%, p = 0.04) and pulmonary embolism (2.2% vs. 4.2%, p = 0.35) occurred less often in treated patients. Analysis of demographics, clinicopathologic data, and treatment factors revealed that pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis was the only variable associated with post-operative VTE.
CONCLUSIONS: Post-operative pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis lowers the incidence of symptomatic VTE after major hepatectomy without increasing the rate of RBC transfusion."
21691997,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21691997/,"BACKGROUND: Spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) without evidence of a bleeding source on the first digital subtraction angiogram (DSA) - also called SAH of unknown origin - is observed in up to 27% of all cases. Depending on the bleeding pattern on CT scanning, SAH can be differentiated into perimesencephalic (PM-SAH) and non-perimesencephalic SAH (NON-PM-SAH). The aim of our study was to investigate the effectiveness of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for detecting a bleeding source in SAH of unknown origin.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 1,226 patients with spontaneous SAH between January 1991 and December 2008 in our department. DSA was performed in 1,068 patients, with negative results in 179 patients.
RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were categorized as having PM-SAH and 132 patients as having NON-PM-SAH. MRI of the brain and the craniocervical region was performed within 72 h after diagnosis of SAH and demonstrated no bleeding sources in any of the PM-SAH and NON-PM-SAH patients (100% negative).
CONCLUSIONS: In our experience MRI did not produce any additional benefit for detecting a bleeding source after SAH with a negative angiogram. The costs of this examination exceeded the clinical value. Despite our results MRI should be discussed on a case-by-case basis because rare bleeding sources are periodically diagnosed in cases of NON-PM-SAH."
21692019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21692019/,"OBJECTIVES: In this study, we aimed to define the efficacy of F-18 FDG PET/CT for the detection of mediastinal lymph node metastases by comparing the mediastinal findings of F-18 FDG PET/CT with the histopathological results obtained either by mediastinoscopy or thoracotomy in patients with clinically operable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a prospective, single-institution study of 68 consecutive patients with suspected or pathologically proven, localized, clinically resectable NSCLC (8 females and 60 males; mean age: 60.36 ± 1.01 years, range: 43-78 years). The patients underwent integrated PET/CT scanning at the same PET center. Standard cervical mediastinoscopy and extended mediastinoscopy were performed to sample the lymph nodes. During thoracotomy, complete mediastinal lymph node dissection was routinely performed.
RESULTS: Mediastinoscopy gave true positive results in 9 patients and true negative results in 57 patients. There were two false negative results. Mediastinoscopy had a sensitivity of 81.8% (95% CI: 63-82), a specificity of 100% (95% CI: 96-100), a PPV of 100% (95% CI: 77-100), a NPV of 96.6% (95% CI: 93-96), and an accuracy of 97% for the detection of mediastinal lymph node metastases. When PET/CT results were compared with postoperative pathological examination results, PET/CT correctly identified 48 out of 50 patients (96%) who did not have metastatic lymph node involvement. N2/N3 disease was correctly determined by PET/CT in 8 of 11 patients (72.7%) who had positive results on histological analysis. When only N2 and N3 nodal diseases were included in the calculation with the aim of making a comparison with mediastinoscopy (for mediastinal nodes), integrated PET/CT had a sensitivity of 72.7% (95% CI: 51-80), a specificity of 97.7% (95% CI: 92-99), a PPV of 88.9% (95% CI: 62-97), a NPV of 93.3% (95% CI: 88-95) and an accuracy of 92.6% (95% 83-95) for the detection of intrathoracic N2 and N3 nodal metastases.
CONCLUSION: Our data shows that due to its high sensitivity and accuracy, mediastinoscopy is still the most reliable method to evaluate mediastinal lymph nodes in patients with NSCLC."
21692046,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21692046/,"BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to elicit future patients' preferences for preoperative chemoradiation (pre-CRT) for rectal cancer to determine whether patients' preferences are consistent with current treatment guidelines.
METHODS: During a standardized interview, the treatment protocol, risks, benefits, and long-term outcomes associated with 1) surgery alone (SA) and 2) pre-CRT followed by surgery (CR + S) were described to healthy individuals, and a threshold task was performed. Each participant was asked which treatment option they would prefer when the risk of local recurrence was set initially at 15% for both options. If the participant indicated SA (which was expected), then the risk of local recurrence for CR + S was lowered systematically until the participant's preference changed from SA to CR + S. This threshold point represented the risk of local recurrence for pre-CRT that the participant would require before they would choose treatment with pre-CRT.
RESULTS: Fifty individuals participated in the study, and the majority were well educated. Twenty-seven of 50 participants (54%) required a risk of local recurrence with CR + S of ≤ 5% (ie, equivalent to an absolute risk reduction ≥ 10%) before they would choose treatment with pre-CRT. Regression analysis did not identify any variables that were predictive of the participants' preferences.
CONCLUSIONS: Participants seemed to highly value functional outcomes and seemed willing to accept a higher risk of local recurrence to achieve this. Therefore, developers of future guidelines may need to downgrade the use of pre-CRT for all patients with stage II/III tumors from a guideline to an option."
21692059,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21692059/,"BACKGROUND: The authors compared treatment adherence rates and outcome in Caucasian and African American patients with inflammatory breast cancer (IBC).
METHODS: The records of 55 (25 Caucasian and 30 African American) IBC patients treated with curative intent from 1995 to 2009 were reviewed. All patients received neoadjuvant doxorubicin (Adriamycin) and/or taxane-based chemotherapy, and mastectomy with or without radiotherapy. The median follow-up period for Caucasian and African American patients was similar (39.5 months and 36.1 months, respectively).
RESULTS: There was no difference between races in median age, tumor size, grade, and receptor status at diagnosis. The number of patients who completed neoadjuvant chemotherapy, surgery, and radiotherapy did not differ by race (84% of Caucasians vs 86.7% of African Americans) nor did the median length of time to complete trimodality treatment (263 [range, 207-422] days for Caucasians vs 262 [range, 165-371] days for African Americans). There was a trend toward slightly higher pathological complete response rates in Caucasian than African American women (20% in Caucasians vs 6.7% in African Americans, P = .23). Despite slightly better response rates to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, Caucasian patients did not have higher 3-year local control rates (70% in Caucasians vs 64% in African Americans, P = .73). However, there was a trend toward higher 3-year overall survival in Caucasian versus African American patients (73% in Caucasians vs 55% in African Americans, P = .09) and higher distant metastasis-free survival (60% in Caucasians vs 40% in African Americans, P = .19).
CONCLUSIONS: This study is among the largest to examine patients with IBC by race. Being Caucasian or African American did not appear to impact treatment adherence. However, African American patients tended to have poorer response to standard treatment and worse outcome than Caucasian patients."
21692066,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21692066/,"BACKGROUND: The authors previously identified racial/ethnic disparities in the use of radiation therapy (RT) in patients with advanced breast cancer (BC). They hypothesized that disparities in the use of RT were associated with survival differences favoring white patients.
METHODS: The authors used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database to identify white, black, Hispanic, and Asian patients with BC associated with ≥ 10 metastatic lymph nodes diagnosed between 1988 and 2005. Multivariate analyses of overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) assessed age, sex, race, tumor size, histology, estrogen receptor status, progesterone receptor status, RT, and type of surgery. The authors further stratified for use of RT and type of surgery. Risk of mortality was reported as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: Of 15,895 patients with advanced BC, 12,653 met entry criteria. On multivariate analysis, RT was associated with a decreased risk of all-cause (HR, 0.78; 95% CI 0.74-0.83; P < .001) and disease-specific (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.76-0.86; P < .001) mortality; black race was associated with an increased risk of all-cause (HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.42-1.68; P < .001) and disease-specific (HR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.39-1.68; P < .001) mortality. After stratifying by type of surgery and use of RT, blacks demonstrated poorer survival than their white counterparts, regardless of surgery type or receipt of RT.
CONCLUSIONS: Only black patients had poorer OS and DSS relative to whites. When stratified by type of surgery and use of RT, blacks continued to demonstrate poorer survival. This survival disparity is unlikely to be because of lack of RT."
21692259,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21692259/,"BACKGROUND: In addition to human resources in health care, hospitals are unavoidable factor in international deliberations of development level of health systems. Besides education of health workers, equipped devices and efficiency of work in hospitals, it is important to compare the number of hospitals, their size, type of hospitals, their distribution and availability to users. These elements are essential to the overall quality and efficiency of health work of an area.
AIM: To identify and analyze the hospital by the number, type and size, number and type of beds in them, and the disposition in relation to population and unit area (km2) in Croatia, County of Split-Dalmatia and other European countries in total and by groups of European countries by the gross national product per capita (GDP pc), in 2007. Based on the analysis, to answer the question whether Croatia has a sufficient number of hospitals, particularly in County of Split-Dalmatia and Dalmatia.
METHOD: In this article are used methods of descriptive epidemiology based on available electronic data of the WHO Office for Europe.
RESULTS: Of the 44 European countries, Croatia is in the 35th place with a total of 79 hospitals (1.7 hospitals/100,000 population; Europe 3.4/100,000). Without 10 hospital wards, and 6-of-hospital maternity, Croatian average is 1.4/100,000 which places Croatia in 41st place. By the number of acute hospitals with no out-patient clinic and maternity wards, Croatia is in the penultimate 43rd place with 36 hospitals (0.8/100,000; Europe 2.6/100,000). According to the average number of beds/100,000 population, Croatia is at the 23rd place (Europe: 489 beds/100,000 population; Croatia: 352 beds/100,000). By the size of the hospitals per average number of hospital beds per one acute hospital Croatia has no clinic and outpatient hospitals (446) which puts Croatia in the second place behind the Netherlands (541). According to the number of acute hospitals/1,000 km2 with no out-patient clinic and maternity wards, Croatia is at the 39th place (0.6/1,000 km2; European average without Russia: 2.3/1,000 km2). In Croatia, most hospitals/100,000 population has County of Pozega-Slavonia (3.5/100,000), while the least are in Split-Dalmatia County (0.4/100,000). The most acute hospitals are in County of Pozega-Slavonia (2.3/100,000), and the least in County of Split-Dalmatia (0.2/100,000) or 7 times less than the Croatian average, and 13 times less than the European average. By the number of acute hospitals with no out-patient clinic and maternity wards/1,000 km2 in Croatia, there are most hospitals together, in City of Zagreb and County of Zagreb (3/1000 km2), and the least in County of Lika-Senj and County of Split-Dalmatia (0.2/1,000 km2).
DISCUSSION: Croatia is getting behind by the number of hospitals, compared to Europe, especially concerning acute hospitals. Given the density and area unit in the Southern Croatia there is a striking lack of acute hospitals, causing a disparity in the availability of hospital and specialist health care. To make hospital and specialist health care available to the 170,000 inhabitants of Dalmatia, who are more than an hour away from the hospital, it is necessary to replace outpatient-clinics and maternity hospitals with the general hospitals.
CONCLUSION: Given the fact that Croatia is at the top of Europe by the size of the hospitals by the number of beds for acute patients, and there is the sufficient number of beds to population, but also a lack of spatial coverage of acute hospitals and therefore poor availability of hospital and specialist care for the advisory large population of south and east of the state and Istria. Croatia should achieve further necessary hospital facilities by planning and building small municipal/town/local hospitals for acute patients with the necessary agreed facilities at the headquarters of the former health centers where already exists specialist diagnostic and therapeutic activities of secondary level health care."
21692797,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21692797/,"BACKGROUND: Pheochromocytomas are tumours arising from chromaffin tissue located in the adrenal medulla associated with typical symptoms and signs which may occasionally develop metastases, which are defined as the presence of tumour cells at sites where these cells are not found. This retrospective analysis was focused on clinical, genetic and histopathologic characteristics of primary metastatic versus primary benign pheochromocytomas.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified 41 subjects with metastatic pheochromocytoma and 108 subjects with apparently benign pheochromocytoma. We assessed dimension and biochemical profile of the primary tumour, age at presentation and time to develop metastases.
RESULTS: Subjects with metastatic pheochromocytoma presented at a significantly younger age (41·4 ± 14·7 vs. 50·2 ± 13·7 years; P < 0·001) with larger primary tumours (8·38 ± 3·27 vs. 6·18 ± 2·75 cm; P < 0·001) and secreted more frequently norepinephrine (95·1% vs. 83·3%; P = 0·046) compared to subjects with apparently benign pheochromocytomas. No significant differences were found in the incidence of genetic mutations in both groups of subjects (25·7% in the metastatic group and 14·7% in the benign group; P = 0·13). From available histopathologic markers of potential malignancy, only necrosis occurred more frequently in subjects with metastatic pheochromocytoma (27·6% vs. 0%; P < 0·001). The median time to develop metastases was 3·6 years with the longest interval 24 years.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, regardless of a genetic background, the size of a primary pheochromocytoma and age of its first presentation are two independent risk factors associated with the development of metastatic disease."
21692870,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21692870/,"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine whether there was a difference between adult and paediatric alopecia areata patients with respect to the severity and pattern of the disease, nail changes and personal and family history of autoimmune diseases and also in comparison with controls.
METHODS: Two groups were included: patients with onset of alopecia before the age of ≤18 years and >18 years. The total number of the patients were 124. The control group was comprised of 114 age- and gender-matched patients.
RESULTS: There were 81 adults and 43 children. No statistically significant difference was present between disease severity and gender, age, personal and family history of autoimmune disease in the adult and paediatric group (P > 0.5). Thirteen adults with scalp involvement had nail changes. 61.5% had mild and 38.46% had severe disease (P > 0.5). Of the 43 paediatric patients, 10 patients had nail changes. Severe alopecia was present in 40% of patients with nail changes; however, 9.1% had severe alopecia in patients without nail changes (P = 0.04). There was no statistical significance in patients with and without familial autoimmune diseases when compared with pattern and severity of the diseases between the two groups.
CONCLUSION: The frequencies of autoimmune and atopic diseases were not different between adult and paediatric patients and the control group. We did not find a statistically significance between disease severity and personal and family history of autoimmune disease in the two groups. Disease severity was not related to nail changes in the adult group. However, severe alopecia areata was more prevalent in children with nail changes. Furthermore, ophiasis pattern was more prevalent in the paediatric group with nail changes compared with the adult group."
21693206,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21693206/,"BACKGROUND: Although stroke volume variation (SVV) is a valuable index of preload responsiveness, there is limited information about the association between low SVV and increased hepatectomy-related bleeding. We therefore evaluated whether SVV predicts blood loss during living donor hepatectomy.
METHODS: We evaluated 93 adult liver donors undergoing right hepatectomy for transplantation. Arterial blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, central venous pressure, SVV, cardiac output, and systemic vascular resistance were measured. Logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were performed to determine independent factors and optimal cutoff values of hemodynamic parameters for predicting intraoperative blood loss ≥ 700 mL.
RESULTS: Of these 93 donors, 36 (38.7%) had blood loss ≥ 700 mL. Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that factors associated with blood loss ≥ 700 mL included heart rate, SVV, cardiac output, and systemic vascular resistance. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that only SVV was an independent predictor of blood loss ≥ 700 mL. ROC curve analysis showed that the optimal cutoff value for SVV predicting blood loss ≥ 700 mL was 6% (area under the curve = 0.64).
CONCLUSIONS: SVV is a significant independent predictor of blood loss ≥ 700 mL during donor hepatectomy, suggesting that low SVV may provide useful information on intraoperative bleeding in donors undergoing right hepatectomy."
21693219,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21693219/,"BACKGROUND: Fructose 1,6-biphosphate (FBP) has been shown to exert therapeutic effects in models of ischemia-reperfusion in organs other than the liver. This study compared FBP and University of Wisconsin (UW) solution during cold storage and reperfusion, among mitochondria of adult male Wistar rat livers.
METHODS: Adult male Wistar rats were assigned to two groups according to the preservation solution used; UW or FBP Aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transferase (ALT); and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) were measured in samples of the storage solution obtained at 2, 4 and 6 hours of preservation. After 6 hours of cold storage, we reperfused the liver, taking blood samples to measure AST, ALT, LDH, and throbarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). Hepatic fragments were processed for histologic analysis; for determinations of TBARS, catalase, and nitric oxide as well as for mitochondrial evaluation by infrared spectroscopy.
RESULTS: During cold preservation, levels of AST and LDH in the storage solution were lower among the FBP group, but after reperfusion, serum levels of AST, ALT, and LDH were higher in this group, as was catalase activity. TBARS and nitric oxide were comparable between the groups. In the UW group there was a higher amide I/amide II ratio than in the FBP group, suggesting an abnormal protein structure of the mitochondrial membrane. No signs of preservation injury were observed in any liver biopsy, but sinusoidal congestion was present in livers preserved with FBP.
CONCLUSION: FBP showed a protective effect for preservation during cold storage seeming to protect the mitochondrial membrane although it did not prevent reperfusion injury."

In order to verify that these objectives are achieved, we compared our results of pelvic lymphadenectomy by laparotomy and by laparoscopy for the past 12 years.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1997 and June 2008, 36 (23.8%) patients underwent open pelvic lymphadenectomy and 76.16% (115 cases) laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy. We did a retrospective and comparative analysis of data including the preoperative characteristics, per- and postoperative complication as well pathologic results.
RESULTS: Preoperative data were comparable between both groups. The comparison of the peroperative data showed an increased bleeding volume in the open group (105.6±420.9mL; 12.1±96.1mL: P=0.001) and longer operative time in the laparoscopic group (103.7±83.9min; 132.8±40.9min: P=0.006). Postoperative complications were similar. Pathologic results showed a significantly more important number of lymph nodes removed in the open group (7.2±3.5; 5.7±3.2: P=0.022), but the positive rate similar in both groups (13.9%; 22.6%: P=0.258). In order to remove ""the learning curve effect"", we compared 36 open pelvic lymphadenectomy to the last 36 laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy. In the laparoscopic group the patients showed an upper Gleason score (6.3±1.1; 7±1: P=0.005); but there was no difference for the operative time, number of lymph nodes removed and the complications rates.
CONCLUSIONS: After training, laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy was similar to open pelvic lymphadenectomy."
21694567,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21694567/,"PURPOSE: To compare perceptions and perspectives of medical school deans and hospital chief executive officers (CEOs) regarding roles, responsibilities, and attributes of effective clinical department chairs.
METHOD: In 2009, the authors surveyed the deans of 126 U.S. medical schools and the CEOs of the primary teaching hospitals in the schools' academic health centers. All were queried on 34 items about clinical department chair performance in six categories (mission prioritization, leadership responsibilities, leadership values, skill sets, barriers to success, and competitive differentiators).
RESULTS: Eighty-four deans (67%) and 57 CEOs (45%) responded. Both groups ranked ensuring good patient care as the chair's primary responsibility; agreement between CEOs on that responsibility was much stronger than among deans (P < .01). CEOs placed greater emphasis on getting results (P < .01), whereas mentoring was a higher priority for deans (P < .01). CEOs identified the inability to work within budgeted resources as a barrier to chair success more than did deans (P < .01). CEOs reported that high-quality care and cutting-edge hospital technologies were keys to competitive distinction, whereas deans put more weight on clinical and translational research and educating future physicians. The majority of deans and CEOs rated the alignment and relationship between themselves and their counterpart as ""excellent"" or ""good.""
CONCLUSIONS: Deans and their ""partner"" hospital CEOs agreed on most of the attributes, skills, and responsibilities characterizing the successful clinical department chair. CEOs were biased toward patient care, clinical quality, and results, whereas deans placed more emphasis on research, education, and mentoring."
21694586,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21694586/,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between ""overscheduling"" and sports-related overuse and acute injuries in young athletes and to identify other potential contributing factors to create a working definition for ""overscheduling injury.""
DESIGN: Survey.
SETTING: Six university-based sports medicine clinics in North America.
PARTICIPANTS: Athletes aged 6 to 18 years (13.8 ± 2.6) and their parents and pediatric sports medicine-trained physicians.
INTERVENTIONS: Questionnaires developed from literature review and expert consensus to investigate overscheduling and sports-related injuries were completed over a 3-month period.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Physician's clinical diagnosis and injury categorization: acute not fatigue related (AI), overuse not fatigue related (OI), acute fatigue related (AFI), or overuse fatigue related (OFI).
RESULTS: Overall, 360 questionnaires were completed (84% response rate). Overuse not fatigue-related injuries were encountered most often (44.7%), compared with AI (41.9%) and OFI (9.7%). Number of practices within 48 hours before injury was higher (1.7 ± 1.5) for athletes with OI versus those with AI (1.3 ± 1.4; P = 0.025). Athlete or parent perception of excessive play/training without adequate rest in the days before the injury was related to overuse (P = 0.016) and fatigue-related injuries (P = 0.010). Fatigue-related injuries were related to sleeping ≤6 hours the night before the injury (P = 0.028).
CONCLUSIONS: When scheduling youth sporting events, potential activity volume and intensity over any 48-hour period, recovery time between all training and competition bouts, and potential between-day sleep time (≥ 7 hours) should be considered to optimize safety. An overscheduling injury can be defined as an injury related to excessive planned physical activity without adequate time for rest and recovery, including between training sessions/competitions and consecutive days."
21694589,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21694589/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine if prerace to postrace changes in superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and coeliac artery hemodynamics were related to the development of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms during a triathlon.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
SETTING: Field study at an international Ironman Triathlon.
PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-nine Ironman triathletes of whom 59% (n = 35) reported GI symptoms (GI group) during the race and 41% (n = 24) remained asymptomatic (CON group).
ASSESSMENT OF RISK FACTORS: Prerace questionnaire (personal details, racing and training history, personal general medical history, and medication) and splanchnic hemodynamics.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prerace and postrace measurements of splanchnic hemodynamics [artery diameter, systolic velocity, diastolic velocity, and resistive index (RI) of the SMA and coeliac artery] using duplex Doppler ultrasound.
RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in the diameter of the SMA after the race (P = 0.003) and a significant decrease in the RI of the SMA and coeliac artery (P < 0.001) in both the GI and CON groups, but there were no significant differences between the groups. The only significant risk factor for the development of GI symptoms was younger age (P = 0.041). Other risk factors, including high-intensity exercise, poorly trained athlete, and medication use, were not associated with the development of GI symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: The hypothesis that altered blood flow is related to the development of GI symptoms in endurance athletes is not supported by the results of this study. Other mechanisms for GI symptoms associated with endurance exercise should be investigated."
21695700,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21695700/,"BACKGROUND: Sentinel node biopsies (SNBs) have been clinically applied in melanoma and breast cancer for limited lymphadenectomy. However, the use of SNB remains controversial in gastric cancer due to unsatisfactory sensitivity and variability. This meta-analysis was performed to determine the sensitivity of SNB in gastric cancer and to identify factors that improve its sensitivity.
METHODS: Feasibility studies on SNB in gastric cancer were searched for from 2001 to 2009 in Pubmed, Cochrane, and Embase. Forty-six reports, which included 2,684 patients, were found. Estimated sensitivities, detection rates, and negative (NPV), and positive predictive values (PPV) were calculated using a random effects model. Inter-study heterogeneity, meta-regression, and subgroup analysis for sensitivity was performed.
RESULTS: The estimated sensitivity, detection rate, NPV, and PPV were 87.8%, 97.5%, 91.8%, and 38.0%, respectively, with significant inter-study heterogeneity (P < 0.0001). However, no significant contributor to heterogeneity was identified. By subgroup analysis, sensitivity was found to depend significantly on the number of SNs harvested.
CONCLUSIONS: SNB in gastric cancer is probably not clinically applicable for limited lymphadenectomy due its unsatisfactory sensitivity and heterogeneity between practicing surgeons. To improve sensitivity, more than four SNs should be harvested, and a tumor specific SNB method should be developed."
21696057,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21696057/,"BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of current therapies for humoral rejection and decreasing antibody production directed against human leukocyte antigens (HLA) remains controversial. Standard regimens are unable to abrogate alloantibody production long term, most likely due to a lack of a direct effect on inhibiting and depleting mature plasma cells. Bortezomib (BZ) may be more effective at removing long-lived plasma cells compared to standard regimens that modulate alloantibody production by different mechanisms.
METHODS: We report a kidney transplant recipient with several episodes of mixed antibody mediated and cellular rejection treated with numerous therapies including BZ. Monitoring included serial measurements of donor specific antibodies (DSA) by Luminex assay and repeated allograft biopsies.
RESULTS: One cycle of BZ was able to reverse humoral rejection and graft dysfunction. DSA levels to multiple donor HLA antigens which were not affected by previous therapies were reduced to undetectable levels post BZ. Abrogation of DSA was only transient. Despite continued stable renal function post-BZ, the patient had a reemergence of DSA, and evidence of humoral rejection detected by allograft biopsy.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the promise of BZ as a therapy for humoral rejection, current data on how it should be used and its efficacy long-term remains limited."
21696252,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21696252/,"BACKGROUND: Linezolid is frequently used in critically ill patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia. Its potent activity against Gram-positive microorganisms and its high tissue penetration may favour Gram-negative colonization and infection. The aim of our study was to evaluate the risk for Gram-negative infections in critically ill patients treated with linezolid or vancomycin.
METHODS: The cases of all patients admitted over an 18-month period to a hepatic intensive care unit for ≥ 1 week, and treated with linezolid or vancomycin, were retrospectively reviewed. The main clinical characteristics and infections due to Gram-negative bacteria in the month after starting linezolid or vancomycin were obtained.
RESULTS: Seventy-one patients treated with linezolid and 68 treated with vancomycin fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Co-morbidities were similar in both groups. Patients on linezolid treatment had a longer stay in the ICU (mean ± standard deviation 41 ± 38 days vs 18.4 ± 13 days), received this treatment later (14.3 ± 15.1 days vs 6.3 ± 6.5 days), had a higher mean serum creatinine concentration (1.71 ± 1.18 mg/dl vs 1.04 ± 1.04 mg/dl), more often required haemodiafiltration (29.6% vs 13.2%), and 30 day-mortality was higher (42.3% vs 20.6%) than in patients receiving vancomycin. More than 95% in both groups received a broad-spectrum beta-lactam in addition to linezolid or vancomycin. The rate of Gram-negative infection during the following month was 28.2% in the linezolid group and 26.5% in the vancomycin group (p > 0.5).
CONCLUSIONS: Linezolid was more frequently used in critically ill patients with longer ICU stay and renal failure. The rate of infection due to Gram-negative microorganisms was similar in patients who received linezolid or vancomycin."
21696335,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21696335/,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether parameters in fetal biophysical profile (BPP) testing exhibit a diurnal rhythm and to discuss the probable factors associated with these variables.
METHODS: Thirty healthy primigravid patients carrying pregnancies between 35 and 40 completed weeks were enrolled for the study. Fetal BPP testing was performed for each patient both in the early morning (08:00-10:00 am) and in the late evening (08:00-10:00 pm), and the scoring parameters were compared between morning and evening tests.
RESULTS: BPP scores in the evening were significantly higher than that in the morning (p < 0.05). Deepest vertical amniotic pocket measurements and fetal breathing absence in the morning mostly contributed to this variation (p < 0.001). Fetal movement counts were also significantly lower in the morning tests (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The parameters of BPP exhibit circadian variations in healthy fetuses, which may be associated with many factors such as fetomaternal hormones. It is essential for the clinician to be aware of these changes when interpreting the results, as interventions based on false-positive results may have deleterious effects on both the mother and her fetus."
21696567,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21696567/,"INTRODUCTION: The purpose of the study was to determine if multi-field inverse-planned intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) improves on the sparing of organs at risk (heart, lungs and contralateral breast) when compared with field-in-field forward-planned RT (FiF).
METHODS: The planning CT scans of 10 women with left-sided breast cancer previously treated with whole-breast RT on an inclined breast board with both arms supported above the head were retrieved. The whole breast planning target volume (PTV) was defined by clinical mark-up and contoured on all relevant CT slices as were the organs at risk. For each patient, three plans were generated using FiF, five- and nine-field inverse-planned IMRT, all to a total dose of 50 Gy to the whole breast. Mean and maximum doses to the organs at risk and the homogeneity index (HI) of the whole-breast PTV were compared.
RESULTS: The mean heart dose for the FiF plans was 2.63 Gy compared with 4.04 Gy for the five-field and 4.30 Gy for the nine-field IMRT plans, with no significant differences in the HI of the whole-breast PTV in all plans. The FiF plans resulted in a mean contralateral breast dose of 0.58 Gy compared with 0.70 and 2.08 Gy for the five- and nine-field IMRT plans, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: FiF resulted in a lower mean heart and contralateral breast dose with comparable HI of the whole-breast PTV in comparison with inverse-planned IMRT using five or nine fields."
21696724,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21696724/,"INTRODUCTION: Despite the lack of robust evidence, numerous different ""track and trigger"" warning systems have been implemented. These have only been validated in an emergency medical admissions setting. The Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) is the chosen track and trigger system used in the University Hospitals of Leicester trauma unit, but has not been validated in trauma patients. A considerable proportion of all trauma admissions are elderly patients with proximal femoral fractures and significant co-morbidities. Early recognition of physiological deterioration and prompt action could therefore be lifesaving in this patient group.
AIM: To identify whether the implementation of the MEWS system coupled with a critical care outreach service resulted in a reduction in mortality in a busy trauma unit.
METHOD: A retrospective study. The MEWS system was implemented in all trauma and orthopaedic wards at the Leicester Royal Infirmary in the summer of 2005. The numbers of emergency trauma inpatient admissions and deaths from January 2002 to December 2009 were obtained. The diagnosis, primary procedures and cause of death, if known, were noted. Comparisons were made pre- and post-MEWS. Student's t-test was used for statistical analysis.
RESULTS: 32,149 patients were admitted (55% male; 45% female). Overall there were 889 deaths (77% female; 33% male, P<0.0001). The in-hospital mortality rate for orthopaedic trauma patients was 2.8% throughout the 7-year study period. 61% of those who died were admitted with proximal femoral fractures. The modal age group with the highest mortality was 81-90 years. Overall, females had a considerably greater mortality rate than males. The mortality rate was lower post-MEWS in males (1.82-1.418%; P=0.214), females (4.871-3.364%; P=0.108) and all patients (3.215-2.294%; P=0.092), but this was not statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: The use of a track and trigger warning system has not led to a statistically significant reduction in mortality in trauma patients. In view of the apparent lack of clinical effectiveness of the MEWS/outreach partnership, the cost effectiveness of this initiative needs to be questioned. Possible reasons for these findings include: failure of the MEWS to be correctly applied, inadequate action once the threshold is triggered, or unsuitability of this tool for this patient population. A better system for identifying and treating elderly, medically unwell trauma patients with co-morbidities needs to be developed."
21696808,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21696808/,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether the use of silver-coated catheters increased the risk of developing urethral stricture disease after robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP). Recently, silver alloy-coated Foley catheters have been shown to decrease the risk of catheter-associated urinary tract infections. Other than the increased cost, no disadvantages to the use of these catheters have been reported.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We switched to routine use of the Bardex I.C. silver alloy-coated Foley catheters for all urologic procedures on November 1, 2008. After institutional review board approval, we retrospectively reviewed the records of all consecutive patients who had undergone RALP 12 months before and after the catheter change. The primary outcome was the rate of urethral strictures after RALP.
RESULTS: A total of 188 RALPs were performed during the 12 months before the catheter change. No patients who underwent RALP in the months before the catheter change had developed a new postoperative urethral stricture. In the 12 months after the change to the silver-coated catheters, 217 RALPs were performed. Six patients after RALP using silver-coated catheters developed new strictures, at a rate of 2.8% (P = .03).
CONCLUSIONS: Silver alloy-coated urinary catheters might increase the risk of developing urethral strictures after RALP compared with standard noncoated catheters. Additional evaluation by a large randomized prospective trial is warranted to elucidate the true risk of stricture formation."
21697178,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21697178/,"BACKGROUND: The MIC corresponding to daptomycin susceptibility for vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) is ≤ 4 mg/L. Based on the concentration-dependent killing properties of daptomycin, there may be concern about achieving adequate concentrations when the MIC approaches the upper end of the susceptible range (3-4 mg/L). Higher doses of daptomycin may be needed to treat VRE isolates with higher MICs.
METHODS: We conducted a single-centre retrospective chart review of adult cases with VRE bacteraemia who received daptomycin as initial therapy. The primary outcome was time to microbiological cure (TMC) between standard doses (≤ 6 mg/kg) and high doses (> 6 mg/kg) of daptomycin and whether TMC differed based on MICs. The secondary outcome evaluated the daptomycin MIC distribution and assessed whether recent exposure to vancomycin was associated with higher daptomycin MICs.
RESULTS: Forty-six cases were included in the primary analysis and 60.9% of patients were neutropenic. The two dose groups differed in the baseline characteristics of age, body mass index, blood culture source and catheter removal. Median TMC was 2 days for both dose groups. There was no significant difference in TMC between MIC subgroups of ≤ 2 mg/L versus >2 and ≤ 4 mg/L. For the secondary analysis 227 VRE isolates were evaluated and 62% had daptomycin MICs of 3-4 mg/L. Each daptomycin MIC group had a similar incidence of prior vancomycin exposure.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on this retrospective review we did not observe a difference in TMC based on daptomycin dose and MIC; however, there were various limitations to this study, and the study was not powered to detect a difference in TMC. Also, prior vancomycin exposure did not appear to influence daptomycin MICs. The frequency of daptomycin MICs of 3-4 mg/L reported in this study is higher than those reported in the literature."
21697267,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21697267/,"OBJECTIVE: To examine and compare doctors' and nurses' views and experiences regarding outcome measurement in palliative care, including patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs).
METHODS: A web-based survey developed through expert review and piloting was conducted in Europe and Africa with palliative care professionals working in clinical care, audit and research.
RESULTS: The overall participation rate was 42% (663/1592) and the overall completion rate was 59% (392/663). Of these respondents, 196 were doctors (51% male, mean 47 years) and 104 were nurses (84% female, mean 45 years). Doctors' most common reported reasons for not using tools were time constraints followed by lack of training. For nurses, it was lack of training followed by time constraints. Provision of information and guidance influenced willingness to use measures. For those that used tools, most reported favourable outcome measurement experiences. Both prioritized brief PROMs, and measures that included physical and psychological domains. For clinical purposes, the main advantage for doctors was assessment/screening, and clinical decision making for nurses. For research, doctors were most influenced by a measure's comparability with national/international literature followed by its validation in palliative care. For nurses, validation in palliative care was followed by tool access.
CONCLUSION: Overall these respondents shared similar views and experiences, and both were influenced by similar factors. Multidisciplinary outcome measurement education and training is feasible and required. Multidimensional and brief PROMs that include physical and psychological domains need to be prioritized, and access to freely available, validated and translated tools is needed to ensure cross-national comparisons and coordination of international research."
21698501,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21698501/,"BACKGROUND: In selected patients with incidental gallbladder carcinoma (GBCA) diagnosed after laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC), definitive resection is warranted. Port site excision has been advocated but remains controversial.
METHODS: Patients with GBCA were identified through institutional/departmental databases. The subset of patients with incidental tumors identified after LC and submitted to definitive surgical therapy were selected. Those subjected to port site resection were compared with patients who underwent resection without port site removal and analyzed for differences in recurrence patterns and survival.
RESULTS: From 1992 to 2009, 113 patients with incidental GBCA presented for definitive resection after LC; 69 patients had port site resection and 44 did not. In the resected port site group, depth of tumor invasion was T1b = 6, T2 = 35, T3 = 28, and 13 (19%) had port site metastases. Port site disease was seen only in patients with T2 or T3 tumors and correlated with the development of peritoneal metastases (P = 0.01). Median survival of patients with T2/T3 tumors without port site metastases was 42 months compared to 17 months in patients with port site disease (P = 0.005). When only R0 resected patients were compared and adjusted for T and N stage, port site resection was not associated with overall survival (P = 0.23) or recurrence-free survival (P = 0.69).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with incidental GBCA, port site metastases were associated with peritoneal disease and decreased survival. Port site resection was not associated with improved survival or disease recurrence and should not be considered mandatory during definitive surgical treatment."
21699603,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21699603/,"BACKGROUND: Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) microscopy on a 7.0T system demonstrated the corticomedullary junction (CMJ) to be a high-susceptibility region (HSR) in young normal subjects, suggesting that functional alteration of cortical microcirculation could be assessed with this imaging method.
METHODS: Focused microscopic studies were performed on the parietal association cortex in 74 normal volunteers (ages 20-79 years; 35 female, 39 male) using a SWI algorithm on a system constructed based on General Electric Signa LX (Waukesha, WI, USA), equipped with a 900-mm clear bore superconducting magnet operating at 7.0T.
RESULTS: There was a clear-cut reduction in the thickness of the normal-appearing cortex (cortex, R2 = .5290, P < .001) and expansion of CMJ-HSR (R(2) = .6919, P < .001). The sum of cortex thickness and CMJ-HSR thickness was essentially constant, suggesting that the observed expansion of CMR-HSR with aging likely occurred within the cortical mantle.
CONCLUSION: CMJ-HSR expands significantly as a function of aging. Since CMJ-HSR represents a functionally distinct area with relatively slow venous flow, the observed expansion is believed to reflect alteration in cerebral microcirculation with increased age, providing another clue for pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease."
21700150,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21700150/,"PURPOSE: This study describes the perspectives of parents and adolescents regarding clinical need for and attitudes toward care for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In addition, it explores as to how these views relate to past year usage of mental health services.
METHODS: Parents and adolescents were interviewed 6 years after the school district was screened for ADHD. Using standardized measures, mental health service usage, adolescent and parent perceived clinical needs (ADHD symptoms, disruptive behavior disorders, anxiety and/or depression, functioning), and enabling attitudes (treatment receptivity, ADHD stigma), as well as parent factors (caregiver strain, distress, instrumental social support) were assessed. Nested logistic regression modeling was used to determine the hierarchical contribution of parent and adolescent perspectives on past year service usage, after adjusting for previous usage of mental health services. Stepwise regression was conducted to identify the variables that were most predictive of service usage.
RESULTS: Among the adolescents who were at a high risk for ADHD, 79% had a history of lifetime mental health service usage, but only 42% had received any kind of mental health services in the past year. In hierarchical modeling, only parent inattention ratings and medication receptivity and adolescent ADHD stigma perceptions contributed significantly toward improved model fit. Stepwise regression confirmed these three variables to be predictors (OR: 1.2, 3.8, and .2, respectively) and identified adolescents-reported functioning as an additional predictor of service usage (OR: 1.1).
CONCLUSION: Perceptions of adolescents regarding the stigma related to ADHD are influential in treatment receipt. Quality improvement interventions for adolescents with ADHD should include psychoeducational interventions for adolescents and their parents that target medication receptivity and the stigma related to ADHD."
21700374,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21700374/,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Drug-eluting stents are useful for preventing restenosis, but the patho-physiological processes involved in the proliferative response after implantation are still not known in detail. The aim of this study is to compare the coronary vascular histomorphometry after implanting drug-eluting stents and bare metal stents in a swine model.
METHODS: Sixty stents were randomly implanted in 20 Large White female pigs with a ratio of baremetal/drug-eluting stents of 1:2. After 28 days, euthanasia and histomorphometry were performed. We defined the vessel injury score in accordance to whether the internal elastic lamina was intact or ruptured.
RESULTS: There were no differences between drug-eluting stents and bare metal stents in the intact internal elastic lamina group regarding neointimal area or % restenosis (1.3 [1.1-2.2]) vs 2.0 [1.3-2.5] mm²; P=.6; and 14.0 [12.1-20.8] vs 22.2 [14.1-23.3] %; P=.5). We assessed statistically significant differences for the ruptured internal elastic lamina group, (neointimal area 1.2 [0.8-2.0] vs 2.9 [2.3-3.7] mm²; P=.001 and % restenosis 16.63 [11.2-23.5] vs 30.4 [26.4-45.7] %; P=.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In our swine model, we did not find any differences between proliferative response of drug-eluting stents and bare metal stents when the internal elastic lamina is intact; differences are only found when vascular injury is deeper."
21700456,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21700456/,"PURPOSE: The objective of the present study was to determine whether progesterone receptor (PgR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status differs by menopausal status in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancers.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinicopathological data of 588 with operable ER(+) breast cancers patients. ER, HER2 and PgR expression in the tumor specimens were examined by immunohistochemistry. The relationship between different variables was assessed by Pearson's χ(2) and Fisher's exact probability tests in univariate analyses. Logistic regression was used for multivariate analyses of relationship between HER2 expression and selected clinicopathological characteristics. Maximum likelihood estimates of the odds ratio (OR) were obtained and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.
RESULTS: In the postmenopausal women with ER(+) tumors, HER2 was independently inversely associated with PgR expression (P = 0.017; OR 3.02; 95% CI 1.22-7.49). An ER(+)/PgR(-) tumor was 3.02 times more likely to express HER2 than an ER(+)/PgR(+) tumor in the postmenopausal women. However, an ER(+) tumor in the premenopausal patients failed to show an independent relationship between HER2 and PgR.
CONCLUSION: Menopausal status played a very important role in determining HER2 and PgR status in ER(+) breast cancer patients. HER2 was independently inversely associated with PgR only in the postmenopausal women with ER(+) breast cancers but not in the premenopausal ones."
21700757,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21700757/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the value of echocardiography in predicting response to cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT).
METHODS: This is a prospective randomised study that recruited patients with (group 1) and without (group 2) echocardiographic evidence of mechanical dyssynchrony. 73 heart failure patients (NYHA III-IV) with a requirement for an implantable cardioverter defibrillator, QRS ≥120 ms and LV ejection fraction (EF) <35% were studied. Group 1 patients received CRT-D (26 patients). Group 2 patients were randomised to CRT-D (group 2a: 23 patients) or implantable cardioverter defibrillator (group 2b: 21 patients).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: were peak oxygen consumption (VO(2)max), NYHA class, and echocardiography at baseline and at 6 months.
RESULTS: 62% of group 1 patients achieved ≥1 ml/kg/min increase in VO(2)max at 6 months versus 50% in group 2a and 21% in group 2b (p=0.04). Group 1 patients showed significant improvements in VO(2)max (15.8±2 to 18.0±4 ml/kg/min, p=0.01), NYHA class (3.1±0.3 to 1.9±0.7, p<0.001) and EF (22±7% to 26±9%, p=0.02). Group 2a showed significant improvement in NYHA class (3.1±0.3 to 2.2±0.7, p<0.001) but no change in EF or VO(2)max. Group 2b showed no change in NYHA class or EF with a decline in VO(2)max (16.4±4 to 14.1±4, p=0.03). A significantly higher proportion of patients in group 2b showed ≥1 ml/kg/min deterioration in VO(2)max compared to group 2a (68% vs 23%, HR for group 2b: 2.4, 95% CI 1.2 to 4.8, p=0.005).
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of echocardiographic dyssynchrony identifies patients who derive the most improvement from CRT. Patients without dyssynchrony also show more benefit and less deterioration with CRT than without and should not be denied CRT."
21700820,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21700820/,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Although low socioeconomic status has been considered a contraindication to peritoneal dialysis (PD), no published data clearly link it to poor outcomes. The goal of this study was assessing the effect of income on survival in the Brazilian Peritoneal Dialysis Multicenter STUDY.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Incident PD patients enrolled in this prospective cohort from December 2004 to October 2007 were divided according to monthly family income. The median age was 59 years, 54% were women, 60% Caucasians, 41% diabetics, and 24% had cardiovascular disease. Most of them were in continuous ambulatory PD, had not received predialysis care, had <4 school years, and had a family income of <5 minimum wage (80%). Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and the Cox proportional hazards model adjusting the results for age, gender, educational status, predialysis care, first therapy, PD modality, calendar year, and comorbidities.
RESULTS: There were no differences in technique (log rank test χ² = 4.36) and patient (log rank test χ² = 2.92) survival between the groups. In the multivariate analysis, low family income remained not associated either to worse technique survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.29; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.91 to 1.84) or to patient survival (HR = 1.40; 95% CI = 0.99 to 1.99).
CONCLUSIONS: According to these results, economic status is not independently associated with outcomes in this large cohort and should not be considered a barrier for PD indication."
21700921,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21700921/,"OBJECTIVE: The A1C-Derived Average Glucose (ADAG) study demonstrated a linear relationship between HbA(1c) and mean plasma glucose (MPG). As glucose variability (GV) may contribute to glycation, we examined the association of several glucose variability indices and the MPG-HbA(1c) relationship.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Analyses included 268 patients with type 1 diabetes and 159 with type 2 diabetes. MPG during 3 months was calculated from 7-point self-monitored plasma glucose and continuous glucose monitoring. We calculated three different measures of GV and used a multiple-step regression model to determine the contribution of the respective GV measures to the MPG-HbA(1c) relationship.
RESULTS: GV, as reflected by SD and continuous overlapping net glycemic action, had a significant effect on the MPG-HbA(1c) relationship in type 1 diabetic patients so that high GV led to a higher HbA(1c) level for the same MPG. In type 1 diabetes, the impact of confounding and effect modification of a low versus high SD at an MPG level of 160 mg/dL on the HbA(1c) level is 7.02 vs. 7.43 and 6.96 vs. 7.41. All GV measures showed the same tendency.
CONCLUSIONS: In only type 1 diabetic patients, GV shows a significant interaction with MPG in the association with HbA(1c). This effect is more pronounced at higher HbA(1c) levels. However, the impact of GV on the HbA(1c) level in type 1 diabetes is modest, particularly when HbA(1c) is close to the treatment target of 7%."
21700937,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21700937/,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Atrial fibrillation is the most important risk factor for cardioembolic stroke. Thrombi form in the left atrial appendage rather than in the right. The causes of this different thrombogenicity are not well-understood. The goal herein was to compare the activation of the anticoagulant protein C and the thrombomodulin and endothelial protein C receptor/activated protein C receptor expression on the endocardium between right and left atria.
METHODS: We harvested the atria of 6 monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) and quantified their ability to activate protein C ex vivo and we measured the thrombomodulin and endothelial protein C receptor expression by immunofluorescence.
RESULTS: We found the ability to activate protein C decreased by half (P=0.028) and there was lower expression of thrombomodulin in the left atrial endocardium than the right (52.5±19.9 and 72.1±18.8 arbitrary intensity units, mean±standard deviation; P=0.028). No differences were detected in endothelial protein C receptor expression.
CONCLUSIONS: Impaired protein C activation on the left atrial endocardium attributable to low thrombomodulin expression may explain its higher thrombogenicity and play a role in cardioembolic stroke."
21700979,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21700979/,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to evaluate the prevalence and site of fractures detected on skeletal surveys performed for suspected child abuse at a tertiary children's hospital and to determine whether any survey images may be eliminated without affecting clinical care or the ability to make a diagnosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified all skeletal surveys performed for suspected abuse from 2003 to 2009 of children younger than 2 years. Repeated studies were excluded, as were studies not performed to evaluate for suspected abuse. From the reports, we documented the sites of all the fractures. RESULTS. Nine hundred thirty children (515 boys and 415 girls) with a median age of 6 months met the entry criteria for the study. Fractures were detected in 317 children (34%), of whom 166 (18%) had multiple fractures. The most common sites for fractures were the long bones (21%), ribs (10%), skull (7%), and clavicle (2%). Ten children (1%) had fractures in the spine (n = 3), pelvis (n = 1), hands (n = 6), and feet (n = 2). All 10 children had other signs of physical abuse.
CONCLUSION: In skeletal surveys performed for suspected child abuse, fractures limited to sites other than the long bones, ribs, skull, and clavicles are rare. The additional radiation exposure and cost of obtaining radiographs of the spine, pelvis, hands, and feet may outweigh their potential benefit. Given the rarity of fractures of the spine, pelvis, hands, and feet, consideration may be given to eliminating those views from routine skeletal surveys performed to evaluate for suspected child abuse."
21701019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21701019/,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this prospective study was to determine the incidence and clinical significance of pneumothoraces detected on routine radiography after chest tube removal following cardiac surgery and correlate those findings with an immediate postprocedure assessment of the likelihood of new pneumothorax.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Routine portable chest radiographs obtained after chest tube removal in 400 consecutive cardiac surgery patients were assessed by a radiologist to determine the incidence and grade of pneumothoraces and were correlated with the clinical estimation of the likelihood of this complication, and whether the radiographic finding changed medical management or led to surgical intervention.
RESULTS: Of 9.3% of cases (37/400) of new pneumothoraces after chest tube removal, 70.3% were tiny (barely perceptible), 27.0% were small (< 1 cm from the pleural line to the apex of the hemithorax), and 2.7% were medium (6-10 cm from the pleural line to the apex of the hemithorax). The incidences of small and medium pneumothoraces were substantially greater in patients with higher levels of clinical suspicion. All tiny pneumothoraces had no clinical importance. Not obtaining routine chest radiographs after chest tube removal in the 345 patients (86.3%) with the lowest level of clinical suspicion would have resulted in missing six small pneumothoraces (1.7%), none of which led to medical or surgical intervention or a delay in discharge.
CONCLUSION: Chest radiography performed after chest tube removal following cardiac surgery is necessary only if the patient has respiratory or hemodynamic changes or if there are problems with the technical aspect of chest tube removal. Following this guideline in our patient population could have eliminated 86.3% of radiographs without missing any clinically significant pneumothoraces."
21701238,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21701238/,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the metabolic cardiovascular risk factors of obese patients after weight loss and 4-year weight loss maintenance afterwards against a matched control group of subjects with a stable body weight and without history of weight loss.
METHOD: 50 obese non-diabetic subjects in the study group who previously lost 10% or more of their weight and afterwards entered a 4-year weight loss maintenance programme were matched by age, BMI and sex and compared to 50 weight-stable subjects without history of weight loss. The comparison between both groups was done in term of anthropometrical, metabolic and biological characteristics, early atherosclerosis and insulin sensitivity.
RESULTS: Anthropometrical, metabolic and biological characteristics were similar between the weight loss group and the control matched group. However, insulin sensitivity was still significantly lower in the weight loss than in the matched control group (p = 0.02). Intima media thickness (IMT) also was similar in both groups. We found that lower atherosclerosis measured by IMT at the level of the carotid is associated with better insulin sensitivity (p < 0.05). After the 4-year weight loss maintenance programme, insulin sensitivity improved in the post-weight loss group from 7.9 ± 3.2 to 8.4 ± 3.6 mg/kg/min.
CONCLUSION: All cardiometabolic parameters of obese subjects, except for insulin sensitivity, normalised completely after weight loss. The latter was improved by a weight loss maintenance programme if successfully completed."
21701391,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21701391/,"INTRODUCTION: Incidence of oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC) is increasing rapidly. OAC arises in columnar-lined oesophagus (CLO), a metaplastic change affecting some patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). As yet there is no reliable method of identifying those at highest risk. Our earlier observation of an association between OAC and blood group O Rhesus negative, if confirmed, may help identify those at greatest risk.
AIM AND METHODS: To assess the distribution of blood group and Rhesus D (RhD) factor in patients with GORD compared with the blood donating general population. GORD was categorized as nonerosive reflux (NER), erosive oesophagitis, CLO and OAC. The Rotherham Hospital database holds details of all GORD, CLO and OAC patients seen in the Gastroenterology Unit. Blood group information for patients with GORD was obtained from patients' records and the hospital's blood transfusion service. The blood group distribution in the general population was obtained from the National Blood Transfusion Service. The number of expected to observed patients in each blood group for each subtype was compared.
RESULTS: Two thousand six hundred and ten NER, 2813 erosive oesophagitis, 568 CLO and 73 OAC patients had a recorded blood group. For RhD positive patients observed proportions in each blood group were similar to expected. The most striking difference was the marked excess of OAC in blood group O, Rhesus negative (P=0.002).
CONCLUSION: CLO patients with blood group O, RhD negative carry a disproportionately higher risk of developing OAC. The mechanism is unknown but the finding has practical application in guiding risk stratification and intensity of surveillance."
21701872,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21701872/,"BACKGROUND: Coronary bifurcations remain a challenging lesion subset for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). It is unclear whether intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) guidance can improve PCI results in bifurcations. We aimed to compare IVUS-guided PCI versus standard PCI in a large registry of patients undergoing PCI for bifurcations in the drug-eluting stent era.
METHODS: A multicenter, retrospective study was conducted enrolling consecutive patients undergoing bifurcation PCI between January 2002 and December 2006 at 22 centers. The primary end-point was the long term rate of major adverse cardiac events [MACE, i.e. death, myocardial infarction or target lesion revascularization (TLR)].
RESULTS: A total of 4,314 patients were included, 226 (5.2%) undergoing IVUS-guided PCI, and 4,088 (94.8%) standard PCI. Early (30-day) outcomes were similar in the two groups, with MACE in 1.3 versus 2.1%, respectively, death in 0.9 versus 1.0%, and stent thrombosis in 0 versus 0.6% (all p > 0.05). After 24 ± 15 months, unadjusted rates of MACE were 17.7 versus 16.4%, with death in 2.7 versus 4.9%, myocardial infarction in 4.4 versus 3.7%, TLR in 15.0 versus 12.3%, and stent thrombosis in 3.1 versus 2.7% (all p > 0.05). Even at multivariable Cox proportional hazard analysis with propensity score adjustment, IVUS was not associated with any statistically significant impact on the risk of MACE, death, myocardial infarction, TLR (neither on the main branch nor on the side branch), or stent thrombosis (all p > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite a sound rationale to choose stent size, optimize stent expansion and guide kissing inflation, IVUS usage during PCI for coronary bifurcation lesions was not associated with significant clinical benefits in this large retrospective study."
21702069,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21702069/,"PURPOSE: Causality assessment of cases with herbal hepatotoxicity represents a major regulatory challenge and included, in the past, the application of a diagnostic algorithm consisting of causality evaluation methods with either liver-specific or liver-unspecific characteristics. To evaluate various causality assessing methods in cases with suspected herbal hepatotoxicity, two different scales were now used for reasons of comparison.
METHODS: We used the liver-specific scale of the updated Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) as well as the Naranjo scale that is not organ specific and therefore not liver specific. Both scales were applied to 22 cases of spontaneous reports with initially assumed herbal hepatotoxicity caused by black cohosh, used for menopausal symptoms.
RESULTS: The analysis shows that causality was either unlikely (n = 6) or excluded (n = 16), using the updated CIOMS scale. There were various confounding variables: pre-existing liver diseases (n = 6) including genuine autoimmune hepatitis or alcoholic or cardiac hepatopathy; hepatotoxicity induced by interferon or fluoxetine (n = 2); marginally increased serum activities of alanine aminotransferase (n = 2) or gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (n = 2) of unassessable causality; a mixed group consisting of unassessable cases (n = 6) and cases with questionable, poorly documented hepato-biliary diseases (n = 3); and rosuvastin-induced rhabdomyolysis (n = 1). These confounding factors were not recognized by the Naranjo scale.
CONCLUSIONS: Structured hepatotoxicity-specific causality assessment methods such as the updated CIOMS scale are the preferred tools for causality assessment of assumed herbal hepatotoxicity and should replace the liver-unspecific Naranjo scale. Applying the updated CIOMS scale to cases with initially assumed hepatotoxicity by BC, causality was now found either unlikely or excluded."

Patients were: 59.75 years old, 68.6% male and 66.7% were of East Indian extraction The average time to thrombolysis was 5 hours and 31 minutes from the onset of chest pain. The average door to thrombolysis time was 2 hours and 7 minutes with 20% of patients having a door to thrombolysis time of 30 minutes. The time to thrombolysis from the onset of chest pain and the door to thrombolysis times were adversely affected by the health facility to which the patient first presented
CONCLUSION: The majority of patients presented within the thrombolysis window. Early recognition of symptoms of myocardial infarction and arrival at a healthcare facility is not being achieved by the majority of patients. The systems that are responsible for the transport, triage and treatment of patients who present with chest pain are inadequate and require urgent review and overhaul to achieve the goals outlined by the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiologist."
21702253,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21702253/,"BACKGROUND: Not all patients with histologically mild chronic Hepatitis C progress to cirrhosis. Many patients being treated on the basis of raised ALT and positive PCR alone may not be actually requiring it.
METHODS: All adult patients suffering from chronic Hepatitis C, qualifying for combination interferon ribavirin therapy, under went liver biopsies. Tissue samples were sent to Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) Rawalpindi for histopathology. Reporting was done according to modified Ishaq score.
RESULTS: Total number of patients was 147. Out of these, 75 (51%) were female and 72 (49%) were male. Mean age of females and males were 35.1 +/- 8.12 and 36.31 +/- 8.56 year respectively. Out of these, 19 (12.9%) were stage zero, 61 (41.5%) at stage 1, and 31 (21.1%) at stage 2 of modified fibrotic Ishaq score. In all, 111 (75.5%) of the patients were < or = 2 of modified Ishaq fibrotic score in either sex or 80 (54.4%) < or = 1 of modified Ishaq fibrotic stage. The necroinflammatory score has been divided into minimal (0-3), mild (4-8), moderate (9-13), and severe (14-18). About the same number of our patients (74%) had minimal to mild inflammation.
CONCLUSION: Since the majority of the patients have fibrotic score less than 3, so it will be cost effective to individualise their treatment on liver histpathology. Patients with low fibrotic score and minimal to mild inflammation may not be treated, but only monitored with serial ALT and liver biopsy every 4-5 years. Treatment may be started if there is increase in fibrosis on surveillance biopsy. However, there is a need to conduct prospective studies in similar group of patients to evaluate the natural course of disease in untreated patients."
21702870,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21702870/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the differences in the quality of treatment for presumptive malaria received by different socio-economic status (SES) groups in Nigeria.
METHODS: The study was conducted in southeast Nigeria. A household survey was used to collect data on patterns of use of different providers for treatment of adult and childhood malaria. The quality of services provided by different provider types was assessed using treatment vignettes. Quality scores for the different providers were computed based on their responses to the different points raised in the vignettes. Patterns of household treatment seeking for fever were disaggregated by SES, and then weighted by quality score to indicate the overall quality-weighted utilization by SES and the average quality of a visit by a member of each SES group. Equity ratios (poorest/least poor) provided the measure of inequity in quality-weighted utilization of different providers.
RESULTS: In treatment of adult malaria, higher SES groups used more of public and private hospitals, while lower SES groups used more of traditional healers. In case of children, higher SES used more of healthcare centres and private hospitals and lower SES groups used more of pharmacy shops. The lowest quality of services was measured among laboratories, patent medicine dealers (PMDs), mixed goods shops and pharmacies, all of which are private. The highest scores were observed among the two types of public providers (public hospital and healthcare centres). The quality of treatment services utilised by consumers decreased as SES decreased. However, when the quantity normalized index was used this SES disparity almost disappeared. The resulting equity ratio was 0.96 for adults and 0.94 for children.
CONCLUSION: Everybody used poor quality malaria treatment services but the poor people used providers with poor quality malaria treatment services more than others. The major driver of disparities in use of different providers by different SES was the greater number of visits of the higher SES groups, rather than the higher quality of the providers they used. Interventions should be developed to improve quality of treatment seeking behaviour and provision practices."

METHODS: In February 2009, a pupal productivity survey was conducted in 2 districts of the city of Goiania, central Brazil. The results were compared to those of LIRAas conducted in the same districts during the months before and after the pupal productivity survey.
RESULTS: In the pupal productivity survey, 2,024 houses were surveyed and 2,969 water-holding containers were inspected. Discarded small water containers most frequently contained immature Ae. aegypti. The most pupal-productive containers were elevated water tanks, roof gutters and water holding roofs. Combined, these three containers accounted for <40% of all positive containers but produced >70% of all pupae. In the two districts where the pupal productivity survey was conducted, the house indices were 5.1 and 4.6 and the Breteau indices were 5.9 and 6.0. In contrast, the two LIRAs conducted in the same two districts resulted in an average house index of 1.5 and Breteau index of 2.5, with discarded items identified as the most frequently infested container type.
CONCLUSION: Both the LIRAa and the pupal productivity survey identified discarded items as being most frequently infested with immature stages of Ae. aegypti, but the pupal productivity survey showed that elevated containers produced the greatest proportion of Ae. aegypti pupae (a proxy measure of adult vector density) and that the values of the Stegomyia indices were substantially underestimated by LIRAa. Although both surveys differ considerably in terms of sampling method and manpower, in the case of this study the LIRAa did not accurately identify or target the containers that were the most important to adult mosquito production."
21702894,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21702894/,"BACKGROUND: Genome wide association studies reported two single nucleotide polymorphisms in ANK3 (rs9804190 and rs10994336) as independent genetic risk factors for bipolar disorder. Another SNP in ANK3 (rs10761482) was associated with schizophrenia in a large European sample. Within the debate on common susceptibility genes for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, we tried to investigate common findings by analyzing association of ANK3 with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and unipolar depression.
METHODS: We genotyped three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ANK3 (rs9804190, rs10994336, and rs10761482) in a case-control sample of German descent including 920 patients with schizophrenia, 400 with bipolar affective disorder, 220 patients with unipolar depression according to ICD 10 and 480 healthy controls. Sample was further differentiated according to Leonhard's classification featuring disease entities with specific combination of bipolar and psychotic syndromes.
RESULTS: We found no association of rs9804190 and rs10994336 with bipolar disorder, unipolar depression or schizophrenia. In contrast to previous findings rs10761482 was associated with bipolar disorder (p = 0.015) but not with schizophrenia or unipolar depression. We observed no association with disease entities according to Leonhard's classification.
CONCLUSION: Our results support a specific genetic contribution of ANK3 to bipolar disorder though we failed to replicate findings for schizophrenia. We cannot confirm ANK3 as a common risk factor for different diseases."
21702905,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21702905/,"BACKGROUND: Troponins (highly sensitive biomarkers of myocardial damage) increase counts of myocardial infarction (MI) in clinical practice, but their impact on trends in admission rates for MI in National statistics is uncertain.
METHODS: Cases coded as MI or other cardiac diagnoses in the Hospital Morbidity Data Collection (MI-HMDC) in Western Australia in 1998 and 2003 were classified using revised criteria for MI developed by an International panel convened by the American Heart Association (AHA criteria) using information on symptoms, ECGs and cardiac biomarkers abstracted from samples of medical notes. Age-sex standardized rates of MI-HMDC were compared with rates of MI based on AHA criteria including troponins (MI-AHA) or traditional biomarkers only (MI-AHAck).
RESULTS: Between 1998 and 2003, rates of MI-HMDC decreased by 3.5% whereas rates of MI-AHA increased by 17%, a difference largely due to increased false-negative cases in the HMDC associated with marked increased use of troponin tests in cardiac admissions generally, and progressively lower test thresholds. In contrast, rates of MI-AHAck declined by 18%.
CONCLUSIONS: Increasing misclassification of MI-AHA by the HMDC may be due to reluctance by clinicians to diagnose MI based on relatively small increases in troponin levels. These influences are likely to continue. Monitoring MI using AHA criteria will require calibration of commercially available troponin tests and agreement on lower diagnostic thresholds for epidemiological studies. Declining rates of MI-AHA ck are consistent with long-standing trends in MI in Western Australia, suggesting that neither MI-HMDC nor MI-AHA reflect the true underlying population trends in MI."
21703109,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21703109/,"BACKGROUND: Emergency medical admissions to UK hospitals have been increasing steadily over the past few decades and there are likely to be a proportion of these admissions that are avoidable. This evaluation aims to demonstrate whether a general practitioner support unit (GPSU) reduces general practitioner (GP) referred emergency medical admissions to an acute hospital.
METHODS: The GPSU comprises a team of GPs based in the hospital with the purpose of providing alternatives to admission for medical referrals from community GPs. This is an observational study of patients referred and admitted to the Medical Admissions Unit (MAU) of an acute hospital over two six-month periods, in 2007 prior to and in 2008 after the introduction of the GPSU.
RESULTS: The number of GP referrals to the MAU per day decreased by 1.55 (confidence interval -2.45 to -0.51) patients with the GPSU in place. The number admitted to the hospital per day from MAU decreased by a mean of 0.48 patients but with confidence intervals that included the null hypothesis (-1.39 to 0.44). In comparison, non-GP admissions that were not targeted by the GPSU increased by 3.99 per day (2.64 to 5.33).
CONCLUSION: An acute GP led service run from within the hospital to provide support to community GPs led to a modest reduction in the number of GP admissions to the MAU, but did not reduce the number of GP admissions to the hospital wards."
21703132,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21703132/,"OBJECTIVES: This paper provides highlights of a utilization-focused evaluation of a collaborative Pan-Arctic Inuit Wellness TV Series that was broadcast live in Alaska and Canada in May 2009. This International Polar Year (IPY) communication and outreach project intended to (1) share information on International Polar Year research progress, disseminate findings and explore questions with Inuit in Alaska, Canada and Greenland; (2) provide a forum for Inuit in Alaska, Canada and Greenland to showcase innovative health and wellness projects; (3) ensure Inuit youth and adult engagement throughout; and (4) document and reflect on the overall experience for the purposes of developing and ""testing"" a participatory communication model.
STUDY DESIGN: Utilization-focused formative evaluation of the project, with a focus on overall objectives, key messages and lessons learned to facilitate program improvement.
METHODS: Participant observation, surveys, key informant interviews, document review and website tracking.
RESULTS: Promising community programs related to 3 themes - men's wellness, maternity care and youth resilience - in diverse circumpolar regions were highlighted, as were current and stillevolving findings from ongoing Arctic research. Multiple media methods were used to effectively deliver and receive key messages determined by both community and academic experts. Local capacity and new regional networks were strengthened. Evidence-based resources for health education and community action were archived in digital formats (websites and DVDs), increasing accessibility to otherwise isolated individuals and remote communities.
CONCLUSIONS: The Pan-Arctic Inuit Wellness TV Series was an innovative, multi-dimensional communication project that raised both interest and awareness about complex health conditions in the North and stimulated community dialogue and potential for increased collaborative action. Consistent with a communication for social change approach, the project created new networks, increased motivation to act and provided new tools to do so, and increased local community involvement and ""voice"" in the discussion and dissemination of successful strategies to promote Inuit wellness."
21703202,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21703202/,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Little is known about the HCV prevalence in non-Western migrant populations. To determine whether targeted HCV screening and prevention programs for migrants are needed, we examined HCV prevalence and determinants among non-Western, Western migrants, and the native Dutch population in the Netherlands.
METHODS: Data were obtained from four surveys: (1) 3895 heterosexual visitors recruited during biannual surveys at the STI-clinic Amsterdam, 2007-2009; (2) random sample of 4563 pregnant women in Amsterdam, 2003; (3) population-based random sample of 1309 inhabitants of Amsterdam, 2004; (4) population-based random sample of 4428 people living in the Netherlands, 2006-2007. Characteristics associated with HCV-positivity were examined and phylogenetic analysis was used to obtain insight in the geographical origin of HCV strains.
RESULTS: HCV seroprevalence in the four surveys was low (0.3-0.6%). In total 4860/14,195 (34%) were non-Western and 9329/14,195 (66%) Western participants (including Dutch). First-generation non-Western migrants were more likely to be HCV-positive (0.7-2.3%) than Western participants (0.1-0.4%). Except for survey 3, second-generation non-Western migrants had a lower HCV prevalence than first-generation migrants, comparable to Western migrants and the Dutch population. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the majority of the HCV-positive, first-generation non-Western non-European migrants were infected with endemic strains which are rarely observed in Europe.
CONCLUSIONS: First-generation non-Western migrants are at increased risk for HCV. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that transmission likely took place in the country of origin, causing introduction but no further transmission of endemic HCV strains in the Netherlands. HCV screening and prevention programs should target first-generation, but not second-generation, non-Western migrants."
21703668,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21703668/,"OBJECTIVES: Coexisting conditions associated with interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome (IC/PBS) have not been fully explored by IC/PBS subtypes. We compared comorbid diagnoses/symptoms in women with ulcerative (ULC) and nonulcerative (N-ULC) IC/PBS and controls.
METHODS: Adult women with IC/PBS and controls without IC/PBS completed a mailed survey assessing for 21 diagnoses. IC/PBS subtype was determined by hydrodistention reports. Standardized questionnaires assessed IC/PBS symptoms (Interstitial Cystitis Symptom/Problem Indexes [ICSI-PI]) and for undiagnosed fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, and depression (Symptom Intensity Score [SIS]; Rome III Functional Bowel Questionnaire; Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale [CES-D]). Data were analyzed using the Pearson chi-square, Fisher exact, Wilcoxon rank test, or Spearman rank correlation coefficient.
RESULTS: Of 178 N-ULC IC/PBS patients, 36 ULC IC/PBS patients, and 425 controls, ULC IC/PBS subjects were older (median 63 years; P < .01) and less employed (P < .01), but groups were similar on other demographic characteristics. N-ULC reported more chronic diagnoses (mean 3.5 ± 2.3) than ULC (2.3 ± 2.0) and controls (1.2 ± 1.5) (P < .01). When N-ULC and ULC IC/PBS patients were compared, more N-ULC IC/PBS patients had fibromyalgia (P = .03), migraines (P = .03), temporomandibular joint disorder (P < .01), and higher CES-D (P = .02) and SIS scores (P = .01). The ULC IC/PBS group voided more frequently during the daytime (P = .03) and nighttime (P < .01) and had smaller mean bladder capacity than N-ULC (P < .01). No significant differences were seen between N-ULC and ULC IC/PBS patients on the ICSI-PI and Rome III.
CONCLUSIONS: Notable differences in the number of comorbid diagnoses and symptoms were seen between IC/PBS subtypes and controls. Subtypes should continue to be evaluated individually to ascertain other similarities and differences."
21704294,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21704294/,"BACKGROUND: Jejunostomy tubes (JT) are routinely placed at the time of esophagectomy and can be associated with low--but not insignificant--morbidity. Increased emphasis on evidence-based medicine prompted this critical review of JT use during esophagectomy and factors that predict the absolute need for JT.
METHODS: All esophagectomies performed at one tertiary care institution from 1995 through 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. Statistical analyses were performed to determine preoperative variables that would assist in selecting patients who should receive a JT.
RESULTS: A total of 143 JTs were placed in 151 patients undergoing esophagectomy for carcinoma (83.4%), high-grade dysplasia (13.2%), and perforation (2.6%). Of these, 110 patients (76.9%) had returned to oral intake before discharge (median, 7 days), whereas 33 patients (23.1%) still required tube feedings. Of 8 patients who did not undergo intraoperative JT placement, 6 had resumed oral intake at discharge. Two patients were discharged on total parenteral nutrition. Logistic regression analysis of preoperative variables showed a body mass index of less than 18.5 kg/m2 conferred a likelihood of requiring a JT at discharge (odds ratio, 7.56; p<0.05). Age, sex, albumin level, type of esophagectomy, histology, stage, preoperative neoadjuvant therapy, and type of cancer were not significant predictors of JT need at discharge.
CONCLUSIONS: The only absolute indication for JT placement after esophagectomy was a body mass index of less than 18.5 kg/m2. Other patients may have selective JT placement based on the surgeon's judgment."
21704299,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21704299/,"BACKGROUND: The existing guidelines for extent of resection of carcinoid tumors are based on other, more malignant non-small cell lung cancers. Because of the small number of patients in any single institution, we analyzed the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database to study the effect of the extent of resection of these tumors on overall survival.
METHODS: All patients with lung cancer in the SEER database from 1973 to 2006 with carcinoid tumors as their only cancer were included. Variables examined included age, race (white, black, others), gender, histologic type (atypical versus typical carcinoid), stage (localized, regional, and distant), extent of resection (sublobar resection, lobectomy, or more extensive) and survival. Univariate analyses (Kaplan-Meier method) were used to select variables for multivariate analysis (Cox regression analysis). Associations were considered significant with an alpha error < 5%. In addition, propensity score-matched Cox regression analysis was performed for patients with typical carcinoid disease.
RESULTS: Most patients with carcinoid tumors did not acquire any other cancers (4,785/6,819; 70.2%). Of these, 797 patients had sublobar resection and 2,681 patients had lobectomy or more extensive resections. On univariate analysis, gender (p = 0.014), race (p < 0.001), stage (p < 0.001), histologic type (p < 0.001) and extent of resection (p = 0.04) were associated with overall survival. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that age, gender, race, stage, and histologic type remain statistically associated with overall survival and disease-specific survival, whereas extent of resection is not. Propensity score-matched analysis demonstrates that for typical carcinoid, extent of resection is not associated with overall survival when adjusted for age, gender, race, and stage.
CONCLUSIONS: Sublobar resection of carcinoid tumors did not compromise oncologic outcomes in a large population-based database. Lobectomy for typical carcinoid tumors is not mandatory as long as complete resection and adequate mediastinal staging are performed."
21704300,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21704300/,"BACKGROUND: Since 2007, the use of preoperative β-blockers has been used as a quality standard for patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Recent studies have called into question of the benefit of empiric preoperative β-blocker use.
METHODS: Data were extracted from our Society of Thoracic Surgeons certified database for patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass graft surgery from 2000 to 2008. We compared the outcomes for patients who received preoperative β-blockers with those of patients who did not.
RESULTS: The study group had 12,855 patients, of whom 7,967 (62.0%) were treated preoperatively with β-blockers. Using propensity matching, we selected two matched groups of 4,474 patients with preoperative β-blocker use and 4,474 not using preoperative β-blockers. In the unmatched cohort, only deep sternal infection (0.3% versus 0.5% without β-blockers; p=0.032), pneumonia (1.9% versus 2.4% without β-blockers; p=0.039), and intraoperative blood usage (37.2% versus 34.1% without β-blockers; p<0.001) reached statistically significant difference. In the matched groups, there was no difference between adverse event rates in patients treated with β-blockers and those who were not. The number of patients requiring intraoperative blood product use was significantly higher among β-blocker-treated patients (p=0.004). Calculating the adjusted odds ratios showed that in the matched groups, the preoperative use of β-blockers was not an independent predictor of mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: A rational for preoperative β-blockade exists. However, as with any medical intervention, its application should be tailored to specific clinical scenarios. With no differences in mortality or morbidity, our findings do not support preoperative β-blockade as a useful quality indicator for coronary artery bypass graft surgery."
21704991,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21704991/,"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic duct stenting is widely performed for bridging main pancreatic duct obstruction in patients with chronic pancreatitis. The major limitation is early stent occlusion, making regular stent exchange necessary.
OBJECTIVE: To date, no measures are available to prevent stent occlusion. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cleansing effect of shock wave application (SWA) on occluded pancreatic duct stents in vitro.
DESIGN: In vitro study.
PATIENTS: We analyzed occlusion rates of 25 plastic endoprostheses removed from 21 patients with chronic pancreatitis.
INTERVENTION: We administered 350 shock wave pulses every 10 mm along the prosthesis, which was stored in a latex balloon filled with gas-free physiologic saline solution, by using a pressure of 42 megapascals.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: After SWA, the occlusion rate was measured again, and the cleansing rate was calculated in comparison with the native prosthesis.
RESULTS: The mean (± SD) occlusion rate was significantly reduced (64.7 ± 28.7 [15%-100%]) before SWA vs 9.8 ± 25.3 [0-100%]) after SWA; P = .038). In 16 of 25 prostheses (64%), cleaning was complete. Four of the remaining 9 prostheses (16%) showed satisfactory cleaning of 95%, on average. Residual clogging material was found mainly at the duodenal tip and the middle of the stent. No significant association was found between patient-related or stent-related parameters and the cleansing effect of SWA.
LIMITATIONS: In vitro study design.
CONCLUSION: SWA is effective in cleaning occluded pancreatic endoprostheses in vitro. Prolongation of stent placement seems possible if regular SWA is performed. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy therefore might become a new indication for patients under treatment with pancreatic endoprostheses."
21705091,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21705091/,"BACKGROUND: Bipolar disorder and risk for mania are associated with setting high goals and dysregulated goal pursuit. One mechanism mediating between setting high goals and manic symptoms could be daydreaming or more generally, mental imagery. 'Daydreams' (as one form of mental imagery) are characterized by the fact that the content is produced deliberately. Akiskal et al. (1995) reported that daydreaming prospectively predicted a switch from unipolar depression to bipolar disorder. We here hypothesized that risk for mania should also be associated with increased daydreaming after controlling for depression.
METHOD: N=249 participants from a non-clinical, community sample completed several self-report measures including the Hypomanic Personality scale and Daydreaming scale.
RESULTS: Hierarchical regression revealed that risk for mania predicted daydreaming after controlling for current and former depression.
LIMITATIONS: Only self-report measures were used. The sample was a non-clinical, primarily White British sample, which has implications for generalizability.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite limitations our results support the hypothesis that vulnerability for mania is associated with daydreaming. Daydreaming was related to mania and depression which highlights that it might be relevant for the etiology or maintenance of mood disorders."
21705479,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21705479/,"OBJECTIVE: We assessed the use of ultrasound guided foam sclerotherapy (UGFS) to treat bilateral varicose veins either as synchronous or interval procedures. We specifically assessed total foam volume usage and its influence on early outcome and complications.
METHODS: We reviewed our prospectively compiled computerised database of patients with bilateral varicose veins who have undergone UGFS. Duplex findings, foam volumes used and clinical outcome were assessed.
RESULTS: One hundred and twelve patients had undergone UGFS for bilateral varicose veins. Sixty-one had bilateral UGFS (122 legs) and 51 had interval UGFS (102 legs). Seventy-eight percent bilateral and 60% interval procedures were for single trunk disease. Median foam volumes per treatment episode were: 17.5 mls bilateral, and 10 mls interval FS. At two weeks 81% of legs had complete occlusion after bilateral UGFS compared to 70% after interval UGFS. One patient in the bilateral UGFS developed transient visual disturbance. There was no systemic complications in the interval UGFS.
CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral foam sclerotherapy treatment did not adversly affect vein occlusion rates and there was no significant difference in complication rates between the two groups. Bilateral UGFS can be safely performed in selected patient presenting with bilateral varicose veins."

However, the associated meniscus and cartilage lesions often cannot be repaired and may have long-term detrimental effects on knee function.
PURPOSE: The authors used the large database within the Kaiser Permanente Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Registry to evaluate time to surgery, age, and gender as risk factors for meniscus and cartilage injury and associations with meniscus repair rates in patients.
STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3.
METHODS: A retrospective review of the Kaiser Permanente Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Registry was performed. The associations between time to surgery, age, and gender with meniscus and cartilage lesions and meniscus repair were analyzed using binary logistic regression modeling to calculate odds ratios (ORs) while adjusting for potential confounding variables.
RESULTS: A total of 1252 patients met the inclusion criteria. The risk of medial meniscus injury increased only with time to surgery (6-12 months: OR = 1.81, 95% confidence internal [CI] 1.29-2.54, P = .001; and >12 months: OR = 2.19, 95% CI 1.58-3.02, P < .001). The risk of lateral meniscus injury decreased only with female gender (OR = 0.65, 95% CI 0.51-0.83, P = .001). The risk of cartilage injury increased with age (OR = 1.05 per year, 95% CI 1.04-1.07, P < .001) and time to surgery >12 months (OR = 1.57, 95% CI 1.12-2.20, P = .009), but decreased with female gender (OR = 0.71, 95% CI 0.54-0.92, P = .009). Medial meniscus repairs relative to medial meniscus injury decreased with increasing time to surgery (3-6 months: OR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.37-1.00, P = .050; and >12 months: OR = 0.41, 95% CI 0.25-0.67, P < .001) and increasing age (OR = 0.96 per year, 95% CI 0.94-0.98, P < .001).
CONCLUSION: Increased risk of medial meniscus injury and decreased repair rate were strongly associated with increasing time to surgery. Increased risk of cartilage injury was associated with increasing age, increasing time to surgery, and male gender."
21705784,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21705784/,"BACKGROUND: Hypokalaemic nephropathy has been described in patients with chronic potassium depletion; it is a condition in which proximal tubular vacuolization and interstitial fibrosis occur, resulting in a decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and, in some cases, renal failure. It has been described in patients with chronic diarrhoea, eating disorders, laxative abuse and primary hyperaldosteronism; also occasionally in Bartter syndrome (BS), in which severe hypokalaemia accompanies significant renal sodium and water losses, though rarely in Gitelman syndrome (GS), in which there is equally severe hypokalaemia, but only modest sodium losses.
AIM: We hypothesized that hypokalaemic nephropathy may not be due to potassium depletion per se, but persistently elevated circulating levels of aldosterone, possibly with superimposed episodes of renal hypoperfusion.
DESIGN AND METHODS: We searched UK and European data sets to retrospectively compare serum and urinary parameters in patients with GS and BS.
RESULTS: The patients with GS often had lower serum potassium concentrations than patients with BS, but the BS patients had significantly higher serum creatinine concentrations and lower estimated GFRs (eGFR). BS patients had significantly higher fractional excretions of sodium compared with GS patients, as well as higher plasma renin activities and serum aldosterone levels.
CONCLUSION: These findings show that in genetically confirmed cases of BS and GS, the degree of hypokalaemia (as an index of chronic potassium depletion) does not correlate with GFR, and that on-going sodium and water losses, and consequent secondary hyperaldosteronism, may play a more important role in the aetiology of hypokalaemic nephropathy."

However, the nature of the relationship is not fully understood. Here the authors compared 30 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of temporomandibular joint dysfunction and tinnitus to a group of 61 patients with tinnitus but without any subjective complaints of TMJ dysfunction with respect to clinical and demographic characteristics.
STUDY DESIGN: Case-control study.
SETTING: Tertiary referral center.
SUBJECTS: Tinnitus patients with and without TMJ dysfunction presenting at the Department of Prosthetic Dentistry and th: Tinnitus Clinic at the University of Regensburg.
RESULTS: Tinnitus patients with TMJ disorder had better hearing function (P < .0005), lower age (P = .001), and lower age at tinnitus onset (P = .002) and were more frequently female (P = .003). Their subjectively perceived tinnitus loudness was lower (P = .01), and more of them could modulate their tinnitus by jaw or neck movements (P = .001).
CONCLUSION: Classical risk factors for tinnitus (age, male gender, hearing loss) are less relevant in tinnitus patients with TMJ disorder, suggesting a causal role of TMJ pathology in the generation and maintenance of tinnitus. Based on this finding, treatment of TMJ disorder may represent a causally oriented treatment strategy for tinnitus."
21705903,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21705903/,"BACKGROUND: Saddle pulmonary embolism represents a large clot and a risk for sudden hemodynamic collapse. However, the clinical presentation and outcomes vary widely. On the basis of the findings of right heart dysfunction on echocardiograms, computed tomography angiography, or cardiac enzyme elevation, some argue for the use of thrombolytics or catheter thrombectomy even for hemodynamically stable patients.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the outcomes and management of patients with saddle pulmonary embolism, including radiographic appearance (estimate of clot burden) and echocardiographic features.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: This study is a retrospective evaluation of all patients with computed tomography angiography positive for pulmonary embolism from June 1, 2004, to February 28, 2009. Two radiologists selected those with saddle pulmonary embolism and evaluated the clot burden score. The clinical information, echocardiography, treatments, and outcomes of these patients were extracted via chart review. Saddle pulmonary embolism was found in 37 of 680 patients (5.4%, 95% confidence interval 4% to 7%) with documented pulmonary embolism on computed tomography angiography. For patients with saddle pulmonary embolism, the median age was 60 yrs and 41% were males. Major comorbidities were neurologic (24%), recent surgery (24%), and malignancy (22%). Transient hypotension occurred in 14% and persistent shock in 8%. One patient required mechanical ventilation. Echocardiography was performed in 27 patients (73%). Right ventricle enlargement and dysfunction were found in 78% and elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure in 67%. Computed tomography angiography demonstrated a high median pulmonary artery clot burden score of 31 points. The median right ventricle to left ventricle diameter ratio was 1.39. Inferior vena cava filters were placed in 46%. Unfractionated heparin was administered in 33 (87%) and thrombolytics in four (11%). The median hospital length of stay was 9 days. Two of 37 saddle pulmonary embolism patients (5.4%) died in the hospital (95% confidence interval 0.7% to 18%).
CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with saddle pulmonary embolism found on computed tomography angiography responded to the standard management for pulmonary embolism with unfractionated heparin. Although ominous in appearance, most patients with saddle pulmonary embolism are hemodynamically stable and do not require thrombolytic therapy or other interventions."
21705951,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21705951/,"OBJECTIVES: The objective was to test whether chromogranin A (CgA), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) are released from the pancreas during the selective arterial calcium stimulation and hepatic venous sampling test (ASVS) in patients with insulinomas.
METHODS: We determined CgA, NSE, PP, insulin, C-peptide, and proinsulin in blood samples obtained during the ASVS test in 19 patients with insulinomas. Levels following calcium injection into the arteries supplying the tumor were compared with levels following calcium stimulation of arteries supplying healthy pancreatic tissue.
RESULTS: After calcium injection into the artery supplying the insulinoma, a significant 8-fold increase in insulin (range, 2.3-117; P < 0.001), a 3.8-fold increase in C-peptide (1.7-32.4; P < 0.001), and a 1.9-fold increase in proinsulin (0.7-5.3, P < 0.001) were detectable whereas NSE and CgA did not increase. No significant increases in insulin, C-peptide, proinsulin, CgA, and NSE concentrations were found after calcium injection into control arteries. Pancreatic polypeptide increased 1.5-fold (0.8-4.5; P = 0.017) after calcium injection into the tumor artery and 2.4-fold (0.8-7.9; P = 0.016) after injection into the control artery.
CONCLUSIONS: Insulin, C-peptide, and proinsulin are released by insulinoma cells in response to arterial calcium stimulation, whereas CgA and NSE are not released. Also from our study it seems that PP may be released by healthy islet cells after calcium stimulation."
21706197,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21706197/,"PURPOSE: It is broadly supposed that in total knee arthroplasty, the flexion/extension gap ratio is increased after resection of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL). However, studies are rare and results are inconsistent. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine whether PCL release regularly increases the flexion gap.
METHODS: Data from 50 consecutive posterior stabilised knee prostheses were analysed retrospectively. Using imageless computer navigation, the joint-gap width was measured over the entire range of motion before and after PCL release.
RESULTS: PCL release had no effect on the extension gap, but it increased the flexion gap significantly. An increase of >3 mm occurred in 36% of patients and of >5 mm in 12%. No clinically relevant effect (<2 mm) was found in 44% of patients.
CONCLUSION: PCL release increased the flexion/extension gap ratio on average, but the individual effect could not be predicted. Therefore, we recommend PCL release before the femoral resections are performed, as this step mainly determines the ratio between extension and flexion gap."
21706204,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21706204/,"BACKGROUND: The immunochemical faecal occult blood test (IFOBT) is widely performed for colorectal cancer screening, but the usefulness of IFOBT in the detection of disorders of the small intestine is unknown. The objective of this study was to investigate what proportion of IFOBT-positive subjects with negative colonoscopy and oesophagogastroduodenoscopy has pathologies of the small intestine detected by capsule endoscopy (CE).
METHODS: Between October 2008 and June 2010, asymptomatic IFOBT-positive patients with negative total colonoscopy and oesophagogastroduodenoscopy underwent CE. CE findings were classified into three categories: P0 (no abnormalities, or findings without potential for bleeding), P1 (findings with uncertain potential for bleeding), P2 and (findings with high potential for bleeding).
RESULTS: Fifty-three patients (37 males, 16 females; 52.1 ± 13.0 years) were included. There were no cases with P2, 19 cases with P1, and 34 cases with P0 (there were no abnormalities in 25 of 34 cases). As a result, lesions in the small intestine were detected in 28 cases. Additional examination was considered necessary for five patients after CE, but no abnormality was detected, and therapeutic intervention was not undertaken in any case. Caecal completion rate was 92.5%.
CONCLUSIONS: No significant pathologies of the small intestine were detected in asymptomatic IFOBT-positive cases with negative colonoscopy and oesophagogastroduodenoscopy. CE is of limited use in asymptomatic patients with positive IFOBT."
21706238,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21706238/,"PURPOSE: To explore whether the 'hikikomori' syndrome (social withdrawal) described in Japan exists in other countries, and if so, how patients with the syndrome are diagnosed and treated.
METHODS: Two hikikomori case vignettes were sent to psychiatrists in Australia, Bangladesh, India, Iran, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the USA. Participants rated the syndrome's prevalence in their country, etiology, diagnosis, suicide risk, and treatment.
RESULTS: Out of 247 responses to the questionnaire (123 from Japan and 124 from other countries), 239 were enrolled in the analysis. Respondents' felt the hikikomori syndrome is seen in all countries examined and especially in urban areas. Biopsychosocial, cultural, and environmental factors were all listed as probable causes of hikikomori, and differences among countries were not significant. Japanese psychiatrists suggested treatment in outpatient wards and some did not think that psychiatric treatment is necessary. Psychiatrists in other countries opted for more active treatment such as hospitalization.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with the hikikomori syndrome are perceived as occurring across a variety of cultures by psychiatrists in multiple countries. Our results provide a rational basis for study of the existence and epidemiology of hikikomori in clinical or community populations in international settings."
21706289,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21706289/,"BACKGROUND: Patients with sleep apnea (OSA) have an increased risk of perioperative complications.
AIM: The purpose of this study is to assess whether OSA increases the risk of cardio-respiratory complications in patients undergoing endoscopic procedures with conscious sedation.
METHODS: A prospective study over a 7-month period was performed. All patients undergoing upper, lower, or combined endoscopy were asked to fill in the Berlin questionnaire. The questionnaire was scored, and patients were classified as high or low risk for sleep apnea based on the suggested scoring criteria. Patients who had previously undergone a sleep study were excluded. Demographics and co-morbidities were identified from the electronic medical record. Procedure type, amount of sedation, and minor and major complications were identified from the endoscopy flow sheet. The minor complications were defined as hypertension, hypotension, bradycardia, tachycardia, hypoxemia, and bradypnea (respiratory rate <8 breaths/min). Major complications included chest pain, arrhythmia, altered mental status, respiratory distress, and a minor complication that required a significant intervention, such as use of a reversal agent, atropine, up-titration of oxygen for hypoxemia, or prolonged observation.
RESULTS: Procedures were performed in 904 patients: colonoscopies, 68.0%; upper endoscopies, 22.8%; and combined procedures, 9.2%. Five hundred fifty-three patients were identified as low risk (61.2%), and 351 were identified as high risk (38.8%). The mean age was 59.5 ± 10.5 years, mean body mass index was 28.9 ± 6.6, mean neck circumference was 16.2 ± 6.3 in., and 91.4% were males. The median Charlson co-morbidity index was 1 (25-75% percentage range 0-2). All patients received midazolam and fentanyl during endoscopy. The median and 25-75% range for midazolam and fentanyl dosages were 5 mg, 4-6 mg and 100 μg, 75-125 μg, respectively. Minor complications were observed in 10.56% of low-risk patients and 10.63% of high-risk patients (p = not significant (NS); odds ratio, 1.01; 95% confidence interval 0.65-1.56). Major complications were observed in 3.25% of low-risk patients and 1.9% of high-risk patients (p = ns; odds ratio, 0.6; 95% confidence interval 0.26-1.46).
CONCLUSION: For patients undergoing endoscopy procedures under conscious sedation, the presence of OSA does not clearly increase the risk of cardiopulmonary complications."
21707472,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21707472/,"INTRODUCTION: Cognitive deficits are commonly reported in schizophrenia and have a significant impact on the daily life of patients and on their social and work inclusion. Cognitive remediation therapies (CRT) may enhance the capabilities of schizophrenia patients. Although social and work integration is the ultimate goal of CRT, previous studies have failed to carry out a detailed assessment of the effects on everyday life.
METHODS: Fifty-nine schizophrenia patients were randomised into two groups (remediation or usual treatment) to test the effects of a new remediation programme, which included both rehearsal and strategy learning, on cognitive functions. An ecological test was used to evaluate its transfer to daily living skills.
RESULTS: Cognitive improvements are revealed in CRT patients, mainly in memory and executive functions. Patients showing some deficiencies to perform the ecological test had better scores after the CRT. Moreover, they significantly improve their social activity scores.
CONCLUSIONS: CRT would facilitate mental load monitoring by enhancing or reallocating cognitive resources, facilitating the patient's organisation and autonomy. The rehearsal learning approach improves the ability to carry out automatic operations that are less demanding in terms of cognitive resources, thereby increasing the resources available for acquisition and efficient use of strategies provided during the strategy learning approach."
21708000,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21708000/,"BACKGROUND: This study investigated whether the introduction of professional development teaching in the first two years of a medical course improved students' observed communication skills with simulated patients. Students' observed communication skills were related to patient-centred attitudes, confidence in communicating with patients and performance in later clinical examinations.
METHODS: Eighty-two medical students from two consecutive cohorts at a UK medical school completed two videoed consultations with a simulated patient: one at the beginning of year 1 and one at the end of year 2. Group 1 (n = 35) received a traditional pre-clinical curriculum. Group 2 (n = 47) received a curriculum that included communication skills training integrated into a 'professional development' vertical module. Videoed consultations were rated using the Evans Interview Rating Scale by communication skills tutors. A subset of 27% were double-coded. Inter-rater reliability is reported.
RESULTS: Students who had received the professional development teaching achieved higher ratings for use of silence, not interrupting the patient, and keeping the discussion relevant compared to students receiving the traditional curriculum. Patient-centred attitudes were not related to observed communication. Students who were less nervous and felt they knew how to listen were rated as better communicators. Students receiving the traditional curriculum and who had been rated as better communicators when they entered medical school performed less well in the final year clinical examination.
CONCLUSIONS: Students receiving the professional development training showed significant improvements in certain communication skills, but students in both cohorts improved over time. The lack of a relationship between observed communication skills and patient-centred attitudes may be a reflection of students' inexperience in working with patients, resulting in 'patient-centredness' being an abstract concept. Students in the early years of their medical course may benefit from further opportunities to practise basic communication skills on a one-to-one basis with patients."
21708010,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21708010/,"BACKGROUND: The basic function of the immune system is to protect an organism against infection in order to minimize the fitness costs of being infected. According to life-history theory, energy resources are in a trade-off between the costly demands of immunity and other physiological demands. Concerning fish, both physiology and immunity are influenced by seasonal changes (i.e. temporal variation) associated to the changes of abiotic factors (such as primarily water temperature) and interactions with pathogens and parasites. In this study, we investigated the potential associations between the physiology and immunocompetence of common carp (Cyprinus carpio) collected during five different periods of a given year. Our sampling included the periods with temporal variability and thus, it presented a different level in exposure to parasites. We analyzed which of two factors, seasonality or parasitism, had the strongest impact on changes in fish physiology and immunity.
RESULTS: We found that seasonal changes play a key role in affecting the analyzed measurements of physiology, immunity and parasitism. The correlation analysis revealed the relationships between the measures of overall host physiology, immunity and parasite load when temporal variability effect was removed. When analyzing separately parasite groups with different life-strategies, we found that fish with a worse condition status were infected more by monogeneans, representing the most abundant parasite group. The high infection by cestodes seems to activate the phagocytes. A weak relationship was found between spleen size and abundance of trematodes when taking into account seasonal changes.
CONCLUSIONS: Even if no direct trade-off between the measures of host immunity and physiology was confirmed when taking into account the seasonality, it seems that seasonal variability affects host immunity and physiology through energy allocation in a trade-off between life important functions, especially reproduction and fish condition. Host immunity measures were not found to be in a trade-off with the investigated physiological traits or functions, but we confirmed the immunosuppressive role of 11-ketotestosterone on fish immunity measured by complement activity. We suggest that the different parasite life-strategies influence different aspects of host physiology and activate the different immunity pathways."
21708016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21708016/,"BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) exists in the breast milk of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) mothers. The authors use a meta-analytic technique to quantify the evidence of an association between breastfeeding and risk of CHB infection among the infants vaccinated against HBV.
METHODS: Literature search is performed up to 2010 on the relationship between infantile CHB infection within one-year follow up after immunization with the third-dose hepatitis B vaccine and breastfeeding. Two reviewers independently extract the data and evaluate the methodological quality. A random-effects model is employed to systematically combine the results of all included studies.
RESULTS: Based on data from 32 studies, 4.32% (244/5650) of infants born of CHB mothers develop CHB infection. The difference in risk of the infection between breastfed and formula-fed infants (RD) is -0.8%, (95% confidence interval [CI]: -1.6%, 0.1%). Analysis of the data from 16 of the studies finds that RD for mothers who are positive for the HBeAg and/or the HBV DNA, 0.7% (95%CI: -2.0%, 3.5%), is similar to that for those who are negative for these infectivity markers, -0.5% (95%CI: -1.7%, 0.6%).
CONCLUSIONS: Breast milk is infectious; yet, breastfeeding, even by mothers with high infectivity, is not associated with demonstrable risk of infantile CHB infection, provided that the infants have been vaccinated against HBV at birth."
21708250,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21708250/,"BACKGROUND: Estrone and its sulfated esters are the most abundant estrogens in blood in men and in women after the menopause. However, previous studies on the esterification of estrone with fatty acids have yielded conflicting results, some studies reporting high nanomolar concentrations of estrone fatty acyl esters in plasma.
METHODS: We developed an estrone radioimmunoassay (RIA) method to determine endogenous concentrations of estrone and after saponification, applied it to male and female plasma. In addition, the concentration of estrone fatty acyl esters in ovarian follicular fluid was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
RESULTS: By estrone RIA, we did not find measurable amounts of estrone fatty acyl esters in male or female plasma, except for one premenopausal woman who had the highest plasma concentration of nonesterified estrone. The concentration of hydrolyzed estrone fatty acyl esters determined by LC-MS/MS in follicular fluid obtained from women undergoing ovarian stimulation was below the limit of quantification of <10 pmol/l (<2.7 ng/l).
CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to previous data by others, our study suggests that estrone fatty acyl esters are in most cases not detectable in plasma of healthy men or healthy nonpregnant women."
21708367,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21708367/,"BACKGROUND: Orthopedic surgery residency training requires intellectual and motor skill development. In this study, we utilized a computer-based haptic simulator to examine a potential model for evaluation of resident proficiency and efficiency in the placement of a center guide wire during fixation of an intertrochanteric proximal femur fracture. We hypothesize the junior residents will utilize more fluoroscopy and require more time to complete the task.
METHODS: Postgraduate year (PGY) 1-5 residents completed the same task of placing a single central guide pin into a femoral head for a dynamic hip screw construct utilizing a haptic surgical simulator. Residents were divided into 2 groups (PGY 1-2 and PGY 3-5) and then evaluated based on final tip-apex distance (TAD), fluoroscopy time, time to complete the task, total number of distinct attempts at pin placement for each femur construct, as well as final 3-dimensional location of the pin from the isometric center of the femoral head.
RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were noted between the 2 groups in total time or for tip-apex distance, anterior/posterior medial/lateral position, anterior/posterior superior/inferior, and lateral x-ray medial/lateral positioning measurements. Significant differences between Groups I and II were observed in anterior/posterior final position on the lateral view (p = 0.01), unique attempts (0.77 and 1.5, p = 0.03), and total fluoroscopic time (18.4 seconds and 12.9 seconds, p = 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we displayed that based on our simulator model there was no statistical difference between Group I and II in time to completion, final placement on anterior/posterior (A/P) view, and tip-apex distance. There was a statistically significant difference in the anterior/posterior placement of the wire in lateral view between the 2 groups, fluoroscopy time, and number of attempts per trial. Our findings suggest a computer-based surgical simulator can identify measurable differences in surgical proficiency between junior and senior orthopedic surgery residents and may play an expanding role in resident education."
21709018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21709018/,"BACKGROUND: Vacuum-assisted breast biopsy (VABB) is used for the diagnosis of non-palpable breast lesions. Hematoma has been recognized as the main complication of the procedure. Its main disadvantage is the underestimation rate. Generally speaking, approximately up to 24 cores are excised in most published series. It has been suggested that excision of more cores per lesion can reduce the underestimation rate. The present study aims to evaluate hematoma formation with regard to the number of cores excised.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 660 women underwent VABB; 232 women were allocated to the standard protocol (24-36 cores excised, 2-3 offsets) and 428 women were allocated to the extended protocol (96 cores excised, 8 offsets). Cases were derived from a double blind study, as well as from the periods before (standard protocol) and after (mainly extended protocol) the study. In all cases, the occurrence of organized hematomas within the subsequent 20 days was followed up by ultrasound.
RESULTS: In the standard protocol, the frequency of clinically significant and subsequently organized hematomas was 3.5%. However, in the extended protocol the respective hematoma percentage was 7.5%. Clinically significant and subsequently organized hematomas were significantly more frequent in the extended protocol (Pearson's chi-squared=4.29, p=0.038).
CONCLUSION: Despite the superiority of the extended protocol in terms of underestimation, the approximately two-fold increase in hematoma occurrence prompts the need for careful patient selection prior to its performance."
26462554,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26462554/,"AIM: To retrospectively evaluate the feasibility and value of CT-CT image fusion to assess the shift of peripheral lung cancers with/-out chest wall infiltration, comparing computed tomography acquisitions in shallow-breathing (SB-CT) and deep-inspiration breath-hold (DIBH-CT) in patients undergoing FDG-PET/CT for lung cancer staging.
METHODS: Image fusion of SB-CT and DIBH-CT was performed with a multimodal workstation used for nuclear medicine fusion imaging. The distance of intrathoracic landmarks and the positional shift of tumours were measured using semi-transparent overlay of both CT series. Statistical analyses were adjusted for confounders of tumour infiltration. Cutoff levels were calculated for prediction of no-/infiltration.
RESULTS: Lateral pleural recessus and diaphragm showed the largest respiratory excursions. Infiltrating lung cancers showed more limited respiratory shifts than non-infiltrating tumours. A large respiratory tumour-motility accurately predicted non-infiltration. However, the tumour shifts were limited and variable, limiting the accuracy of prediction.
CONCLUSION: This pilot fusion study proved feasible and allowed a simple analysis of the respiratory shifts of peripheral lung tumours using CT-CT image fusion in a PET/CT setting. The calculated cutoffs were useful in predicting the exclusion of chest wall infiltration but did not accurately predict tumour infiltration. This method can provide additional qualitative information in patients with lung cancers with contact to the chest wall but unclear CT evidence of infiltration undergoing PET/CT without the need of additional investigations. Considering the small sample size investigated, further studies are necessary to verify the obtained results."
26462683,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26462683/,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to explore the association between specific forms of childhood abuse and neglect with lifetime suicide attempts in women with bulimia nervosa (BN).
METHODS: Two hundred and four women aged 18-65 (mean 25.6 years, SD 9.13) with full or subclinical BN were recruited in five US Midwestern communities and specialized eating disorder clinics. Participants completed questionnaires including the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) and self-reported whether they had ever had a lifetime suicide attempt. Logistic regression analyses were used to predict lifetime suicide attempts from each subscale of the CTQ.
RESULTS: Childhood emotional, physical, and sexual abuse were significantly associated with the presence of a lifetime suicide attempt in women with BN. Childhood emotional and physical neglect were not associated with suicide attempts.
CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with BN who have experienced childhood emotional and sexual abuse are at increased risk of a lifetime suicide attempt. Future research is needed to understand the mechanism to address in treatment and prevention efforts. It is important for clinicians to be aware of the potential increased risk of suicide in individuals with BN with a history of childhood abuse."
26462960,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26462960/,"BACKGROUND: Biological and sociocultural differences between men and women may play an important role in medical treatment. Little is known about the awareness of these differences among general practitioners (GPs) and if they consider such differences in their medical practice. The aim of this study was to explore GPs' perception of sex and gender aspects in medical treatment.
METHODS: We conducted five focus group discussions (FGDs) with 29 physicians (mainly GPs) in Sweden. A discussion guide with semi-structured questions was used. All FGDs were audio-recorded and transcribed word-by-word. Data were analysed through inductive thematic analysis with no predetermined categories.
RESULTS: Three main categories emerged from the data. The first category emphasised GPs' experiences of sex and gender differences in diagnosing and assessment of clinical findings. Medical treatment in men and women was central in the second category. The third category emphasised GPs' knowledge of sex differences in drug therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: The GPs stated they had little knowledge of sex and gender differences in drug treatment, but gave multiple examples of how the patient's sex affects the choice of treatment. Sex and gender aspects were considered in diagnosing and in the treatment decision. However, once the decision to treat was made the choice of drug followed recommendations by local Drug and Therapeutics Committee, which were perceived to be evidence-based. In the analysis we found a gap between perceived and expressed knowledge of sex and gender differences in drug treatment indicating a need of education about this to be included in the curriculum in medical school and in basic and specialist training for physicians. Education could also be a tool to avoid stereotypical thinking about male and female patients."
26462976,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26462976/,"OBJECTIVES: Female gender has been shown to negatively affect the outcomes of surgical bypass for peripheral arterial disease (PAD). We examined gender-related disparities in outcomes of endovascular PAD procedures in a large population-based study.
METHODS: We used discharge data from California hospitals to identify patients who had PAD interventions during 2005 to 2009. Logistic regression was used for 12-month reintervention, and Cox proportional hazard regression was used for amputation-free survival comparisons.
RESULTS: A total of 25 635 patients had endovascular procedures (11 389 [44.4%] women). Women were more likely than men (34.5% vs 30.1%, P < .0001) to have critical limb ischemia (CLI). Twelve-month reintervention rate in women was similar to men. Amputation-free survival was better among women than men (hazard ratio 0.84, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76-0.93, P = .0006).
CONCLUSION: Despite presenting more frequently with CLI, women had better amputation-free survival than men following endovascular procedures. Future research should determine whether findings favor one type of PAD treatment modality over another for women."
26462989,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26462989/,"OBJECTIVES: The treatment of bone and joint infections is challenging due to the presence of bacterial biofilm and the increasing emergence of multiresistant strains. BAG-S53P4 is a bone substitute that is characterized by osteoconductive and antimicrobial properties. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of BAG-S53P4 against biofilm produced in vitro by multiresistant bacterial strains.
METHODS: Multiresistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from bone and joint infections were used in this study. Titanium discs covered by bacterial biofilm were incubated with BAG-S53P4 or inert glass as a control. The amount of biofilm on each titanium disc was evaluated after 48 h of incubation by means of confocal laser scanning microscopy.
RESULTS: Significantly lower total biomass volumes were observed for all strains after treatment with BAG-S53P4 when compared with controls. Moreover, the percentage of dead cells was significantly higher in treated samples than in controls for all the tested strains.
CONCLUSIONS: BAG-S53P4 is able to reduce the biofilm produced by multiresistant S. epidermidis, A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae on titanium substrates in vitro, probably by interfering with cell viability. Owing to its osteoconductive, antibacterial and antibiofilm properties, the use of BAG-S53P4 may be a successful strategy for the treatment of bone and prosthetic joint infections."
26463445,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26463445/,"BACKGROUND: Although the UK fit note has been broadly welcomed as a tool to facilitate return to work, difficulties and uncertainties have resulted in wide variation in its use. Agreement on what constitutes the 'ideal' fit note from the perspective of all stakeholders is needed to inform best practice. A recent Delphi study conducted by the authors reached consensus on 67 recommendations for best practice in fit note use for employed patients. However, such recommendations are not necessarily followed in practice. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate the perceived achievability of implementing these Delphi recommendations with a further reference panel of stakeholders.
METHODS: Potential participants were identified by the research team and study steering group. These included representatives of employers, government departments, trades unions, patient organisations, general and medical practitioners and occupational health organisations who were believed to have the knowledge and experience to comment on the recommendations. The consensus Delphi statements were presented to the participants on-line. Participants were invited to comment on whether the recommendations were achievable, and what might hinder or facilitate their use in practice. Free text comments were combined with comments made in the Delphi study that referred to issues of feasibility or practicality. These were synthesised and analysed thematically.
RESULTS: Twelve individuals representing a range of stakeholder groups participated. Many of the recommendations were considered achievable, such as improved format and use of the electronic fit note, completion of all fields, better application and revision of guidance and education in fit note use. However a number of obstacles to implementation were identified. These included: legislation governing the fit note and GP contracts; the costs and complexity of IT systems and software; the limitations of the GP consultation; unclear roles and responsibilities for the funding and delivery of education, guidance and training for all stakeholders, and the evaluation of practice.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that although many recommendations for the ideal fit note are considered achievable, there are considerable financial, legal, organisational and professional obstacles to be overcome in order for the recommendations to be implemented successfully."
26463599,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26463599/,"BACKGROUND: MDT (multidisciplinary team) meetings are considered an essential component of care for patients with cancer. However there is remarkably little direct evidence that such meetings improve outcomes. We assessed whether or not MDT (multidisciplinary team) processes influenced survival in a cohort of patients with colorectal cancer.
METHODS: Observational study of a population-based cohort of 586 consecutive patients with colorectal cancer diagnosed in Tayside (Scotland) during 2006 and 2007.
RESULTS: Recommendations from MDT meetings were implemented in 411/586 (70.1 %) of patients, the MDT+ group. The remaining175/586 (29.9 %) were either never discussed at an MDT, or recommendations were not implemented, MDT- group. The 5-year cause-specific survival (CSS) rates were 63.1 % (MDT+) and 48.2 % (MDT-), p < 0.0001. In analysis confined to patients who survived >6 weeks after diagnosis, the rates were 63.2 % (MDT+) and 57.7 % (MDT-), p = 0.064. The adjusted hazard rate (HR) for death from colorectal cancer was 0.73 (0.53 to 1.00, p = 0.047) in the MDT+ group compared to the MDT- group, in patients surviving >6 weeks the adjusted HR was 1.00 (0.70 to 1.42, p = 0.987). Any benefit from the MDT process was largely confined to patients with advanced disease: adjusted HR (early) 1.32 (0.69 to 2.49, p = 0.401); adjusted HR(advanced) 0.65 (0.45 to 0.96, p = 0.031).
CONCLUSIONS: Adequate MDT processes are associated with improved survival for patients with colorectal cancer. However, some of this effect may be more apparent than real - simply reflecting selection bias. The MDT process predominantly benefits the 40 % of patients who present with advanced disease and conveys little demonstrable advantage to patients with early tumours. These results call into question the current belief that all new patients with colorectal cancer should be discussed at an MDT meeting."
26463865,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26463865/,"PURPOSE: Medium- to long-term retrospective evaluation of clinical and radiographic outcome in the treatment of degenerative lumbar diseases with hybrid posterior fixation.
METHODS: Thirty patients were included with the mean age of 47.8 years (range 35 to 60 years). All patients underwent posterior lumbar instrumentation using hybrid fixation for lumbar stenosis with instability (13 cases), degenerative spondylolisthesis Meyerding grade I (6 cases), degenerative disc disease of one or more adjacent levels in six cases and mild lumbar degenerative scoliosis in five patients. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using Oswestry disability index (ODI), Roland and Morris disability questionnaire (RMDQ), and the visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores. All patients were assessed by preoperative, postoperative and follow-up standing plain radiographs and lateral X-rays with flexion and extension. Adjacent disc degeneration was also evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at follow-up.
RESULTS: At a mean follow-up of 6.1 years, we observed on X-rays and/or MRI 3 cases of adjacent segment disease (10.0 %): two of them (6.6 %) presented symptoms and recurred a new surgery. The last patient (3.3 %) developed asymptomatic retrolisthesis of L3 not requiring revision surgery. The mean preoperative ODI score was 67.6, RMDQ score was 15.1, VAS back pain score was 9.5, and VAS leg pain score was 8.6. Postoperatively, these values improved to 28.1, 5.4, 3.1, and 2.9, respectively, and remained substantially unchanged at the final follow-up: (27.7, 5.2, 2.9, and 2.7, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: After 5-year follow-up, hybrid posterior lumbar fixation presented satisfying clinical outcomes in the treatment of degenerative disease."
26464337,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26464337/,"OBJECTIVE: Knowledge of factors associated with fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) may inform intervention development and improve patient care. The aims were (1) to compare FCR severity between cancer types and (2) to identify associations between FCR, demographics, medical characteristics, information provision and health-related quality of life.
METHODS: Cross-sectional data were obtained from the Patient Reported Outcomes Following Initial Treatment and Long-Term Evaluation of Survivorship registry. We included stage I and II survivors diagnosed with melanoma (n = 469), colorectal cancer (n = 861), endometrial cancer (n = 688), thyroid cancer (n = 218), Hodgkin (n = 103) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 276). Cancer survivors completed questionnaires on FCR (Impact of Cancer scale - Health Worries subscale), satisfaction with information provision (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer, Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ) INFO25, satisfaction scale) and health-related quality of life (EORTC-QLQ C30, Short Form 36-item).
RESULTS: A total of 2615 survivors completed the Impact of Cancer scale - Health Worries subscale. No significant differences in FCR severity were found between any of the cancer types (p = 0.063). A younger age, female gender, stage II disease, a shorter time since diagnosis, scheduled follow-up appointments and comorbidity were associated with higher FCR (p < 0.01). Satisfaction with information provision was negatively correlated with FCR severity (r = -0.16, p < 0.05). Demographic and medical factors accounted for 6% of explained variance in FCR. The full model, also including health-related quality of life, explained 15% and 19%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Fear of cancer recurrence seems to be a universal concern of cancer survivors rather than a cancer type-specific problem. Gender, age and medical factors were identified as risk factors. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
26465127,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26465127/,"BACKGROUND: Concerns about randomized controlled trial (RCT) generalizability typically center on characteristics of RCT patient participants. Possibly there are RCT site characteristics that distinguish RCT outcomes from those that can be expected in non-RCT settings.
OBJECTIVES: To examine whether site propensity toward RCT enrollment is associated with recovery outcomes for patients and whether the association differs between patients who participate in a RCT compared with those who remain in an observational (OBS) treatment environment.
DATA: Study participants with acute bipolar depression from The Systematic Treatment Enhancing Program for Bipolar Disorder acute depression pharmacotherapy RCT (N=337) and OBS treatment arm (N=1581).
METHODS: A longitudinal OBS study comparing the likelihood of recovery in the RCT to the OBS arm, allowing effect modification by site high RCT enrollment propensity (defined as >the median) and other predictors over a 6-month follow-up period.
RESULTS: Non-RCT participants who received care in sites with high RCT enrollment propensity had a higher probability of recovering from their bipolar-depression episode compared with participants from low propensity sites [odds ratio (95% confidence interval)=2.13 (1.28-3.55)]. RCT enrollment propensity was not associated with recovery outcomes for RCT participants [1.03 (0.35-3.03)].
CONCLUSIONS: Sites with high propensity to enroll patients in RCTs appear to have unobserved characteristics, which play a significant role in outcomes for non-RCT patients. For RCT participants in low-enrollment sites, possibly RCT protocols, which proscribe care delivery and monitoring, attenuate this effect. These results have implications for future research to improve outcomes in nonresearch care settings."
26465706,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26465706/,"INTRODUCTION: The present study aimed to investigate mindreading abilities in female adolescent patients with AN compared to healthy controls (HCs), analysing differences for emotional valence of facial stimuli.
METHODS: The Eating Disorder Inventory) for evaluating psychological traits associated with eating disorders and the Children's version of the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test for evaluating mindreading abilities were administered to 40 Italian female patients (mean age = 14.93; SD = 1.48) with restrictive diagnosis of anorexia nervosa (AN) and 40 healthy females (mean age = 14.88; SD = 0.56).
RESULTS: No significant differences between the AN group and HCs for the Eyes Total score were found. Even when analysing emotional valence of the items, the two groups were equally successful in the facial recognition of positive, negative and neutral emotions. A significant difference was revealed for the percentage of correct responses of item 10 and item 15, where the AN group was less able to correctly identify the target descriptor (Not believing) over the foils than HCs. A significant difference was revealed in discriminating for affective emotions versus cognitive states; only for affective but not for cognitive states, patients with AN were found to perform better than controls on the mindreading task.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlighted the importance of analysing and discriminating for different valences of facial stimuli when assessing mindreading abilities in adolescents with AN, so that more precise and specific treatment approaches could be developed for female adolescents with AN."
26466149,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26466149/,"OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of the study was to compare analgesia-prescribing practices and timing of analgesia administration between pediatric emergency medicine (PEM) and general emergency medicine (GEM) practitioners for children with appendicitis. The secondary objective was to compare analgesia administration versus triage pain score, pediatric appendicitis score (PAS), and body mass index (BMI).
METHODS: This was a retrospective chart review of patients younger than 21 years who presented to either an urban pediatric emergency department (ED) or 2 general EDs and were diagnosed with appendicitis.
RESULTS: Two hundred eighteen charts were reviewed, 153 (70%) from the pediatric ED and 65 (30%) from the general EDs. The patients seen by PEM physicians were younger than the patients seen by GEM physicians (mean age, 12.8 vs 15.4 years; P = 0.002). The patients evaluated by GEM physicians were more likely to receive analgesia in the ED (82% vs 60%, P = 0.003) and received analgesia sooner (mean, 178 vs 239 minutes; P = 0.026) than the patients evaluated by PEM physicians. The patients with triage pain scores higher than 6 of 10 were more likely to receive analgesia than the patients with pain scores lower than 6 (71% vs 51%, P = 0.015). There was no association between PAS or BMI and analgesia administration or time to analgesia (P = not significant).
CONCLUSIONS: The patients with appendicitis evaluated by GEM physicians were more likely to receive analgesia and receive analgesia quicker than the patients evaluated by PEM physicians. The patients with higher pain scores were more likely to receive analgesia, but PAS and BMI did not affect analgesia administration."
26466387,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26466387/,"INTRODUCTION: It is desirable for patients to play active roles in the choice of renal replacement therapy (RRT). Patient decision aid tools (PDAs) have been developed to allow the patients to choose the option best suited to their individual needs.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: An observational, prospective registry was conducted in 26 Spanish hospitals between September 2010 and May 2012. The results of the patients' choice and the definitive RRT modality were registered through the progressive implementation of an Education Process (EP) with PDAs designed to help Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patients choose RRT.
RESULTS: Patients included in this study: 1044. Of these, 569 patients used PDAs and had made a definitive choice by the end of registration. A total of 88.4% of patients chose dialysis [43% hemodialysis (HD) and 45% peritoneal dialysis (PD)] 3.2% preemptive living-donor transplant (TX), and 8.4% conservative treatment (CT). A total of 399 patients began RRT during this period. The distribution was 93.4% dialysis (53.6% HD; 40% PD), 1.3% preemptive TX and 5.3% CT. The patients who followed the EP changed their mind significantly less often [kappa value of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.86-0.95)] than those who did not follow it, despite starting unplanned treatment [kappa value of 0.85 (95% CI, 0.75-0.95]. A higher agreement between the final choice and a definitive treatment was achieved by the EP and planned patients [kappa value of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.89-0.98)]. Those who did not go through the EP had a much lower index of choosing PD and changed their decision more frequently when starting definitive treatment [kappa value of 0.73 (95% CI, 0.55-0.91)].
CONCLUSIONS: Free choice, assisted by PDAs, leads to a 50/50 distribution of PD and HD choice and an increase in TX choice. The use of PDAs, even with an unplanned start, achieved a high level of concordance between the chosen and definitive modality."
26467002,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26467002/,"BACKGROUND: Multi-vessel disease is frequent in patients presenting with myocardial infarction and have an important prognostic impact. The decision to proceed to revascularization in non-culprit vessels can be postponed until ischemia is proven in non-invasive stress tests. On the other hand, there is an increasing evidence to support the role of fractional flow reserve (FFR) in acute coronary syndrome setting.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case in which a FFR-guided strategy for non-culprit vessels, 3 weeks after an ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, was followed by a short-term sub-occlusion of the evaluated vessel.
CONCLUSION: The timing of the coronary microcirculation recovery post-myocardial infarction, avoiding a possible false negative FFR, and the diagnostic gaps between ischemia and plaque vulnerability are under discussion. An FFR-guided strategy in this setting should be interpreted with caution."
26467165,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26467165/,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Same-day surgery is common for foot surgery. Continuous regional anesthesia for outpatients has been shown effective but the economic impact on the perioperative process-related healthcare costs remains unclear.
METHODS: One hundred twenty consecutive patients were included in this assessor-blinded, prospective cohort study and allocated according to inclusion criteria in the day-care or in the in-patient group. Standardized continuous popliteal sciatic nerve block was performed in both groups for 48 h using an elastomeric pump delivering ropivacaine 0.2 % at a rate of 5 ml/h with an additional 5 ml bolus every 60 min. Outpatients were discharged the day of surgery and followed with standardized telephone interviews. The total direct health costs of both groups were compared. Moreover, the difference in treatment costs and the difference in terms of quality of care and effectiveness between the groups were compared.
RESULTS: Total management costs were significantly reduced in the day-care group. There was no difference between the groups regarding pain at rest and with motion, persistent pain after catheter removal and the incidence of PONV. Persistent motor block and catheter inflammation/infection were comparable in both groups. There was neither a difference in the number of unscheduled ambulatory visits nor in the number of readmissions.
CONCLUSIONS: Day-care continuous regional analgesia leads to an overall positive impact on costs by decreasing the incidence of unplanned ambulatory visits and unscheduled readmissions, without compromising on the quality of analgesia, patients' satisfaction, and safety."
26467342,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26467342/,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to analyse the interaction between patients and GPs in preventive consultations with an emphasis on how patients answer GPs' questions about lifestyle, and the conditions these answers impose on the process of establishing agreement about lifestyle as a problem or not.
DESIGN: Six general practitioners (GPs) video-recorded 15 annual preventive consultations. From these, 32 excerpts of discussions about lifestyle were analysed using conversation analysis (CA).
RESULTS: GPs used an interview format to assess risk in patients' lifestyles. In some cases patients adhered to this format and answered the GPs' questions, but in many cases patients gave what we have termed ""anticipatory answers"". These answers indicate that the patients anticipate a response from their GPs that would highlight problems with their lifestyle. Typically, in an anticipatory answer, patients bypass the interview format to give their own evaluation of their lifestyle and GPs accept this evaluation. In cases of ""no-problem"" answers from patients, GPs usually encouraged patients by adding support for current habits.
CONCLUSION: Patients anticipated that GPs might assess their lifestyles as problematic and they incorporated this possibility into their responses. They thereby controlled the definition of their lifestyle as a problem or not. GPs generally did not use the information provided in these answers as a resource for further discussion, but rather relied on standard interview procedures. Staying within the patients' frame of reference and using the patients' anticipatory answers might provide GPs with a better point of departure for discussion regarding lifestyle."
26467372,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26467372/,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of transesophageal electrophysiologic study (TEEPS) for the determination of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) recurrences in symptomatic and asymptomatic children after successful radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for SVT.
METHODS: A total of 66 patients who underwent TEEPS after successful RFA were included. The demographic features, symptoms of the patients, and the characteristics of the recurrences induced by TEEPS were evaluated. The arrhythmia types induced during RFA were compared with those induced by TEEPS in terms of the compatibility of the diagnosis.
RESULTS: Forty-two (63.6%) girls and 24 (36.4%) boys with a mean age of 11.8±3.4 years were followed-up for 44.1±15.7 months. The average time between RFA and TEEPS was 5.2±5.9 months. The diagnoses during RFA were atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) in 47 of 66 patients, atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) in 18 of 66 patients, and ectopic atrial tachycardia in 1 of 66 patients. SVT was induced by TEEPS in 2 of 25 symptomatic and 5 of 41 asymptomatic patients. The SVT inducibility rate was 5.5% (1/18) and 12.7% (6/47) in patients with AVRT and AVNRT, respectively. In addition, 85.7% (6/7) of all recurrences occurred within 3.5 months. The recurrences as AVNRT in 2 of 25 symptomatic patients occurred in the first month after RFA. AVNRT in 4 of 41 and AVRT in 1 of 41 asymptomatic patients were induced within 3.5 months and 15 months, respectively.
CONCLUSION: TEEPS seems to be a valuable screening and diagnostic method for the determination of recurrence in symptomatic and asymptomatic children who underwent successful RFA."
26467456,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26467456/,"BACKGROUND: This study evaluated breast imaging procedures for predicting pathologic complete response (pCR = ypT0) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) for breast cancer to challenge surgery as a diagnostic procedure after NACT.
METHODS: This retrospective, exploratory, monocenter study included 150 invasive breast cancers treated by NACT. The patients received magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), mammography (MGR), and ultrasound (US). The results were classified in three response subgroups according to response evaluation criteria in solid tumors. To incorporate specific features of MRI and MGR, an additional category [clinical near complete response (near-cCR)] was defined. Residual cancer in imaging and pathology was defined as a positive result. Negative predictive values (NPVs), false-negative rates (FNRs), and false-positive rates (FPRs) of all imaging procedures were analyzed for the whole cohort and for triple-negative (TN), HER2-positive (HER2+), and HER2-negative/hormone-receptor-positive (HER2-/HR+) cancers, respectively.
RESULTS: In 46 cases (31%), pCR (ypT0) was achieved. Clinical complete response (cCR) and near-cCR showed nearly the same NPVs and FNRs. The NPV was highest with 61% for near-cCR in MRI and lowest with 44% for near-cCR in MGR for the whole cohort. The FNRs ranged from 4 to 25% according to different imaging methods. The MRI performance seemed to be superior, especially in TN cancers (NPV 94%; FNR 5%). The lowest FPR was 10 % in MRI, and the highest FPR was 44% in US.
CONCLUSION: Neither MRI nor MGR or US can diagnose a pCR (ypT0) with sufficient accuracy to replace pathologic diagnosis of the surgical excision specimen."
26467551,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26467551/,"AIMS: In the United Kingdom, alcohol warning labels are the subject of a voluntary agreement between industry and government. In 2011, as part of the Public Health Responsibility Deal in England, the industry pledged to ensure that 80% of products would have clear, legible health warning labelling, although an analysis commissioned by Portman found that only 57.1% met best practice. We assessed what proportion of alcohol products now contain the required health warning information, and its clarity and placement.
DESIGN: Survey of alcohol labelling data.
SETTING: United Kingdom.
PARTICIPANTS: Analysis of the United Kingdom's 100 top-selling alcohol brands (n = 156 individual products).
MEASUREMENTS: We assessed the product labels in relation to the presence of five labelling elements: information on alcohol units, government consumption guidelines, pregnancy warnings, reference to the Drinkaware website and a responsibility statement. We also assessed the size, colour and placement of text, and the size and colouring of the pregnancy warning logo.
FINDINGS: The first three (required) elements were present on 77.6% of products examined. The mean font size of the Chief Medical Officer's (CMO) unit guidelines (usually on the back of the product) was 8.17-point. The mean size of pregnancy logos was 5.95 mm. The pregnancy logo was on average smaller on wine containers.
CONCLUSIONS: The UK Public Health Responsibility Deal alcohol labelling pledge has not been fully met. Labelling information frequently falls short of best practice, with font and logos smaller than would be accepted on other products with health effects."

METHOD: We reviewed and analysed patient and contact investigation data from a large outbreak that occurred in Tokyo, Japan, between 2010 and 2012. Relevant data were extracted to create a social matrix, which was then analysed using SNA software to visualise the network and calculate SNA metrics (degree and betweenness) for all patients and contacts. Statistical analyses were conducted to examine whether degree and betweenness centrality scores could prioritise contacts for in-depth investigation by calculating the odds of latent tuberculous infection (LTBI) being diagnosed among contacts with high scores compared to those with low scores.
RESULTS: The data on a total of 8 patients and 376 contacts, of whom 56 were diagnosed with LTBI, were analysed. Centrality scores did not show a statistically significant association with the risk of contacts being diagnosed with LTBI. However, contacts with high betweenness scores were more likely to be diagnosed with LTBI than contacts with lower scores (OR 2.88, 95%CI 1.31-5.83, P = 0.007).
CONCLUSION: Our results showed the potential of a betweenness score in prioritising contacts during TB contact investigation."
26467644,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26467644/,"BACKGROUND: HbA1c ≥ 6.5% has been recommended as a diagnostic criterion for the detection of diabetes mellitus (DM) since 2010 because of its convenience, stability and significant correlation with diabetic complications. Nevertheless, the accuracy of HbA1c compared to glucose-based diagnostic criteria varies among subjects of different ethnicity and risk profile.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of HbA1c for diagnosing DM compared to the diagnosis by oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and the optimal HbA1c level to diagnose DM in primary care Chinese patients with impaired fasting glucose (IFG).
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out in three public primary care clinics in Hong Kong. About 1128 Chinese adults with IFG (i.e. FG level between 5.6 and 6.9 mmol/l in the past 18 months) were recruited to receive paired OGTT and HbA1c tests. Sensitivities and specificities of HbA1c at different threshold levels for predicting DM compared to the diagnosis by OGTT were evaluated. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine the optimal cut-off level.
RESULTS: Among the 1128 subjects (mean age 64.2±8.9 year, 48.8% male), 229 (20.3%) were diagnosed to have DM by OGTT. The sensitivity and specificity of HbA1c ≥6.5% were 33.2% and 93.5%, respectively, for predicting DM diagnosed by OGTT. The area under the ROC curve was 0.770, indicating HbA1c had fair discriminatory power. The optimal cut-off threshold of HbA1c was 6.3% for discriminating DM from non-DM, with sensitivity and specificity of 56.3% and 85.5%, respectively. HbA1c ≥ 5.6% has the highest sensitivity and negative predictive value of 96.1% and 94.5%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: HbA1c ≥ 6.5% is highly specific in identifying people with DM, but it may miss the majority (66.8%) of the DM cases. An HbA1c threshold of <5.6% is more appropriate to be used for the exclusion of DM. OGTT should be performed for the confirmation of DM among Chinese patients with IFG who have an HbA1c between 5.6% and 6.4%."
26467762,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26467762/,"INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to determine the influence on practice of a community of practice designed for public health nutritionists who work with retail stores in remote Indigenous communities in Australia.
METHODS: A descriptive evaluation of the community of practice participants' perspectives using the most significant change technique and individual in-depth interviews was conducted. Data were analysed using thematic and content analysis with a focus on answering the evaluation questions.
RESULTS: Twelve public health nutritionists employed to work with remote Indigenous community stores were involved. The community of practice was reported to develop competence through problem solving, knowledge sharing and building confidence for innovative work. Building competence was achieved through accessible and timely professional support. Sharing stories and being encouraged to reflect on practice was valued and supported the participant's practice. Working to improve the food supply is challenging but there is value in being supported by like-minded colleagues to stay focused on this work.
CONCLUSIONS: Most participants perceived the community of practice intervention to be an effective strategy to improve their work. These findings provide evidence of a promising intervention for building the public health nutrition workforce in remote Indigenous community store retail settings."
26467861,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26467861/,"BACKGROUND: The use of two diagnostic criteria in the current literature has led to some degree of ambiguity in the precise diagnosis of acute kidney injury in pediatric patients undergoing surgery for congenital heart disease. This study aims to determine which criteria is the most accurate diagnostic indicator of acute kidney injury and determine whether the incidence is being overestimated based on the current criteria.
METHODS: This retrospective study consisted of 389 patients with congenital heart disease from birth to 18 years, who underwent cardiac surgery. The statistical tests conducted were the student t test and chi-square test. Outcomes measured included hospital length of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, and mortality.
RESULTS: The incidence rate of acute kidney injury diagnosed by the pediatric Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, and End-Stage Renal Disease (RIFLE) criterion was 56% compared to 24.4% for the Acute Kidney Injury Network criterion. The pediatric RIFLE criterion consists of the following subsets: risk, injury, failure, loss, and end-stage renal disease. Patients classified in the ""risk"" subset of the pediatric RIFLE criterion who failed to meet Acute Kidney Injury Network criterion were compared to patients without acute kidney injury. Comparison of intensive care unit outcomes between these groups lacked statistical significance for all variables except the duration of mechanical ventilation postoperatively.
CONCLUSION: Although recent research in this field identified the pediatric RIFLE criterion as the most sensitive indicator of acute kidney injury, the results of this study suggest the pediatric RIFLE criterion overestimates acute kidney injury incidence and that the Acute Kidney Injury Network criterion is the more accurate diagnostic indicator."
26467902,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26467902/,"OBJECTIVE: This case-series study aimed to determine if there were observable changes in sensory processing for postural control in individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) following physical therapy using hippotherapy (HPOT), or changes in balance and functional gait.
DESIGN: This pre-test non-randomized design study, with follow-up assessment at 6 weeks, included two females and one male (age range 37-60 years) with diagnoses of relapse-remitting or progressive MS. The intervention consisted of twelve 40-min physical therapy sessions which included HPOT twice a week for 6 weeks. Sensory organization and balance were assessed by the Sensory Organization Test (SOT) and Berg Balance Scale (BBS). Gait was assessed using the Functional Gait Assessment (FGA).
RESULTS: Following the intervention period, all three participants showed improvements in SOT (range 1-8 points), BBS (range 2-6 points), and FGA (average 4 points) scores. These improvements were maintained or continued to improve at follow-up assessment. Two of the three participants no longer over-relied on vision and/or somatosensory information as the primary sensory input for postural control, suggesting improved use of sensory information for balance.
CONCLUSION: The results indicate that HPOT may be a beneficial physical therapy treatment strategy to improve balance, functional gait, and enhance how some individuals with MS process sensory cues for postural control. Randomized clinical trials will be necessary to validate results of this study."
26468408,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26468408/,"OBJECTIVE: To quantify the loss of pigmented neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) of autopsy-confirmed Parkinson disease (PD) and incidental Lewy body disease (ILBD) vs age-matched controls (C).
METHODS: Unbiased stereology methods were used to rigorously count number and measure volumes of nigral pigmented neurons in PD, ILBD, and C brains. The obtained stereologic results were correlated with Lewy body (LB), amyloid plaque (AP), neurofibrillary tangle (NFT), and vascular pathology loads assessed in nigral and extranigral regions of each PD, ILBD, and C brain. The stereologic measurements were also correlated to predeath motor and cognitive scores as available for each participant.
RESULTS: A marked nigral neuronal loss (NNL) in PD (-82%) and ILBD (-40%) compared to C (p < 0.0001) was found. While there was significant correlation between NNL and LB in some cortical areas of PD (i.e., olfactory bulb), there were no correlations between NNL and LB, AP, or NFT loads or cerebral infarct volumes in any other examined regions for PD and ILBD brains.
CONCLUSIONS: Using unbiased stereology methods, we show that there is a significant loss and absence of hypertrophic changes in nigral pigmented neurons of ILBD in comparison to C brains. Intriguingly, no significant correlations were found between NNL and LB loads in the SN of both PD and ILBD brains. These autopsy-verified stereologically based findings are novel and support ILBD as a pathologic condition. These results suggest possible new and alternative pathophysiologic hypotheses on the actual relationship between NNL and LB pathology."
26468632,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26468632/,"PURPOSE: For patients hospitalized for a cardiac event, an earlier appointment to outpatient cardiac rehabilitation (CR) increases participation. However, it is unknown what effect hastening CR enrollment might have among employed patients planning to return to work (RTW).
METHODS: Using 2 complementary data sets from Henry Ford Hospital (HFH) and Mayo Clinic, we assessed when employed patients eligible for CR anticipated a RTW, the impact of an earlier appointment on CR enrollment, and the effect of employment status on the number of CR sessions attended. Patients at HFH attended CR at either 8 or 42 days (through randomization), whereas Mayo Clinic patients attended 10 days after hospital discharge per standard routines.
RESULTS: Among 148 patients at HFH, 65 (44%) were employed and planned to RTW. Of these, 67% desired to RTW within 1 to 2 weeks, whereas 28% anticipated an RTW within 1 to 3 days. Home financial strain predicted nonparticipation in CR (P < .001) and was associated with an earlier planned RTW. Among 1030 patients at Mayo Clinic, 393 (38%) were employed. Employed (vs nonemployed) patients enrolled in CR 3.3 days sooner (P < .001), but attended 1.6 fewer CR sessions (P = .04). In employed patients from both health systems, an earlier (vs later) appointment to CR did not result in additional exercise sessions of CR.
CONCLUSIONS: Employed patients plan to RTW quickly, in part because of home finances. They also enroll earlier into CR than nonemployed patients. Despite these findings, earlier appointments do not seem to favorably impact overall CR participation."
26468793,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26468793/,"PURPOSE: The aims of this study were to present our experience in the use of the mirroring tool in computer-aided simulation (CAS) as well as to describe its diversified uses and indications systematically.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2006 and 2012, 144 patients underwent preoperative CAS with mirroring tool developed by our department called Accu-Navi System. Various mirroring methods were performed and classified systemically. The outcome was evaluated thru its performance intraoperatively and the results postoperatively.
RESULTS: The optimal preoperative plans were achieved for all 144 patients using the mirroring tool. This provided the surgeon with accurate surgical information preoperatively and intraoperatively. There were 138 operations performed based on the preoperative plan. The duration of the operations was significantly shortened with improved surgical accuracy and safety. The mean discrepancy was confirmed to be less than 1.0 mm by comparing postoperative computed tomography with the preoperative plan. Postoperative esthetics improved remarkably along with patients' satisfaction without complications thru long-term follow-up evaluations.
CONCLUSIONS: The mirroring tool with its many uses can be a valuable CAS procedure for craniofacial surgery."
26468851,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26468851/,"PURPOSE: Patients may encounter various complications during and after orthognathic surgery. The aim of this study was to compare the prevalence of complications in various skeletal deformities to see if an association exists.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study assessed patients in 2 groups. Group 1 had class III skeletal deformity and group 2 had class II skeletal deformity with vertical maxillary excess (VME). Complications were studied in 2 stages: Stage 1 included perioperative and immediate (first 24 hours) postoperative complications namely difficult intubation, blood transfusion, bad splits, pain, and postoperative airway problems. Stage 2 included postoperative complications (from 24 hours up to 6 months after surgery namely bad splits and relapse). Age, sex, operation time, and the amount of jaw movements were considered as variables. Types of skeletal deformity were predictive factor of the study.
RESULTS: The authors studied 248 patients in 2 groups. In group 1, 13 (8.2%) patients needed blood transfusion during surgery up to 24 hours after operation and 27 (30%) patients in group 2. Analysis of data demonstrated a significant difference for blood transfusion between 2 groups (P = 0.001). In group 1, 8 (5.1%) patients had a difficult intubation compared with 13 (14.4%) patients in group 2.Comparison of mandibular movement and maximum mouth opening (MMO) did not show significant differences between 2 groups (P > 0.05). The amount of maxillary movement and horizontal discrepancy were different statistically in 2 groups (P < 0.05). Analysis of the data showed a significant difference in intubation between the 2 groups (P < 0.05). There were no differences between the 2 groups for bad splits, postoperative airway problems, or paresthesia (P > 0.05). Results did not demonstrate a significant difference for pain between the 2 groups (P > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with class II skeletal deformity and VME may have higher risk of perioperative blood loss and difficult intubation compared with patients with class III skeletal deformity."
26468951,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26468951/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine if the GnRH antagonist protocol is effective in preventing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) in potentially high responders.
METHODS: A total of 660 IVF-ET/ICSI cycles were retrospectively identified. The inclusion criterion was age ≤ 30 years. Cycles were divided into two groups: a GnRHa group and a GnRHant group. In the GnRHa group, the patients received one single injection of 1.0mg-1.3mg Triptorelin in previous mid-luteal phase. In the GnRHant group, a daily dose of 0.25 mg Cetrotide was initiated when a lead follicle obtained a mean diameter of 14 mm, continued up until the day of hCG administration. The duration of stimulation, total dose of Gn, implantation rate, pregnancy rate, and OHSS rate were compared.
RESULTS: The duration of stimulation, E2 level on hCG day, numbers of oocytes retrieved, MII oocytes, and high-quality embryos in the GnRHa group were all significantly more than those in the GnRHant group. In the GnRHa group, 83.53% of cancelled fresh-transferred cycles were cancelled because of high risk of OHSS, which was significantly higher than that in the GnRHant group (43.55%, P<0.05). The incidence of OHSS in the GnRHa group was slightly higher than that in the GnRHant group. The implantation and clinical pregnancy rates in the GnRHa group were significantly higher than those in the GnRHant group (37.36% VS 19.25%, 62.78% VS 31.06%; P<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that for potentially high responders, the GnRHant protocol can, to some extent, lower the cancellation and incidence rates of OHSS. The GnRHa protocol was superior to the GnRHant protocol in terms of implantation and clinical pregnancy rates."

We examined whether exposure to prenatal maternal depression, a condition associated with high glucocorticoids, carries greater risk for depression at 12 and 18 years in girls.
METHODS: Our sample comprised 7959 mothers and children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children following imputation for missing data. Maternal depression was assessed pre-and post-natally, and offspring depression at ages 12 and 18. We used logistic regression models to examine the relationship between exposure to prenatal and postnatal depression and offspring depression at 18 and 12 and interactions with gender.
RESULTS: There was an interaction between prenatal depression and gender (P=0.027) and between postnatal depression and gender (P=0.027) for offspring depression at 18. Following adjustment in pre-natally depressed mothers, the odds ratio for offspring depression at 18 was 1.55 (95% c.i. 1.03-2.34) for girls and 0.54 (0.23-1.26) for boys. In post-natally depressed mothers, the odds ratio for offspring depression at 18 was 1.15 (0.70-1.89) in girls and 3.13 (1.52-6.45) in boys. However there was no evidence for interaction between prenatal or postnatal depression and gender (P=0.559 and 0.780 respectively) for offspring depression at 12.
LIMITATIONS: As expected with this large cohort spanning over 18 years, there was loss-to-follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first evidence in humans that increased vulnerability of female fetuses to maternal stress responses during pregnancy persists into adolescence. One explanation for gender differences emerging later is more depressive symptomatology is attributed to heritable risk at 12, whereas biological processes involved in brain development at 18 may be influenced by foetal programming. If replicated, this study has potential to help understand intergenerational transmission of depression, a leading cause of morbidity worldwide."

METHODS: Participants exercised for 8 weeks (3 weekly sessions: 10 × 60 sec HIIT) on a cycle ergometer supervised by medical staff. Prior to the intervention and after the last HIIT session, venous blood samples were collected.
RESULTS: Circulating omentin-1 concentrations increased significantly in both the CON-group (p = 0.003) and in the T2D-group (p = 0.002). Pentraxin-3 (p = 0.010) and IL-1ra (p = 0.031) levels increased significantly in the CON-group. Plasma FFA in the T2D-group was significantly reduced after 60 min (p = 0.011). Post HIIT area under curve of circulating FFAs was reduced by -17.73 ± 6.99% (p = 0.041) in the T2D-group.

26469715,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26469715/,"OBJECTIVE: External ventriculostomy-related infection (VRI) of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a source of significant morbidity and mortality. In previous trials, antibiotic-impregnated ventricular catheters have been associated with lower incidence of CSF infections. We undertook this retrospective observational study to evaluate whether the introduction of antibiotic-impregnated external ventricular drains (EVDs) in 2004 has decreased VRI in our neurosurgical unit.
METHOD: One hundred and fifteen patients underwent insertion of EVDs from January 2000 to March 2008. Data were collected for 99 patients with a total of 146 EVD insertions. The parameters studied were age, gender, ASA score, seniority of the surgeon, significant medical history, presence of trauma, concurrent surgeries, revisional surgery, use of peri-operative systemic antibiotic, use of antibiotic-impregnated external ventricular catheter, tunnelling of the catheter, duration of drainage and VRIs.
RESULTS: Eleven patients developed new VRI (12%). Analysis comparing infection incidence for various co-morbidities shows that systemic sepsis was associated with higher infection rates (p = 0.037). Revisional surgery (p = 0.036) and longer duration of catheterization (p = 0.001) were also found to be associated with VRI. The Standard catheters and the antibiotic-impregnated catheters had similar infection rates. The antibiotic-impregnated catheters tended to be infection-free for longer but these differences were not statistically significant. The duration of catheterization was significantly higher for the antibiotic-impregnated catheter group. In both groups, the majority of infections were caused by Gram-positive bacteria.
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that there was no statistically significant difference in the infection rates for the Standard and antibiotic-impregnated external ventriculostomy catheters. The duration of catheterization was significantly higher for the Antibiotic-impregnated catheter group. The antibiotic-impregnated catheter infections tended to occur later as compared with the Standard catheter group."
26469796,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26469796/,"PURPOSE: To determine whether triple-arterial phase acquisition with fluoroscopic triggering can provide both well-timed early and late hepatic arterial phase (HAP) images more frequently than when using a fixed-time delay during gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Written informed consent was obtained for this Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved prospective, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant study. Ninety patients underwent gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI at 3T with a single-breath-hold triple-arterial phase acquisition using either a fixed-time delay (n = 45) or fluoroscopic triggering injection protocol (n = 45). Three radiologists, blinded to method of timing and other data, independently determined whether well-timed early or late HAP were obtained for each arterial phase image set and assessed for transient severe motion (TSM). Rates of successful HAP acquisitions and of TSM were compared between the two protocols using χ(2) or Fisher's exact test.
RESULTS: The rate of successful acquisition of late HAP images was similar in the two groups (93% [42/45] for fixed-time delay vs. 98% [44/45] for fluoroscopic triggering, P = 0.62). There was a trend toward higher rates of successful acquisition of both early and late HAP images in the fluoroscopic triggering group (69% [31/45] vs. 49% [22/45], P = 0.05). TSM occurred in five patients (6% [5/90]) and at similar frequencies in the two groups (2% [1/45] vs. 9% [4/45], P = 0.36).
CONCLUSION: Triple-arterial phase acquisition with fluoroscopic triggering tended to provide both well-timed early and late HAP images more frequently than when using a fixed-time delay during gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI."
26469887,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26469887/,"AIM: This study explored the clinical and economic impact of clinical pharmacological advice (CPA) (based on therapeutic drug monitoring [TDM] results, and on patients' characteristics and co-medications) on personalized linezolid therapy in a tertiary care hospital.
METHODS: A 1 year retrospective analysis of quality indicators of CPA (clinicians' adherence rate to CPA, pre-post rate of linezolid trough concentrations within the desired range and cost balance analysis) was conducted.
RESULTS: Five hundred and forty-four CPAs were provided to clinicians during 2014 for personalizing linezolid therapy in 168 patients. Clinicians' adherence to CPAs was very high (94.7%). The pre-post rate of linezolid Cmin distribution showed a favourable impact of CPA on patient care (pre-post ratio of Cmin within the desired range + 23.4%, pre, 51.2% vs. post, 74.6%). Overall, linezolid dosage was mainly reduced (56.9% of cases), whereas dose augmentation was needed only in a minority of cases (7.7%). Cost balance analysis showed that overall 1258 standard doses of linezolid (unitary dose 600 mg) were spared for treating 168 patients with a personalized dosage for a median duration of 11 days (range 3-128 days) with a cost saving of 60038.05 €.
CONCLUSION: Active computerized advice elaborated by the clinical pharmacologist on the basis of TDM results and of patient's pathophysiological data and co-medications may be cost-effective for personalizing linezolid treatment."
26470011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26470011/,"OBJECTIVES: Controversy is continuing over the need for ventilation and the optimal compression-ventilation (CV) ratio during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The aim of this study was to comparatively elucidate the effect on hemodynamics and arterial oxygen saturation of a single ventilation relative to two consecutive ventilations during CPR in a dog model of cardiac arrest.
METHODS: Twenty mongrel dogs were divided into two groups. After 3 minutes of ventricular fibrillation (VF), the single-ventilation group received CPR with a 30:1 CV ratio, and the two-ventilation group received CPR with a 30:2 CV ratio, all with room air for 7 minutes. Thereafter, continuous chest compressions and intermittent ventilation at rate of 10 per minute were followed for both groups for 10 minutes. Hemodynamic parameters, arterial blood gas profiles, and variables from CPR were compared at baseline and at 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes after induction of VF.
RESULTS: Hemodynamic parameters including aortic systolic and diastolic pressures, right atrial systolic and diastolic pressures, coronary perfusion pressure, end-tidal carbon dioxide tension, and arterial blood gas profiles including arterial oxygen tension, arterial oxygen saturation, and arterial carbon dioxide tension were not different between two groups during CPR. In the 30:1 group, the period of compression interruption was shorter and chest compression fraction was higher than that in the 30:2 group (6 sec/min vs. 10.9 sec/min, p < 0.001; 90.0% vs. 81.8%, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: CPR with a 30:1 CV ratio, compared to CPR with a 30:2 CV ratio, results in comparable arterial oxygenation saturation and hemodynamics."

METHODS: A literature search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, CNKI and ClinicalTrials.gov up to May 2015. Two reviewers independently evaluated titles and abstracts, extracted data and assessed quality. We included studies that compared the IVF/ICSI outcomes of CCS-based embryo selection with those of the traditional morphological method. Relative risk (RR) values with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated in RevMan 5.3, and subgroup analysis and Begg's test were used to assess heterogeneity and potential publication bias, respectively.
RESULTS: Four RCTs and seven cohort studies were included. A meta-analysis of the outcomes showed that compared to morphological criteria, euploid embryos identified by CCS were more likely to be successfully implanted (RCT RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.18-1.47; cohort study RR 1.74, 95% CI 1.35-2.24). CCS-based PGS was also related to an increased clinical pregnancy rate (RCT RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.83-1.93; cohort study RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.20-1.83), an increased ongoing pregnancy rate (RCT RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.64-2.66; cohort study RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.30-2.00), and an increased live birth rate (RCT RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.05-1.50; cohort study RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.85-2.13) as well as a decreased miscarriage rate (RCT RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.24-1.15; cohort study RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.21-0.46) and a decreased multiple pregnancy rate (RCT RR 0.02, 95% CI 0.00-0.26; cohort study RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.07-0.51). The results of the subgroup analysis also showed a significantly increased implantation rate in the CCS group.
CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of CCS-based PGS is comparable to that of traditional morphological methods, with better outcomes for women receiving IVF/ICSI technology. The transfer of both trophectoderm-biopsied and blastomere-biopsied CCS-euploid embryos can improve the implantation rate."
26470697,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26470697/,"BACKGROUND: Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is rare among the different gastrointestinal cancers with a significant global variation in incidence. High cholecystectomy rates on benign indications have been assumed to prevent the development of gallbladder cancer. The aim of the present study was to explore the relationship between the rate of cholecystectomy at different time periods and regions of the country and the annual incidence of GBC.
METHODS: Standardized cholecystectomy and GBC incidences for Swedish counties have been obtained from the Swedish national inpatient and National Cancer registries for the years 1998–2013. The incidences have been calculated for ages over 15 years and per 100,000 population. The relationships between cholecystectomy and GBC incidences have been analyzed using regression models. Correlation analyses were performed for the total cumulative incidence rates as well as the incidence rates calculated for the first and last 8 years of the entire study period.
RESULTS: Cholecystectomy rates ranged from 99 to 205 per 100,000 and year, and the GBC incidence from 2.3 to 5.1. Overall, we observed a slow but steady decline in cholecystectomy rates—as well as GBC incidences during the 16-year period. No significant correlation between the cholecystectomy rates and GBC incidences was seen.
CONCLUSIONS: This nationwide population-based study demonstrates substantial geographic differences in annual cholecystectomy rates without any significant inverse co-variation between cholecystectomy rates and the ensuing GBC incidence which would have supported the idea that frequent cholecystectomy affects the incidence of GBC."
26470742,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26470742/,"BACKGROUND: Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an autoimmune bleeding disorder, which occurs as a result of autoantibodies attachment to the platelets surface and subsequent destruction. Several organisms can mimic features of human antigens (Ags) and induce autoantibody production. One of these organisms is Helicobacter pylori (HP). We assessed the prevalence and relationship of HP infection with ITP in a population of children.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and six children younger than 18 years old were enrolled in this case-control study in which 42 children with ITP were in the case group and 64 healthy children were in the control group. Stool exam for detection of HP-Ag were performed and the variables were compared between the two groups.
RESULTS: Mean ± standard deviation age of case and control group was 6.4 ± 3.4 and 8.6 ± 4.4 years old, respectively. HP stool Ag differ significantly between the case and the control groups (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Our results support the role of HP in ITP of children, and urea breath test or Ag detection of HP in stool of these patients is recommended."
26470801,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26470801/,"INTRODUCTION: Total hip arthroplasty (THA) can bring about complications - particularly leg length differences - that are becoming increasingly litigious. Computer-assisted orthopedic surgery (CAOS) can help optimize the procedure, but its ability to effectively restore leg length is controversial. As a consequence, we carried out a study to determine: (1) its contribution to meeting leg length and offset objectives, (2) its reliability, by evaluating the correlation between radiological and navigation data, (3) its safety, by evaluating navigation-specific and non-specific complications.
HYPOTHESIS: CAOS will help to restore leg length within ± 5 mm in more than 80% of cases.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A series of 321 continuous cases of cementless THA implanted through the posterolateral approach using CAOS was analyzed retrospectively. With a minimum 1 year follow-up, we evaluated whether the leg length and offset goals were achieved, how well the navigation and radiology data were correlated and whether navigation-specific and non-specific complications occurred. Based on our hypothesis that 80% of patients would have less than 5 mm leg length difference and the null hypothesis (PA = P0) with an alpha of 0.05, 200 observations were required to achieve a power of 90%.
RESULTS: The leg length and offset objectives were achieved in 83.3% and 88% of cases, respectively. Twenty-two patients required a heel wedge to compensate for leg length differences. The correlation between the radiology and surgical navigation data was satisfactory - the Pearson coefficient was 0.79 for length and 0.74 for offset. Intraoperative and postoperative complications or adverse events were found in 14.6% of cases; these were specific to CAOS in 12.1% of cases and non-specific in 2.5% of cases.
CONCLUSION: This study shows the relevance of CAOS for achieving preoperative leg length objectives, with good correlation between navigation and radiology data, and without major complications.

26470825,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26470825/,"BACKGROUND: Recent policy changes by insurance companies have been instituted to encourage vaginal hysterectomy (VH) as the preferred route for removal of the uterus. It is not known if advantages of VH for benign indications apply to women with gynecologic cancer.
OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to assess trends in surgical approach to hysterectomy among gynecologic cancer patients and to evaluate outcomes by approach. We hypothesized that, among gynecologic oncology patients, postoperative complications and hospital stay would differ by surgical approach, and that advantages of VH for benign indications may not apply to gynecologic cancer patients.
STUDY DESIGN: We performed a population-based retrospective cohort study of cervical, endometrial, or ovarian/fallopian tube cancer patients treated surgically in Washington State from 2004 through 2013 using the Comprehensive Hospital Abstract Reporting System. Surgery was categorized as abdominal hysterectomy (AH), laparoscopic hysterectomy (LH), or VH. We determined rate of surgical approach by year and the association with length of stay, 30-day readmission rate, and perioperative complications.
RESULTS: We identified 10,117 patients who underwent surgery for gynecologic cancer, with 346 (3.4%) VH, 2698 (26.7%) LH, and 7073 (69.9%) AH. Patients undergoing AH had more comorbidities than patients with VH or LH (Charlson Comorbidity Index ≥2: 11.3%, 7.9%, and 8.1%, respectively; P < .001). From 2004 through 2013 AH and VH declined (94.4-47.9% and 4.4-0.8%, respectively; P < .001) while LH increased from 1.2-51.4% in 2013 (P < .001). Mean length of stay was 4.6 days for women undergoing AH and was 1.9 days shorter for VH (95% confidence interval, 1.6-2.3 days) and 2.6 days shorter for LH (95% confidence interval, 2.4-2.7 days) (P < .001). Risk of 30-day readmission for patients undergoing LH was 40% less likely compared to AH but not different for VH vs AH.
CONCLUSION: AH and LH remain the preferred routes for hysterectomy in gynecologic oncology. Over the past decade, there has been a significant shift to LH with lower 30-day readmission and complication rates. There may be a limited role for VH in select patients. Current efforts to standardize the surgical approach to hysterectomy should not apply to patients with known or suspected gynecologic cancer."

METHODS: In this study, L. major isolated from a man who 18 years old, living in Bitlis province of Turkey. This strain also was utilized to infect gerbils. A total of 1 × 10(8)/mL promastigotes were inoculated to 10 gerbils. Necropsy was performed on infected gerbils for monitoring the visceralization tendency of the parasites. Tissue samples were prepared from each animal and stained by Giemsa and inoculated into NNN culture. However, a real-time PCR assay was performed to confirm the infection the clinical material.
RESULTS: Examination of Giemsa-stained tissue smears showed that infected animals with L.major were positive for Leishmania amastigotes in all tissues at the first month post infection and Leishmania promastigotes were cultured at 26°C in culture flasks containing NNN. Melting curve analyses of ribozomal internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS-1) PCR showed the peak concordant with L. major.
CONCLUSION: As a result, the present study confirmed by both Giemsa-stained smears and PCR, visceralization and dissemination of L. major amastigotes, the principal cause of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis in gerbils."
26471452,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26471452/,"BACKGROUND: Conversations eliciting patient preferences about cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) are among the most common examples of informed consent. However, this is rarely recognized and therefore may not include all key elements of informed consent, namely, details and benefits of the procedure, significant risks involved, likelihood of the outcome, and alternative therapeutic options.
OBJECTIVE: Assess the content of code status discussions as reported by residents to examine whether residents meet requirements of informed consent.
DESIGN: Prospective, observational, single-center survey study.
SETTING: Internal medicine residents at an academic medical center.
INTERVENTION: Medicine residents were surveyed and data were anonymously collected.
MEASUREMENTS: Content of code status discussions and knowledge of CPR outcomes.
RESULTS: Among 100 respondents, 66% have code status discussions with most patients upon hospital admission. Two main barriers to discussing code status were lack of time (49%) and lack of rapport (29%). Only 8% reported discussing all 5 elements of informed consent. Less than 10% of the residents correctly answered questions testing knowledge regarding outcomes after cardiac arrest. In logistical regression analyses, residents who included all key elements of informed consent reported more confidence that they provided the information needed for patients to make an informed decision (odds ratio 1.7 [95% confidence interval: 1.2-2.3]).
CONCLUSIONS: Resident conversations regarding CPR are insufficient in the 5 key elements of informed consent. Framing code status discussions as examples of informed consent may be an effective strategy for educating residents or may improve the quality of these discussions, potentially leading to better patient decisions."
26471690,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26471690/,"UNLABELLED: With the increasing availability of integrated PET/MR scanners, the utility and need for MR contrast agents for combined scans is questioned. The purpose of our study was to evaluate whether administration of gadolinium chelates is necessary for evaluation of pediatric tumors on (18)F-FDG PET/MR images.
METHODS: First, in 119 pediatric patients with primary and secondary tumors, we used 14 diagnostic criteria to compare the accuracy of several MR sequences: unenhanced T2-weighted fast spin-echo imaging; unenhanced diffusion-weighted imaging; and-before and after gadolinium chelate contrast enhancement-T1-weighted 3-dimensional spoiled gradient echo LAVA (liver acquisition with volume acquisition) imaging. Next, in a subset of 36 patients who had undergone (18)F-FDG PET within 3 wk of MRI, we fused the PET images with the unenhanced T2-weighted MR images (unenhanced (18)F-FDG PET/MRI) and the enhanced T1-weighted MR images (enhanced (18)F-FDG PET/MRI). Using the McNemar test, we compared the accuracy of the two types of fused images using the 14 diagnostic criteria. We also evaluated the concordance between (18)F-FDG avidity and gadolinium chelate enhancement. The standard of reference was histopathologic results, surgical notes, and follow-up imaging.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference in diagnostic accuracy between the unenhanced and enhanced MR images. Accordingly, there was no significant difference in diagnostic accuracy between the unenhanced and enhanced (18)F-FDG PET/MR images. (18)F-FDG avidity and gadolinium chelate enhancement were concordant in 30 of the 36 patients and 106 of their 123 tumors.
CONCLUSION: Gadolinium chelate administration is not necessary for accurate diagnostic characterization of most solid pediatric malignancies on (18)F-FDG PET/MR images, with the possible exception of focal liver lesions."

Whether melatonin concentration changes in neonatal sepsis and whether it can be used as a marker of sepsis is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to evaluate melatonin concentration in the serum as a marker for neonatal sepsis and compare it to standard markers.
STUDY DESIGN: We prospectively studied 40 neonates: 20 diagnosed with late neonatal sepsis and 20 healthy neonates as a control group. Markers of sepsis and melatonin concentration were compared between both groups.
RESULTS: The sepsis groups had significantly increased immature to total neutrophils ratio (I/T ratio), and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (HsCRP), and decreased platelet count. Melatonin concentration was increased in sepsis group when compared to control group (27.2 ± 3.3 versus 11.4 ± 3.2 pg/ml, p = 0.001), and positively correlated with HsCRP (r = 0.952, p = 0.001) and I/T ratio (r = 0.326, p = 0.015). Combining melatonin to HsCRP increased sensitivity and specificity to detect neonatal sepsis to 97.3 and 93.3%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Endogenous melatonin concentration is increased in late neonatal sepsis and can potentially be used as a marker for sepsis especially when combined with CRP."

METHODS: ARVC and NICM patients with two substrate maps of the same diseased ventricle with an interprocedural delay of ≥12 months were included. Disease progression was defined as ≥1 factor: scar area progression (PROG, +5%), ventricular remodeling (dilatation [+25 mL] or decreased ejection fraction [-5%EF]). Incomplete ablation was defined as index VT recurrence or ablation in previously unablated regions inside index scar without PROG.

Disease progression occurred in 75% with ventricular remodeling in 70%: ventricular dilation in 45% (ARVC [71%]; NICM [38%]), decreased EF in 60% [RVEF in ARVC (71%); LVEF in NICM (54%)], and scar progression in 50% (in ARVC [57%] and NICM [46%]). Index VT recurrence was observed in 40%. Redo ablation sites were located in previously unablated regions inside the index scar in 70% of patients. VT recurrence following the second procedure was seen in 25%. Fifteen percent died during a follow-up of 17 ± 17 months.
CONCLUSION: Disease progression is the rule in ARVC and NICM while scar progression occurs in half. However, even if disease progression is frequently observed, incomplete index ablation is the most common finding, strongly suggesting the need for more extensive ablation."
26472197,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26472197/,"BACKGROUND: There is growing recognition that ""nutrition-sensitive"" development is necessary to ensure nutrition security and reduce malnutrition. While agriculture has the potential to be a strong driver of malnutrition reduction and serves as the main source of livelihood for approximately two-thirds of East Africa's population, its potential to reduce malnutrition is currently not being realized.
OBJECTIVE: Leveraging Agriculture for Nutrition in East Africa is a research study based in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Uganda that seeks to understand the enabling environment necessary for optimizing the contribution of the food and agriculture sector to nutrition outcomes. Its objectives were to explore stakeholder perceptions of nutrition-agriculture linkages, of political and institutional challenges and opportunities, of evidence that is available and influential for policy making, and of key issues with regard to capacity.
METHODS: Open-ended and semistructured interviews were conducted with 53 stakeholders from government, civil society, donors, United Nations organizations, private sector, and research/academic institutions in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Uganda in 2014.
RESULTS: Although policy opportunities and contexts are different between the 3 countries, stakeholders identified similar barriers to greater action, including a narrow focus on solely market-oriented and staple crop production, a lack of clarity and incentives within the agriculture sector about improving nutrition and how to translate policy into action, and lack of capacity in human and financial resources. Many actions to improve the nutrition sensitivity of agriculture were mentioned, including crop diversification, value chain activities and improved market access, nutrition education, and reduction in time and labor costs to women.
CONCLUSION: Many opportunities exist to strengthen the impact of agriculture on nutrition in East Africa, but stronger formulation and implementation of policies will require adequate human resources, funds, timely data on the context, sector alignment on priority actions, and alignment on a framework or indicators for accountability."

OBJECTIVE: To examine the ""childhood monitoring of naevus density"" approach suggested some 10 years ago in a routine setting of mandatory pre-school examinations.
METHODS: Data were collected between 1999 and 2005 in Göttingen, Wolfenbüttel, Northeim, Salzgitter, and Erlangen. Besides basic data, freckling, iris and hair colour, and ""Fitzpatrick skin type"" as well as counts of melanocytic naevi were documented. Negative binomial regression analysis quantified the association between naevus counts and above factors, and year and site of examination, respectively.
RESULTS: Of 12,809 children examined at five different sites over a period of 6 years, 11,345 were eligible for the analysis. While differences between sites were marked and significant, only a very minute, albeit significant, decrease in risk was found between the reference group (Göttingen 1999/2000) and the last year examined in Göttingen (2005).
CONCLUSIONS: Significant between-site variation in the analysis adjusted for constitutional factors points to problems with standardization; thus, a broad application of this instrument does not seem to be advisable."
26472565,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26472565/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the ability of the new American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk algorithm in detecting high cardiovascular (CV) risk, RA patients identified by carotid ultrasonography (US) were compared with Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) and QRisk II algorithms.
METHODS: SCORE, QRisk II, 2013 ACC/AHA 10-year ASCVD risk and EULAR recommended modified versions were calculated in 216 RA patients. In sonographic evaluation, carotid intima-media thickness >0.90 mm and/or carotid plaques were used as the gold standard test for subclinical atherosclerosis and high CV risk (US+).
RESULTS: Eleven (5.1%), 15 (6.9%) and 44 (20.4%) patients were defined as having high CV risk according to SCORE, QRisk II and ACC/AHA 10-year ASCVD risk, respectively. Fifty-two (24.1%) patients were US + and of those, 8 (15.4%), 7 (13.5%) and 23 (44.2%) patients were classified as high CV risk according to SCORE, QRisk II and ACC/AHA 10-year ASCVD risk, respectively. The ACC/AHA 10-year ASCVD risk index better identified US + patients than SCORE and QRisk II (P < 0.0001). With EULAR modification, reclassification from moderate to high risk occurred only in two, five and seven patients according to SCORE, QRisk II and ACC/AHA 10-year ASCVD risk, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The 2013 ACC/AHA 10-year ASCVD risk estimator was better than the SCORE and QRisk II indices in RA, but still failed to identify 55% of high risk patients. Furthermore adjustment of threshold and EULAR modification did not work well."
26472585,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26472585/,"BACKGROUND: Patients with pelvic ring displacement and instability can benefit from surgical reduction and instrumentation to stabilize the pelvis and improve functional outcomes. Current treatments include iliosacral screw or transsacral-transiliac screw, which provides greater biomechanical stability. However, controversy exists regarding the effects of placement of a screw across an uninjured sacroiliac joint for pelvis stabilization after trauma.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: Does transsacral-transiliac screw fixation of an uninjured sacroiliac joint increase pain and worsen functional outcomes at minimum 1-year followup compared with patients undergoing standard iliosacral screw fixation across the injured sacroiliac joint in patients who have sustained pelvic trauma?
METHODS: All patients between ages 18 and 84 years who sustained injuries to the pelvic ring (AO/OTA 61 A, B, C) who were surgically treated between 2011 and 2013 at an academic Level I trauma center were identified for selection. We included patients with unilateral sacroiliac disruption or sacral fractures treated with standard iliosacral screws across an injured hemipelvis and/or transsacral-transiliac screws placed in the posterior ring. Transsacral-transiliac screws were generally more likely to be used in patients with vertically unstable sacral injuries of the posterior ring as a result of previous reports of failures or in osteopenic patients. We excluded patients with bilateral posterior pelvic ring injuries, fixation with a device other than a screw, previous pelvic or acetabular fractures, associated acetabular fractures, and ankylosing spondylitis. Of the 110 patients who met study criteria, 53 (44%) were available for followup at least 12 months postinjury. Sixty patients were unable to be contacted by phone or mail and seven declined to participate in the study. Outcomes were obtained by members of the research team using the visual analog scale (VAS) pain score for both posterior sacroiliac joints, Short Musculoskeletal Functional Assessment (SMFA), and Majeed scores. Patients completed the forms by themselves when able to return to the clinic. A phone interview was performed for others after they received the outcome forms by mail or email.
RESULTS: There were no differences between iliosacral and transsacral-transiliac in terms of VAS injured (2.9 ± 2.9 versus 3.0 ± 2.8, mean difference = 0.1 [95% confidence interval, -1.6 to 1.7], p = 0.91), VAS uninjured (1.8 ± 2.4 versus 2.0 ± 2.6, mean difference = 0.2 [-1.3 to 1.6], p = 0.82), Majeed (80.3 ± 19.9, 79.3 ± 17.5, mean difference = 1.0 [-11.6 to 9.6], p = 0.92), SMFA Function (22.8 ± 22.2, 21.0 ± 17.6, mean difference = 1.8 [-13.2 to 9.6], p = 0.29, and SMFA Bother (24.3 ± 23.8, 29.7 ± 23.4, mean difference = 5.4 [-7.8 to 18.6], p = 0.42).
CONCLUSIONS: Placement of fixation across a contralateral, uninjured sacroiliac joint resulted in no differences in pain and function when compared with standard iliosacral screw placement across an injured hemipelvis at least 1 year after instrumentation. When needed for biomechanical stability, transsacral-transiliac fixation across an uninjured sacroiliac joint can be used without expectation of positive or negative effects on pain or functional outcomes at minimum 1-year followup.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, therapeutic study."
26472587,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26472587/,"BACKGROUND: Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are commonly used by healthcare providers as means of assessing health-related quality of life and function at any given time. The complexity of PROMs can differ and when combined with varying degrees of adult literacy, error can be introduced if patients fail to understand questions. With an average adult literacy level of 11-year-old students in the United Kingdom, it is unclear to what degree PROMs can be read and understood by most patients (readability); to our knowledge, this has not been evaluated.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We wished to determine the readability of commonly used PROMs in orthopaedic surgery, as assessed by a validated tool that measures the complexity of the language in these surveys.
METHODS: We performed a MEDLINE search to identify the most-commonly reported PROMs in orthopaedic research. One hundred twenty-one PROMs were identified and reviewed by 19 attending orthopaedic surgeons at our institution. Fifty-nine were selected as the most commonly used in our department. Of these, 52 (78%) were disease specific and included: 12 (20%) knee, 10 (17%) shoulder, seven (12%) spine, six (10%) hip, five (8%) foot and ankle, four (7%) elbow, three (5%) pelvis, three (5%) hand and wrist, and two (3%) lower limb. The remaining seven (12%) PROMs were general health questionnaires. The Flesch Reading Ease Score is a validated readability tool measuring average sentence length and syllables per word. It is expressed on a scale from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating easier reading. We extracted the text from each PROM and inserted it in the same online Flesch Reading Ease Score calculator to generate a score.
RESULTS: The mean readability score was 55 (range, 0-93), corresponding to text best understood by 16- to 18-year-old students (11th-12th grades). Twenty-nine PROMs (49%) scored less than 60, classifying them as at least fairly difficult to read. Eight (14%) scored less than 30, best understood by university graduates. Only seven of 59 PROMs analyzed scored greater than 79, corresponding to text that can be understood by the average UK adult.
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of PROMs analyzed are written at a level that is incomprehensible to the average UK adult.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This issue needs to be addressed if we are to continue basing our research conclusions on outcome scores. The information obtained is useful for patients to understand their musculoskeletal health, governmental agencies allocating healthcare resources, provision of management guidelines, and as a link to other data sets, such as hospital episodes statistics. Accurate and reliable data can be obtained only if patients who complete these evaluations are able to read and understand the questions asked."
26473326,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26473326/,"OBJECTIVE: In spite of successful treatment of immune-mediated arthritis, many patients still experience pain. We undertook this study to investigate whether antigen-induced arthritis (AIA) in rats triggers neuronal changes in sensory neurons that outlast the inflammatory process.
METHODS: We induced unilateral AIA in the knee joint and assessed in sensory neurons the expression of CREB, a transcription factor that regulates genes involved in neuronal plasticity. We tested whether neutralization of the effects of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) by etanercept or infliximab or neutralization of the effects of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) by anakinra influences the up-regulation of phospho-CREB, and we studied the up-regulation of phospho-CREB by IL-1β and TNF in cultured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons.
RESULTS: Unilateral AIA caused bilateral up-regulation of phospho-CREB in lumbar DRG neurons. While inflammation and pain subsided within 21 days, the up-regulation of phospho-CREB still persisted on day 42. At this time point mechanical hyperalgesia at the knee reappeared in the absence of swelling. TNF neutralization during AIA significantly reduced pain-related behavior but did not prevent phospho-CREB up-regulation. In contrast, anakinra, which only reduced thermal hyperalgesia, prevented phospho-CREB up-regulation, suggesting a role of IL-1β in this process. In cultured DRG neurons the application of IL-1β significantly enhanced phospho-CREB.
CONCLUSION: Immune-mediated arthritis causes neuroplastic changes in sensory neurons that outlast the inflammatory phase. Such changes may facilitate the persistence or recurrence of pain after remission of arthritis. IL-1β is an important trigger in this process, although its neutralization barely reduced mechanical hyperalgesia during inflammation."

METHODS: Female healthy volunteer university students randomly assigned into two groups. Group 1 followed a pilates program for an hour two times a week. Group 2 continued daily activities as control group. Dynamic and static balance were evaluated by Sport Kinesthetic Ability Trainer (KAT) 4000 device. Hamstring flexibility and abdominal endurance were determined by sit-and-reach test, curl-up test respectively. Pressure biofeedback unit (PBU) was used to measure transversus abdominis and lumbar muscle activity. The physical activity of the participants was followed by International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form.
RESULTS: Twenty-three subjects in pilates group and 24 control subjects completed the study. In pilates group, statistical significant improvements were observed in curl-up, sit-and-reach test, PBU scores at sixth week (P<0.001), and KAT static and dynamic balance scores (P<0.001), waist circumference (P=0.007) at eighth week. In the comparison between two groups, there were significant improvements in pilates group for sit-and-reach test (P=0.01) and PBU scores (P<0.001) at sixth week, additionally curl-up and static KAT scores progressed in eighth week (P<0.001). No correlation was found between flexibility, endurance, trunk muscle activity and balance parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: An eight-week pilates training program has been found to have beneficial effect on static balance, flexibility, abdominal muscle endurance, abdominal and lumbar muscle activity. These parameters have no effect on balance."
26474230,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26474230/,"OBJECTIVE: Adverse events occur in up to 10% of obstetric cases, and up to one half of these could be prevented. Case reviews and root cause analysis using a structured tool may help health care providers to learn from adverse events and to identify trends and recurring systems issues. We sought to establish the reliability of a root cause analysis computer application called Standardized Clinical Outcome Review (SCOR).
METHODS: We designed a mixed methods study to evaluate the effectiveness of the tool. We conducted qualitative content analysis of five charts reviewed by both the traditional obstetric quality assurance methods and the SCOR tool. We also determined inter-rater reliability by having four health care providers review the same five cases using the SCOR tool.
RESULTS: The comparative qualitative review revealed that the traditional quality assurance case review process used inconsistent language and made serious, personalized recommendations for those involved in the case. In contrast, the SCOR review provided a consistent format for recommendations, a list of action points, and highlighted systems issues. The mean percentage agreement between the four reviewers for the five cases was 75%. The different health care providers completed data entry and assessment of the case in a similar way. Missing data from the chart and poor wording of questions were identified as issues affecting percentage agreement.
CONCLUSION: The SCOR tool provides a standardized, objective, obstetric-specific tool for root cause analysis that may improve identification of risk factors and dissemination of action plans to prevent future events."
26474236,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26474236/,"AIM/SCOPE: Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is a common complication of diagnostic/therapeutic procedures. Serum creatinine levels are sensitive but often lead to diagnostic delays in acute kidney injury and potential misclassification of actual injury status. Kidney injury molecule (KIM-1) is a novel early marker of acute kidney injury. The aim of our study was to evaluate the KIM-1 levels in patients with CIN. We performed a single-center, nested case-control study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three thousand two hundred patients who had undergone coronary angiography were included in the study. Thirty-two patients were diagnosed with CIN. Twenty patients who had undergone coronary angiography but did not have CIN were evaluated as a control group (n = 20). The diagnosis of CIN was performed according to the KDIGO 2012 Acute Kidney Injury Guideline criteria. Urinary KIM-1 levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay before as well as on the 6th and 48th hours of contrast exposure. Serum creatinine levels were measured before as well as on the 24th and 48th hours after angiographic procedure.
RESULTS: We demonstrated that KIM-1 levels increased in the patients with CIN significantly on the sixth hour when compared with the baseline (P < 0.01; median levels, 0.27 and 0.70 mg/dL) but not in the controls (P = 0.107). The precontrast and 48th-hour KIM-1 levels were median ones and were also significantly different (P = 0.001, the median levels were 0.27 and 0.60 mg/dL, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Because creatinine is a sensitive but a late marker of CIN, KIM-1 may be used for early diagnosis and early initiation of treatment and may reduce risk for morbidity."
26474430,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26474430/,"OBJECTIVES: The authors investigated if timing of medical treatment is associated with the analgesic effect of pregabalin or placebo in patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP).
METHODS: Sixty-four patients received pregabalin (150-300 mg twice a day) or matching placebo for 3 consecutive weeks. Responders to treatment were defined as patients with a reduction in clinical pain scores of 30% or greater. Factors associated with timing of pain treatment (ie, duration of CP and opioid usage) were collected at baseline. In addition, other factors that potentially could influence outcome (eg, clinical pain scores prior to study medication, diabetes, and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency) were also included. Conventional groupwise logistic regression and analysis on the individual patient level with a machine learning technique were used to predict treatment response.
RESULTS: In the conventional statistical analysis duration of CP (odds ratio, 0.9; 95% confidence interval, 0.8-1.1; P = 0.3) and opioid treatment (odds ratio, 1.0; 95% confidence interval, 0.9-1.1; P = 0.6) were not associated with pain relief. In addition, none of the supplementary factors were associated with treatment response (all P > 0.1). Likewise, in the individual patient-level analysis, none of the included variables reached classification accuracies greater than chance level (all P > 0.1).
CONCLUSIONS: Pregabalin can be added as adjuvant analgesic at any time point during the disease course of CP."
26474764,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26474764/,"PURPOSE: Attempts to formulate acyclovir to improve its bioavailability and reduce the frequency of dosing from the present q4h have not materialized.
DISCUSSION: It was thought that an approach using permeability enhancer such as chitosan may impart improved absorption profile to acyclovir; however, the recently published pharmacokinetic data suggested otherwise. The lack of promise of chitosan formulation was attributed to the muco-adhesive properties of chitosan to hold off acyclovir and preventing its transport across the gastrointestinal tract. However, the above hypothesis was refuted by another published human pharmacokinetic study of fexofenadine formulated with chitosan formulation - in this work it was unambiguously shown that chitosan helped in enhanced absorption of fexofenadine which is a well-known Pgp substrate. If one examines the pharmacokinetic disposition of acyclovir, it is clear that renal elimination is so rapid necessitating frequent dosing of acyclovir. In summary, the ability of chitosan based formulations to aid in the oral absorption of drugs may be drug dependent as enumerated by data obtained from acyclovir and fexofenadine. While chitosan favourably improved the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine, acyclovir may not be ideal for chitosan type of formulation.
CONCLUSION: The choice of the drug and the formulation type intended to deliver the drug need to be made in a diligent and pragmatic fashion."
26475404,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26475404/,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The findings from existing research on the association between socioeconomic status (SES) and multiple sclerosis (MS) are inconsistent. Most previous studies are limited to one country and do not adequately adjust for other risk factors for the disease.
METHODS: The association between SES and MS was examined using data from the multinational Environmental Risk Factors in Multiple Sclerosis (EnvIMS) case-control study, comprising 2144 cases and 3859 controls from Norway, Canada and Italy. Multiple logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the association between early life SES, measured by parental educational level, and MS. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, sunlight exposure, history of infectious mononucleosis, smoking, obesity and family size.
RESULTS: Relative to those whose parents had primary school education or below, the adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for MS amongst individuals with university-educated parents, and the P value for trend across education levels, were 1.45 (1.03-2.05) in Canada (P for trend 0.030), 1.09 (0.85-1.39) in Norway (P for trend 0.395) and 0.65 (0.39-1.07) in Italy (P for trend 0.158).
CONCLUSION: There is no consistent association between parental SES and MS risk in Norway, Canada and Italy, with a protective effect of low SES only found in Canada."
26476149,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26476149/,"OBJECTIVE: We compared the neurological outcome of isolated periventricular leukomalacia and severe intraventricular hemorrhage in a cohort of very low birth weight infants born and managed at single tertiary-care center in Saudi Arabia.
METHODS: We undertook a descriptive retrospective chart review of the neurological status of very low birth weight infants who were born and managed over a 5-year period at King Abdulaziz Medical City, Riyadh. The neurological outcome of neonates with isolated periventricular leukomalacia and severe intraventricular hemorrhage (grades III and IV) was studied and compared in relation to developmental delay and cerebral palsy.
RESULTS: A total of 20 patients with isolated periventricular leukomalacia and 26 with severe intraventricular hemorrhage (grades III and IV) were identified for this study. Of 20 patients with isolated periventricular leukomalacia, 9 (45%) had good developmental outcome and 11 (55%) had bad developmental outcome. Of 26 patients of severe intraventricular hemorrhage, 14 (54%) had good developmental outcome and 12 (46%) had bad developmental outcome (P = 0.55). Significant motor neurological deficit affecting function is distributed as follows: 11/20 (55%) in the isolated periventricular leukomalacia group and 7/26 (27%) in the severe intraventricular hemorrhage group (P = 0.05). Cerebral palsy was diplegic in 7/11 (64%) and quadriplegic in 4/11 (36%) in the isolated periventricular leukomalacia group, and hemiplegic 3/7 (43%), diplegic in 1/7 (14%), and quadriplegic in 3/7 (43%) in the severe intraventricular hemorrhage group (P = 0.03). Distribution of the neurological outcome according to periventricular leukomalacia grade was as follows: for periventricular leukomalacia grade I (n = 8), 6/8 (75%) had good neurological outcome and 2/8 (25%) had bad neurological outcome. In periventricular leukomalacia grade II (n = 4), good neurological outcome was seen in three patients (75%) and bad neurological outcome was seen in one patient (25%). All patients (n = 8) with periventricular leukomalacia grade III had bad outcome (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: About half of patients with isolated periventricular leukomalacia and severe intraventricular hemorrhage had a poor developmental outcome. However, the severity of cerebral palsy was greater in the isolated periventricular leukomalacia patients and correlates highly with periventricular leukomalacia grade. Symmetrical diplegic cerebral palsy is the most common motor deficit associated with isolated periventricular leukomalacia, whereas asymmetrical hemiplegic cerebral palsy is seen exclusively with severe intraventricular hemorrhage."
26476700,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26476700/,"OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to validate the accuracy of image-based pre-operative segmentation using the gold standard endoscopic and microscopic findings for localization and pre-operative diagnosis of the offensive vessel.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fourteen TN and 6 HS cases were randomly selected. All patients had 3T MRI, which included thin-sectioned 3D space T2, 3D Time of Flight and MPRAGE Sequences. Imaging sequences were loaded in BrainLab iPlanNet and fused. Individual segmentation of the affected cranial nerves and the compressing vascular structure was performed by a neurosurgeon, and the results were compared with the microscopic and endoscopic findings by two blinded neurosurgeons. For each case, at least three neurovascular landmarks were targeted. Each segmented neurovascular element was validated by manual placement of the navigation probe over each target, and errors of localization were measured in mm.
RESULTS: All patients underwent retro-sigmoid craniotomy and MVD using both microscope and endoscope. Based on image segmentation, the compressing vessel was identified in all cases except one, which was also negative intraoperatively. Perfect correspondence was found between image-based segmentation and endoscopic and microscopic images and videos (Dice coefficient of 1). Measurement accuracy was 0.45 ± 0.21 mm (mean ± SD).
CONCLUSION: Image-based segmentation is a promising method for pre-operative identification and localization of offending blood vessels causing HFS and TN. Using this method may prevent some unnecessary explorations on especially atypical cases with no vascular contacts. However, negative pre-operative image segmentation may not preclude one from exploration in classic cases of TN or HFS. A multicenter study with larger number of cases is recommended."
26476976,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26476976/,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the consequences of laparoscopic nephrectomy with vaginal extraction on sexual quality of life.
METHODS: Sixteen patients (mean age: 53.8 years) who underwent laparoscopic nephrectomy with vaginal extraction between September 2010 and February 2014 were included in this monocentric prospective study. All patients underwent a preoperative gynecological examination to evaluate the feasibility of vaginal extraction. The sexual function of the patients was evaluated using the French version of the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI). The patients completed an initial FSFI preoperatively then another postoperatively after the resumption of sexual activities.
RESULTS: The mean hospital stay was 2.2 days (0-5 days). No postoperative complications were observed except for one case of bleeding at the vaginal incision 4 days after surgery, resolved with a single suture under local anesthesia. Fifteen patients (94%) completed both the pre- and postoperative FSFIs. Three patients were sexually inactive and one was a virgin. The pre- and postoperative mean FSFI overall scores were 24.2 and 24.3 respectively (p=0.39). Scores were comparable in all six of the domains assessed by the questionnaire. Particularly, the pre- and postoperative scores for satisfaction were 4.5 and 4.4 respectively. No increase in dyspareunia was observed after surgery, nor was it more difficult for our patients to reach orgasm after the intervention. No statistically significant differences were observed between the pre- and postoperative FSFI scores.
CONCLUSIONS: Although preliminary, our results suggest that laparoscopic nephrectomy with vaginal extraction has no effect on the sexual quality of life of patients."

Despite significant investment in preventive health care in general practice, little is known about whether GP detection of lifestyle risk factors have improved over time.
OBJECTIVES: To examine whether sensitivity and specificity of GP detection of smoking, risky alcohol consumption and overweight and obesity has increased in patients presenting to see their GP, by comparing results from four Australian studies conducted between 1982 and 2011.
METHODS: Demographic characteristics of patient and GP samples and the prevalence, sensitivity and specificity of detection of each risk factor were extracted from published studies. Differences between GP and patient sample characteristics were examined. To identify trends over time in prevalence of risk factors, sensitivity and specificity of detection across studies and the Cochran-Armitage test for trend were calculated for each risk factor for the overall sample and by male and female subgroups.
RESULTS: There were no statistically significant changes in the sensitivity of GP detection of smoking or overweight or obesity over time. Specificity of detection of smoking increased from 64.7% to 98% (P < 0.0001) and decreased for overweight or obesity from 92% to 89% (P = 0.01). There was a small decrease in the sensitivity of detection of alcohol consumption (P = 0.02) and an increase in specificity (P = 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite significant investment to increase GP detection and intervention for lifestyle risk factors, accurate detection of smoking, risky alcohol consumption and overweight and obesity occurs for less than two-thirds of all patients."
26477482,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26477482/,"BACKGROUND: Markedly elevated plasma glucose and relatively low HbA1c compared to plasma glucose is one diagnostic criterion for fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus (FT1DM). Glycated albumin (GA) is a glycemic control marker that reflects glycemic control in shorter period than HbA1c. This study investigated whether GA is useful for differential diagnosis between FT1DM and acute-onset autoimmune type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1ADM) or not.
METHODS: This study included 38 FT1DM patients and 31 T1ADM patients in whom both HbA1c and GA were measured at the time of diagnosis.
RESULTS: In FT1DM patients, as compared to T1ADM patients, both HbA1c and GA were significantly lower (HbA1c; 6.6±0.9% vs. 11.7±2.6%, P<0.0001, GA; 22.9±4.8% vs. 44.3±8.3%, P<0.0001). For differential diagnosis between FT1DM and T1ADM, ROC analysis showed that the optimum cut-off value for GA was 33.5% with sensitivity and specificity of 97.4% and 96.8%, respectively, while the optimum cut-off value for HbA1c was 8.7% with sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 83.9%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: GA also may be useful for the differential diagnosis between FT1DM and T1ADM when the cut-off value can be set at 33.5%."

During every symptom assessment at the cancer center, patients reported their level of severity for each of nine symptoms. A Markov multistate model under an intermittent observation scheme was implemented to examine the progression of symptom severity over time among cancer patients.
RESULTS: This study included 55,883 patients with over 280,000 symptom assessments. The median time between assessments was 29 days, and the majority of patients had at least three assessments. The symptoms deteriorating most rapidly over time were fatigue and well-being, whereas the symptom deteriorating least rapidly over time was nausea.
CONCLUSION: The availability of numerous medications for treating nausea, compared to fatigue and well-being, may be a reasonable explanation for our findings. Alternate management for these symptoms, such as exercise for reducing fatigue, should be investigated to improve patients' quality of life. The use of multistate modeling methods is also unique in the study of symptom progression and provides a more in-depth understanding of the likelihood of symptom deterioration and improvement over time."
26479285,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26479285/,"BACKGROUND: Preemptive kidney transplantation (preKT) is associated with higher patient survival, improved quality of life, and lower costs. However, only a minority of patients receives preKT. The aim of this study was to examine changes over the past decade in rates of preKT, focusing on living donor kidney transplantation (LDKT) and specifically recipients who underwent kidney transplantation within 1 year of initiating dialysis.
METHODS: Using United Network of Organ Sharing data, we examined retrospectively all kidney transplant candidates (n = 369 103) and recipients (n = 141 254) from 2003 to 2012 in the United States focusing on LDKT (n = 47 108). Predictors of preKT were examined, and patient and graft survival were compared for preKT, pretransplant dialysis less than 1 year, and pretransplant dialysis recipients of 1 year or longer.
RESULTS: PreKT occurred in only 17% of recipients overall and 31% of LDKT recipients. Medicare patients (odds ratio [OR], 0.29; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.28-0.31), diabetics (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.69-0.80), and minorities (Hispanics OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.57-0.68 and African Americans OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.53-0.63) were less likely to receive preKT. Dialysis recipients for less than 1 year comprised 30% of nonpreemptive LDKT. Dialysis recipients of less than 1 year had similar patient survival to preKT (5 years: preKT, 94%; dialysis < 1 year, 94%; dialysis ≥ 1 year, 89%; P < 0.01), but decreased death-censored graft survival (5 years: preKT, 93%; dialysis < 1 year, 89%; and dialysis ≥ 1 year, 89%; P < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: PreKT remains an unrealized goal for the majority of recipients. Medicare patients, diabetics, and minorities are less likely to receive preKT. Almost one third of nonpreemptive LDKT recipients were dialyzed for less than 1 year, highlighting an important target for improvement."
26480048,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26480048/,"BACKGROUND: After a pilot study on skin cancer screening was performed between 2003 and 2004 in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, the country implemented what to the authors' knowledge is the first nationwide skin cancer screening program in the world in 2008. The objective of the current study was to provide details regarding mortality trends in Schleswig-Holstein and Germany in relation to the screening.
METHODS: Annual age-standardized mortality rates for skin melanoma (using the 10th Revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems [ICD-10] code C43) and malignant neoplasms of ill-defined, secondary, and unspecified sites (ICD-10 code C76-C80) were analyzed. The European Standard population was used for age standardization. A bias analysis was performed to estimate the number of skin melanoma deaths that may have been incorrectly counted as ICD-10 code C76-C80 when the skin melanoma mortality declined in Schleswig-Holstein.
RESULTS: The observed mortality decline in Schleswig-Holstein 5 years after the pilot study was accompanied by a considerable increase in the number of deaths due to malignant neoplasms of ill-defined, secondary, and unspecified sites (ICD-10 code C76-C80) that is not explainable by an increase in the incidence of these neoplasms. Incorrect assignment of 8 to 35 and 12 to 23 skin melanoma deaths per year among men and women, respectively, as ICD-10 code C76-C80 during 2007 through 2010 could explain the transient skin melanoma mortality decline observed in Schleswig-Holstein. Five years after implementation of the program, the nationwide skin melanoma mortality increased (age-standardized rate change of +0.4 per 100,000 person-years [95% confidence interval, 0.2-0.6] in men and +0.1 per 100,000 person-years [95% confidence interval, -0.1 to 0.2] in women).
CONCLUSIONS: Although the current analyses raise doubts that the skin cancer screening program in Germany can reduce the skin cancer mortality rate, the authors do not believe the program should be immediately stopped.

26480313,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26480313/,"OBJECTIVE: We analyzed whether further education in young adult and mid-life [adult educational mobility] influences physical functioning and depressive symptoms in women.
METHODS: 14247 women born 1973-78 (younger cohort) and 13715 women born 1946-51 (mid-aged cohort) from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health were followed for 14-16 years. Measures were the Short-Form 36 Health Survey physical functioning subscale (SF-36 PF) and Centre for Epidemiologic Studies 10-item Depression Scale (CESD-10). Linear mixed modelling, accounting for time varying covariates, assessed the influence of further education on physical functioning and depressive symptoms over time. Sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of missing data was conducted using multiple imputation.
RESULTS: Compared to younger women with a pre-existing high level of education, women gaining further education (up to age 39 years) from low levels had lower SF-36 PF scores (poorer physical functioning) (fully adjusted beta estimates (95%CIs) -1.52 (-2.59, -0.44)) while those gaining further education from middle to high levels showed equivalent SF-36 PF scores (-0.08 (-0.61, 0.44)). A similar pattern was shown for CESD-10 scores (0.78 (0.29, 1.25); -0.02 (-0.26, 0.21), respectively) where higher scores represented more depressive symptoms. For mid-age women, further education from a middle to high level resulted in equivalent SF-36 PF scores (-0.61 (-1.93,0.71)) but higher CESD-10 scores (0.49 (0.11, 0.86)), compared to highly educated women.
CONCLUSION: Women who delay further education until they are aged between their 40s and 60s can improve or maintain their physical functioning but may have missed the critical time to minimise depressive symptomatology. Public health policy should focus on encouraging women to upgrade their educational qualifications earlier in life in order to potentially offset the negative associations between their initial lower socio-economic position class of origin and their mental health."
26480863,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26480863/,"BACKGROUND: Many prognostic indexes are available for patients with brain metastases in order to estimate remaining lifetime before selection of appropriate treatment including palliative radiotherapy. Their routine utilization is often deprecated for their complexity. We developed a practical tool based on widely available spreadsheet editors for facilitation of daily clinical use of selected indexes (RPA, GPA and WBRT 30) and evaluated its usage for retrospective single institutional survival analysis of patients irradiated for brain metastases.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Spreadsheet platform was prepared and adjusted for automatic calculation of selected prognostic indexes after input of the relevant parameters. The consecutive series of newly diagnosed patients referred during 2011 to the palliative brain radiotherapy were analyzed, and real calculated survival parameters of individual subgroups of RPA, GPA and WBRT 30 were compared with estimated ones. Correlation of radiotherapy technique and estimated survival at the time of treatment indication was evaluated.
RESULTS: Total of 121 patients (61% with multiple metastases) were irradiated with the majority undergoing whole brain radiotherapy. Median overall survival from the time of radiotherapy indication was 3.13 months. Non balanced distribution into individual scoring systems subgroups was observed with 8 (7%), 89 (73%) and 24 (20%) patients assigned to RPA 1, 2 and 3 subgroup, 3 (3%), 9 (7%), 57 (47%) and 52 (43%) patients assigned to GPA 3.5- 4, GPA 3.0, GPA 1.5- 2.5 and GPA 0- 1.0 subgroup and 10 (8%), 88 (73%) and 23 (19%) patients assigned to WBRT 30 subgroup D, B and A. Entire differences in overall survival between subgroups are significant among all three scoring systems.
CONCLUSION: Routine calculation of available prognostic indexes is useful in decision making regarding the best radiotherapy of brain metastases, and their calculation is greatly facilitated by properly prepared widely available spreadsheet tools."
26480879,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26480879/,"BACKGROUND: The minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis (MIPO) technique has been described and used effectively in humeral shaft fractures. However, the postoperative deformity resulting from malreduction with the minimally invasive technique has not received adequate attention. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the postoperative malrotation and the functional results of the MIPO technique and conventional plating in open reduction and internal fixation after humeral shaft fracture.
METHODS: A prospective cohort research was performed; 53 cases of humeral shaft fractures in a level I trauma center were included and allocated into group I for open reduction and internal fixation or group II for MIPO. Computed tomography was used to measure the postoperative malrotation. The status of the union, functional scoring, and muscle strength were recorded at 12 months after surgery.
RESULTS: Both groups exhibited satisfactory union results and final shoulder function scoring. Shoulder girdle musculature of both groups exhibited considerable strength loss with no obvious intergroup discrepancy, with greater internal rotation strength loss compared with external rotation. A significantly increased incidence of postoperative malrotation >20° was observed in the MIPO group (40.9% vs. 0%; P < .01). A linear correlation between postoperative malrotation and range of rotation loss was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: The MIPO technique might be advantageous as a cosmetic consideration; however, it did not improve postoperative function and strength restoration results more than the open technique. Moreover, MIPO was associated with greater postoperative malrotation, which was considered to be correlated with subsequent long-term shoulder degeneration."
26481122,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26481122/,"BACKGROUND: High-energy tibial plateau and tibial plafond fractures have a high complication rate and are frequently treated with a staged approach of spanning external fixation followed by definitive internal fixation after resolution of soft tissue swelling. A theoretical advantage to early spanning external fixation is that earlier fracture stabilization could prevent further soft tissue damage and potentially reduce the occurrence of subsequent infection. However, the relative urgency of applying the external fixator after injury is unknown, and whether delay in this intervention is correlated to subsequent treatment complications has not been examined.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: Is delay of more than 12 hours to spanning external fixation of high-energy tibial plateau and plafond fractures associated with increased (1) infection risk; (2) compartment syndrome risk; and (3) time to definitive fixation, length of hospitalization, or risk of secondary surgeries? We further stratified our results based on injury site: plateau and plafond. In practical clinical terms, many of these high-energy C-type articular fractures will arrive at the regional trauma center in the evening and this investigation attempted to explore if these injuries need to be placed in temporizing fixators that evening or if they may be safely addressed in a dedicated trauma room the next morning.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of all patients at a Level I university trauma center with high-energy tibial plateau and plafond fractures who underwent staged treatment with a spanning external fixation followed by subsequent definitive internal fixation between 2006 and 2012. Patients who received a fixator within 12 hours of recorded injury time were classified as early external fixation; those who received a fixator greater than 12 hours from injury were classified as delayed external fixation. There were 80 patients (42 plateaus and 38 plafonds) in the early external fixation cohort and 79 patients (45 plateaus and 34 plafonds) in the delayed external fixation cohort. Deep infection rate was 13% in plateau fractures and 18% in plafond fractures. Rates of infection, compartment syndrome, secondary surgeries, time to definitive fixation, and length of hospitalization were recorded.
RESULTS: Controlling for differences in open fracture severity between groups, there was no difference in infection for plafond (early fixation: 12 of 38 [32%]; delayed fixation: seven of 34 [21%]; adjusted relative risk = 1.39 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.45-4.31], p = 0.573) and plateau (early fixation: eight of 42 [19%]; delayed fixation: nine of 45 [20%]; adjusted relative risk: 0.93 [95% CI, 0.31-2.78], p = 0.861) groups. For compartment syndrome risk, there was no difference between early and delayed groups for plateau fractures (early fixation: six of 42 [14%]; delayed fixation: three of 45 [7%]; relative risk = 0.47 [0.12-1.75], p = 0.304) and plafond fractures (early fixation: two of 38 [5%]; delayed fixation: three of 34 [9%]; relative risk = 1.67 [0.30-9.44], p = 0.662). There was no difference for length of hospitalization for early (9 ± 7 days) versus delayed fixation (9 ± 6 days) (mean difference = 0.24 [95% CI, -2.9 to 3.4], p = 0.878) for patients with plafond fracture. Similarly, there was no difference in length of hospitalization for early (10 ± 6 days) versus delayed fixation (8 ± 4 days) (mean difference = 1.6 [95% CI, -3.9 to 0.7], p = 0.170) for patients with plateau fracture. Time to definitive fixation for plateau fractures in the early external fixation group was 8 ± 6 days compared with 11 ± 7 days for the delayed external fixation group (mean difference = 2.9 [95% CI, 0.13-5.7], p = 0.040); there was no difference in time to definitive fixation for early (12 ± 7 days) versus delayed (12 ± 6 days) for patients with plafond fractures (mean difference = 0.39 [95% CI, -2.7 to 3.4], p = 0.801). There was no difference in risk of secondary surgeries between early external fixation (21 of 38 [55%]) and delayed external fixation (13 if 34 [38%]) for plafond fractures (adjusted relative risk = 0.69 [95% CI, 0.41-1.16], p = 0.165) and no difference between early fixation (24 of 42 [57%]) and delayed fixation (26 of 45 [58%]) for plateau fractures (adjusted relative risk = 1.0 [95% CI, 0.70-1.45], p = 1.00).
CONCLUSIONS: We were unable to detect a difference in infection, compartment syndrome, secondary procedures, or length of hospitalization for patients who undergo early versus delayed external fixation for high-energy tibial plateau or plafond fractures. This may affect decisions for resource use at trauma centers such as whether high-energy periarticular lower extremity fractures need to be spanned on the evening of presentation or whether this procedure may wait until the morning trauma room. Given the high complication rate of these injuries and clinical relevance of this question, this may also need to be examined in a prospective manner.

26481741,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26481741/,"BACKGROUND: The radiochemotherapy regimen concomitantly employing temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy and radiotherapy (RT) 4 weeks after surgery, followed by 6 cycles of TMZ is a common treatment for glioblastoma (GBM). However, its median overall survival (OS) is only 14.6 months. This study was to explore the effectiveness and safety of early TMZ chemotherapy between surgery and chemoradiotherapy plus the standard concomitant radiochemotherapy regimen.
METHODS: A randomized, parallel group, open-label study of 99 newly diagnosed GBM patients was conducted at 10 independent Chinese neurosurgical departments from June 2008 to June 2012. Patients were treated with concomitant radiochemotherapy regimen plus early postsurgical temozolomide (early TMZ group) or standard concomitant radiochemotherapy regimen (control group). Overall response was assessed based on objective tumor assessments, administration of corticosteroid and neurological status test. Hematological, biochemical, laboratory, adverse event (AE), and neurological condition were measured for 24 months of follow-up. The primary efficacy endpoint of this study was overall survival (OS). The secondary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS).
RESULTS: The median OS time in the early TMZ group was 17.6 months, compared with 13.2 months in the control group (log-rank test P = 0.021). In addition, the OS rate in the early TMZ group was higher at 6, 12, and 18 months than in the control group, respectively (P < 0.05). The median PFS time was 8.7 months in the early TMZ group and 10.4 months in the control group (log-rank test P = 0.695). AEs occurred in 29 (55.8%) and 31(73.8%) patients respectively in early and control groups, including nausea (15.4% vs. 33.3%), vomiting (7.7% vs. 28.6%), fever (7.7% vs. 11.9%), and headache (3.8% vs. 23.8%). Only 30.8% and 33.3% were drug-related, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Addition of TMZ chemotherapy in the early break of the standard concomitant radiochemotherapy regimen was well tolerated and significantly improved the OS of the GBM patients, compared with standard concomitant radiochemotherapy regimen. However, a larger randomized trial is warranted to verify these results."
26481765,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26481765/,"AIM: Clinical guidelines provide evidence-based management recommendations to guide practice. This study aimed to evaluate whether patients discussed at a lung cancer multidisciplinary team meeting received guideline-recommended treatment and determine reasons for not receiving guideline-recommended treatment.
METHODS: All new lung cancer patients discussed at the Liverpool/Macarthur lung cancer multidisciplinary team meeting between 1 December 2005 and 31 December 2010 were included. Guideline-recommended treatment was assigned according to pathology, stage and ECOG (Eastern Co-operative Oncology Group) performance status as per the 2004 Australian Lung Cancer Guidelines. This was compared with actual treatment received to determine adherence to guidelines. For those patients who did not receive guideline-recommended treatment, the medical record was reviewed to determine the reason(s) for this. Survival was compared between those who did and did not receive guideline-recommended treatment.
RESULTS: 808 new patients were discussed at the multidisciplinary team meeting. Guideline-recommended treatment could not be assigned in 2% of patients due to missing data. 435 patients (54%) received guideline-recommended treatment, and 356 (44%) did not. The most common reasons for not receiving guideline-recommended treatment were a decline in ECOG performance status (24%), large tumor volume precluding radical radiotherapy (17%), comorbidities (15%) and patient preference (13%). Patients less than 70 years who received guideline-recommended treatment had improved survival compared with those who did not.
CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of lung cancer patients did not receive guideline-recommended treatment due to legitimate reasons. Alternative guidelines are needed for patients not suitable for current best practice. Treatment according to guidelines was a predictor for survival."
26481926,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26481926/,"INTRODUCTION: Obese and overweight patients represent a challenging surgical group for autologous free-flap breast reconstruction. There is a paucity of information regarding post-operative patient-reported satisfaction in this increasingly prevalent cohort. This retrospective study aimed to determine using BREAST-Q patient-reported satisfaction amongst normal, overweight and obese patients receiving autologous free-flap breast reconstruction.
METHODS: BREAST-Q (post-reconstruction) module was sent to 174 autologous breast free flap reconstruction patients between 2001 and 2012. Clinical data were collated for patients who returned questionnaires. Post-operative complications and satisfaction scores were compared between normal versus overweight and obese patients.
RESULTS: A total of 101 patients (normal body mass index (BMI) = 27; overweight BMI = 48 and obese BMI = 25) completed BREAST-Q (response rate 66%). Obese and overweight patients are significantly more likely to develop major (44.8% and 31.1% vs. 29.6%) and minor (34.4% and 20% vs. 7.4%) complications in comparison to normal BMI patients (p < 0.02). Overweight and obese patients demonstrated similar levels of satisfaction compared with normal patients with the shape of their reconstructed breasts (73.2 and 72.1 vs. 71.2; p > 0.05) and overall surgical outcome (75.8 and 78.9 vs. 75.4; p > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Patient post-operative satisfaction is gaining increasing relevance in assessing the outcomes from autologous breast reconstruction. Overweight and obese women benefit from autologous breast reconstruction, despite being at increased risk of post-operative complications, and eventually achieve comparable levels of post-operative satisfaction. This should be reflected in pre-operative counselling."
26481934,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26481934/,"UNLABELLED: Using a Danish Register cohort of 86,039 adult new allopurinol users and propensity score matched controls, we found that gout requiring allopurinol prescription was associated with an increased fracture risk.
PURPOSE: Gout, an acute inflammatory arthritis, is common and associated with elevated serum urate, obesity and high alcohol consumption. The mainstay of therapy is the urate-lowering agent, allopurinol. Here, we report the relationship between allopurinol prescription and fracture in a large registry population.
METHODS: We established a Danish Register cohort of 86,039 adult cases (new allopurinol users) and 86,039 age, sex and propensity score matched controls (not exposed to allopurinol or with a gout diagnosis), with no diagnosis of malignancy in the year prior.
RESULTS: We found a modest adjusted effect of allopurinol prescription on major osteoporotic fractures (hazard ratio (HR) 1.09, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.05-1.14, p = 0.04) and on hip fractures (HR 1.07, 95 % CI 1.11-1.14, p < 0.001), robust to adjustment for confounding factors (age, sex, comorbidity, medication use). Associations were stronger in men than women, and among incident allopurinol users whose gout diagnosis had been confirmed by at least one hospital contact. Prespecified subanalyses by filled dose of allopurinol (mg/day in first year of prescription) showed increased hip and major fracture risk in women in the highest allopurinol dose grouping only, while a less strong dose effect was evident for fracture rates in men.
CONCLUSION: Gouty arthritis requiring allopurinol is associated with an excess risk of major or hip fracture, with an allopurinol dose effect evident in women such that women taking the highest doses of allopurinol--suggestive of more severe disease--were at increased risk relative to women taking lower doses."
26482456,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26482456/,"OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study have been to determine prognostic factors for acute pyelonephritis (AP) after flexible ureteroscopy (FU), to assess the frequency of readmission for AP and to study the usefulness of urinalysis the day before surgery.
METHODS: Between 2010 and 2013, 266 patients have had at least one ureteroscopy (n=325). All infectious complications and unplanned readmissions within the month after FU were retrospectively evaluated. Several data have been collected: age, sex, BMI, surgical indication (calculis or tumor), number of previous ureteroscopies, number of previous surgeries for calculis, stones number, size and location, bilateral interventions, operating time, preoperative ureteral stenting, postoperative stenting, hospitalization stay, urine culture the day before surgery (j-1) and prescription of antibiotic therapy the week before FU. Correlation between these variables and acute pyelonephritis (AP) the month following the USSR was tested (StatView 4.5, SAS Institute) (P<0.05 significant).
RESULTS: We observed 24 postoperative APs (7.4%), 17 prior to hospital discharge and 7 requiring rehospitalization. In univariate analysis, the significant prognostic factors of postoperative AP have been: stone size (>14 mm) (P=0.03); operating time (70 minutes) (P<0.005); positive day - 1 urine culture (P<0.001); antibiotics treatment the week before FU (P<0.001). In multivariate analysis, antibiotics prescription during the week before USSR remained significant (P<0.002; RR 5.8 [1.9-15]).
CONCLUSION: Acute pyelonephritis requiring unplanned admission after ureteroscopy is a rare complication (2.4%). Urinalysis one day before ureteroscopy could allow early antibiotic therapy and may reduce 63% of unplanned hospital admissions for acute pyelonephritis.

26482473,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26482473/,"BACKGROUND: Repeated epidemiological surveys show no decline in depression although uptake of treatments has grown. Universal depression prevention interventions are effective in schools but untested rigorously in adulthood. Selective prevention programmes have poor uptake. Universal interventions may be more acceptable during routine healthcare contacts for example antenatally. One study within routine postnatal healthcare suggested risk of postnatal depression could be reduced in non-depressed women from 11% to 8% by giving health visitors psychological intervention training. Feasibility and effectiveness in other settings, most notably antenatally, is unknown.
METHOD: We conducted an external pilot study using a cluster trial design consisting of recruitment and enhanced psychological training of randomly selected clusters of community midwives (CMWs), recruitment of pregnant women of all levels of risk of depression, collection of baseline and outcome data prior to childbirth, allowing time for women 'at increased risk' to complete CMW-provided psychological support sessions.
RESULTS: Seventy-nine percent of eligible women approached agreed to take part. Two hundred and ninety-eight women in eight clusters participated and 186 termed 'at low risk' for depression, based on an Edinburgh Perinatal Depression Scale (EPDS) score of <12 at 12 weeks gestation, provided baseline and outcome data at 34 weeks gestation. All trial protocol procedures were shown to be feasible. Antenatal effect sizes in women 'at low risk' were similar to those previously demonstrated postnatally. Qualitative work confirmed the acceptability of the approach to CMWs and intervention group women.
CONCLUSION: A fully powered trial testing universal prevention of depression in pregnancy is feasible, acceptable and worth undertaking."
26482516,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26482516/,"BACKGROUND: A shortage of pediatric surgeons exists. The purpose of this study was to evaluate pediatric outcomes using pediatric surgeons vs adult trauma surgeons.
METHODS: A review was conducted at 2 level II pediatric trauma centers. Center I provides 24-hour in-house trauma surgeons for resuscitations, with patient hand-off to a pediatric surgery service. Center II provides 24-hour in-house senior surgical resident coverage with an on-call trauma surgeon. Data on demographics, resource utilization, and outcomes were collected.
RESULTS: Center I patients were more severely injured (injury severity score = 8.3 vs 6.2; Glasgow coma scale score = 13.7 vs 14.3). Center I patients were more often admitted to the intensive care unit (52.2% vs 33.5%) and more often mechanically ventilated (12.9% vs 7.7%), with longer hospital length of stay (2.8 vs 2.3 days). However, mortality was not different between Center I and II (3.1% vs 2.4%). By logistic regression analyses, the only variables predictive of mortality were injury severity score and Glasgow coma scale score.
CONCLUSION: As it appears that trauma surgeons' outcomes compare favorably with those of pediatric surgeons, utilizing adult trauma surgeons may help alleviate shortages in pediatric surgeon coverage."
26482784,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26482784/,"BACKGROUND: The optimal mode of resection for thymoma in nonmyasthenic patients remains unclear. The aim of this study was to explore whether or not thymomectomy alone is a relevant option for patients with stage I (T1N0M0) thymoma in the proposed TNM classification.
METHODS: We investigated 2,835 patients with thymic epithelial tumors treated at 32 institutions participating in the Japanese Association for Research on the Thymus (JART). A total of 1286 patients with thymomectomy: resection of thymoma with partial thymectomy (n = 289) or thymothymomectomy: resection of thymoma with total thymectomy (n = 997) for stage I thymoma were included. Surgical and oncologic outcomes were compared between the 2 groups.
RESULTS: Patients who underwent thymomectomy were older (61.1 versus 57.0 years; p = 0.000) and had smaller tumors (4.77 versus 5.99 cm; p = 0.000) than those who underwent thymothymomectomy. There was a significant difference in the distribution of histologic subtype (p = 0.007). After propensity-score matching, the matched cohort consisted of 276 patients in each group. Postoperative complications were seen more frequently in the thymothymomectomy group than in the thymomectomy group (8.3% versus 4.3%; p = 0.0397). The 5-year overall survival rate was 97.3% in the thymomectomy group and 96.9% in the thymothymomectomy group (p = 0.487). Patients who underwent thymomectomy tended to have local recurrence more frequently than did those who underwent thymothymomectomy (2.2% versus 0.4%; p = 0.0613).
CONCLUSIONS: Thymomectomy alone is acceptable for stage I thymoma in regard to postoperative complications and prognosis. Further studies are needed to evaluate long-term outcomes."
26482821,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26482821/,"BACKGROUND: Researchers have shown that the characteristics of a person with an intellectual disability (ID), in particular the severity of the disability, are related to the outcomes of professional support. Hardly any studies have asked parents and/or legal guardians for their own opinion about the quality of support given to their child/family member with ID. Therefore, this study examined the relationship between the severity of a person's disability and the opinions voiced by the parents and/or other legal guardians of that person concerning several aspects of the quality of support received in residential care.
METHOD: Questionnaires were completed by 1058 parents and/or legal guardians of people with ID living in residential facilities. A multiple covariance analysis was conducted to explore the relationship between the severity of the disability and the parents' and/or legal guardians' opinions.
RESULTS: Only small differences in the opinions about the quality of support were observed between parents and/or legal guardians of people with mild to moderate ID and those of people with severe to profound ID.
CONCLUSION: This study showed that there are differences in parental opinions about the quality of support, but that most of these differences are not related to the severity of disability. The only significant difference related to the severity of disability is on the leisure activities domain. Parents and/or legal guardians of a person with severe/profound ID were less satisfied with leisure activities than parents and/or legal guardians of persons with mild/moderate ID. It is important to determine to what other factors parental opinions are related, as these opinions concerning the quality of support are important measures alongside client self-reports and measures of the facility itself. The quality of support should be measured using a combination of methods for different stakeholders."
26482901,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26482901/,"BACKGROUND: The number of medical students accepted into medical programs is increasing, which has made the traditional long/short case style of examination difficult to conduct. At Dammam University, the program is shifting to the use of the Objective Structural Clinical Examination (OSCE), which may solve some of these difficulties, including issues with reliability, validity index and exam duration.
RESULTS: A pilot study was conducted over one semester. A total of 207 examinees in three groups took the OSCE and written exams. The OSCE consisted of 18 clinical stations and required 3-4.3 h/day. The written exam contained 80 multiple-choice questions. The Cronbach's alpha for each group was 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9. Correlations for all stations ranged from 0.7 to 0.8, which indicated good stability and internal consistency with minor differences in the progression of the indexes. The reliability of the written exam was 0.79, and the validity of the OSCE was 0.63, as assessed using Pearson's correlation.
CONCLUSION: No single reliability index can be considered a perfect assessment tool to solve this issue. Thus, at least two to three indexes should be used to ensure the reliability of the OSCE."
26483263,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26483263/,"PURPOSE: Upper airway stimulation is an effective treatment option for obstructive sleep apnea after failure of positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy. To ensure a therapeutic effect, closed-loop hypoglossal nerve implants require the absence of palatal complete concentric collapse during sleep endoscopy. The frequency and potential predictors of this exclusion criterion are unknown.
METHODS: Over a 2-year period, 74 consecutive patients with sleep apnea who sought PAP alternatives were evaluated with sleep endoscopy using propofol. The influence of sleep apnea severity and anthropometric characteristics as predictors of sleep endoscopy results was investigated.
RESULTS: One-fifth of all patients showed a concentric collapse. Gender and age did not predict the presence of concentric collapse, but higher body mass and apnea hypopnea index values were predictive (p = 0.011; e.g., 0.026). The most commonly used body mass index values for upper airway stimulation indications demonstrated acceptable specificity (BMI 32 kg/m(2) 0.71, 95 % confidence interval = 0.57, 0.82; e.g., 35 kg/m(2) 0.81, 95 % confidence interval = 0.69, 0.90). Despite the association with overweight, a significant number of severely overweight patients had no concentric palatal collapse.
CONCLUSIONS: Concentric collapse is a somewhat common condition encountered in sleep endoscopy evaluations of PAP alternatives, and cannot be sustainably predicted with anthropometric or sleep assessments. Sleep surgeons should be aware of the possibility of concentric collapse, especially in candidates who are more overweight and have severe sleep apnea. Sleep endoscopy can be useful for providing information about continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) alternatives or to motivate patient adherence to treatment."
26483417,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26483417/,"OBJECTIVES: Children are especially vulnerable to harmful effects of ionizing radiation. Cutting down the dimensions of the X-ray beam is the most effective way to reduce the patient dose. We evaluated the appropriateness of field-size in the most frequent radiographs, dental panoramic tomographs (DPTs) and lateral cephalometric radiographs (LCRs) among 7- to 12-year-olds.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The image field-size of 241 DPTs and 118 LCRs was analysed. The image field was considered appropriate when it did not include anatomic structures beyond the area of clinical interest. The image field was compared with factors such as the age of the patient, the radiographic equipment used and the programme selected. Moreover, we assessed the use of thyroid shield in LCR.
RESULTS: The field-size was too large in 70% of the DPTs horizontally and in 96% vertically. None of the DPTs were segmented. Every LCR showed appropriate limitation anteriorly, but the image field was too large in 54% posteriorly, in 86% superiorly, and in 76% inferiorly. A thyroid shield had been used in only 71% of cases.
CONCLUSION: Most DPTs and LCRs had been performed sub-optimally. An abundancy of DPTs had been taken using an adult programme, and the field-size had not been sufficiently adjusted in LCRs, possibly for technical reasons. To facilitate adherence to radiological best practice the equipment used for DPTs and LCRs should facilitate the adjustment of field-size in both the vertical and horizontal planes. In addition, those involved in taking radiographs should maintain their skills through regular update courses."
26483858,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26483858/,"OBJECTIVE: Sufficient teaching and assessing clinical skills in the undergraduate setting becomes more and more important. In a surgical skills-lab course at the Medical University of Innsbruck fourth year students were teached with DOPS (direct observation of procedural skills). We analyzed whether DOPS worked or not in this setting, which performance levels could be reached compared to tutor teaching (one tutor, 5 students) and which curricular side effects could be observed.
METHODS: In a prospective randomized trial in summer 2013 (April - June) four competence-level-based skills were teached in small groups during one week: surgical abdominal examination, urethral catheterization (phantom), rectal-digital examination (phantom), handling of central venous catheters. Group A was teached with DOPS, group B with a classical tutor system. Both groups underwent an OSCE (objective structured clinical examination) for assessment. 193 students were included in the study. Altogether 756 OSCE´s were carried out, 209 (27,6%) in the DOPS- and 547 (72,3%) in the tutor-group.
RESULTS: Both groups reached high performance levels. In the first month there was a statistically significant difference (p<0,05) in performance of 95% positive OSCE items in the DOPS-group versus 88% in the tutor group. In the following months the performance rates showed no difference anymore and came to 90% in both groups. In practical skills the analysis revealed a high correspondence between positive DOPS (92,4%) and OSCE (90,8%) results.
DISCUSSION: As shown by our data DOPS furnish high performance of clinical skills and work well in the undergraduate setting. Due to the high correspondence of DOPS and OSCE results DOPS should be considered as preferred assessment tool in a students skills-lab. The approximation of performance-rates within the months after initial superiority of DOPS could be explained by an interaction between DOPS and tutor system: DOPS elements seem to have improved tutoring and performance rates as well. DOPS in students 'skills-lab afford structured feedback and assessment without increased personnel and financial resources compared to classic small group training.
CONCLUSION: In summary, this study shows that DOPS represent an efficient method in teaching clinical skills. Their effects on didactic culture reach beyond the positive influence of performance rates."

26484853,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26484853/,"BACKGROUND: Metastatic lesions in prostate cancer beyond the bone have prognostic importance and affect clinical therapeutic decisions. Few data exist regarding the prevalence of soft-tissue metastases at the initial diagnosis of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).
METHODS: This study analyzed 232 men with nonmetastatic (M0) castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) who developed metastases detected by a bone scan or computed tomography (CT). All bone scans and CT scans within the 30 days before or after the mCRPC diagnosis were reviewed. The rate of soft-tissue metastases among those undergoing CT was determined. Then, predictors of soft-tissue metastases and visceral and lymph node metastases were identified.
RESULTS: Compared with men undergoing CT (n = 118), men undergoing only bone scans (n = 114) were more likely to have received primary treatment (P = .048), were older (P = .013), and less recently developed metastases (P = .018). Among those undergoing CT, 52 (44%) had soft-tissue metastases, including 20 visceral metastases (17%) and 41 lymph node metastases (35%), whereas 30% had no bone involvement. In a univariable analysis, only prostate-specific antigen (PSA) predicted soft-tissue metastases (odds ratio [OR], 1.27; P = .047), and no statistically significant predictors of visceral metastases were found. A higher PSA level was associated with an increased risk of lymph node metastases (OR, 1.38; P = .014), whereas receiving primary treatment was associated with decreased risk (OR, 0.36; P = .015).
CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that there is a relatively high rate of soft-tissue metastasis (44%) among CRPC patients undergoing CT at the initial diagnosis of metastases, including some men with no bone involvement. Therefore, forgoing CT during a metastatic evaluation may lead to an underdiagnosis of soft-tissue metastases and an underdiagnosis of metastases in general.

AIMS: Three questions are addressed: the degree to which concern for the work of consultant psychiatrists informed the introduction of the new roles; what the reforms implied for the work of the psychiatrist and those in new roles; and the impact of any changes on the operation of CMHTs.
METHOD: Data were collected as part of a national-level evaluation. The main means of collection was the semi-structured interview.
RESULTS: The study shows: that reform was underpinned by concerns about the workload of psychiatrists; and that while in principle the responsibilities of the psychiatrist were to be distributed across other team members, those in new roles felt themselves to be isolated.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the intentions of policy, the creation of the new roles did little to extend the idea of distributed responsibility in CMHTs."
26485247,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26485247/,"BACKGROUND: This study measured the serum levels of complement component (C)3a and C5a and the placental expressions of C3a receptor (R) and C5aR to determine a potential correlation with circulating angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor agonistic autoantibody (AT1-AA) in severe pre-eclampsia.
METHODS: A total of 118 women were recruited and divided into 2 groups: the control group (normotensive preterm pregnancies, n = 66) and severe pre-eclampsia group (n = 52). Levels of C3a, C5a and AT1-AA in serum were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and C3aR and C5aR in placenta by Western blotting.
RESULTS: Levels of C3a, C5a and AT1-AA in serum from the severe pre-eclampsia group were significantly higher than in controls (p < 0.05). Placental expression of C3aR and C5aR in the pre-eclampsia group was lower than that in controls (p < 0.05). There were significant positive correlations between levels of C3a, C5a and AT1-AA in serum from the pre-eclampsia group (p < 0.05). In contrast, there was no correlation between C3aR and C5aR in the placenta and AT1-AA in serum in the pre-eclampsia group (p > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Increased C3a, C5a and AT1-AA in the serum provide indirect evidence that AT1-AA-mediated activation contributes to activate complement, which is a key mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of severe pre-eclampsia."
26485556,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26485556/,"INTRODUCTION: The most important tool in any infection control program is good hand hygiene. Despite recognizing that hand hygiene is crucial in reducing infection rates, hand hygiene compliance remains suboptimal. This study was designed to determine hand hygiene compliance, before and after an educational intervention and its impact on hospital infection rates.
METHOD: The study was done in neonatal intensive care unit of an educational hospital. All healthcare providers working in the unit at the time of study were trained on importance of hand hygiene and methods of hand hygiene observation; after that hand washing compliance controlled by a physician during postintervention phase. Hand hygiene compliance, healthcare associated infection and mortality rates compared before and after educational intervention.
RESULTS: Compliance of health-care workers for all hand hygiene opportunities combined was 30% before intervention and improved to 70% in postintervention. In postintervention phase, healthcare associated infection rates and mortality rates decreased significantly as the hand hygiene compliance improved.
CONCLUSIONS: Good control of hand hygiene compliance by physician after an educational program may have good effect in healthcare associated infections control in neonatal intensive care unit."
26485622,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26485622/,"BACKGROUND: There is a debate regarding the management of ovarian immature teratomas (ITs). In adult women, postoperative chemotherapy is standard except for stage I, grade 1 disease, whereas surgery alone is standard in pediatric patients. To determine the role of chemotherapy, a pooled analysis of pediatric and adult clinical trials was conducted.
METHODS: Data from 7 pediatric trials and 2 adult trials were merged in the Malignant Germ Cell International Collaborative data set. Four trials included patients with newly diagnosed pure ovarian ITs and were selected (Pediatric Oncology Group/Children's Cancer Group Intergroup Study (INT 0106), Second UKCCSG Germ Cell Tumor Study (GC2), Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG 0078 and GOG 0090). Adult and pediatric trials were analyzed separately. The primary outcome measures were event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS).
RESULTS: One hundred seventy-nine patients were included (98 pediatric patients and 81 adult patients). Ninety pediatric patients were treated with surgery alone, whereas all adult patients received chemotherapy. The 5-year EFS and OS were 91% and 99%, respectively, for the pediatric cohort and 87% and 93%, respectively, for the adults. There were no relapses in grade 1 patients, regardless of the stage or age. Only 1 adult patient with a grade 2 IT relapsed. Among grade 3 patients, the 5-year EFS was 0.92 (0.72-0.98) for stage I/II and 0.52 (0.22-0.75) for stage III in the pediatric cohort (P = .005) and 0.91 (0.69-0.98) for stage I/II and 0.65 (0.39-0.83) for stage III/IV in the adult cohort (P = .01). Postoperative chemotherapy did not decrease relapses in the pediatric cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: The grade was the most important risk factor for relapse in ovarian ITs. Among grade 3 patients, the stage was significantly associated with relapse. Adjuvant chemotherapy did not decrease relapses in the pediatric cohort; its role in adults remains unresolved. Cancer 2016;122:230-237. © 2015 American Cancer Society."
26485670,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26485670/,"BACKGROUND: Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) is an established treatment after cardiac arrest and growing evidence supports its use as neuroprotective treatment in stroke. Only few and heterogeneous studies exist on the effect of hypothermia in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). A novel approach of early and prolonged TH and its influence on key complications in poor-grade SAH, vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) was evaluated.
METHODS: This observational matched controlled study included 36 poor-grade (Hunt and Hess Scale >3 and World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies Scale >3) SAH patients. Twelve patients received early TH (<48 h after ictus), mild (35°C), prolonged (7 ± 1 days) and were matched to 24 patients from the prospective SAH database. Vasospasm was diagnosed by angiography, macrovascular spasm serially evaluated by Doppler sonography and DCI was defined as new infarction on follow-up CT. Functional outcome was assessed at 6 months by modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and categorized as favorable (mRS score 0-2) versus unfavorable (mRS score 3-6) outcome.
RESULTS: Angiographic vasospasm was present in 71.0% of patients. TH neither influenced occurrence nor duration, but the degree of macrovascular spasm as well as peak spastic velocities were significantly reduced (p < 0.05). Frequency of DCI was 87.5% in non-TH vs. 50% in TH-treated patients, translating into a relative risk reduction of 43% and preventive risk ratio of 0.33 (95% CI 0.14-0.77, p = 0.036). Favorable functional outcome was twice as frequent in TH-treated patients 66.7 vs. 33.3% of non-TH (p = 0.06).
CONCLUSION: Early and prolonged TH was associated with a reduced degree of macrovascular spasm and significantly decreased occurrence of DCI, possibly ameliorating functional outcome. TH may represent a promising neuroprotective therapy possibly targeting multiple pathways of DCI development, notably macrovascular spasm, which strongly warrants further evaluation of its clinical impact."
26485756,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26485756/,"BACKGROUND: Lynch syndrome (LS) is the most common hereditary colorectal cancer (CRC) syndrome, caused by germline mutations in MisMatch Repair (MMR) genes, particularly in MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6. Patients with LS seem to have a more favourable prognosis than those with sporadic CRC, although the prognostic impact of different mutation types is unknown. Aim of our study is to compare survival outcomes of different types of MMR mutations in patients with LS-related CRC.
METHODS: 302 CRC patients were prospectively selected on the basis of Amsterdam or Revised Bethesda criteria to undergo genetic testing: direct sequencing of DNA and MLPA were used to examine the entire MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6 coding sequence. Patients were classified as mutation-positive or negative according to the genetic testing result.
RESULTS: A deleterious MMR mutation was found in 38/302 patients. Median overall survival (OS) was significantly higher in mutation-positive vs mutation-negative patients (102.6 vs 77.7 months, HR:0.63, 95%CI:0.46-0.89, p = 0.0083). Different types of mutation were significantly related with OS: missense or splicing-site mutations were associated with better OS compared with rearrangement, frameshift or non-sense mutations (132.5 vs 82.5 months, HR:0.46, 95%CI:0.16-0.82, p = 0.0153).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms improved OS for LS-patients compared with mutation-negative CRC patients. In addition, not all mutations could be considered equal: the better prognosis in CRC patients with MMR pathogenic missense or splicing site mutation could be due to different functional activity of the encoded MMR protein. This matter should be investigated by use of functional assays in the future."
26486453,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26486453/,"BACKGROUND: The Tokyo guidelines provide criteria for the diagnosis and classification of acute cholecystitis in three severity grades. However, no data exists on the predictive value of these guidelines. The aim of this study was to analyze the accuracy of the Tokyo guidelines as a predicting parameter for the severity of acute cholecystitis in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the charts of patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis in a primary care hospital within a five-year period was performed. The preoperative severity grades were compared with the histological extent of inflammation.
RESULTS: One hundred thirty-eight patients; 79 with severity grade I, 33 with grade II and 26 with grade III were analyzed. The incidence of uncomplicated cholecystitis decreased with increasing severity grade, while the incidence of complicated cholecystitis increased with increasing severity. However, complicated cholecystitis was evident in an unexpectedly high number of cases with severity grade I. There was a significant correlation (χ (2)(1) = 10. 43, p = 0.01) between the preoperative severity grade and the extent of gallbladder inflammation on histopathology. Conversion to open surgery (14 vs. 5, p = 0.002) and complications (17 vs. 7, p = 0.001) were significantly higher in patients with preoperative severity grade II/III compared to patients with severity grade I.
CONCLUSION: Worsening clinical severity correlated significantly with worseing pathology, findings from blood test and clinical outcomes; rates of conversion and morbidity. However, the Tokyo guidelines may have a tendency to underestimate the extent of inflammation in male patients with severity grade I and over estimate the difficulty of dissection in severity grade II."
26486995,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26486995/,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the outcomes of robotic partial nephrectomy (RPN) in patients where nephron-sparing surgery would have mandated a large amount of renal volume resection.
METHODS: Patients undergoing RPN with extensive volume resection (≥30%), from 2006 to 2014, were identified. Pre- and postoperative CT/MRI-based volumetric assessment of the operated kidney was performed. To address the possible benefits of RPN, we matched this cohort to patients undergoing laparoscopic radical nephrectomy (LRN). The groups were matched for tumor size, R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry score, age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index (ACCI), and preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Demographics, perioperative, functional, and oncologic outcomes were compared between the groups. Multivariable analysis of factors predicting chronic kidney disease (CKD) upstaging (type of surgery, R.E.N.A.L. score, ACCI, and baseline eGFR) was performed.
RESULTS: In total, 52 patients undergoing RPN were matched to 52 LRN patients. The median R.E.N.A.L. score (interquartile range) was 9 (9-10) for both groups. Demographic variables were comparable between the groups. The median renal volume preservation in the RPN group was 57.0% (47.2-67.2). The rates of overall and major complications were comparable between RPN and LRN. The RPN group had higher overall eGFR preservation (75.8% vs 68.5%; p = 0.01) and a lower rate of CKD upstaging (26.9% vs 50.6%; p = 0.001). On multivariable analysis, LRN and baseline eGFR were significant predictors of CKD upstaging (odds ratio [OR] 4.26; 95% CI [1.80-10.12]; p = 0.001 and OR 0.98; 95% CI [0.96-0.99]; p = 0.03, respectively). During the median follow-up time of 21 (9-36) months, local recurrence, metastasis, and cancer-specific and overall survival were comparable between RPN and LRN.
CONCLUSION: RPN requiring extensive volume resection provides renal functional preservation without significant increase in surgical complications or compromising short-term oncologic outcomes."

However, it is a difficult and complex procedure with a steep learning curve. The aim of this study was to evaluate the learning curve of LLR at our institutions since 2008.
METHODS: One hundred and twenty-six consecutive LLRs were included from May 2008 to December 2014. Patient characteristics, operative data, and surgical outcomes were collected prospectively and analyzed.
RESULTS: The median tumor size was 25 mm (range 5-90 mm), and 96 % of the resected tumors were malignant. 41.3 % (52/126) of patients had pathologically proven liver cirrhosis. The median operation time was 216 min (range 40-602 min) with a median blood loss of 100 ml (range 20-2300 ml). The median length of hospital stay was 4 days (range 2-10 days). Six major postoperative complications occurred in this series, and there was no 90-day postoperative mortality. Regarding the incidence of major operative events including operation time longer than 300 min, perioperative blood loss above 500 ml, and major postoperative complications, the learning curve [as evaluated by the cumulative sum (CUSUM) technique] showed its first reverse after 22 cases. The indication of laparoscopic resection in this series extended after 60 cases to include tumors located in difficult locations (segments 4a, 7, 8) and major hepatectomy. CUSUM showed that the incidence of major operative events proceeded to increase again, and the second reverse was noted after an additional 40 cases of experience. Location of the tumor in a difficult area emerged as a significant predictor of major operative events.
CONCLUSIONS: In carefully selected patients, CUSUM analysis showed 22 cases were needed to overcome the learning curve for minor LLR."
26487580,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26487580/,"BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence has shown that cancer cell metabolism differs from that of normal cells. However, up to now it is not clear whether different cancer types are characterized by a specific metabolite profile. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate whether the plasma metabolic phenotype allows to discriminate between lung and breast cancer.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum of plasma is divided into 110 integration regions, representing the metabolic phenotype. These integration regions reflect the relative metabolite concentrations and were used to train a classification model in discriminating between 80 female breast cancer patients and 54 female lung cancer patients, all with an adenocarcinoma. The validity of the model was examined by permutation testing and by classifying an independent validation cohort of 60 female breast cancer patients and 81 male lung cancer patients, all with an adenocarcinoma.
RESULTS: The model allows to classify 99% of the breast cancer patients and 93% of the lung cancer patients correctly with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.96 and can be validated in the independent cohort with a sensitivity of 89%, a specificity of 82% and an AUC of 0.94. Decreased levels of sphingomyelin and phosphatidylcholine (phospholipids with choline head group) and phospholipids with short, unsaturated fatty acid chains next to increased levels of phospholipids with long, saturated fatty acid chains seem to indicate that cell membranes of lung tumors are more rigid and less sensitive to lipid peroxidation. The other discriminating metabolites are pointing to a more pronounced response of the body to the Warburg effect for lung cancer.
CONCLUSION: Metabolic phenotyping of plasma allows to discriminate between lung and breast cancer, indicating that the metabolite profile reflects more than a general cancer marker.

METHODS: Evidence for cost and mortality/morbidity risk of bariatric surgery and obesity-related diseases was evaluated determining equivalency point of absolute incremental mortality risk by BMI and risks associated with bariatric surgery. A stochastic model was developed evaluating costs related to surgical procedure at a given BMI.
RESULTS: Bariatric surgery produces significant lifetime cost savings associated with diabetes, gallstones, hypertension, high cholesterol, colon cancer, heart disease, and stroke in men at BMI 30 kg/m2 for laparoscopic gastric bypass. For women, laparoscopic gastric bypass saves cost at BMI 32 kg/m2 and laparoscopic gastric banding at BMI 37 kg/m2. In white men, relative to single-year mortality risks by BMI, surgical intervention becomes risk-beneficial at BMI 25 kg/m2 for laparoscopic gastric banding, BMI 27 kg/m2 for laparoscopic gastric bypass procedure and open gastric banding, and BMI 37 kg/m2 for open gastric bypass. Risk benefit for African-American men by procedure occurs at BMI <25 kg/m2, BMI 27 kg/m2, and BMI 42 kg/m2, respectively. In white women, surgical intervention is beneficial at BMI 25.5 kg/m2 (laparoscopic gastric banding), BMI 28.5 kg/m2 (laparoscopic gastric bypass procedure), and BMI 45 kg/m2 (open gastric banding). Risk benefit for black women by procedure occurs at BMI 27.5 kg/m2, BMI 33.5 kg/m2, and BMI 50+ kg/m2, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Risk and cost benefit suggest surgical guidelines should be reconsidered. Threshold for bariatric surgery should be redefined to BMI 35 kg/m2 or BMI 30 kg/m2 with comorbidities."

RESULTS: Fifty-four biopsies (27 cryobiopsies) from 18 patients (11 men) were reviewed. A median of 3 (range, 2-5) and 10 (range, 6-12) specimens were obtained with cryobiopsies and conventional biopsies, respectively. Cryobiopsies were larger and contained more alveoli (P < .001, both) and small airways (P = .04). Conventional biopsies showed more fresh alveolar hemorrhage (procedural) and crush artifact/atelectasis (P < .001, both). Cryobiopsies contained more pulmonary veins and venules (P < .001). There was no significant difference between the types of biopsies with respect to the reviewers' agreement on grades of rejection. Complications were more frequent in the cryobiopsy group, though the difference was not statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: Cryobiopsies of lung allografts are larger and have less artifact. However, complications occur and should be considered. Three cryobiopsy specimens appear sufficient for histopathologic evaluation of lung allografts."
26488168,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26488168/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a school-based health promotion program affects children's weekend physical activity and whether this effect varies according to socioeconomic-status.
METHODS: This was a quasi-experimental trial of school-based programs on physical activity levels implemented in disadvantaged neighborhoods in Alberta, Canada. In 2009 and 2011, 7 full days of pedometer data were collected from cross-sectional samples of grade 5 students (age 10-11 years) from 10 intervention schools in low-socioeconomic neighbourhoods and 20 comparison schools in middle-socioeconomic neighbourhoods. Multilevel models assessed differences in step-counts between intervention and comparison groups over-time by weight (objectively measured) and socioeconomic status subgroups.
RESULTS: In 2009, children from intervention schools were less active on weekends relative to comparison schools (9212 vs. 11186 steps/day p<0.01). Two years later, daily step-counts on weekend days among children in low socioeconomic intervention schools increased such that they approximated those of children from middle socioeconomic comparison schools (12148 vs. 12121 steps/day p = 0.96). The relative difference in steps between intervention and comparison schools on weekends reduced from -21.4% to 0.2% following the intervention. The normalization of weekend step counts was similar for normal weight (-21.4% to +2.0%) and overweight (-19.1 to +3.9%) children, and was balanced across socioeconomic subgroups.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that school-based health promotion is effective for reducing inequities in physical activity levels outside school hours. Investments in school-based health promotion lead to behavior modification beyond the school environment.

26488178,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26488178/,"BACKGROUND: In contrast to the vast majority of pharmaceuticals on the market, antiplatelet agents are widely prescribed in a uniform, 'one size fits all' manner, without conventional dose adjustments. However, strong evidence yielded from clinical trials repeatedly suggests that patients with a low body weight (LBW), the elderly and those with renal or hepatic impairment may benefit from reduced doses, while younger, heavier patients, males and diabetics may benefit from a dose escalation. Vorapaxar, a thrombin protease-activated receptor-1 inhibitor, has been tested in the TRA2P and TRACER clinical trials, but its efficacy and safety in patients with a LBW is unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of LBW on primary end point rates (PER) and bleeding risk after vorapaxar, as yielded from the TRA2P and TRACER secondary FDA review.
RESULTS: The LBW (<60 kg) groups in TRA2P (n = 1,852; 7%) and TRACER (n = 1,046; 8%) were small. However, the PER repeatedly suggested inferiority of vorapaxar over placebo in both the successful TRA2P study (10.6 vs. 8.4%; p = 0.012) and the failed TRACER study (19.3 vs. 18.2%; p = not significant). In TRA2P, the PER monotonically escalated with increasing weight for placebo, while those in the vorapaxar arm formed a flat U- or J-shaped distribution across the weight quintiles. In TRACER, the PER by weight quintile appear much higher, but also more random than in TRA2P. The bleeding rates in TRA2P were higher for the 2 lowest-weight quintiles with both placebo and vorapaxar. In TRACER, bleeding rates were more than doubled when compared to TRA2P, and they varied little by weight quintile, with a slight decrease for the heaviest patients in the placebo population and being the highest in the 2 lowest-weight quintiles after vorapaxar.
CONCLUSION: The FDA analyses revealed no definite proof that LBW is associated with reduced efficacy of vorapaxar. While these data are striking, they can be explained by better outcomes in LBW placebo patients already sufficiently treated with dual-antiplatelet therapy. In contrast to efficacy, both TRA2P and TRACER definitely suggest that bleeding rates after vorapaxar are higher in patients with LBW. Dose adjustment for antiplatelet agents may soon become a reality."
26488204,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26488204/,"BACKGROUND: Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS) necessitates administration of corticosteroids or corticoid-sparing agents in 60% of the cases for prolonged periods resulting in serious adverse effects.
METHODS: To avoid these complications, we investigated the efficacy and safety of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in our retrospective single-center study with 15 patients presenting with complicated courses of INS and aspired to estimate a cutoff level for mycophenolic acid-area under the curve (MPA-AUC) values, which can predict relapses with high sensitivity.
RESULTS: Seven of 15 patients stayed in remission while receiving MMF. Average frequency of relapses was 1.39 (0.28-2.5) per year. In case of relapses, patients had lower predose and estimated AUC0-12 levels of MPA (P = 0.02 and 0.001, respectively). Based on the results of receiver operating characteristic analysis, we consider an estimated MPA-AUC0-12 lower than 44.6 mg·h·L(-1) as a risk factor for future relapses (91% sensitivity, 57% specificity, P = 0.06) because the prevalence of relapse is significantly lower (0.07 versus 0.5, P = 0.02), if the estimated MPA-AUC0-12 is >44.6 mg·h·L(-1). During MMF administration, we did not detect any adverse event requiring discontinuation of treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we demonstrate MMF as an alternative treatment for children with complicated INS to maintain remission without serious side effects. Furthermore, we propose a higher therapeutic target range of MPA-AUC0-12 (>45 mg·h·L(-1)) than used in transplanted children underlining the crucial role of therapeutic drug monitoring."
26488317,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26488317/,"BACKGROUND: Many centers advocate aggressive lower extremity deep venous thrombosis (DVT) screening using ultrasound (LUS) for patients meeting high-risk criteria. We hypothesized that a high-risk screening protocol is impractical and costly to implement.
METHODS: The University of Virginia's trauma database was queried to identify 6,656 patients admitted between 2009 and 2013. Patient characteristics and outcomes were recorded. Multivariate analyses were performed on patients who underwent LUS to assess the association between patient characteristics and the development of DVT. A predictive model for DVT was applied to the entire population to determine performance and resources required for implementation.
RESULTS: Overall, 2,350 (35.3%) of admitted patients underwent LUS. A total of 146 patients (6.2%) developed DVT. Patients who underwent LUS were significantly older (54.5 years vs. 50.4 years, p < 0.0001), had higher Injury Severity Scores (ISSs) (13.5 vs. 8.6, p < 0.0001), and had longer admissions to the intensive care unit (5.6 days vs. 0.9 days, p < 0.0001). Backward selection multivariable logistic regression identified intensive care unit length of stay, transfusion of blood products, spinal cord injury, and pelvic fracture to be associated with DVT (c statistic, 0.76). The model was applied to the entire population to evaluate probability of DVT (c statistic, 0.87). Predictive performance and costs were determined using a cost per LUS of $228. The most sensitive threshold for screening would detect 53% of DVTs, require screening of 26% of all trauma patients, and cost nearly $600,000 to implement during the study period.
CONCLUSION: Although a predictive model identified high-risk criteria for the development of DVT at our institution, the model demonstrated poor sensitivity and positive predictive value. These results suggest that implementing a high-risk screening protocol in trauma patients would require a costly and burdensome commitment of resources and that high-risk DVT screening protocols may not be practical or cost-effective for trauma patients.

26488611,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26488611/,"BACKGROUND: Front of pack (FOP) nutrition labels are concise labels located on the front of food packages that provide truncated nutrition information. These labels are rapidly gaining prominence worldwide, presumably because they attract attention and their simplified formats enable rapid comparisons of nutritional value.
METHODS: Eye tracking was conducted as US consumers interacted with actual packages with and without FOP labels to (1) assess if the presence of an FOP label increases attention to nutrition information when viewers are not specifically tasked with nutrition-related goals; and (2) study the effect of FOP presence on consumer use of more comprehensive, traditional nutrition information presented in the Nutritional Facts Panel (NFP), a mandatory label for most packaged foods in the US.
RESULTS: Our results indicate that colored FOP labels enhanced the probability that any nutrition information was attended, and resulted in faster detection and longer viewing of nutrition information. However, for cereal packages, these benefits were at the expense of attention to the more comprehensive NFP. Our results are consistent with a potential short cut effect of FOP labels, such that if an FOP was present, participants spent less time attending the more comprehensive NFP. For crackers, FOP labels increased time spent attending to nutrition information, but we found no evidence that their presence reduced the time spent on the nutrition information in the NFP.
CONCLUSIONS: The finding that FOP labels increased attention to overall nutrition information by people who did not have an explicit nutritional goal suggests that these labels may have an advantage in conveying nutrition information to a wide segment of the population. However, for some food types this benefit may come with a short-cut effect; that is, decreased attention to more comprehensive nutrition information. These results have implications for policy and warrant further research into the mechanisms by which FOP labels impact use of nutrition information by consumers for different foods."
26488771,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26488771/,"BACKGROUND: Screening for fetal growth restriction (FGR) is a major component of prenatal care. We investigated whether the presence of maternal and pregnancy risk factors for FGR improves the antenatal suspicion of FGR for infants born small-for-gestational age (SGA) as well as their impact on screening specificity.
METHODS: Data are from a representative sample of births from the 2010 French National Perinatal Survey (n = 14 100). Detection of FGR was determined by a suspicion of FGR noted in medical charts. Analyses were performed for singleton infants with birthweight under the 10th percentile (SGA), under the 3rd percentile (severely SGA), and above the 10th percentile (false positives) of French references. We studied risk factors for FGR (medical and obstetric conditions, advanced maternal age, nulliparity, body mass index and smoking) using multivariable Poisson regression to derive adjusted risk ratios (aRR).
RESULTS: Of SGA infants, 21.7% were suspected of FGR. The presence of obstetric and medical risk factors for FGR was associated with higher suspicion among SGA infants [RR 2.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7, 2.7]. However, despite the presence of these factors, 60% and 40% of SGA and severely SGA infants, respectively, were not suspected of FGR. Two per cent of normal birthweight infants were suspected of FGR, increasing to 5% when obstetric and medical risk factors were present. Smoking and older maternal age were unrelated to suspicion while females were more likely to be suspected of FGR.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that better risk assessment could improve antenatal identification of FGR. Sex-specific fetal growth references should be used to avoid systematic bias linked to sex."
26488831,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26488831/,"PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To examine the association between routine physical activity and self-rated health status in older adults with cancer..
DESIGN: Cross-sectional.
SETTING: Community-dwelling older adult survivors who completed a screening tool and subsequent detailed interview from the 2004 wave of the National Long-Term Care Survey, a nationally representative study of Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years or older.
SAMPLE: 251 older adult cancer survivors who regularly engaged in routine physical activity.
METHODS: Participants were asked about chronic health conditions, depression, activities of daily living, participation in physical activities, self-rated health status, and sociodemographic characteristics. A weighted ordered probit model was used to estimate variables that predict self-reported health status.
MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Self-rated health status and participation in physical activity.
FINDINGS: Age and higher education level were found to be significant correlates of health status (p < 0.05) in the first model. Although education was not significant in subsequent models, age, functional disability, and depression all were identified as significant correlates of health status (p < 0.01). In the final model, in which moderate and vigorous activity participation were entered, older adult survivors who engaged in vigorous physical activity showed higher levels of health status than those who engaged in light physical activity (p < 0.05), but number of chronic health conditions was not significantly associated with health status.
CONCLUSIONS: The association between vigorous activity and health status points to the primacy of physical activity within a post-cancer treatment health regimen. .
IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Health programs and policies need to address physical activity to improve the overall well-being of older adult cancer survivors."
26489709,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26489709/,"BACKGROUND: Previous research shows that only 10-30% of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are malignant. Nonetheless, some reports suggest that all of them have some degree of potential for malignancy. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is a useful technique for differentiation of subepithelial lesions in the gastrointestinal tract. We explored EUS characteristics that might predict the malignancy potential of GISTs.
METHODS: In this retrospective review of the medical records from 1999 through 2007, patients who had gastric stromal tumors diagnosed prior to surgery using EUS were enrolled. The EUS images, procedure records and tissue histopathology were reviewed. All patients were positive for C-kit.
RESULTS: Of the 110 patients enrolled, 57 were males, and 53 were females. Most (67%) of the GISTs were located in the gastric body. The lesion size ranged from 6.3 to 150 mm (mean ± SD: 39.73 ± 22.49 mm). The high-risk GIST group had 19 (17.3%) patients, the intermediate-risk group had 12 (10.9%) patients and the low/very low-risk group had 79 (71.8%) patients. Thirty patients had cystic lesions (27.3%), while six patients had calcification in the lesion (5.5%). Additionally, 27 patients (24.5%) had surface ulceration visible on endoscopy. GISTs at high risk for malignancy were highly associated with lesion size (p < 0.0001), cystic change (p = 0.015) and surface ulceration (p = 0.036) but not with calcification (p = 0.667). We also found that mitosis was associated with lesion size (p < 0.0001) rather than other parameters. Age was not predictive of malignancy potential (p = 0.316). However, tumor size is the only one independent risk factor for malignancy (p ≤ 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: The preliminary results show that large gastric GISTs with cystic change and surface ulceration may associate with a risk of malignancy, warranting more aggressive management. Nevertheless, the tumor size is more important than other factors."
26489744,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26489744/,"BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is associated with serious complications, such as staple line (SL) leaks and bleeding. In order to prevent the occurrence of these complications, surgeons have advocated the need to strengthen the staple line. The aim of this randomized controlled study was to compare the efficacy of three different ways of strengthening of the SL in LSG in preventing surgical post-operative complications.
METHODS: Between April 2012 and December 2014, 600 patients (pts) scheduled for LSG were prospectively randomized into groups without SL reinforcement (group A) or with SL reinforcement including fibrin glue coverage (group B), or oversewn SL with imbricating absorbable (Monocryl™; group C) or barbed (V lock®) running suture (group D). Primary endpoints were post-operative leaks, bleeding, and stenosis, while secondary outcomes consisted of the time to perform the staple line reinforcement (SLR) and total operative time.
RESULTS: Mean SLR operative time was lower for group B (3.4 ± 1.3 min) compared with that for groups C (26.8 ± 8.5 min) and D (21.1 ± 8.4 min) (p < 0.0001). Mean total operative time was 100.7 ± 16.4 min (group A), 104.4 ± 22.1 min (group B), 126.2 ± 18.9 min (group C), and 124.6 ± 22.8 (group D) (p < 0.0001). Post-operative leaks, bleeding, and stenosis were recorded in 14 pts (2.3 %), 5 pts (0.8 %), and 7 pts (1.1 %), respectively, without statistical difference between the groups.
CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that SLR during LSG, with an imbricating or non-imbricating running suture or with fibrin glue, is an unrewarding surgical act with the sole effect of prolonging the operative time."
26489842,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26489842/,"BACKGROUND: To manage incontinence following tumor surgery, prostate cancer patients are advised to perform pelvic floor exercise (PFE). Patients' self-efficacy and support from partners were shown to facilitate PFE. Whereas support may enhance self-efficacy (enabling function), self-efficacy may also cultivate support (cultivation function).
PURPOSE: Cross-lagged inter-relationships among self-efficacy, support, and PFE were investigated.
METHOD: Post-surgery patient-reported received support, self-efficacy, PFE, and partner-reported provided support were assessed from 175 couples at four times. Autoregressive models tested interrelations among variables, using either patients' or partners' reports of support.
RESULTS: Models using patients' data revealed positive associations between self-efficacy and changes in received support, which predicted increased PFE. Using partners' accounts of support provided, these associations were partially cross-validated. Furthermore, partner-provided support was related with increases in patients' self-efficacy.
CONCLUSION: Patients' self-efficacy may cultivate partners' support provision for patients' PFE, whereas evidence of an enabling function of support as a predictor of self-efficacy was inconsistent."
26489844,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26489844/,"BACKGROUND: Prior research suggests that stronger racial/ethnic identification offsets negative effects of discrimination on substance use. Yet research in this area and on whether gender modifies this association is limited for Latina/os.
PURPOSE: The purpose of the present study is to examine whether different sources of discrimination (everyday and racial/ethnic) are associated with substance use (alcohol use disorder, smoking), if racial/ethnic identity buffers this association, and the potential moderating role of gender among these variables.
METHODS: We present cross-sectional, US population-based data from the Latina/o adult sample (1427 females and 1127 males) of the National Latino and Asian American Study. Respondents completed self-reported measures of everyday and racial/ethnic discrimination, racial/ethnic identity, smoking status, and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV) lifetime alcohol use disorder.
RESULTS: Weighted logistic regression analyses showed that before inclusion of three-way interactions and adjusting for covariates, everyday discrimination predicted increased risk for any DSM-IV lifetime alcohol use disorders. Moderation analyses revealed that the effect of everyday discrimination on the risk of being a current smoker was strongest for Latino men with high levels of racial/ethnic identity compared to those with low racial/ethnic identity. No differences were noted among Latino women. There were no main or interaction effects of racial/ethnic discrimination for any substance use outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest differential associations for type of discrimination and outcome and that the role of racial/ethnic identity is gender-specific for smoking, appearing particularly detrimental for Latino men reporting high levels of racial/ethnic identity."

METHODS: A total of 287 consecutive patients treated with breast-conserving surgery from 2010 to 2012 were identified retrospectively. The risk calculator was applied to each patient to generate an individual risk profile. Risk calculations were then compared with actual outcomes. The performance of the risk calculator was evaluated using 2 metrics: the Brier score and c statistic.
RESULTS: The NSQIP calculator performed adequately for all complications, with Brier scores less than .05. However, 37 patients (12.9%) returned to the operating room for oncologic indications. Twenty-nine patients (10.1%) had positive margins, whereas 8 patients (2.8%) returned due to an upgrade in diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: When considering return to the operating room for oncologic management, the observed rate of 13.9% is significantly higher than the NSQIP prediction. This deviation must be addressed when using the NSQIP risk calculator model during preoperative risk discussion."
26490054,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26490054/,"PURPOSE: An oncologically effective total mesorectal excision (TME) still represents a technical challenge, especially in the presence of a low rectal cancer and anatomical restraints such as obesity or narrow pelvis. Recently, few reports have shown that transanal TME was feasible and associated with good outcomes. Nevertheless, a widespread employment of the technique has yet to happen due to the doubts about the reproducibility of the results outside a tertiary specialized center.
METHODS: Between February 2014 and June 2015, patients with low rectal cancer underwent a transanal TME with laparoscopic assistance. The end points included the oncologic adequacy of the mesorectal excision and the perioperative outcomes.
RESULTS: Eleven patients (9 male, median age 70.5 years) with proven low rectal cancer were enrolled in the study. The median distance of the tumor from the anal verge was 5 cm (2-7). Four patients (36.4 %) received preoperative chemoradiation. The median operative time was 360 min (275-445). Postoperative morbidity (36.4 %) included one (9.1 %) anastomotic leak requiring a reoperation. The median length of hospital stay was 8 days (3-28). The median distance from the circumferential and distal resection margins were, respectively, 5 (1-20) and 10 (5-20) mm, and the mean number of harvested lymph nodes was 21.7 (11-50). All cases had a complete or nearly complete mesorectal plane of surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: Although technically challenging, the initial results suggest that transanal TME could be a feasible, oncologically safe, and reproducible operation. However, more robust studies are required to assess the short- and long-term outcomes."
26490099,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26490099/,"OBJECTIVES: Smokers report that smoking is therapeutic; a recent meta-analysis suggests the contrary. However, the association in that review may be explained by group-membership bias and confounding. Propensity score matching (PSM) aims to produce causal estimates from observational data. We examined the association between cessation and change in mental health before and after PSM.
DESIGN: A secondary analysis of prospective data from 5 placebo-controlled randomised trials for smoking reduction.
PARTICIPANTS: All participants were adult smokers and had smoked for at least 3 years. Participants were excluded if they were pregnant, breast feeding, under psychiatric care, deemed to be unfit by a general practitioner or part of a cessation programme. In total, 937 participants provided smoking data at both 6-month and 12-month follow-ups. Of these, 68 were confirmed as abstinent at both 6 and 12 months and 589 as continuous smokers at both follow-ups.
PRIMARY OUTCOME: Change in mental health (36-item Short Form Survey (SF-36), scored 0-100) from baseline (while all participants were smokers) to 12-month follow-up (after cessation) was compared between quitters and continuing smokers with and without adjustment, and after PSM.
RESULTS: Before matching, quitters' mental health scores improved compared with continuing smokers', the mean difference and 95% CI was 5.5 (1.6 to 9.4). After adjustment, the difference was 4.5 (0.6 to 8.5), and after PSM, the difference was 3.4 (-2.2 to 8.9).
CONCLUSIONS: Improvements in mental health after smoking cessation may be partly but not completely explained by group membership bias and confounding."
26490659,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26490659/,"BACKGROUND: TP53 gene mutation is widely known as one of the determinants of impaired chemosensitivity. p53 is a tumor-suppressor protein in humans encoded by the TP53 gene. Some studies have shown that TP53 gene mutation and accumulation of the p53 protein are closely related with serum anti-p53 antibody positivity. This study aimed to evaluate the predictive significance of the serum p53 antibody status in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients treated with fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, plus bevacizumab as first-line chemotherapy.
METHODS: Ninety patients treated with fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin plus bevacizumab as first-line chemotherapy were enrolled, including 70 whose KRAS genotype was revealed at the beginning of treatment. Before chemotherapy initiation, the serum p53 antibody level was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using MESACUP® anti-p53 test kits. The cutoff value for positivity was 1.3 U/mL, as calculated previously. The KRAS genotype of the tumor samples was analyzed using the Luminex® assay.
RESULTS: Overall response rates of Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria were 77.7 % (42/54) in anti-p53-negative patients and 69.4 % (25/36) in anti-p53-positive patients. The odds ratio was 1.07. Median overall survival was 36.1 months in the anti-p53-positive patients, and not available in the anti-p53-negative patients (hazard ratio, 0.81; 95 % confidence interval, 0.37-1.77; P = 0.61). The corresponding values for median progression-free survival were 13.3 months and 14.6 months (hazard ratio, 0.69; 95 % confidence interval, 0.41-1.17; P = 0.17), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Serum anti-p53 antibody positivity did not predict chemoresistance in mCRC treated with fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, plus bevacizumab as first-line chemotherapy."
26490730,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26490730/,"INTRODUCTION: Reduced-port laparoscopic surgery is a novel minimally invasive surgery. However, reduced-port surgery for ulcerative colitis (UC) remains controversial. Here, we describe the clinical outcomes of single-incision plus one port laparoscopic surgery (SILS + 1) for medically uncontrolled UC.
METHODS: Between May 2011 and September 2014, 10 UC patients underwent SILS + 1 port surgery. All procedures were performed with the use of a SILS port and either a 5-mm or a 12-mm port placed at the planned ileostomy site.
RESULTS: The median age of patients was 32 years (range, 22-53 years). Six patients underwent two-stage SILS + 1 port restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, two patients underwent SILS + 1 total proctocolectomy, and the remaining two patients underwent SILS + 1 subtotal colectomy with subsequent three-stage SILS + 1 ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. The median operative time was 363.1 min (range, 253-465 min) and the median estimated blood loss was 29 mL (range, 0-100 mL). There were no conversions or additional ports required. Two patients previously underwent SILS + 1 subtotal colectomy, and in one of those patients, SILS + 1 ileal pouch-anal anastomosis was performed successfully 6 months after the previous surgery. There were no intra-abdominal adhesions, and no extra wounds were necessary because the previous stoma site had been used to access the SILS port. The median postoperative period was 24 months, during which five patients had their ileostomies closed. No patients reported occasional minor daily soiling or the need to wear a pad.
CONCLUSION: Reduced-port laparoscopic surgery for medically uncontrolled UC is a feasible and safe procedure when performed by skilled surgeons."
26490878,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26490878/,"BACKGROUND: Every year more than 200,000 new leprosy cases are registered globally. This number has been fairly stable over the past 8 years. WHO has set a target to interrupt the transmission of leprosy globally by 2020. The aim of this study is to investigate whether this target, interpreted as global elimination, is feasible given the current control strategy. We focus on the three most important endemic countries, India, Brazil and Indonesia, which together account for more than 80 % of all newly registered leprosy cases.
METHODS: We used the existing individual-based model SIMCOLEP to predict future trends of leprosy incidence given the current control strategy in each country. SIMCOLEP simulates the spread of M. leprae in a population that is structured in households. Current control consists of passive and active case detection, and multidrug therapy (MDT). Predictions of leprosy incidence were made for each country as well as for one high-endemic region within each country: Chhattisgarh (India), Pará State (Brazil) and Madura (Indonesia). Data for model quantification came from: National Leprosy Elimination Program (India), SINAN database (Brazil), and Netherlands Leprosy Relief (Indonesia).
RESULTS: Our projections of future leprosy incidence all show a downward trend. In 2020, the country-level leprosy incidence has decreased to 6.2, 6.1 and 3.3 per 100,000 in India, Brazil and Indonesia, respectively, meeting the elimination target of less than 10 per 100,000. However, elimination may not be achieved in time for the high-endemic regions. The leprosy incidence in 2020 is predicted to be 16.2, 21.1 and 19.3 per 100,000 in Chhattisgarh, Pará and Madura, respectively, and the target may only be achieved in another 5 to 10 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Our predictions show that although country-level elimination is reached by 2020, leprosy is likely to remain a problem in the high-endemic regions (i.e. states, districts and provinces with multimillion populations), which account for most of the cases in a country."
26491128,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26491128/,"BACKGROUND: Age and peripheral microcirculation disorders are the main causes of rotator cuff degeneration. Acromion variants may affect subacromial space width, causing a pathological narrowing of the space that may compromise the cuff integrity. However, it is not clear if the subacromial space width is genetically determined or if it changes according to loading conditions. To clarify this unresolved question, we performed an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) study with the aim of evaluating the acromiohumeral distance in a group of elderly monozygotic and dizygotic twins, and we analyzed the obtained data using the twin design to separate the contributions of shared and unique environments.
METHODS: We identified twenty-nine pairs of elderly twins. On MRI scans, we evaluated the acromiohumeral distance and health status of the rotator cuff tendons. Heritability, defined as the proportion of total variance of a specific characteristic in a particular population due to a genetic cause, was estimated as twice the difference between the intraclass correlation coefficients for monozygotic and dizygotic pairs. The influence of shared environment, due to environmental factors that contribute to twin and sibling similarity, was calculated as the difference between the monozygotic correlation coefficient and the heritability index. One-way ANOVA (analysis of variance) was used to estimate the differences among job categories, both in the total cohort and within zygosity groups.
RESULTS: The intraclass correlation coefficient was substantially higher for monozygotic than for dizygotic twins, indicating a high degree of concordance of the acromiohumeral distance in pairs of individuals who shared 100% of their genes. The heritability index was 0.82, and shared and unique environmental contributions were both 0.09. There were no significant differences among subjects in different job categories, either in the total cohort (p = 0.685) or within the monozygotic (p = 0.719) and dizygotic groups (p = 0.957).
CONCLUSIONS: The acromiohumeral distance is mainly genetically determined and only marginally influenced by external factors."
26491808,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26491808/,"BACKGROUND: Helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) provide an important service to decrease interfacility transport times compared with ground ambulances. Although transport via HEMS is typically faster, the decreased transportation time comes at the expense of increased risks to the patient and flight crew and higher costs. Therefore, it is important to balance the immediate patient needs with the risk and expense of HEMS transport. Our objective was to determine how frequently pediatric patients who are interfacility transported to a Level 1 pediatric trauma center (PTC) receive a time-sensitive intervention.
METHODS: This was a 4-year (2008-2012) retrospective study of children aged 0 year to 18 years who were interfacility transported to a single Level 1 PTC by HEMS. Patients were identified using the trauma registry at the PTC. A previously published outcome was used to determine if patients received time-sensitive interventions. Driving distance to the PTC was determined using Google Maps. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics.
RESULTS: A total of 207 cases were identified (median age, 7 years; interquartile range, 2-12 years; 29% female; median Injury Severity Score [ISS], 11; median Revised Trauma Score [RTS], 8). Forty-three percent (90 patients; 95% confidence interval, 37-50%) of patients received a time-sensitive intervention; these cases had a median age of 6 years (interquartile range, 2-11 years; 32% female; median ISS, 13; median RTS, 8). Of the 117 patients who did not receive time-sensitive interventions, 81% were within 120 driving miles of the PTC and 49% were within 60 miles.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests an overuse of HEMS for interfacility transfer of injured pediatric patients to a PTC. Although these patients likely required the resources of a PTC, they could perhaps have been transported by ground ambulance without detriment. Further research is needed to investigate how interfacility transport modes are selected and if these decisions can be improved without increasing evaluation times at transferring facilities.

STUDY DESIGN: Our cohort was a retrospective cohort of women undergoing second trimester pregnancy termination for fetal anomalies, fetal death or previable premature rupture of membranes. We analyzed the rates of spontaneous delivery <37 weeks in the first pregnancy following the termination. We also compared preterm birth rates in our cohort with national averages and analyzed by the total number of prior procedures.
RESULT: There were 173 women in our cohort. Women who had undergone a D&E (n=130) were less likely to have a subsequent preterm birth (6.9 vs 30.2%; P<0.01). This held true for a low risk subset without obstetric risk factors. There was no statistical difference in preterm birth rates for women who had undergone a D&E as compared with national averages, nor between the rates of preterm birth for women with 0, 1, 2 or 3 or more prior first or second trimester procedures.
CONCLUSION: We did not find that D&E was a risk factor for preterm delivery when compared with women with a prior IOL or national rates."
26491853,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26491853/,"OBJECTIVE: To study whether fetal main pulmonary artery (MPA) Doppler indices can predict the development of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS).
STUDY DESIGN: This prospective cross-sectional study included pregnant women between 34 and 38+6 weeks gestation. The diagnostic accuracy of MPA Doppler measurements (systolic/diastolic (S/D) ratio, peak systolic velocity (PSV), pulsatility index (PI), resistance index (RI) and acceleration time/ejection time (At/Et)) for diagnosis of neonatal RDS was tested.
RESULT: Of the 698 eligible fetuses, 55 (7.87%) developed neonatal RDS. PSV, PI, RI and At/Et were positively correlated with gestational age. The strongest correlation was found with At/Et (r=0.602, P<0.001). PI and RI were significantly higher, whereas At/Et and PSV were significantly lower in fetuses that developed RDS. A cutoff value of 0.305 for At/Et predicted the development of RDS (sensitivity: 76.4%; specificity: 91.6%).
CONCLUSION: Development of neonatal RDS can be predicted using the MPA At/Et with high sensitivity and specificity."
26492292,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26492292/,"RATIONALE: Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) can be prevented by a single dose of montelukast (MLK). The effect is variable, similar to the variable responsiveness observed after daily treatment with MLK. We hypothesized that the effect of a single MLK-dose (5 or 10 mg) on EIB could predict the clinical effectiveness of longer term once daily treatment.
METHODS: This was a prospective, open-label study. Twenty-four asthmatic adolescents (12-17 years) suboptimally controlled by low-dose inhaled corticosteroids, with ≥10% post-exercise fall in FEV1 , were included. They performed an exercise test at baseline, 20 hr after a single MLK-dose and 40-44 hr after the last dose of 4 weeks once daily treatment. The correlations between the effect of a single dose and 4 weeks treatment on area under the curve (AUC) and maximum % fall in FEV1 were calculated.
RESULTS: AUC0-20 min decreased significantly after a single MLK-dose (P = 0.001, CI: 64.9-218.2), but not after 4 weeks of treatment (P = 0.080, CI: -12.2 to 200.4). There was a moderate correlation between the effect of a single MLK-dose and 4 weeks treatment on AUC0-20 min , r = 0.49 (P = 0.011), and maximum % fall in FEV1 , r = 0.40 (P = 0.035).
CONCLUSION: The protection provided by a single MLK-dose against EIB only modestly predicts the effect of regular treatment against EIB in adolescent asthmatics on low-dose inhaled corticosteroids. If used on a daily base, MLK offered clinically significant protection against EIB in two thirds of adolescents suboptimally controlled by low-dose ICS."
26492383,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26492383/,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to examine the impact of state workers' compensation (WC) policies regarding wage replacement and medical benefits on medical costs and length of disability (LOD) in workers with low back pain (LBP).
METHODS: Retrospective cohort analysis of LBP claims from 49 states (n = 59,360) filed between 2002 and 2008, extracted from a large WC administrative database.
RESULTS: Longer retroactive periods and state WC laws allowing treating provider choice were associated with higher medical costs and longer LOD. Limiting the option to change providers and having a fee schedule were associated with longer LOD, except that allowing a one-time treating provider change was associated with lower medical costs and shorter LOD.
CONCLUSIONS: WC policies about wage replacement and medical treatment appear to be associated with WC LBP outcomes, and might represent opportunities to improve LOD and reduce medical costs in occupational LBP."
26492453,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26492453/,"OBJECTIVES: To determine whether hospital processes and hospital quality associated with the care of femoral neck fractures were significantly altered by the implementation of healthcare reform in Massachusetts.
DESIGN: Pre-post retrospective study.
SETTING: Massachusetts Statewide Inpatient Dataset (SID).
PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: Patients treated for femoral neck fracture (n = 23,485) in the periods prehealth (2003-06) and posthealth reform (2008-10).
INTERVENTION: Differences in hospital processes for fracture care and quality measures were assessed for the periods before and after health reform.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Differences in hospital processes for fracture care (type of surgical intervention, length of stay, and discharge disposition) and quality metrics [mortality, complications, re-operation, and failure to rescue (FTR)] in the periods before and after health reform were assessed using regression techniques to adjust for differences in case mix and the type of surgical intervention.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the type of surgical intervention performed prereform and postreform (P = 0.27). After adjustment for case mix and surgical intervention, length of stay was significantly reduced {regression coefficient -0.07 [95% confidence interval (CI), -0.09 to -0.06]} as were the odds of FTR [odds ratio 0.73 (95% CI, 0.59-0.92)]. Discharges to skilled nursing facilities significantly increased in the postreform period [relative risk ratio 1.15 (95% CI, 1.03-1.30)]. Findings associated with FTR were driven by changes in the detection of surveillance sensitive complications.
CONCLUSIONS: Health reform in Massachusetts led to no clinically meaningful differences in hospital processes for femoral neck fracture care. Although some differences in quality measures were noted, these cannot necessarily be attributed to health care reform."
26492456,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26492456/,"BACKGROUND: Cognitive processes like attentional and interpretation biases have been suggested to play a vital role in the onset and exacerbation of chronic pain. Research consistently supports the occurrence of interpretation bias (IB) in pain patients and healthy individuals high in pain anxiety. Nevertheless, studies on the indirect assessment of IB or the relation between IB and responses to pain are limited. The present studies examined the association between indirect assessed IB and pain anxiety, while Study 2 additionally examined IB as a mediator in the relation between pain anxiety and pain responses.
METHOD: In Study 1 (N = 125) and Study 2 (N = 73), anxiety sensitivity, injury/illness sensitivity (IS) and pain catastrophizing were assessed with questionnaires. IB was indirectly derived from performance on an ambiguous word priming task. In Study 2, an experimental heat pain induction was used to assess pain responses (i.e. tolerance and subjective pain experience).
RESULTS: Results showed a positive correlation between pain anxiety and IB, albeit that the strength of the observed associations differed between both studies. Furthermore, IB was inversely related to pain tolerance, and found to mediate the relation between IS and pain tolerance in Study 2.
CONCLUSIONS: Current findings underscore the importance of interpretational processes in the context of physical health threat. Furthermore, the ambiguous word priming task is proposed as a suitable paradigm for further research on the indirect assessment of IB. Nevertheless, further research is warranted to deepen our understanding of IB and its contribution to the experience of (chronic) pain."
26492490,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26492490/,"OBJECTIVE: This administrative data-linkage cohort study examines the association between prison crowding and the rate of post-release parole violations in a random sample of prisoners released with parole conditions in California, for an observation period of two years (January 2003 through December 2004).
BACKGROUND: Crowding overextends prison resources needed to adequately protect inmates and provide drug rehabilitation services. Violence and lack of access to treatment are known risk factors for drug use and substance use disorders. These and other psychosocial effects of crowding may lead to higher rates of recidivism in California parolees.
METHODS: Rates of parole violation for parolees exposed to high and medium levels of prison crowding were compared to parolees with low prison crowding exposure. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using a Cox model for recurrent events. Our dataset included 13070 parolees in California, combining individual level parolee data with aggregate level crowding data for multilevel analysis.
RESULTS: Comparing parolees exposed to high crowding with those exposed to low crowding, the effect sizes from greatest to least were absconding violations (HR 3.56 95% CI: 3.05-4.17), drug violations (HR 2.44 95% CI: 2.00-2.98), non-violent violations (HR 2.14 95% CI: 1.73-2.64), violent and serious violations (HR 1.88 95% CI: 1.45-2.43), and technical violations (HR 1.86 95% CI: 1.37-2.53).
CONCLUSIONS: Prison crowding predicted higher rates of parole violations after release from prison. The effect was magnitude-dependent and particularly strong for drug charges. Further research into whether adverse prison experiences, such as crowding, are associated with recidivism and drug use in particular may be warranted."
26492559,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26492559/,"BACKGROUND: The ""weekend effect"" describes an increase in adverse outcomes for patients admitted at the weekend. Critical care units have moved to higher intensity working patterns to address this with some improved outcomes. However, support services have persisted with traditional working patterns. Blood cultures are an essential diagnostic tool for patients with sepsis but yield is dependent on sampling technique and processing. We therefore used blood culture yield as a surrogate for the quality of support service provision. We hypothesized that blood culture yields would be lower over the weekend as a consequence of reduced support services.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational study examining 1575 blood culture samples in a university hospital critical care unit over a one-year period.
RESULTS: Patients with positive cultures had, on average, higher APACHE II scores (p = 0.015), longer durations of stay (p = 0.03), required more renal replacement therapy (p<0.001) and had higher mortality (p = 0.024). Blood culture yield decreased with repeated sampling with an increased proportion of contaminants. Blood cultures were 26.7% less likely to be positive if taken at the weekend (p = 0.0402). This effect size is the equivalent to the impact of sampling before and after antibiotic administration.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that blood culture yield is lower at the weekend. This is likely caused by delays or errors in incubation and processing, reflecting the reduced provision of support services at the weekend. Reorganization of services to address the ""weekend effect"" should acknowledge the interdependent nature of healthcare service delivery."
26492988,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26492988/,"BACKGROUND: Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common diagnosis associated with age, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHP) is also seen with these comorbidities, but its association with ED has yet to be studied. We evaluated the rate and resolution of impotence after curative surgery for PHP.
METHODS: Prospectively collected data, including a self-reported questionnaire of symptoms, were reviewed for men who had curative parathyroid exploration for sporadic PHP from July 2010 to January 2014. Data were compared with an age-matched cohort of men who had thyroidectomy during the same period.
RESULTS: Among 160 men with PHP and mean age of 60 years (range, 19-88), preoperative ED was reported by 13%, and this group was older than patients without ED (mean age, 70 vs 58 years, P < .01). Self-reported resolution of ED after parathyroidectomy occurred in 67% compared with 43% of patients in a thyroidectomy cohort. Preoperative mean arterial blood pressure was less in men with postoperative resolution of ED (96.6 vs 105.4 mm Hg, P = .03). Among 3 of 21 men on specific ED medications, 2 no longer required them postoperatively.
CONCLUSION: Impotence is reported often by men undergoing parathyroidectomy for PHP. After curative surgery, 67% of those affected may self-report ED resolution, which may be more pronounced in those patients with a lesser preoperative mean arterial blood pressure."
26493213,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26493213/,"BACKGROUND: Central-line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) rate is an important quality measure, but it suffers from subjectivity and interrater variability, and decreasing national CLABSI rates may compromise its power to discriminate between hospitals. This study evaluates hospital-onset bacteremia (HOB, ie, any positive blood culture obtained 48 hours post admission) as a healthcare-associated infection-related outcome measure by assessing the association between HOB and CLABSI rates and comparing the power of each to discriminate quality among intensive care units (ICUs).
METHODS: In this multicenter study, ICUs provided monthly CLABSI and HOB rates for 2012 and 2013. A Poisson regression model was used to assess the association between these 2 rates. We compared the power of each measure to discriminate between ICUs using standardized infection ratios (SIRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A measure was defined as having greater power to discriminate if more of the SIRs (with surrounding CIs) were different from 1.
RESULTS: In 80 ICUs from 16 hospitals in the United States and Canada, a total of 663 CLABSIs, 475,420 central line days, 11,280 HOBs, and 966,757 patient days were reported. An absolute change in HOB of 1 per 1,000 patient days was associated with a 2.5% change in CLABSI rate (P<.001). Among the 80 ICUs, 20 (25%) had a CLABSI SIR and 60 (75%) had an HOB SIR that was different from 1 (P<.001).
CONCLUSION: Change in HOB rate is strongly associated with change in CLABSI rate and has greater power to discriminate between ICU performances. Consideration should be given to using HOB to replace CLABSI as an outcome measure in infection prevention quality assessments."
16111952,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16111952/,"BACKGROUND: MRCP is rapidly replacing diagnostic ERCP in various pancreaticobiliary diseases. This study was designed to evaluate the accuracy of MRCP in detecting and determining the extent of choledochal cysts, as well as associated ductal anomalies or lesions.
METHODS: The study design was an 8-year retrospective survey conducted at a tertiary referral center, Asan Medical Center (University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea). There were 72 patients with choledochal cysts. All patients underwent both MRCP and ERCP. MRCP findings were compared with those of ERCP as the criterion standard.
RESULTS: The overall detection rate of MRCP for choledochal cysts was 96% (69/72). The sensitivity, the specificity, the positive predictive value, and the negative predictive value of MRCP for classifying choledochal cysts according to Todani's classification were 81%, 90%, 86%, and 86% in type I, respectively; 73%, 100%, 100, and 95% in type III, respectively; 83%, 90%, 80%, and 91% in type IVa, respectively; 100%, 100%, 100%, and 100% in type IVb, respectively; and 100%, 100%, 100%, and 100% in type V, respectively. The sensitivity, the specificity, and the accuracy of MRCP for detecting ductal anomalies were 83%, 90%, and 86%, respectively. The detection rate of MRCP for concurrent cholangiocarcinoma and choledocholithiasis was 87% (13/15) and 100% (8/8), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: MRCP showed overall good accuracy in the detection and the classification of choledochal cysts and revealed associated cholangiocarcinoma and choledocholithiasis with excellent accuracy. MRCP, therefore, may supersede the diagnostic role of ERCP for the patients with choledochal cysts. However, MRCP showed limited capacity to detect minor ductal anomalies or small choledochocele."
16112180,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16112180/,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate whether the results of the Hybrid Capture II (HCII) assay for detecting high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (H-SIL) or cervical carcinoma can be improved by increasing the relative light units (RLU) level.
STUDY DESIGN: We included 2271 women (mean age 38.7 +/- 12.3, range 15-92) referred to a colposcopic clinic due to cytology of atypical cells of unknown significance, SIL or carcinoma. All women underwent a new Pap test, HR-HPV detection using HCII and colposcopy with biopsy of suspicious areas when present.
RESULTS: HR-HPV was detected in 91.7% of carcinomas, 96.6% of H-SIL, 85.1% of low-grade SIL and 21.6% of cases with no lesion. The probability of harboring an H-SIL or a carcinoma significantly increased as RLU increased (P = 0.01). The sensitivity and specificity for H-SIL or carcinoma at different cutoffs were 95.7 and 54.6 at 1 RLU, 93.9 and 59.6 at 2 RLU, 90.1 and 65.1 at 5 RLU and 85.7 and 68.7 at 10 RLU. The percentage of cases not detected with HCII increased from 2.4% for cases with <1 RLU to 9.5% for cases between 1 and 2 RLU, 14.8% between 2 and 3 RLU, 21.7% between 3 and 5 RLU and 28.4% between 5 and 10 RLU.
CONCLUSION: The use of a higher cutoff (higher viral load) in the HCII should not be recommended because it significantly increases the number of cases with H-SIL or carcinoma not detected, reducing the sensitivity and negative predictive value of the test."
16113030,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16113030/,"BACKGROUND: While many cancer patients derive strength from spiritual or religious faith, concern often remains regarding how different patient subgroups and other community members might react to faith-based services when sponsored by a secular health care organization.
METHODS: ""A Sacred Gathering for Those Touched by Cancer"" was presented in 2 Catholic and 2 Protestant churches. The service included key themes (surrendering fear, peace, hope, community support, and God's love) reinforced by Scripture, music, ritual, and prayer. Patients, clergy, and staff participated. Questionnaires evaluating attendee characteristics, emotional response to the service, and satisfaction with service components were distributed.
RESULTS: Attendees (women: 80%; Catholic: 71%; half older than 50 years) returned 450 questionnaires. Most found the service very (83%) or somewhat (14%) helpful. Multivariate regression of perceptions indicated (1) the opinion that the service was helpful was associated with the perception that the service made the respondent feel hopeful (P < .0001), that respondents found inspirational messages important (P = .058), and that the respondent was a current patient (P = .018) and (2) an angry response reported by respondents was associated with current patient status (P = .0044). Men tended to feel less loved by God (P = .012) and people (P = .034) and less hopeful (P = .057) than women did. Men liked music less (P = .048), liked Scripture and prayers concerning community less (P = .040), and found prayer (P = .0035) less important. However, men felt the gatherings were as helpful as women did. Past patients felt less sadness than did others (P = .0084). Increased perceived helpfulness of the service was associated in a multivariate analysis with current patient status, feeling hopeful as a result of the service, increased appreciation of the service's inspirational message, and the perception that the service was not too long.
CONCLUSIONS: While almost all attendees found the service somewhat or very helpful, distinct preferences and reactions to the service were noted for gender, patient status, and religious affiliation. This evaluation will help tailor future events to better meet the spiritual needs of cancer patients and their loved ones."

METHODS: This retrospective case series included all patients with periocular tumours seen in the authors' unit between 1996 and 2004, and who were initially diagnosed with keratoacanthoma based on the clinical presentation.
RESULTS: Twelve patients (eight males, four females) were clinically diagnosed with keratoacanthoma. The final histological diagnosis revealed two cases (16.7%) of invasive SCC, and 10 cases (83.3%) of keratoacanthoma. The lower lid was most commonly involved in cases of keratoacanthoma (50.0%). Six patients (60.0%) underwent Mohs surgery, and four (40.0%) were treated with excision under frozen section control. There were no cases of recurrence during a mean follow up period of 21 (SD 13) months.
CONCLUSION: Although the clinical presentation of periocular keratoacanthoma is usually characteristic, a significant percentage of patients will prove to have invasive SCC. Complete excision with margin control offers a definitive diagnosis, as well as tissue conservation and a low recurrence rate."
16113572,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16113572/,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate conservative management of fetal and neonatal ovarian cysts.
METHODS: We followed the progress of 11 fetal and 2 neonatal ovarian cysts.
RESULTS: Ten fetal cysts were simple at recognition, but 8 silently became complex by birth, with ovarian loss in 6/11 cases (54%). In 2 cases where large simple cysts presented for the first time at birth, serious complications occurred, resulting in the death of 1 newborn.
CONCLUSIONS: If a fetal ovarian cyst is already complex before birth it can be managed conservatively, albeit with loss of the ipsilateral ovary in the majority of cases. As simple fetal ovarian cysts frequently become complex before birth, intervention may be justifiable to preserve the ovary. But any intervention also has the potential for complications, and may be ineffective. Intervention also requires accurate differentiation of ovarian cysts from other abdominal cysts."
16114203,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16114203/,"PURPOSE: To assess US-guided vacuum-assisted biopsies in the diagnosis of suspicious sonographic breast lesions after non-diagnostic core needle biopsies (CNB).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective study of 42 females with suspicious breast lesions at US. CNB previously performed were non-diagnostic. Because of the larger sample size, vacuum-assisted biopsies were performed, instead of surgical biopsy.
RESULTS: Vacuum-assisted biopsies showed 32 benign lesions. Histologic examination of the CNB showed non-specific fibrous tissue in 43% of cases as opposed to 7.1% for vacuum-assisted biopsies. The latter provided a more specific diagnosis (mainly fibrocystic breast disease). From a total of 4 lesions that were suspicious at CNB, 3 were diagnosed as malignancies after vacuum-assisted biopsy and one case was a ""borderline"" lesion. Three additional malignant and three additional borderline lesions were diagnosed on vacuum-assisted biopsies. In 11 cases, surgical excision was performed, and all diagnoses from vacuum-assisted biopsies were confirmed at microscopy, except in one case where it was underestimated (ADH versus DCIS).
CONCLUSION: US-guided vacuum-assisted biopsy is a reliable technique. Because it provides more tissue than CNB, it can be an alternative to diagnostic surgery after non-diagnostic CNB. Indeed, it allows confirmation of the diagnosis and provides a more specific diagnosis of benign lesions. With regards to malignant and borderline lesions, it avoids the risk of false-negative CNB and overlooking carcinomas."
16114985,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16114985/,"PURPOSE: Determination of potency is a challenging problem for patient-specific products derived from autologous cells. For several years, we have been investigating the safety and therapeutic potential of patient- specific vaccines derived from short-term autologous cell lines. We investigated whether clinical potency of these vaccines could be determined by retrospective correlation between the numbers of cells injected (quantity of tumor antigens) and clinical outcome.
METHODS: The averages and standard deviations of irradiated tumor cells were determined for those patients who received the first 3 weekly injections, and for the subset that had a recording of results from tumor delayed-type hypersensitivity testing (DTH). Correlations were made between the numbers of cells injected and DTH conversion and survival.
RESULTS: One hundred fifty-six patients received the vaccine product, 136 of whom received the first 3 weekly vaccinations. The most common reason for not receiving 3 injections or having a repeat tumor DTH test was rapidly progressive disease. Ninety-nine patients had cell count data for all 3 injections; 73 had a tumor DTH test at baseline and at week 4. The average number of cells injected over 3 weeks, in millions per patient, by quartile were: 6.0 +/- 1.8, 10.2 +/- 1.4, 15.1 +/- 1.4, and 31.2 +/- 9.8, with respective median survivals of 24.7, 25.5, 24.0, and 21.0 months, with the respective number of DTH conversions being 4, 8, 4, and 6. There were no statistical differences in survival or in the number of patients who had a positive tumor DTH test at week 4.
CONCLUSIONS: We were unable to define potency--based on a relationship between the number of tumor cells injected as part of vaccination and survival or the reactivity to pure autologous tumor--in a tumor DTH test, over the range of 2-30 million injected cells over 3 weeks."
16115582,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16115582/,"BACKGROUND: A possible association had previously been noted between gender and prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with a better survival rate for women.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the current study was to further clarify the role of gender as a possible prognostic factor in NSCLC.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study examined the survival of NSCLC patients who underwent surgical curative treatment at the Hospital Sao Lucas da PUCRS, Porto Alegre, Brazil, between January 1, 1990, and December 31, 2000. Data were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. In addition, a Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to adjust for potential confounding factors.
RESULTS: In the period studied, lung resections were performed in 253 patients with NSCLC, of whom 114 had stage I tumors. Four patients were excluded because of death in the immediate postoperative period, and 1 committed suicide. The 5-year survival rate was 85.5% for women and 46.4% for men (P<0.0001). The median overall survival time was 44.7 months (interquartile range [IQR(25%-75%)], 17.4-72.3 months) and was longer in women than in men: 63.9 months (IQR(25%5%), 35.2-98.7 months) versus 32.3 months (IQR(25%-75%), 11.8-61.5 months), respectively (P<0.0001). Gender effect was still present after adjustment by Cox regression for several factors (age, smoking habits, hemoglobin, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, tumor size, tumor-node-metastasis stage, histology, postoperative complications, and surgery type). The adjusted hazard ratio in women was 0.23 (95% CI, 0.09-0.59; (P<0.0001) when compared with men.
CONCLUSION: This study confirms previous findings that women live longer than men after surgery for stage I NSCLC. This effect persisted after adjusting for several factors. These results highlight the fact that analyses of long-term survival of NSCLC patients, usually generalized to men and women as a whole, may be an inadequate extrapolation. These results question whether analyses of long-term survival, which commonly group men and women together, provide an adequate prognosis of survival rates in women with NSCLC."
16115590,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16115590/,"BACKGROUND: Studies have suggested that women overreport symptoms in nondermatologic disease. Gender-dependent differences in patients' perception of dermatologic disease are poorly described. The description of possible gender differences in morbidity in a skin disease with comparable prevalence in men and women may therefore provide relevant data.
OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to examine gender-dependent differences in the self-reported morbidity of patients with atopic dermatitis (AD).
METHODS: Questionnaires from members of the Atopisk Eksem Forening (Danish Association of Atopic Eczema) aged > or = 15 years were analyzed. Data were gathered regarding age, sex, disease duration and severity, and localization of AD, including the results of the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), a quality-of-life questionnaire designed for use in adults (ie, patients aged > or = 15 years).
RESULTS: Questionnaires from 112 patients were analyzed. The final study population comprised 88 females and 24 males; mean age was 35.3 years (range, 15-77 years). For women, a significant positive correlation was found between DLQI score and disease severity (P < 0.001) and also between DLQI score and visible regions affected by disease (P = 0.001); these correlations were not observed in men. For the total number of body regions affected, a significant correlation with severity was found for women (P = 0.001) but not for men. No significant differences between men and women were noted for age, disease duration, overall disease severity, or quality of life as assessed using the DLQI.
CONCLUSION: Self-reported morbidity is highly consistent among women with AD, but not so among men. Normally visible areas of AD appear to affect women significantly more than men."
16115594,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16115594/,"BACKGROUND: Although low socioeconomic status (SES) has been found to be an important risk factor for all-cause mortality in women, the association is inconsistent across specific causes of death. SES appears to have different associations with 2 common causes of mortality in women: low SES is associated with greater cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in women but may also be associated with lower breast cancer mortality.
OBJECTIVE: We examined the association between SES and CVD and breast cancer mortality among black and white women.
METHODS: Our analysis sample included black and white women participating in the National Longitudinal Mortality Study, which links US Census Bureau Current Population Surveys with the National Death Index between 1979 and 1989. Education and income were used as SES indicators. For each cause of death, we used multivariate logistic regression to estimate variation in mortality risk across SES levels within each racial group.
RESULTS: The sample included 21,303 black women and 186,322 white women. Unadjusted cumulative incidence (over a mean follow-up period of 8.7 years) of CVD mortality was 4.2% among black women and 2.3% among white women, and of breast cancer mortality was 0.3% among black women and 0.4% among white women. After adjustment for age, marital status, and urban or rural residence, less education was still associated with greater CVD mortality among black women (odds ratio [OR], 1.8; 95% Cl, 1.03-3.0) and white women (OR, 1.4; 95% Cl, 1.3-1.6). However, less than a high school education was associated with lower breast cancer mortality among white women (OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.6-0.9) but not among black women (OR, 1.1; 95% Cl, 0.5-2.3). Similar ORs were obtained when income was examined.
CONCLUSIONS: The association between SES and cause-specific mortality may differ between black and white women for breast cancer death but not CVD death. Better understanding of these inter actions could guide the targeting of more effective interventions."
16115603,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16115603/,"BACKGROUND: Controversy still exists as to the relative importance of menopausal status and lifestyle factors for the risk of coronary heart disease in women.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the influence of body mass index (BMI), smoking,lipoprotein levels, surgically induced menopause, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), years since menopause, and age on hemostasis in apparently healthy postmenopausal women.
METHODS: Lipoproteins (total cholesterol [TC], low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C], triglycerides [TG]), and hemostatic factors (fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor antigen [vWFag], coagulation factors VIIag [FVIlag] and VIIa [FVIIa], plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 [PAI-1]) were each measured once. A forward, stepwise, multiple regression analysis was used to assess variations in hemostatic parameters.
RESULTS: A group of 292 healthy Stockholm women recruited from the census register participated in the Stockholm Female Coronary Risk Study as controls. Of these women, 260 participated in the present study. BMI, smoking, lipoprotein levels, surgically induced menopause, and years since menopause (1-5 y) were found to be associated with a 31% increase in fibrinogen levels. A 7% increase in FVIIa levels was attributed to TC, BMI, and HRT. Years since menopause (1-15 y), TG, TC, BMI, and HRT were associated with an increase of up to 26% in FVIIag levels. A 9% increase in vWFag correlated with HDL-C and years since menopause (1-10, 11-14, and > or =15 y). BMI and TG explained a 21% and 3% increase, respectively, in PAI-1 levels. Neither the use of HRT nor years since menopause had any influence on hemostasis.
CONCLUSION: BMI, high levels of TC and TG, and low HDL-C levels appear to be more important than hormonal status in their impact on hemostatic variables in healthy postmenopausal women."
16116319,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16116319/,"BACKGROUND: Oro-facial granulomatosis (OFG) is a rare chronic inflammatory disorder presenting characteristically with lip swelling but also affecting gingivae, buccal mucosa, floor of mouth, and a number of other sites in the oral cavity. Histologically, OFG resembles Crohn's disease (CD), and a number of patients with CD have oral involvement identical to OFG. However, the exact relationship between OFG and CD remains unknown.
METHODS: Thirty-five patients with OFG and no gut symptoms were identified from a combined oral medicine/gastroenterology clinic. All underwent a standardized assessment of the oral cavity and oral mucosal biopsy to characterize the number of sites affected and the type of inflammation involved. Hematological and biochemical parameters were also recorded. All 35 patients underwent ileocolonoscopy and biopsy to assess the presence of coexistent intestinal inflammation.
RESULTS: Ileal or colonic abnormalities were detected in 19/35 (54%) cases. From gut biopsies, granulomas were present in 13/19 cases (64%). An intestinal abnormality was significantly more likely if the age of OFG onset was less than 30 years (P=0.01). Those with more severe oral inflammation were also more likely to have intestinal inflammation (P=0.025), and there was also a correlation between the histologic severity of oral inflammation and the histologic severity of gut inflammation (P=0.047). No relationship was found between any blood parameter and intestinal involvement.
CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic and histologic intestinal abnormalities are common in patients with OFG with no gastrointestinal symptoms. Younger patients with OFG are more likely to have concomitant intestinal involvement. In these patients, granulomas are more frequent in endoscopic biopsies than reported in patients with documented CD. OFG with associated intestinal inflammation may represent a separate entity in which granulomatous inflammation occurs throughout the gastrointestinal tract in response to an unknown antigen or antigens."
16116530,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16116530/,"BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: At many centers wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) without prior radiographic examination to rule out relevant strictures is considered to be contraindicated in suspected obstructive small-bowel disease. However, the accuracy of radiography in this situation has often been questioned. The purpose of this prospective study was to investigate the feasibility and safety of the recently developed patency capsule, and its predictive value regarding the clinical relevance of radiographic small-bowel strictures.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: 22 patients with suspected obstructive small-bowel disease and/or radiological evidence of small-bowel strictures underwent a patency capsule examination. Intact passage, patient experience of pain, and capsule disintegration were correlated with radiographic findings, clinical variables, and outcome.
RESULTS: 13 patients passed an intact capsule without complaints, despite radiographically observed small-bowel stenosis; the subsequent video capsule examination was uneventful in all. In nine patients either intact passage was painful or the capsule disintegrated; in one of these, impaction of an intact capsule led to an ileus and emergency surgery. The type of capsule passage did not correlate with radiographic presence of a stricture, underlying diagnosis, or previous surgery. There was a statistically significant correlation between outcome (surgery performed or recommended) and occurrence of painful capsule passage and disintegration ( P < or = 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Painless egestion of an intact patency capsule indicates safety of WCE. Patients without obstructive symptoms require neither small-bowel radiography nor a patency capsule study prior to WCE. Disintegration of the patency capsule or painful passage seems to be associated with a clinically relevant small-bowel stricture and with a high probability of surgery."
16116591,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16116591/,"BACKGROUND: Patients with ovarian cancer often report having symptoms for months before diagnosis, but such findings are subject to recall bias. The aim of this study was to provide an objective evaluation of symptoms that precede a diagnosis of ovarian cancer.
METHODS: Medicare provider claims linked to records in the California Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data base were utilized to extract diagnosis and procedure codes for 1985 women age 68 years or older who resided in California with ovarian cancer, 6024 elderly women with localized breast cancer, and 10,941 age-matched, Medicare-enrolled women without cancer. Prevalence of rates of symptom-related diagnoses and procedure codes in Medicare claims records were obtained during 3-month periods up to 36 months before diagnosis of ovarian cancer.
RESULTS: From 1 month to 3 months before patients were diagnosed with ovarian cancer, the frequency and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) for 4 ""target symptom"" code groups were: abdominal pain (frequency, 30.6%; OR, 6.0; 95%CI, 5.1-6.9), abdominal swelling (frequency, 16.5%; OR, 30.9; 95%CI, 21.4-44.8), gastrointestinal symptoms (frequency, 8.4%; OR, 2.3; 95%CI, 1.8-3.0), and pelvic pain (frequency, 5.4%; OR, 4.3; 95%CI, 2.8-6.7). The adjusted odds for abdominal swelling codes was elevated 10-12 months before diagnosis (OR, 2.4; 95%CI, 1.2-4.6) for abdominal pain codes 7-9 months before diagnosis (OR, 1.3; 95%CI, 1.1-1.7). Abdominal imaging (frequency, 7.0%; OR, 1.3; 95%CI, 1.0-1.7) and pelvic imaging/CA125 (frequency, 3.7%; OR, 2.4; 95%CI, 1.7-3.4) showed an elevated frequency and adjusted odds 4-6 months before diagnosis. Patients with claims codes for ""target symptoms"" 4-36 months before diagnosis were more likely to have abdominal imaging (61.1%) or gastrointestinal procedures (30.8%) than pelvic imaging/CA125 (25.3%).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ovarian cancer were more likely than patients with breast cancer and women in a cancer-free control group to have target symptom codes (particularly abdominal swelling and pain) > 6 months before diagnosis. The evaluation of women with unexplained ""target symptoms"" should include pelvic imaging and/or CA125."
16117750,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16117750/,"BACKGROUND: It is assumed that the performance of more senior residents is superior to that of interns, but this has not been assessed objectively.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether adherence to national guidelines for outpatient preventive health services differs by year of residency training.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
PARTICIPANTS: One hundred twenty Internal Medicine residents, postgraduate year (PGY)- 1 and PGY -2, attending a University Internal Medicine teaching clinic between June 2000 and May 2003.
MEASUREMENTS: We studied 6 preventive health care services offered or received by patients by abstracting data from 1,017 patient records. We examined the differences in performance between PGY-1 and PGY-2 residents.
RESULTS: Postgraduate year-2 residents did not statistically outperform PGY-1 residents on any measure. The overall proportion of patients receiving appropriate preventive health services for pneumococcal vaccination, advising tobacco cessation, breast and colon cancer screening, and lipid screening was similar across levels of training. PGY-1s outperformed PGY-2s for tobacco use screening (58%, 51%, P = .03). These results were consistent after accounting for clustering of patients within provider and adjusting for patient age, gender, race and insurance, resident gender, and number of visits during the measurement year.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, patients cared for by PGY-2 residents did not receive more outpatient preventive health services than those cared for by PGY-1 residents. Efforts should be made to ensure quality patient care in the outpatient setting for all levels of training."
16117810,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16117810/,"OBJECTIVE: Obesity is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease, and surgical treatment of obese patients as part of a multidisciplinary approach seems to provide faster results than diet therapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of dermolipectomy on insulin action and inflammatory markers in 20 obese women.
PATIENTS: At baseline and 40 days after dermolipectomy, 20 obese women underwent indirect calorimetry and hyperinsulinaemic glucose clamp. Twenty obese nonsmoking females (age range 25--40 years) volunteered for the study. All subjects had a stable body weight for 2 months before the study. No patient was affected by cardiovascular and/or pulmonary disease, type 2 diabetes, thyroid dysfunction, acute or chronic hepatitis, renal insufficiency or cancer. No patients was receiving any drug therapy and all measurements were made during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle.
RESULTS: At baseline, fat mass (FM) correlated with plasma triglycerides (r=.58, P<0.009), free fatty acids (FFA) (r=0.73, P<0.001), insulin (r=0.70, P<0.002), leptin (r=0.55, P<0.01), adiponectin (r=-0.32, P<0.02) and resistin (r=0.31, P<0.01), insulin sensitivity (IS) (r=-0.59, P<0.005) and respiratory quotient (Rq) (r=0.62, P<0.002). With regard to inflammatory markers, FM was significantly correlated with plasma interleukin (IL)-6 (r=0.71, P<0.001), IL-10 (r=-0.67, P<0.002), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) (r=0.78, P<0.001) and soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6r) (r=-0.65, P<0.003). Dermolipectomy resulted in a significant decline in total FM of 2.3+/- 0.2 kg. A significant decline in BMI was also observed (30.0+/- 0.08 vs. 31.1+/- 0.7 kg/m(2)). After 40 days a significant decline in plasma resistin (P<0.001) and inflammatory markers and an increase in plasma adiponectin (P<0.03) were observed. Those metabolic changes were accompanied by a significant improvement in insulin-mediated glucose uptake (P<0.001), substrate oxidation and degree of inflammation. Changes in FM following dermolipectomy correlated with the changes in IS (P<0.01), substrate oxidation and FFA (P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In obese patients, dermolipectomy is associated with weight lost, improved glucose handling and lower inflammatory markers."
16117832,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16117832/,"BACKGROUND: Campylobacter infection is a major cause of bacterial gastrointestinal disease. Exposure to Campylobacter is known to produce an immune response in humans that can prevent future symptomatic infections. Further, studies of the general population have shown that seroprevalence to Campylobacter increases with age.
METHODS: A large collection of serotyped Campylobacter isolates, obtained from human clinical faecal samples, were analysed by comparing the ratio of uncommon to common serotypes by different age groups, using chi2 tests.
RESULTS: We have identified that older age groups, as well as having generally lower incidence, are significantly less likely to be infected by the more common serotypes.
CONCLUSION: These results are indicative of acquired immunity, however, further studies are needed to rule out the confounding effects of the variations in exposure pathways experienced by different age groups."
16117883,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16117883/,"BACKGROUND: Heme-oxygenase 1 (HO-1) is a rate-limiting enzyme in the degradation of heme to bilirubin, ferritin and carbon monoxide (CO) and may have significant anti-inflammatory function. The HO-1 gene promoter region shows microsatellite polymorphism with different (GT)n repeats, reported to differently induce gene expression, with the short allele associated with higher gene expression. We measured the acute inflammatory response using coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) as a well-characterized and uniform stimulus and examined the correlation between levels of IL-6, C-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen and their relationship to HO-1 genotype.
METHODS: Two hundred and seventy-five consecutive patients undergoing CABG were genotyped for the HO-1 promoter polymorphism using PCR and automated DNA capillary sequencer. IL-6, CRP and fibrinogen were measured at baseline and 6, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 hours after CABG.
RESULTS: Complete IL-6, CRP and fibrinogen measures were available in 220 patients. Before surgery IL-6 levels showed a strong correlation with CRP and fibrinogen (r = 0.48, P < 0.0001; r = 0.41, P < 0.0001 respectively), with a significant correlation between CRP and fibrinogen (r = 0.61, P < 0.0001). All three acute phase reactants showed a significant increase after CABG. After surgery, peak IL-6 was strongly correlated with peak CRP (r = 0.34, P = 0.0009) but not with peak fibrinogen (r = 0.15, P = 0.13), while peak CRP and peak fibrinogen were significantly correlated (r = 0.415, P < 0.0001). HO-1 allelic repeats ranged from 22-42, with (GT)25 and (GT)32 being the two most common alleles, and subsequently divided into three groups according to previous published work: <30 (GT)n were designated as S (short), 30-37 (GT)n as M (middle) and long repeats with >37 (GT)n as L (long); allele frequency 0.35, 0.58 and 0.07 respectively. Baseline CRP differed by genotype: those carrying at least one long allele having higher CRP than those with no long allele (3.76 +/- 0.79 vs. 2.07 +/- 0.17, P = 0.013). Conversely, those carrying at least one short allele had higher fibrinogen levels than those with no short allele (3.83 +/- 0.79 vs. 3.51 +/- 0.88, P = 0.006).
CONCLUSIONS: There is a strong correlation between the measured acute phase reactants both at baseline and after the inflammatory response to CABG in patients with coronary disease. There was an association between the HO-1 microsatellite polymorphism and CRP and fibrinogen levels at baseline but there was no similar association following CABG. This may indicate that HO-1 is associated with chronic atherosclerotic inflammatory processes rather than acute."
16118299,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16118299/,"BACKGROUND: Bone strength index (BSI) combines bone mineral and bone biomechanical properties to measure resistance to bending. This index may have greater clinical significance than the more often described markers of bone mineral content (BMC), areal density, or geometry alone and, in turn, may show a stronger relation to fracture risk. The BSI is the product of volumetric cortical bone mineral density (BMD) and cross sectional moment of inertia within a region of interest. Calculations combine dual energy x ray absorptiometry and magnetic resonance imaging technologies and provide a useful, non-invasive measure of in vivo bone strength.
OBJECTIVES: (a) To compare BSI in adolescent female middle distance runners and age matched controls; (b) to examine factors predictive of BSI in adolescent girls.
METHODS: Twenty adolescent female middle distance runners (mean (SD) age 16 (1.7) years, physical activity 8.9 (2.1) hours a week) and 20 female controls (age 16 (1.8) years, physical activity 2.0 (0.07) hours a week) were recruited. To calculate BSI, a region of interest representing 10% of the mid-distal tibia was analysed for dual energy x ray absorptiometry derived BMC and was combined with bone geometry and biomechanical properties obtained by magnetic resonance imaging assessments. Potential predictors of BSI were also examined.
RESULTS: Independent t tests showed that BMC (p = 0.028), cortical bone volume (p = 0.002), volumetric cortical BMD (p = 0.004), cross sectional moments of inertia (p = 0.005), and BSI (p = 0.002) were higher in the distal tibia of athletes than of controls. The strongest predictor of BSI was hours of physical activity a week (R2 = 0.46).
CONCLUSIONS: Athletes habitually exposed to high training loads displayed greater BSI at the distal tibia than controls. The results further confirm BSI as a significant and discerning marker in musculoskeletal health in adolescent girls engaged in high and low mechanical loading."

METHODS: Questionnaires were distributed to all 1100 members of the Climbers' Club of Great Britain. These detailed basic information about the climber, the presence of Dupuytren's disease, and any known risk factors for its development.
RESULTS: About half (51%) of the questionnaires were returned. The respondents were almost entirely male. It was revealed that 19.5% of male climbers had developed Dupuytren's disease. There was a significantly higher life time intensity of climbing activity in those with the disease. An earlier age of onset of the disease was found in climbers compared with the general population.

METHODS: The sample consisted of 360 (189 urban and 171 rural; age 12.3+/-0.42 years) boys and 247 (125 urban and 122 rural; age 12.3+/-0.43 years) girls. The sample was highly representative (32-64%) of all 12 year old children registered in the prefecture of Trikala, Greece. All volunteers were assessed for BMI and % body fat, as well as sit and reach, basketball throw (BT), vertical jump (VJ), handgrip strength (HG), 40 m sprint, agility run, and 20 m shuttle run. To correct for possible associations between fatness and fitness, a single cause allometric scaling was employed using the natural logarithms (ln) of fitness parameters that were significantly correlated with the ln body fat.
RESULTS: Independent-samples t tests revealed that VJ (p<0.05) was significantly higher in boys living in urban settings compared to their rural counterparts. Similarly, BT was found to be significantly better (p<0.05) in urban girls, whereas HG was significantly higher (p<0.05) in rural girls.
CONCLUSION: Considering that (a) only three out of the 14 possible cases (seven fitness parameters for boys and seven for girls) were significantly different between urban and rural children, and (b) these differences were not uniformly distributed in children living in either urban or rural environments, it is concluded that the place of residence has no clear impact on physical fitness as studied herein."
16118333,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16118333/,"CONTEXT: Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the RET protooncogene (RET) could modify disease susceptibility and clinical phenotype in patients with sporadic or familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC). OBJECTIVE/DESIGN OF THE STUDY: Because frequencies of RET SNPs have not yet been evaluated in patients with elevated serum concentrations of calcitonin (hCt), a biochemical marker for medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), we studied RET SNPs in patients with FMTC (n = 22), patients with sporadic MTC (n = 45), and 71 subjects presenting with moderately elevated hCt concentrations (basal, >10 pg/ml; pentagastrin stimulated, > 50 < 100 pg/ml) in comparison with an age- and gender-matched control group (n = 79) with basal hCt concentrations in the normal range (<5 pg/ml).
METHODS: After DNA extraction from citrated whole blood, RET exons 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, and 16 and exon/intron boundaries were analyzed by PCR-based cycle sequencing for RET germ line mutations, exonic (G691S, L769L, S836S, S904S) and intronic (IVS13+158; NCBI rs2472737 = IVS14-24) SNPs.
RESULTS: In FMTC patients, the F791Y mutation was found to be associated (P = 0.001) with the L769L SNP. The exonic SNPs (G691S, L769L, S836S, and S904S) were not different among the four groups. The intron 14 SNP (IVS14-24), however, was more frequent in individuals with elevated hCt serum concentrations (P = 0.016) and patients with sporadic MTC (P < 0.001) when compared with the control group.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the exon 13 (L769L) and the intron 14 (IVS14-24) SNPs could act as genetic modifiers in the development of some forms of hereditary and sporadic MTC, respectively."
16118584,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16118584/,"PURPOSE: Although ample evidence shows that ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) are correlated with psychological variables, whether and how these relationships change as a function of exercise intensity remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to examine the correlations of RPE with both dispositional (extraversion, neuroticism, behavioral activation, behavioral inhibition) and situational (self-efficacy) psychological variables across three exercise intensities. Based on the social-psychophysiological model proposed by Rejeski, it was hypothesized that the correlations would be weakened as the intensity increased.
METHODS: Thirty young and healthy volunteers participated in three 15-min treadmill runs, one 20% VO2max below, one at, and one 10% VO2max above the ventilatory threshold. RPE was assessed at minutes 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15.
RESULTS: Extraversion, behavioral activation, and self-efficacy showed significant negative correlations with RPE at lower but not higher intensities, whereas neuroticism was unrelated to RPE and behavioral inhibition was positively related across all three levels of intensity.
CONCLUSIONS: The results provide partial support to the hypothesis that the relationship of dispositional and situational psychological factors to RPE changes systematically, becoming weaker at higher exercise intensities. This may have implications for the effectiveness of personality-based adjustments of exercise prescriptions and cognitive techniques for dealing with aversive sensations of exertion."

OBJECTIVE: Type and incidence of complications of sentinel node biopsy in skin melanoma patients. From 01.12.1999 to 01.08.2001 in 80 skin melanoma patients sentinel node biopsy were performed. Patients with excised primary focus and without symptoms of regional and distant metastases were enrolled. There were 42 women (52.5%) and 38 men (47.5%) in studied group (age range: 25-87 years, mean 57, median 58.5). Tumor thickness ranged from 0.5 to 20 mm (mean 3.6, median 2.25). In all patients preoperative lymphoscintigraphy, intraoperative dying and intraoperative detection of gamma radiation were used. Identified sentinel nodes were removed for pathologic examination. Type and incidence of complications were noted. No complications of lymphoscintigraphy and intraoperative dying were observed. In 3 patients (3.7%) intraoperative hemorrhage occurred. No complications were observed in remaining 77 patients. Early postoperative complications were: hematoma (1 patient--1.25%), transient lymphocele (9 patients--11.25%), lymphoedema of extremity (7 patients--8.75%). In 66 of 80 patients in whom selective lymphadenectomy were not performed, late postoperative complications were: persistent lymphoedema of extremity (2 patients of 66--3.0%) and persistent tatoo after dye injection (2 patients of 66--3.0%).

16119431,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16119431/,"AIM: To estimate psychiatric and somatic morbidity in a nation-wide prison population, as inferred from detailed medication sheets.
METHOD: Medication sheets from 37 prisons, covering 90% of the Norwegian prison population, were collected and examined by experienced clinicians. All inmates on medication were assigned best-estimate psychiatric and/or somatic diagnoses according to the International Classification of Primary Care diagnostic system.
RESULTS: Among the 2617 inmates 919 (35%) had psychiatric disorders, as estimated by our methodology. Depressive disorders (11%) and sleep disorders (11%) were most prevalent. Twenty-six inmates (1%) were prescribed medication indicative of affective psychosis and an additional 77 (3%) received anti-psychotic drugs in doses indicating other psychotic disorders, bringing the sum total of psychosis up to 103 (4%). A total of 848 inmates (32%) were estimated to suffer from somatic disorders. Various pain conditions were prevalent (11%) in addition to obstructive airway diseases and asthma (4%). Both psychiatric and somatic disorders were more prevalent in female prisoners.
CONCLUSION: This study has demonstrated high psychiatric and somatic morbidity in a nation-wide population of prison inmates receiving adequate health services. As the morbidity estimates are inferred from prescription drug use they must be interpreted with caution.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate our experience with ureterocystoplasty as to whether it is the preferred method for bladder augmentation to achieve continence and preserve the upper urinary tract.
DESIGN: Retrospective study.
SETTING: Paediatric urology unit, Dana Children's hospital, Tel Aviv Medical Center (affiliated to the Sackler School of Medicine), Tel Aviv University.
SUBJECTS: Four children; three girls, one boy, mean age 7.3, range (3-14) years. Two had neurogenic bladder due to occult spinal dysrraphism, the other two had non-neurogenic neurogenic bladder. The indications for surgery were urinary incontinence with recurrent urinary tract infections in all patients, one also had upper tract dilatation.
INTERVENTIONS: All underwent augmentation ureteroplasty, two required nephrectomy due to non-functioning kidney, two required clean intermittent catheterizatiom postoperatively.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Urinary continence, bladder capacity, vesicoureteral reflux, renal function tests, urinary tract infection rate and surgical complications encountered.
RESULTS: In a mean follow-up period of 24 (6-46) months, all of the patients achieved urinary continence, two of the patients who have a normal bladder outlet are continent and void spontaneously with no residual urine. The other two patients are continent on clean intermittent catheterization. Only one episode of urinary tract infection was seen, none of the patients are currently on prophylactic antibiotics. The urinary bladder in all patients is spherical with good capacity and no vesicoureteral reflux was demonstrated. The upper urinary tracts are stable and the renal function tests are normal.
CONCLUSION: Ureterocystoplasty is our preferred choice of bladder augmentation in patients with small, inelastic, poor compliant bladder with at least a moderately dilated ureter. Complications normally seen with enterocystoplasties are minimal."
16119785,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16119785/,"PURPOSE: To evaluate whether selective transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) contributes to preservation of liver function and improves local control and survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent single or multiple TAE were retrospectively analyzed. The incidence of deterioration of liver function caused by TAE was compared between patients with Child class A disease and those having Child B/C disease. The correlation between extent of embolization and incidence of deterioration of liver function was analyzed. In addition, factors affecting deterioration of liver function after TAE were determined. Recurrence-free and overall survival rate were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to analyze prognostic factors affecting recurrence-free and overall survival.
RESULTS: The incidence of deterioration of liver function in the Child B/C group (47%) was significantly higher than that in the Child A group (21%). Pretreatment Child-Pugh classification and extent of embolization were significant factors in the deterioration of liver function after TAE. Recurrence-free survival rates at 1, 2, and 3 years were 38%, 19%, and 8%, respectively. Overall survival rates at 1, 3, 5, and 7 years were 89%, 59%, 22%, and 22%, respectively. Findings of multivariate analyses of prognostic factors showed that tumor size and selectivity of TAE were significant for recurrence-free survival and the initial Child-Pugh classification was the most important factor for overall survival.
CONCLUSION: Selective TAE improves local control and avoids damage to nontumorous liver tissue. The selective technique appears to be associated with a favorable outcome."
16121637,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16121637/,"OBJECTIVE: To correlate the subjective AgNOR counting method and DNA content with histologic diagnoses of thyroid cancer and invasion.
STUDY DESIGN: Eighty-one consecutive cases of thyroid carcinoma were selected for DNA and AgNOR analysis. The diagnoses were: papillary carcinoma (n = 40), follicular carcinoma (n = 31), Hürthle cell adenocarcinoma (n = 4), and undifferentiated carcinoma (n = 6). Seven normal thyroids were used as controls. DNA quantitative measurement was performed with Vidas 2.0 software (Kontron Bildanalyse, Munich, Germany) connected to an MPM 210 photometer microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). The DNA index was obtained using histograms. Counting the NORs was performed by subjectively counting the NORs in 200 malignant cells.
RESULTS: DNA ploidy analysis showed all Hürthle cell adenocarcinomas, 21 (67%)follicular tumors, 23 (57%) papillary tumors and 4 (67%) undifferentiated carcinomas to be aneuploid. DNA analysis correlated with histologic type of the tumor (p = 0.032). There was no statistical significance to the AgNOR counting variables studied. Statistical analysis showed correlation between ploidy and histologic diagnosis, but not AgNOR counting, to have prognostic value.
CONCLUSION: DNA ploidy is more useful than subjective counting of NORs as an adjunct method for thyroid lesion analysis."
16121775,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16121775/,"BACKGROUND: The complications of central venous line insertion have been highlighted by the recent NICE report advising that ultrasound guidance should be used for central line insertion.
METHODS: We report a prospective audit of the complications of subclavian vein central venous line insertion for parenteral nutrition over a five-year period when ultrasound guidance was not used.
RESULTS: In total, 201 lines were inserted for parenteral nutrition into a subclavian vein. A single consultant surgeon inserted 120 of the lines and year five or six surgical registrars performed the other line insertions. Five pneumothoraces occurred in four patients who had subclavian lines inserted and a chest drain was required in three cases. Four line tips were found to be going upwards rather than into the superior vena cava. Misplacement was more common with right subclavian insertion. Inability to site the line at that attempt was associated with previous line insertion in four of six patients.
CONCLUSION: A low complication rate can be achieved for central line insertion for parenteral nutrition. It is likely that this is due to the small number of experienced operators."
16121777,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16121777/,"BACKGROUND: Surgeons have traditionally monitored mortality as part of their surgical practice. The aim of this study was to determine whether peer review surgical mortality data might be useful in appraisal.
METHODS: Since 1994, the Scottish Audit of Surgical Mortality (SASM) has performed critical event analysis of deaths under surgical care in Scotland. The anonymised, peer reviewed records of 16 consenting surgeons from a single Trust were reviewed over a three year period (2000-2002).
RESULTS: Compliance with this voluntary audit was high at 97%. Individual surgeon profiles and comparison with colleagues in similar surgical practice demonstrated adverse events were infrequent and usually due to problems with the process of care rather than individual surgeon errors. The number of case note reviews requested increased significantly over the three years (chi square 9.5, p<0.01) although there was no significant change in the mean number of deaths per surgeon (18) or mean number of adverse events per surgeon (4).
CONCLUSIONS: The use of sequential individual peer reviewed mortality data for anonymised comparison with local colleagues is now in use in appraisal and has potential for the revalidation process. This could provide reassurance that individual surgeons are complying with the General Medical Council concept of ""good clinical practice"" and highlight local problems in the process of care."
16122150,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16122150/,"INTRODUCTION: The Hitachi CLA allergy test gives individual results on a wide range of common allergens. This study looked at the effect on patient management of the extra information gleaned from the use of this test compared to the same patient being investigated under a protocol of a total IgE and 4 allergen specific IgE tests using the Pharmacia UNICAP system.
DESIGN, SETTING AND PATIENTS: Fifty-four patients who presented to our Dermatology Department with possible Type I hypersensitivity: 19 males (10 were <16 years); 36 females (12 were <16 years). Our standard investigative protocol using the Pharmacia UNICAP was applied to all samples; each was also tested using the Hitachi CLA system and the two sets of data compared.
RESULTS: The CLA system identified 22/54 patients in which one or more potentially significant allergens were found that would not have been identified by our current system of total IgE plus 4 allergen specific IgE results. Multiple positive allergens were detected by the CLA system in 13/54 cases. 12/54 patients had no allergen that was positive CLA and the UNICAP. 3/54 had positive results using our Pharmacia-based protocol that were not available by use of the extended panel. 4/54 patients had profiles in which both systems offered differing clinically useful information.
CONCLUSION: These data support the use of a multiple allergen testing system to identify potentially significant individual allergens, patients in whom a Type I allergic reaction is unlikely or patients with multiple positive results for whom allergen avoidance is unlikely to be effective."
16122186,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16122186/,"OBJECTIVE: 1) To assess the regression to normal cytology in women with cervical smears diagnosed as atypical squamous or glandular cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS/AGUS) and absence or clearance of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection; 2) To evaluate the association between viral load, semi-quantitatively evaluated, and cytological or histological outcome.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this cohort study HPV test and biopsy was taken in 148 women with ASCUS/AGUS cytology. After 12-18 months a HPV test and cervical smear were repeated in 121 women.
RESULTS: Absence or clearance of HPV showed significantly more regression to normal cytology than persistent or newly acquired infected women, odds ratio 27 (95% confidence interval; 7-103). The viral load of the HPV test at enrollment was not correlated with the follow-up cytological outcome (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.2, p = 0.2). A marked association between viral load and histological outcome at enrollment was shown (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.43, p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Absence or clearance of HPV can predict regression to normal cytology. Viral load at enrollment cannot predict cytological regression. There was a marked association between viral load and the underlying CIN at enrollment. However, there was large overlapping of viral loads among the grades of CIN. Therefore, viral load is not a useful parameter to predict high-grade lesions in women with ASCUS/AGUS cytology."
16122434,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16122434/,"BACKGROUND: Ischemic mitral regurgitation (MR) is associated with poor survival and degenerative MR with excellent survival. We hypothesized that in some patients with degenerative MR requiring concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), ischemic disease would dominate prognosis, resulting in survival as poor as in patients with ischemic MR. Thus, we (1) determined survival impact of etiology (degenerative vs ischemic) after combined mitral valve repair and CABG and (2) explored survival differences within etiology groups.
METHODS: From 1985 to 2003, 710 patients underwent mitral valve repair for degenerative MR and concomitant CABG (two diseases); 400 patients had mitral annuloplasty and CABG for functional ischemic MR (one disease). Patients were propensity-matched on demography, symptoms, comorbidities, coronary artery disease, and left ventricular function. Survival was compared between matched groups and within groups.
RESULTS: Compared with patients with degenerative MR, those with ischemic MR had more extensive coronary artery disease, worse ventricular function, more comorbidities, and more symptoms (p < 0.05). Unadjusted 5-year survivals were 64% and 82% for patients with ischemic and degenerative MR, respectively. However, 123 ischemic and degenerative MR matched pairs had equivalently poor 5-year survival (p > 0.9), 66% and 65%, respectively. Among patients with degenerative MR, survival varied widely, depending largely on ischemic burden and extent of left ventricular dysfunction.
CONCLUSIONS: The large survival discrepancy between patients with ischemic and degenerative MR is attributable to differences in patient profile, particularly extent of ischemic disease and left ventricular dysfunction. Thus, ischemic and degenerative MR patients with equivalent characteristics have equivalently poor survival."
16122451,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16122451/,"BACKGROUND: Coronary artery graft patency results have been obtained from repeat angiograms in patients who presented with evidence of ischemia. The purpose of this study is to compare protocol-directed angiographic results from a randomized clinical trial with symptom-directed angiography in nontrial patients.
METHODS: Repeat angiography after primary isolated coronary artery bypass grafting was performed in 337 of 2,259 patients between July 1996 and September 2004. Patients were divided into two groups: 596 graft angiograms in 192 trial patients were compared with 389 graft angiograms in 142 nontrial patients. The mean interval from surgery was 1,306 +/- 800 days versus 1,119 +/- 777 days, respectively. Grafting techniques were similar in both groups except that the right internal thoracic artery was used almost exclusively as a free graft in the trial patients. Angiographic outcomes were defined as patent (stenosis <80%) or failure (stenosis > or =80%, occlusion, or the string sign). Comparisons of trial versus nontrial grafts were made using a generalized linear mixed model. Five-year estimates of graft patency were made using survival analyses accounting for interval censoring.
RESULTS: The odds ratio for graft failure for nontrial compared with trial patient grafts was 2.6 (95% confidence interval, 1.6 to 4.3; p < 0.001). Cumulative patency estimates for all grafts at 5 years were trial 91% versus nontrial 83%, p = 0.004. Five-year estimates for individual conduits were left internal thoracic artery, 99% versus 92%, p = 0.002; right internal thoracic artery, 86% versus 87%, p = 0.8; radial artery, 87% versus 86%, p = 0.6; and saphenous vein, 86% versus 56%, p = 0.003.
CONCLUSIONS: Graft patency rates were superior in the trial compared with nontrial patients. Symptom-directed graft failure rates were approximately double those of trial patients."
16122483,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16122483/,"BACKGROUND: Surgical removal remains the principal treatment modality in the management of lung cancer. Our aim is to characterize the effects of tumor removal on subsequent tumor recurrence at both local and systemic levels.
METHODS: C57/BL6 mice [10/group] underwent a mammary fat pad inoculation of 3LL cells [5 x 10(5)/animal] and were divided into two groups. Group 1 served as control while mice in group 2 were further subdivided into groups 2A and 2B. After 2 weeks, all mice in 2A were killed, and primary tumors and lungs were excised. At 2 weeks, primary tumors were excised completely for all mice in group 2B. These mice were then recovered and recurrent tumor growth evaluated for a further 2 weeks. Four weeks from the onset of the study, all remaining primary tumors and lungs were excised from groups 1 and 2.
RESULTS: After 4 weeks undisturbed growth, primary tumors in group 1 reached a mean size of 2.85 +/- 0.33 cm. After 2 weeks growth, primary tumors in groups 2A and 2B were comparable at 1.36 +/- 0.44 m and 1.53 +/- 0.29 cm, respectively. Two weeks after primary tumor excision, recurrent tumors in group 2B had reached a mean size of 2.65 +/- 0.74 cm. Moreover, for several animals, recurrent tumors rapidly reached similar volumes to that of primary tumors in group 1. Primary tumors were typically encapsulated and nonadherent. In contrast, recurrent tumors were locally invasive and adherent to chest wall and wound. Interestingly, pulmonary metastatic burden was increased in group 2B relative to group 1. Histologic examination revealed increased mitosis in recurrent tumors when compared with primary tumors.
CONCLUSIONS: Tumor removal is followed by accelerated growth of locally recurrent tumors and metastases. Moreover, recurrent tumors are more locally invasive than primary tumors. These findings strongly indicate that resection may be followed by tumor progression in residual disease."
16123092,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16123092/,"BACKGROUND: Y chromosome microdeletions are known to impair spermatogenesis. Screenings for these microdeletions are performed mostly in patients with sperm count abnormalities.
METHODS: We have screened the Y chromosome of 80 infertile patients with sperm morphological abnormalities. DNA from sperm, peripheral blood or single sperm following multiple displacement amplification (MDA) was utilized to amplify 20 specific sequence-tagged sites (STS) by PCR.
RESULTS: Y chromosome microdeletions were detected in sperm DNA from four of the teratozoospermic patients; while none of the 53 men with normal sperm morphology had any deletions. Two of the four patients with deletions also provided peripheral blood and a fresh semen sample. Both patients had none of the STS deleted in the peripheral blood DNA. Y chromosome microdeletion analysis in the MDA amplified SRY-positive single sperm DNA confirmed the presence of the same deletion in all 10 sperm for one patient and eight out of 10 sperm in the second patient.
CONCLUSIONS: Our observations suggest that some of the teratozoospermia might be related to gonadal mosaic Y chromosome microdeletions. Gonadal mosaicism can be a source of de novo transmissions of Y chromosome microdeletions. The application of MDA can yield enough DNA from a single sperm for genetic analyses."
16123098,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16123098/,"BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of psychological stress before and during IVF treatment on the outcome of IVF, controlling for known physiological predictors.
METHODS: This is a prospective, longitudinal study. A total of 166 women were studied during their first IVF treatment. They answered questionnaires concerning psychological and social factors on two occasions. Psychological well-being was measured by the Psychological General Well-Being (PGWB) index and psychological effects of infertility were assessed by 14 items.
RESULTS: In the analysis of the psychological variables, no differences were found between pregnant and non-pregnant women. The total number of good quality embryos, the number of good quality embryos transferred, and the number of embryos transferred were significantly higher in the pregnant than in the non-pregnant group. In a multivariate analysis, the number of good quality embryos transferred was the only variable that was independently associated with pregnancy.
CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence that psychological stress had any influence on the outcome of IVF treatment. When counselling infertile couples, it might be possible to reduce the stress they experience during the treatment procedure by informing them of these findings."
16123180,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16123180/,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether a repeated antenatal ultrasound examination improves fetal cardiac visualization for the obese and nonobese population.
METHODS: A computerized ultrasound database (October 1999-June 2003) was used to identify singleton pregnancies undergoing repeated prenatal ultrasound examinations because of initial suboptimal ultrasonographic visualization (SUV) of the 4-chamber view, outflow tracts, or both. Women with maternal diabetes, abnormal maternal serum screening results, or known fetal anomalies at the initial examination were excluded. Patients were classified by maternal body mass index (BMI): less than 30 kg/mg2 (nonobese), 30 to 34.9 kg/mg2 (class I obesity), 35 to 39.9 kg/mg2 (class II obesity), and 40 kg/mg2 or greater (morbid obesity). The association between maternal BMI and SUV of the fetal heart was analyzed.
RESULTS: Three hundred seventy-two patients were abstracted from the database. The median gestational age was 19.0 weeks at the initial visit (range, 18.0-21.9 weeks) and 21.4 weeks at the second visit (range, 18.9-23.9 weeks). The median BMI was 32.6 kg/m2 (range, 16.4-58.7 kg/m2). Sixty-three percent of patients were obese (BMI >or=30). Cardiac anatomy continued to have SUV in 11% of the women. The rate of SUV was associated with the obesity class (1.5% for nonobese, 12% for obesity I, 17% for obesity II, and 20% for morbid obesity; P < .0001). A cardiac anomaly was found in 1 of 372 repeated examinations (arteriovenous canal defect) for a patient with BMI of 24.8 kg/m2.
CONCLUSIONS: Repeated ultrasound examination for SUV of the fetal heart at a later gestational age dramatically reduces SUV. However, obese patients continue to have much higher rates of persistent SUV."
16123313,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16123313/,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess whether a genetic variant associated with higher fibrinogen levels is associated with increased coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, as a test of the causal influence of fibrinogen on CHD.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a meta-analysis of case-control and prospective studies of the G-455-->A and C-148-->T beta-fibrinogen promoter region variants, in relation to CHD risk. The 19 studies found included 12,393 cases and 21,649 controls. Fibrinogen levels were robustly related to the genetic variants (mean increase per allele, 0.117 g/L; 95% CI, 0.091-0.142 g/L). However, the genetic variants were unrelated to CHD risk (odds ratio per allele, 0.976; 95% CI, 0.916-1.040). The predicted causal odds ratio for a 1 g/L higher plasma fibrinogen level, given the genetic variant-fibrinogen and genetic variant-CHD associations, was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.46-1.40).
CONCLUSIONS: Although imprecise, the predicted causal effect of fibrinogen on CHD is clearly different from the odds ratio of 1.8 (95% CI, 1.6-2.0) for an increase of 1 g/L derived from a meta-analysis of observational studies. This evidence suggests that lowering the fibrinogen level may not, in itself, reduce CHD risk."
16123545,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16123545/,"BACKGROUND: Assess the accuracy of transcranial color-coded sonography (TCCS) for detecting middle cerebral artery (MCA) stem occlusion and compare it with cerebral angiography.
METHODS: This study enrolled a series of patients who received TCCS and cerebral angiography at the Department of Neurology in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou Medical Center, Taoyuan, Taiwan, between January 1997 and July 2003. MCA stem occlusion was diagnosed based on digital subtraction angiography and/or computed tomographic angiography. The effect of the supplying artery on the insonation of MCA stem was considered. The sonographic criteria for MCA stem occlusion were defined as absent MCA stem signal + visible signal on the reference arteries, including ipsilateral posterior cerebral artery, ipsilateral anterior cerebral artery or contralateral MCA stem.
RESULTS: A total of 419 consecutive patients were enrolled. Factors that significantly influenced MCA stem insonation included > or =50% ipsilateral carotid artery stenosis, > or =50% MCA stem stenosis, female gender, and age > or =60 years. Comparing patients with <50% and those with > or =50% carotid stenosis, the MCA stem insonation rate was significantly reduced from 69.1% to 45.6% (p < 0.001). In patients with <50% ipsilateral carotid artery stenosis, the sonographic criteria had a positive predictive value of 10.5% and a negative predictive value of 98.9%, and could predict MCA stem occlusion with high specificity but low sensitivity (specificity = 89.6, sensitivity = 54.5, overall accuracy = 88.9, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Absent MCA stem signal may result from MCA stem occlusion/tight stenosis and tight stenosis of ipsilateral carotid arteries, and has a limited value in detecting MCA stem occlusion. TCCS can be useful in identifying nonoccluded MCA stem, and cerebral angiography is necessary to confirm MCA stem occlusion."
16123553,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16123553/,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of corneal flap hinge position on dry eye after laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK).
METHODS: In a prospective double-masked randomized controlled clinical trial, 212 consecutive eyes of 106 myopic patients underwent LASIK; in each patient, one eye was randomly assigned to the superior hinge and the other eye to the nasal hinge procedure. The patients were examined pre-operatively and 1 week, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months after surgery for visual acuity, fluorescein tear film breakup time and Schirmer's baseline tear secretion test; a subjective evaluation of dry eye symptoms was accomplished by the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) questionnaire at the 1-month, 3-month and 6-month postoperative visits.
RESULTS: Tear film breakup time was not significantly different with the nasal or superior hinge flap technique at the preoperative, 1-week, 1-month, 3-month and 6-month visits (p > 0.05 for all comparisons between two groups). No significant difference between the two groups was found for the amount of Schirmer's baseline tear secretion test at pre- and postoperative visits (p > 0.05 for all comparisons between two groups). Subjective evaluation of symptoms also showed no significant difference at the 1-month, 3-month and 6-month postoperative visits.
CONCLUSIONS: The nasal and superior hinge flap methods do not affect signs and symptoms of dry eye after LASIK. We recommend that selecting the hinge position should be done according to the surgeon's preference and ease."
16123564,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16123564/,"OBJECTIVES: Fournier's gangrene (FG) is a rare but life-threatening disease. Although antibiotics and aggressive debridement have been broadly accepted as the standard treatment, the mortality rate remains high. We conducted a retrospective study to analyze the outcome and identify the risk factors and prognostic indicators.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 25 patients diagnosed with FG between July 1993 and August 2003. Data collected included age, predisposing factors, treatment modalities, length of hospital stay, surgical debridement times, and outcome. The FG severity index was used to predict outcome. Univariate analysis of the different prognostic factors was performed using t test and Fisher's exact probability test.
RESULTS: All patients were male, 60% were diabetic, and the mean age was 55.8 years. The mean hospital stay was 20 days and the mortality rate was 32%. The mean age of 53.8+/-18.3 (SD) years in the survival group (n=17) was significantly lower than the 59.9+/-10.2 years (n=8) of the non-survival group (p<0.05). Non-survival group patients had lower serum hematocrit (mean 28.9, p=0.019) and albumin (mean 1.93, p=0.024) levels. In our series, the mean FG severity index for survivors was 4.41+/-2.45 (range 2-9) compared to 12.75+/-2.82 (range 9-18) for those who died (t test, p<0.0001).
CONCLUSION: The survival rate of younger patients with FG was higher. We agree that a FG severity index cutoff value of 9 is an excellent predictor of outcome."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study is a randomized prospective clinical trial with blind assessment of outcome. A total of 26 patients who underwent elective herniorrhaphy for groin hernia participated in the study. Each patient was randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups: totally extraperitoneal preperitoneal hernia repair (TEP; n=13, mean age 46.7+/-1.6 years) or Lichtenstein hernia repair (LHR; n=13, mean age 54.2+/-2.7 years). Six of the patients had bilateral hernias (n=3 for each group). Blood flow indexes of the spermatic artery including end diastolic velocity (EDV), peak systolic velocity (PSV) and the resistive index (RI) were examined by CDUS. Ultrasound was performed just before the operations and repeated after 3 months. Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to evaluate the differences.
RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were found between the preoperative and postoperative measurements which included blood flow parameters (PSV, EDV, and RI) of the testes (p>0.05).
CONCLUSION: Neither the TEP or LHR technique had any decreasing effect on blood flow."
16123822,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16123822/,"INTRODUCTION: We report the unusual presentation and complications of a case of snakebite, involving a child and his mother, who were bitten by the same snake.
CLINICAL PICTURE: The mother was well but the child developed worsening local pain and swelling.
TREATMENT AND OUTCOME: Test doses of antivenom were administered but he developed anaphylactic shock. Subsequently, he developed compartment syndrome and fasciotomies were performed.
CONCLUSIONS: This report serves to alert the public to a few of the avoidable risk factors associated with snakebites (such as avoiding areas known to harbour snakes in the evening in summer and autumn, and wearing protective footwear), and the clinician of the important management issues in snakebites. Precautions for anaphylaxis must be taken when antivenom is administered. If a bitten patient with rapid extension of local injury does not receive any antivenom, compartment syndrome complicating local injury can occur."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: After digitizing and a 20-fold data compression, four radiographs of a CDMAM phantom were transferred via ISDN to a PACS archive. Using a soft copy work station, the contrast detail detectability of these data sets was compared to the contrast detail detectability of the original radiographs.
RESULTS: The contrast detail detectability showed no difference for the original radiographs and the data sets.
CONCLUSION: It is possible to digitize radiographs of a contrast detail mammography phantom, to compress the data sets, to transfer them to a soft copy station and to decompress them without negative influence on the contrast detail detectability."

In FNA smears of NHL, the 2 most commonly used antibodies for immunocytochemical staining were CD3 (29 cases) and CD20 (33 cases). A case was considered positive if > or = 50% of cells showed a positive reaction.
RESULTS: Of the 78 NHL cases, 33 stained for CD20. Thirty were successfully stained; of these, 26 were positive. Twenty-nine cases stained for CD3. Twenty-five were successfully stained; of these, 3, consisting of 2 lymphoblastic lymphomas and 1 large cell lymphoma, showed a positive reaction. CD20 staining performed on 1 of these lymphoblastic lymphomas and the large cell lymphoma showed a diffuse cytoplasmic reaction, respectively, in 2% and 0% only but positive staining of the nucleoli in 96% and 84% of cells, respectively. Another lymphoblastic lymphoma case, which did not have an adequate number of CD3-positive cells to label it as of T-cell lineage also showed CD20 positive nucleoli in 60% of cells and a diffuse cytoplasmic reaction for CD 20 in 5% of cells.
CONCLUSION: If our observation is corroborated by other studies, CD20 nucleolar positivity may serve as a diagnostic aid in T-cell neoplasms."

METHOD: Seventy-one seventh graders classified as proficient (n = 46) and nonproficient (n = 25) readers were compared with respect to scores on an accepted vision screening, on tests of visual-perception, visual-motor integration, and academic performance. Further, academic performance and visual-information processing were compared between children who failed and passed the vision screening.
RESULTS: Visual deficits were found in 68% of the participants, and among significantly more boys than girls. Nonproficient readers had significantly poorer academic performance and vision-screening scores than the proficient readers. Participants who passed the visual screening performed significantly better in visual perception than those who failed.
CONCLUSION: Visual function significantly distinguishes between children with and without mild academic problems, as well as on visual-perception scores. The high occurrence of visual deficits among participants warrants consideration of vision deficits among schoolchildren with academic performance difficulties."
16124982,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16124982/,"AIM: To investigate in mammography screening the correlation between the confidence level of the radiologist, in sampling BI-RADS assessment category 4 and 5 lesions using a single ultrasound-guided 14-gauge needle core biopsy, and the final histological diagnosis.
METHODS: In a prospective study, 389 consecutive ultrasound-guided 14-gauge needle core biopsies were performed on 131 BI-RADS assessment category 4 and 5 breast lesions in 126 women. On average, 3 passes were made through each lesion; for each pass, the radiologist rated confidence in adequacy of sampling at <50%, 50% to 90% or >90%. This was compared with the final histological diagnosis.
RESULTS: The radiologist was >90% confident in 293 biopsies; diagnostic results were confirmed at histology in 283 (97%). In 70 biopsies the radiologist was 50% to 90% confident; diagnostic results were confirmed in 60 (86%). Of 26 samples where confidence was <50%, 13 were diagnostic (50%) (p<0.0001).
CONCLUSION: If, at the time of ultrasound-guided needle core biopsy of BI-RADS assessment category 4 and 5 breast lesions, the radiologist is >90% confident that the lesion has been adequately sampled, a single pass is usually sufficient for diagnosis."
16125066,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16125066/,"BACKGROUND: Trimodal distribution of trauma deaths, described more than 20 years ago, is still widely taught in the design of trauma systems. The purpose of this study was to examine the applicability of this trimodal distribution in a modern trauma system.
STUDY DESIGN: A study of trauma registry and emergency medical services records of trauma deaths in the County of Los Angeles was conducted over a 3-year period. The times from injury to death were analyzed according to mechanism of injury and body area (head, chest, abdomen, extremities) with severe trauma (abbreviated injury score [AIS] >/= 4).
RESULTS: During the study period there were 4,151 trauma deaths. Penetrating trauma accounted for 50.0% of these deaths. The most commonly injured body area with critical trauma (AIS >/= 4) was the head (32.0%), followed by chest (20.8%), abdomen (11.5%), and extremities (1.8%). Time from injury to death was available in 2,944 of these trauma deaths. Overall, there were two distinct peaks of deaths: the first peak (50.2% of deaths) occurred within the first hour of injury. The second peak occurred 1 to 6 hours after admission (18.3% of deaths). Only 7.6% of deaths were late (>1 week), during the third peak of the classic trimodal distribution. Temporal distribution of deaths in penetrating trauma was very different from blunt trauma and did not follow the classic trimodal distribution. Other significant independent factors associated with time of death were chest AIS and head AIS. Temporal distribution of deaths as a result of severe head trauma did not follow any pattern and did not resemble classic trimodal distribution at all.
CONCLUSIONS: The classic ""trimodal"" distribution of deaths does not apply in our trauma system. Temporal distribution of deaths is influenced by the mechanism of injury, age of the patient, and body area with severe trauma. Knowledge of the time of distribution of deaths might help in allocating trauma resources and focusing research effort."

METHODS: The records of all children with a foreign body in either the nose or ear who presented to the Accident and Emergency Department at The National Children's Hospital over a 2-year period were reviewed.
RESULTS: 82 children presented with a foreign body in the nose and 53 (65%) were successfully managed in the A & E Department. In contrast, of the 58 children with a foreign body in the ear only 4 (7%) were successfully removed in the A & E Department.
CONCLUSION: Most foreign bodies in the nose can be successfully removed in the Accident and Emergency Department. In contrast there is a high failure rate in removal of foreign bodies from the ear in the A & E Department and these should be referred directly to the ENT service."
16125514,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16125514/,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the association between haemoglobin levels, anxiety disorder, and depression in cancer patients.
METHODS: Cancer patients attending The Norwegian Radium Hospital (NRH) rated themselves on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Five hundred thirty-two patients also had valid measurements of haemoglobin at the same time. The associations between tertile haemoglobin levels (7.0-12.3 g/dl, 12.4-13.8 g/dl, 13.9-17.1 g/dl) and HADS-defined anxiety disorder and depression were analysed by logistic regression.
RESULTS: HADS-defined depression was identified in 116 cases (22%) and anxiety disorder in 149 (28%). The haemoglobin levels of the lower and middle tertiles were associated with depression (OR=3.85, 95% CI: 2.06-7.21, and OR=2.45, 95% CI: 1.25-4.81, respectively). Adjustment for covariates did not change the association significantly. No association between haemoglobin and anxiety disorder was found.
CONCLUSION: In cancer patients, the risk of depression increases with decreasing haemoglobin levels. This should be taken into account when treatment of anaemic or depressed cancer patients is decided upon."
16125873,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16125873/,"PURPOSE: The effectiveness of synchronous carboplatin, etoposide, and radiation therapy in improving survival was evaluated by comparison of a matched set of historic control subjects with patients treated in a prospective Phase II study that used synchronous chemotherapy and radiation and adjuvant chemotherapy.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were included in the analysis if they had disease localized to the primary site and nodes, and they were required to have at least one of the following high-risk features: recurrence after initial therapy, involved nodes, primary size greater than 1 cm, or gross residual disease after surgery. All patients who received chemotherapy were treated in a standardized fashion as part of a Phase II study (Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology Group TROG 96:07) from 1997 to 2001. Radiation was delivered to the primary site and nodes to a dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks, and synchronous carboplatin (AUC 4.5) and etoposide, 80 mg/m(2) i.v. on Days 1 to 3, were given in Weeks 1, 4, 7, and 10. The historic group represents a single institution's experience from 1988 to 1996 and was treated with surgery and radiation alone, and patients were included if they fulfilled the eligibility criteria of TROG 96:07. Patients with occult cutaneous disease were not included for the purpose of this analysis. Because of imbalances in the prognostic variables between the two treatment groups, comparisons were made by application of Cox's proportional hazard modeling. Overall survival, disease-specific survival, locoregional control, and distant control were used as endpoints for the study.
RESULTS: Of the 102 patients who had high-risk Stage I and II disease, 40 were treated with chemotherapy (TROG 96:07) and 62 were treated without chemotherapy (historic control subjects). When Cox's proportional hazards modeling was applied, the only significant factors for overall survival were recurrent disease, age, and the presence of residual disease. For disease-specific survival, recurrent disease was the only significant factor. Primary site on the lower limb had an adverse effect on locoregional control. For distant control, the only significant factor was residual disease.
CONCLUSIONS: The multivariate analysis suggests chemotherapy has no effect on survival, but because of the wide confidence limits, a chemotherapy effect cannot be excluded. A study of this size is inadequately powered to detect small improvements in survival, and a larger randomized study remains the only way to truly confirm whether chemotherapy improves the results in high-risk MCC."
16126132,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16126132/,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: We determine whether all patients with pain or tenderness to the left lower ribs after blunt traumatic injury require abdominal computed tomography (CT) scanning for the detection of splenic injury.
METHODS: This was a prospective, observational cohort of all blunt-trauma patients who had pain or tenderness to the left lower ribs and presented to the emergency department (ED) of a Level I trauma center. Patients were enrolled if they had a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score greater than 13 and pain or tenderness to the left lower ribs (ribs 7 to 12). Patients with pain or tenderness to the left lower ribs were considered to have pleuritic pain if the pain increased with inspiration or cough. All hemodynamically stable patients underwent abdominal CT scanning for detection of intraabdominal injuries. Data forms collecting information on the medical history and physical examination of all patients were completed before radiographic imaging. Patients with left lower rib pain or tenderness were considered to have ""isolated"" left lower rib injury if they were without all of the following: ED or out-of-hospital systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg, abdominal or flank tenderness, pelvic or femur fractures, and gross hematuria.
RESULTS: Eight hundred seventy-five patients had left lower rib pain or tenderness, 63 (7.2%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.6% to 9.1%) patients had splenic injuries, and 20 (2.3%; 95% CI 1.4% to 3.5%) patients had left renal injuries. Five hundred seventy-four patients had additional indications for abdominal imaging, leaving 301 patients with ""isolated"" left lower rib injury. Of the 301 patients, 9 (3.0%; 95% CI 1.4% to 5.6%) had splenic injuries. All 9 patients had a pleuritic component to their rib tenderness, and 3 (33%) patients underwent splenectomy.
CONCLUSION: A small but important percentage of patients with pain or tenderness to the left lower ribs has splenic injuries. All patients with splenic injury had pleuritic pain."
16126259,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16126259/,"OBJECTIVE: At present, cervical cancer remains the only gynecologic tumor, which is staged by clinical examination according to FIGO. This is associated with a high percentage of over- and understaging of tumor extent. With the operative, especially laparoscopic staging, exact information about intraabdominal tumor spread, lymph node metastases, and involvement of adjacent organs is possible. However, the advantage of operative staging is still discussed controversially. The aim of this study is to describe the laparoscopic transperitoneal staging procedure in patients with cervical cancer and their oncologic outcome after primary chemoradiation.
METHODS: From November 1994 to October 2003, 456 consecutive patients with histologically confirmed primary cervical cancer were admitted to the Department of Gynecology of the Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena, Germany. Out of these, 84 patients with locally advanced tumor (tumor size>or=4 cm) and/or lymph node involvement and/or tumor infiltration to bladder or rectum were selected by a standardized laparoscopic staging procedure for primary chemoradiation. Data of surgery, chemoradiation, and follow-up were analyzed retrospectively for these patients.
RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 54 years (26-80), and the mean body-mass-index was 24.8 (17.9-42.2). Preoperative clinical evaluation showed a stage distribution according to FIGO with stage IB1 in 15.5%, IB2 in 15.5%, IIA in 8.3%, IIB in 23.8%, IIIA in 8.3%, IIIB in 21.4%, IVA in 6%, and IVB in 1.2%. In 15 out of 84 (17.8%) patients, intraabdominal tumor spread was diagnosed by laparascopy. In 24 out of 84 (28.5%) patients, invasion of bladder and/or rectum was proven histologically after biopsy. In 60 out of 84 (71%) patients, lymph node metastases were confirmed histologically. In 2 out of 13 patients with FIGO-stage Ib1, skip metastases in infrarenal paraaortic lymph nodes were seen. Removal of more than 5 pelvic and/or more than 5 positive paraaortic lymph nodes was associated with significant improvement of overall survival. According to the histological findings following laparoscopic staging in 36 out of 84 (43%) patients, a higher tumor stage was diagnosed. If tumor involvement of lymph nodes is also included, an upstaging in 73/84 (87%) of patients has to be noted down. Downstaging was not necessary in any patient following laparoscopic evaluation.
CONCLUSION: Only operative staging gives exact information about tumor extension in patients with locally advanced and/or nodal positive cervical cancer and allows individual treatment planning. This can be done successfully by a transperitoneal laparoscopic approach without serious adverse effects delaying chemoradiation. Debulking of tumor-involved lymph nodes significantly improves overall survival and should be performed prior to primary chemoradiation. Laparoscopic staging should be the basis for all treatment studies in order to group patients according to true tumor extent."
16126324,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16126324/,"OBJECTIVES: The present retrospective study was designed to investigate the value of transition zone (TZ) biopsies for prostate cancer (PC) detection rate in a combined contrast enhanced color Doppler targeted (CECD) and gray-scale systematic biopsy (SB) approach.
METHODS: PSA screening participants totalling 1475 with tPSA of >1.25 ng/ml (fPSA< or =18%) were assessed. Ten SB and additionally 5 or fewer CECD were performed. The impact of TZ biopsies on the PC detection rate and the biological significance of the detected TZ-cancers were analyzed.
RESULTS: Out of 1475 biopsied patients, 395 (26.8%) were identified as PC patients; 5925 biopsy cores from these patients were analyzed. In 86 patients (21.8% of PC), we found 102 PC- positive cores in the TZ, and only in 9 of them solitary TZ-cancers without any other PC-location (2.3% of PC or 0.6% of all investigated patients). Pathologic findings after retropubic prostatectomy (RPE) revealed multifocal adenocarcinoma including involved peripheral zone (PZ) in eight of these nine patients, and solitary TZ-cancer in one patient. There was no positive correlation between prostate volume and TZ-detection rate and no patient with solitary TZ-PC after rebiopsy.
CONCLUSION: Biopsy revealed 9 solitary TZ cancers (1.8%) and RPE revealed only one of them to be truly TZ-confined cancer (0.6%). Furthermore PC-detection did not improve, even in patients with rebiopsy, and there was no correlation between detection of TZ-cancers and prostate volume. A combined use of CECD and SB to investigate participants of a PSA-screening program suggests that TZ-biopsies do not improve PC detection rate and are therefore unnecessary."
16126779,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16126779/,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the prevalence of efflux and amino acid substitutions in ParC and GyrA in Canadian clinical isolates of fluoroquinolone-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae with levofloxacin MICs of 1 mg/L collected before the introduction of the respiratory fluoroquinolones (1995-1997) and after 7 years of use (2003).
METHODS: Quinolone resistance determining regions of parC and gyrA were sequenced for 111 clinical isolates collected from 1995 to 1997 and 665 isolates collected in 2003. Efflux was assessed using a reserpine agar dilution method.
RESULTS: No isolates exhibited efflux. No significant increase in isolates harbouring amino acid substitutions was observed over time (0.9% in 1995-1997 to 2.1% in 2003, P = 0.32). However, the proportion of isolates with a ciprofloxacin MIC = 2 mg/L and a levofloxacin MIC = 1 mg/L versus ciprofloxacin MIC = 1 mg/L and a levofloxacin MIC = 1 mg/L increased over time (3.6% to 6.5%, P = 0.0021).
CONCLUSIONS: No increase in prevalence of first-step parC mutations was observed among all fluoroquinolone-susceptible clinical isolates of S. pneumoniae with levofloxacin MICs of 1 mg/L after the introduction of the respiratory fluoroquinolones; however, fluoroquinolones appear to be selecting for isolates with elevated ciprofloxacin MICs."

The aim of this study was to reduce the proportion of culture negative urines arriving in the laboratory, by producing local evidence based guidelines for the use of urine dipstick testing at point of care within the trust's three acute hospitals.
METHODS: One thousand and seventy six unborated urine samples were dipstick tested at the point of care using an automatic strip reader. Quantitative results for the four infection associated markers-leucocyte esterase, nitrite, blood, and protein-were compared with the results of conventional laboratory microscopy and culture.
RESULTS: The performance of different marker combinations was calculated against the routine laboratory methods. One hundred and seventy five (16.3%) samples were negative for all four markers. Of these dipstick negative samples, only three (1.7% of all true positives) were positive by culture. The absence of all four infection associated markers was found to have a greater than 98% negative predictive value and a sensitivity and specificity of 98.3% and 19.2%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: A urinary dipstick testing algorithm for infection associated markers was derived for use in hospital patients to screen out negative urines. Two years after distributing the algorithm and promoting access to reagent strips and strip readers, a reduction in the urine workload has been seen against an otherwise increasing laboratory specimen load."
16127107,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16127107/,"BACKGROUND: The association between low socioeconomic status and poor physical functioning has been well described; biomedical factors may play an important role in explaining these differences. This study examines the association between socioeconomic status and incident mobility limitation in well-functioning older adults, and seeks to determine whether this link could be explained by biomedical factors.
METHODS: Data were obtained from 3066 men and women, aged 70--79 years from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Memphis, Tennessee participating in the Health, Aging and Body Composition (Health ABC) study. Three indicators of socioeconomic status were used: education, income, and ownership of financial assets. Mobility limitation was defined as reporting difficulty walking 1/4 mile or climbing 10 steps during two consecutive semiannual assessments over 4.5 years. Biomedical factors included a wide range of diseases (e.g., heart and cerebrovascular disease) and biological risk factors (e.g. hypertension, poor pulmonary function, and high serum levels of inflammatory markers).
RESULTS: Adjusted hazard ratios of incident mobility limitation were significantly higher in those persons with low education, low income, and few assets. Hazard ratios ranged from 1.66 to 2.80 in the lowest socioeconomic groups. Additional adjustment for biomedical factors reduced the hazard ratios by an average of 41% for education, 17% for income, and 29% for assets.
CONCLUSION: Biomedical factors can account for some of the association between socioeconomic status and incident mobility limitation. However, to reduce physical disabilities and, in particular, the socioeconomic differences therein, it may not be sufficient to solely intervene upon biological risk factors and risks of diseases."
16127509,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16127509/,"OBJECTIVE: Burnout syndrome (BOS) is a state of physical, and emotional or mental exhaustion, depersonalization, and low personal accomplishment. Health care givers are most prone to suffer from BOS. There are no studies to date on BOS among trained orthopedic, and trauma surgeons. The objective of this study, was to assess the prevalence of BOS among the orthopedic surgeons in the Eastern province of Saudi Arabia.
METHODS: This study was conducted among the orthopedic surgeons of the Eastern province of Saudi Arabia between September 2003 and October 2004. One hundred and two questionnaires of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) were sent to the qualified orthopedic surgeons with a self-addressed stamped envelope, from the Department of Orthopedic Surgery, King Fahd Hospital of the University, Al-Khobar. Three factors of MBI, which were assessed, were emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment. The data were entered in the database, and analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Science.
RESULTS: Sixty-nine (67.6%) of the orthopedic surgeons completed the questionnaire. The average age was 45.72 +/- 6.82 (33-57) years. Thirty-five (50.7%) were found to be in a state of emotional exhaustion, 59.4% depersonalized, and 17% had low state of personal accomplishment. Doctors working in the government hospitals fared better than those in the private sector.
CONCLUSION: Burnout syndrome is common among orthopedic surgeons working in the Eastern province Saudi Arabia. It is emphasized that awareness of the problem should be highlighted; programs need to be put in place to reduce the prevalence of burnout syndrome."
16127511,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16127511/,"OBJECTIVE: Within soft-tissue sarcoma, primitive neuroectodermal tumors have been shown to cover a wide spectrum of small round cell sarcomas, including Ewing's sarcomas (ES) and primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET). The role of the stem cell factor/kit pathway has been investigated in different human tumors especially in chronic myelocytic leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumor and an autocrine loop has been assumed in small cell lung carcinoma, and recently in ES and PNET. Our aim is to investigate the c-kit expression in ES and PNET and also to assessed if c-kit has any role in disease process.
METHODS: We thoroughly searched the archives of the Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Cukurova University Turkey, between 2000 and 2004; and found 14 ES and 14 PNET paraffin embedded tissues. We carried out the detection of the c-kit expression by immunohistochemical staining.
RESULTS: The patient's median age was 23.7 +/-14.6 (12 male and 16 female). Five were diagnosed as metastatic disease whereas 23 were diagnosed as non-metastatic disease at admission. The mean follow up period was 38.9 +/- 22.3 months. The main localization of the disease was lower extremity (32.1%), and others were as follows: head and neck 25%, thorax and abdomen 14.3%, pelvic and upper extremity 7.1% (11 were localized skeletal and 17 were extraskeletal). According to treatment modalities, 10 were treated with surgery alone, 11 with surgery and chemotherapy, and 7 with surgery, radiation therapy and also with chemotherapy. The primary tumor was lower than 5 cm in its dimension in 21 patients. While in 5 patients, tumor was more than 5 cm but did not exceed 10 cm, it was >10 cm in 2 patients. The c-kit expression was positive in 7 patients both cytoplasmic and membranously, whereas 8 patients were positive cytoplasmically. In 5 PNET patients, c-kit expression were stained immunohistochemically in over 50% and in 3 of ES patients. There was no significant correlation between c-kit expression and gender, localization, metastatic status, treatment modalities and tumor. Although in survival analysis, patients treated with surgery alone lived longer, while >50% of patients treated with c-kit expression lived for a shorter period.
CONCLUSION: We suggest that therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitor for PNET and ES patients may be an alternative in addition to standard therapy modalities, especially in patients non-responsive to standard therapy."

AIM: To determine in vitro whether hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury may be detected regardless mitochondrial respiratory activity.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-four heartworm-free mongrel dogs of either sex were randomized in the following groups: control, sham-operated dogs; I60, dogs subjected to 60 min of liver ischemia; I30/R60, dogs subjected to 30 min of ischemia e 60 min of reperfusion of liver; I45/R120 animals subjected to 45 min of ischemia and 120 min of reperfusion of liver. Blood and liver samples were taken after surgery to be processed. Mitochondrial respiratory activity was measured with a Clark-type oxygen electrode and mitochondrial membrane potential was calculated. lactic dehydrogenase, aspartate amino transferase and alanine aminotrasferase activities were determinated using laboratory kits, and malondialdehyde content in liver samples was estimated.
RESULTS: The group I45/R120 showed increases of serum aminotransferase, lactic dehydrogenase and malondialdehyde in liver samples. Whereas no changes were registered in mitochondrial respiratory activities and mitochondrial membrane potential, a tendency of decrease in the rate of active respiration (state 3) could be observed.
CONCLUSION: Under the conditions of this study, the results suggest the data from mitochondrial respiratory activity could show no significance difference among groups in hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury. Hepatic ischemia reperfusion injury can be detected regardless mitochondrial respiratory activity."

The aim of our study was to assess the impact of apolipoprotein E (apo E) polymorphism and other factors on atherosclerotic vascular disease in type-2 diabetic patients. We also examined the association between apo E polymorphism and lipid profile in diabetic patients.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We assessed the apo E polymorphism in 295 atherosclerotic patients (124 of them had diabetes (according to WHO criteria) and 171 of them had coronary artery narrowing > 50). The detection of apo E polymorphism was made by Real-Time PCR using a Light-Cycler (Roche diagnostics, GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). Serum triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)], apolipoprotein A (Apo A) and apolipoprotein B (Apo B) levels were determined by biochemical analyser. Genotypic distribution of apo E polymorphism did not differ between diabetic and non-diabetic atherosclerotic patients. The distributions of apo E2/2, E2/3, E2/4, E3/3, E3/4 and E4/4 genotypes in diabetic and non-diabetic atherosclerotic patients were 7.3%: 8.2%, 15.3%: 15.8%, 4.0%: 5.3%, 50.8%: 56.7%, 16.9%: 11.1% and 5.6%: 2.9%, respectively. Participants were grouped as apo E2 (E2/2 or E2/3), apo E3 (E3/3), or apo E4 (E4/4 or E4/3). The distributions of apo E2, E3 and E4 alleles were 23.5%, 52.9%, 23.5%, for diabetic patients, and 25.3%, 59.9%, 14.8% for non-diabetic patients, respectively. The apolipoprotein E genotype was not associated with the lipid levels in diabetic patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings imply that apo E polymorphism is not related to the development of atherosclerosis in patients with type-2 diabetes."
16128860,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16128860/,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate alterations in endothelial nitric oxide synthase and inducible nitric oxide synthase mRNA expressions and nitric oxide release in the myocardium during ischaemia/reperfusion and determine whether these changes are ischaemic and/or reperfusion dependent.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Isolated rat hearts were perfused by a modified Langendorff system. Following 1 h of global cardioplegic ischaemia, left ventricle haemodynamic parameters were recorded at baseline and during 30 min of reperfusion. Levels of endothelial, inducible nitric oxide synthases mRNA expression and nitric oxide release were measured at baseline, after ischaemia and at 30 min of reperfusion.
RESULTS: Global cardioplegic ischaemia caused a significant depression of left ventricular function and a decrease of coronary flow. Postischaemic intensities of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase mRNA bands were significantly lower than at baseline (P < 0.01). There were no significant differences in endothelial nitric oxide synthase mRNA band intensities immediately after ischaemia compared to the end of reperfusion, nor between the intensities of inducible nitric oxide synthase mRNA bands at baseline, at end of ischaemia and at end of reperfusion. Nitric oxide in the myocardial effluent was below detectable levels at all measured points.
CONCLUSION: Ischaemic injury causes down-regulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase mRNA expression, which is then associated with reduction of coronary flow during reperfusion, representing one possible mechanism of ischaemia/reperfusion injury. We did not find expected elevations of inducible nitric oxide synthase mRNA expression during ischaemia or reperfusion and we suggest that ischaemia/reperfusion injury is not associated with nitric oxide overproduction."
16128936,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16128936/,"AIM: To study the efficacy of esomeprazole-based triple therapy in Helicobacter pylori eradication and to evaluate, by a randomized trial, the effect of increasing the dose of esomeprazole or prolonging the treatment.
METHODS: Four-hundred and fifty duodenal ulcer patients were randomized to receive: (1) esomeprazole (20 mg b.i.d.), clarithromycin (500 mg b.i.d.), and amoxicillin (1 g b.i.d.), for 7 days (E20-7d); (2) esomeprazole (40 mg b.i.d.) with the same antibiotics, also for 7 days (E40-7d); and (3) esomeprazole (40 mg b.i.d.) with the same antibiotics, for 10 days (E40-10d). Cure rates were evaluated by (13)C-urea breath test.
RESULTS: One-hundred and fifty patients received each treatment. Groups were comparable in terms of demographic variables. Eight percent of the patients did not return for follow-up. Compliance (98%) and side effects (only mild to moderate) in the two groups were comparable. Per-protocol cure rates were 83.5% (E20-7d), 84.8% (E40-7d), and 88.2% (E40-10d). Intention-to-treat cure rates were, respectively, 74%, 78%, and 80% (nonstatistically significant differences).
CONCLUSIONS: Esomeprazole-based triple therapies offer comparable efficacy to omeprazole-based therapies used in previous studies. Increasing the dose of esomeprazole or prolonging the treatment does not improve the results. Therefore, if esomeprazole-based triple therapy is used in duodenal ulcer patients, a regimen with only 20 mg twice daily of esomeprazole and for only 7 days may be sufficient."
16128969,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16128969/,"BACKGROUND: Most women will sustain some degree of trauma to the genital tract after vaginal birth. This study aimed to examine the association between maternal position at birth and perineal outcome in women who had a midwife-attended, spontaneous vaginal birth and an uncomplicated pregnancy at term.
METHODS: Data from 3,756 births in a major public tertiary teaching hospital were eligible for analysis. The need for sutures in perineal trauma was evaluated and compared for each major factor studied (maternal age, first vaginal delivery, induction of labor, not occipitoanterior, use of regional anesthesia, deflexed head and newborn birthweight >3,500 g). Birth positions were compared against each other. Subgroup analysis determined whether birth positions mattered more or less in each of the major factors studied. The chi-square test was used to compare categorical variables.
RESULTS: Most women (65.9%) gave birth in the semi-recumbent position. Of the 1,679 women (44.5%) who required perineal suturing, semi-recumbent position was associated with the need for perineal sutures, whereas all-fours was associated with reduced need for sutures; these associations were more marked in first vaginal births and newborn birth weight over 3,500 g. When regional anesthesia was used, semi-recumbent position was associated with a need for suturing, and lateral position associated with a reduced need for suturing. The four major factors significantly related to perineal trauma included first vaginal birth, use of regional anesthesia, deflexed head, and newborn weight more than 3,500 g.
CONCLUSIONS: Women should be given the choice to give birth in whatever position they find comfortable. Maternity practitioners have a responsibility to inform women of the likelihood of perineal trauma in the preferred birth position. Ongoing audit of all clinicians attending births is encouraged to further determine effects of maternal birth position and perineal trauma, to investigate women's perception of comfortable positioning at birth, and to measure changes to midwifery practice resulting from this study."
16128970,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16128970/,"BACKGROUND: Studying populations with low cesarean delivery rates can identify strategies for reducing unnecessary cesareans in other patient populations. Native American women have among the lowest cesarean delivery rates of all United States populations, yet few studies have focused on Native Americans. The study purpose was to determine the rate and risk factors for cesarean delivery in a Native American population.
METHODS: We used a case-control design nested within a cohort of Native American live births, > or = 35 weeks of gestation (n = 789), occurring at an Indian Health Service hospital during 1996-1999. Data were abstracted from the labor and delivery logbook, the hospital's primary source of birth certificate data. Univariate and multivariate analyses examined demographic, prenatal, obstetric, intrapartum, and fetal factors associated with cesarean versus vaginal delivery.
RESULTS: The total cesarean rate was 9.6 percent (95% CI 7.2-12.0). Nulliparity, a medical diagnosis, malpresentation, induction, labor length > 12.1 hours, arrested labor, fetal distress, meconium, and gestations < 37 weeks were each significantly associated with cesarean delivery in unadjusted analyses. The final multivariate model included a significant interaction between induction and arrested labor (p < 0.001); the effect of arrested labor was far greater among induced (OR 161.9) than noninduced (OR 6.0) labors. Other factors significantly associated with cesarean delivery in the final logistic model were an obstetrician labor attendant (OR 2.4; p = 0.02) and presence of meconium (OR 2.3; p = 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite a higher prevalence of medical risk factors for cesarean delivery, the rate at this hospital was well below New Mexico (16.4%, all races) and national (21.2%, all races) cesarean rates for 1998. Medical and practice-related factors were the only observed independent correlates of cesarean delivery. Implementation of institutional and practitioner policies common to the Indian Health Service may reduce cesarean deliveries in other populations."

DESIGN: Analyses of data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999-2000.
PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: Men and women aged > or = 19 years (N=4,218), excluding pregnant and/or lactating women.
STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: SAS (release 8.1, 2000, SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) and SUDAAN (release 8.0.2, 2003, Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC) software were used to calculate sample-weighted means, standard errors, and population percentages of breakfast consumers. Multiple logistic and linear regression models, with controls for covariates, were used to determine the predictability of body mass index from breakfast consumption and from inclusion of ready-to-eat cereal (RTEC) in the breakfast meal.
RESULTS: Breakfast consumers were more likely than breakfast nonconsumers to be older, female, white, nonsmokers, regular exercisers, and trying to control their weight. For women, daily energy intake was higher among breakfast consumers than among breakfast nonconsumers; for both men and women, energy intake from fat among RTEC breakfast consumers was significantly lower than among non-RTEC breakfast consumers, whereas energy from carbohydrate among RTEC breakfast consumers was significantly higher than among non-RTEC breakfast consumers. For women, the odds ratios for BMI > or = 25 were lower for breakfast consumers (odds ratio = 0.76) and RTEC breakfast consumers (odds ratio = 0.70) compared with breakfast nonconsumers and non-RTEC breakfast consumers, respectively, after adjusting the models for covariates. When RTEC consumption was added as a covariate, breakfast consumers no longer exhibited significantly lower odds ratios compared with breakfast nonconsumers. Furthermore, regression analyses supported an inverse association between RTEC breakfast consumption and body mass index in women (regression coefficient = -0.37, P<.01) after adjusting for covariates.
CONCLUSIONS: When we document the association of breakfast consumption with lower prevalence of overweight and obesity, types of meal should be considered as an important determinant. RTEC breakfast consumption, associated with a desirable macronutrient profile for preventing obesity, predicted weight status in women, but not in men. In addition to sex difference in the association of breakfast consumption and RTEC breakfast consumption with lower prevalence of overweight, the effects of physiological variables and health-related behaviors on the relationship between total and RTEC intake at breakfast and weight status, remain to be established."
16129254,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16129254/,"PURPOSE: To assess early high-resolution computer tomographic (CT) signs of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) in non-HIV immunosuppressed patients and their potential association with patient's outcome, including frequency and severity of pulmonary hemorrhage, taking also in consideration the impact of other known risk factors contributory to IPA.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective review of serial CT scans was performed in 45 immunocompromised patients with a total of 46 episodes of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. All patients underwent CT beginning with the day they showed clinical or laboratory signs of infection. Serial follow-up CT included more than two, up to 12 CT examinations. Patient's outcome was judged by clinical and radiological follow-up and classified as survival, death by IPA, or death unrelated to IPA. The influence of patient's age, underlying disease, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, neutropenia, graft versus host disease, and antifungal therapy onset was also statistically considered.
RESULTS: Three main CT findings were identified: small nodules (<1cm) 43% (20/46), large nodules 21% (10/46) and consolidations, either in patchy+/-segmental 26% (12/46), or peribronchial distribution+/-tree in bud 9% (4/46). In 11 patients (24%) we found a combination of two or more of these signs: 9 (19%) patients presented concurrent small nodules accompanied by reticulation, tree in bud or peribronchial infiltrates, while 2 (4%) patients showed large pulmonary nodules accompanied by large consolidations. An accompanying ""halo"" sign was observed in 38 patients (82%). Crescent sign followed by cavitation was encountered in 29 patients (63%). Two patients succumbed to massive pulmonary bleeding caused by IPA. Twenty-one patients (15/46) deceased in this series, 12 of them succumbed to IPA, 1 died from cerebral invasive aspergillosis, while in 9 patients the cause of death was not primarily IPA. Manifest pulmonary hemorrhage occurred in 19% (9/46) of IPA episodes.
CONCLUSION: Initial CT findings of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis consist mainly of small nodules or patchy consolidations, showing in 82% of cases an early halo sign. Serious pulmonary hemorrhage was an infrequent clinical complication in our series, with an attributable mortality of 4.3%. IPA-related lethality was 26%, in our cohort. None of the early HRCT signs seemed to predict outcome."
16129255,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16129255/,"PURPOSE: Virtual bronchoscopy has gained popularity over the past decade as an alternative investigation to conventional bronchoscopy in the diagnosis, grading and monitoring of airway disease. The effect of technical parameters on diagnostic outcome from virtual bronchoscopy has not been determined. This meta-analysis aims to estimate accuracy of virtual compared to conventional bronchoscopy in patients with suspected airway stenosis, and evaluate the influence of technical parameters.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A MEDLINE search was used to identify relevant published studies. The primary endpoint was the ""correct diagnosis"" of stenotic lesions on virtual compared to conventional bronchoscopy. Secondary endpoints included the effects of the technical parameters (pitch, collimation, reconstruction interval, rendering method, and scanner type), and date of publication on the diagnostic accuracy of virtual bronchoscopy.
RESULTS: Thirteen studies containing 454 patients were identified. Meta-analysis showed good overall diagnostic performance with 85% calculated pooled sensitivity (95% CI 77-91%), 87% specificity (95% CI 81-92%) and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.947. Subgroups included collimation of 3mm or more (AUC 0.948), pitch of 1 (AUC 0.955), surface rendering technique (AUC 0.935), and reconstruction interval of more than 1.25 mm (AUC 0.914). There was no significant difference in accuracy accounting for publication date, scanner type or any of the above variables. Weighted regression analysis confirmed none of these variables could significantly account for study heterogeneity.
CONCLUSION: Virtual bronchoscopy performs well in the investigation of patients with suspected airway stenosis. Overall sensitivity and specificity and diagnostic odds ratio for diagnosis of airway stenosis were high. The effects of pitch, collimation, reconstruction interval, rendering technique, scanner type, and publication date on diagnostic accuracy were not significant."
16129630,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16129630/,"OBJECTIVE: Adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ATMSCs) have been shown to differentiate into bone, cartilage, fat or muscle. However, it is not certain that ATMSCs are equal to bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSC) for their bone and cartilage forming potential. The purpose of this study was to answer the question.
METHODS: BMMSCs were obtained from the medullary canal of femur and ATMSCs were isolated from the fat harvested during liposuction procedures. After cell expansion in culture media and two passages, the immunofluorescent studies for STRO-1 and CD34 were performed to characterize the BMMSCs and ATMSCs. Osteogenesis was induced on a monolayer culture with osteogenic medium containing dexamethasone, beta-glycerophosphate and ascorbate. After 2-3 weeks, alkaline phosphatase (AP) and Von Kossa staining were done. To test for chondrogenesis, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were cultured in a pellet culture and in a fibrin scaffold with a chondrogenic medium (CM) containing transforming growth factor-beta(2) and insulin-like growth factor-I. After 4 weeks, Safranin-O staining and immunohistochemical staining for type II collagen were done to evaluate the chondrogenic differentiation and the matrix production. A histological scale was used to semiquantitatively assess the degree of chondrogenesis.
RESULTS: Both BMMSCs and ATMSCs were STRO-1 positive and CD34 negative. On the test of osteogenesis, the osteoblastic differentiation of ATMSCs as demonstrated by AP staining was much less than that of the BMMSCs (P=0.002). The amount of matrix mineralization shown by Von Kossa staining also showed statistical differences between the two MSCs (P=0.011). On the test for chondrogenesis by the pellet culture ATMSCs showed much weaker presentation as chondrogenic cells in both cell morphology and the matrix production. The histological score was 6.5 (SD1.3) for the BMMSCs, and 4.3 (SD1.6) for the ATMSCs cultured in CM, which was statistically significant (P=0.023). The results from fibrin gel paralleled those from the pellet culture in general.
CONCLUSION: The results of our study suggest that the ATMSCs may have an inferior potential for both osteogenesis and chondrogenesis compared with the BMMSCs, and these cast doubts on the value of adipose tissue as a source of MSCs."
16130846,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16130846/,"OBJECTIVE: To identify the prevalence of first-trimester cervical group B Streptococcus (GBS) colonization in routine obstetric patients and whether a relationship exists between first-trimester cervical GBS colonization and maternal GBS bacteriuria or GBS colonization at term.
STUDY DESIGN: An institutional review board-approved prospective, cohort study was performed. The study population included consecutively recruited, unselected obstetric patients who delivered at our medical center, presented for care in thefirst trimester and were followed for the duration of their pregnancies. Each patient consented to have an extra culture swab for GBS status obtained at the time of her first prenatal visit when a routine examination was performed. Urine and third-trimester culture data were also collectedfrom each study subject.
RESULTS: Of the 90 women with complete delivery data, 17 (19%) hadfirst-trimester cervical cultures positive for GBS. Women with first-trimester cervical GBS colonization were more likely to have third-trimester colonization on screening cultures than were women whose initial cultures were negative (35% vs. 14%, p = 0.05). The sensitivity of a GBS-positive cervical culture for detecting the coexisting presence of GBS bacteriuria was 38%, with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 31% and negative predictive value of 89%. When the outcome of interest was expanded to include GBS bacteriuria or third trimester colonization, the PPV of a positive cervical culture increased to 73%.
CONCLUSION: First-trimester GBS colonization of the cervix may be as sensitive as antepartum GBS bacteriuria, an established risk factor, for predicting maternal GBS colonization at term."
16131532,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16131532/,"AIM: To assess the ability of nurse practitioners to manage the care of all babies requiring resuscitation at birth in a unit without on site medical assistance.
METHOD: A prospective review, and selective external audit, of the case records of all 14 572 babies born in a maternity unit in the north of England during the first eight years after nurse practitioners replaced resident paediatric staff in 1996.
RESULTS: Every non-malformed baby with an audible heart beat at the start of delivery was successfully resuscitated. Twenty term babies and 41 preterm babies were intubated at birth. Eight term babies only responded after acidosis or hypovolaemia was corrected following umbilical vein catheterisation; in each case the catheter was in place within six minutes of birth. Early grade 2-3 neonatal encephalopathy occurred with much the same frequency (0.12%) as in other recent studies. Independent external cross validated review found no case of substandard care during the first hour of life.
CONCLUSION: The practitioners successfully managed all the problems coming their way from the time of appointment. There was no evidence that their skill decreased over time even though, on average, they only found themselves undertaking laryngeal intubation once a year. It remains to be shown that this level of competence can be replicated in other settings."
16131989,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16131989/,"OBJECTIVES: The gastric emptying breath test (GEBT) is now routinely used in many centers. Validation studies in adults have shown that although there is a linear correlation between the GEBT and scintigraphy, the GEBT overestimates gastric half emptying time (GEt1/2) by a constant of approximately 60 minutes because of postgastric processing. It is therefore conventional to apply a ""correction factor"" to the GEBT result. Because = no similar validation studies have been performed in infants, the aim of this study was to directly characterize the postgastric processing of 13C octanoic acid in infants to assess the suitability of the standard correction factor for use in infants.
METHODS: The pattern of breath 13CO2 excretion after separate infusion of 13C octanoic acid into either the stomach or the duodenum was measured in 13 healthy preterm infants (6 male, 7 female). The raw 13CO2 half excretion time after intragastric (GEt1/2 raw) and intraduodenal (DEt1/2 raw) administration of C octanoic acid was calculated, and the difference between GEt1/2 raw and DEt1/2 raw (i.e., GEt1/2 raw - DEt1/2 raw) was directly compared with GEt1/2 corrected, derived by applying the standard correction factor to GEt1/2 raw.
RESULTS: Values for GEt1/2 raw - DEt1/2 raw correlated significantly with GEt1/2 corrected.
CONCLUSION: Our results show that the standard correction factor is appropriate for performing the GEBT in preterm infants."
16132886,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16132886/,"OBJECTIVE: To study the implementation of multidisciplinary structured work shift evaluations at a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) to enhance team communication.
DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective, repeated measurements design, comparison of pre/post measurements and process measures in a Dutch tertiary care, university-affiliated PICU.
PARTICIPANTS: All 61 PICU staff members.
INTERVENTIONS: Implementing multidisciplinary structured work shift evaluations. Before the implementation phase the PICU team received feedback training and eight participants (four physicians, four nurses) were trained as ""work shift evaluation leader.""
MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Outcome measures covered: (a) quality and process of the implementation through prestructured checklists during the 3 months of implementation, (b) a subjective evaluation of a feedback training on team communication as anticipated action and on the level of communication (about patients and with colleagues), and (c) emotional exhaustion complaints and work-related fatigue. The interdisciplinary structured work shift evaluations were implemented successfully as planned during the work shift; all staff were trained ahead, and the process was followed almost completely. Almost two-thirds (62%) of the staff felt a positive influence on team communication. Almost all staff members (92%) were satisfied regarding communication with their colleagues after the intervention, compared to 76% before. Emotional exhaustion in the PICU team decreased significantly after the implementation, but no differences in work-related fatigue levels were found.
CONCLUSIONS: As organizational change the implementation of a multidisciplinary structured work shift evaluation at a PICU was successful and team communication improved. Emotional exhaustion decreased during the study period."
16133071,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16133071/,"BACKGROUND: Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is increasingly being used by patients with cancer.
OBJECTIVES: Our aim is to compare the attitudes of cancer patients who use CAM to those of nonusers, on issues of CAM, biopsychosocial considerations, and spiritual needs.
METHODS: Questionnaires were administered to patients and medical care providers in a tertiary teaching hospital with a comprehensive cancer center.
RESULTS: Forty-nine percent of the study patients reported integrating CAM into their conventional care. Health care providers considered psychological and spiritual needs as major reasons for CAM use, while patients considered the familial-social aspect to be more important.
CONCLUSIONS: Cancer patients do not correlate CAM use with spiritual concerns but expect their physicians to attend to spiritual themes. Health care providers involved in oncology cancer care should emphasize spiritual as well as CAM themes. The integration of these themes into a biopsychosocial-spiritual approach may enrich the dialogue between patients and health providers."
16133077,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16133077/,"UNLABELLED: Intra-operative incidental contamination of surgical wounds is not rare. Povidone-iodine solution can be used to disinfect surgical wounds. Although povidone-iodine is a good broad-spectrum disinfecting agent, it has occasionally been reported to have a negative effect on wound healing and bone union. Therefore, its safety in a spinal surgery is unclear. A prospective, single-blinded, randomized study was accordingly conducted to evaluate the safety of povidone-iodine solution in spinal surgeries. Ascertained herein was the effect of wound irrigation with diluted povidone-iodine solution on wound healing, infection rate, fusion status and clinical outcome of spinal surgeries.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 2002 to August 2003, 244 consecutive cases undergoing primary instrumented lumbosacral posterolateral fusion due to degenerative spinal disorder with segmental instability had been collected and randomly divided into two groups: the study group (120 cases, 212 fusion levels) and the control group (124 cases, 223 fusion levels). Excluded were those patients with a prior spinal surgery, spinal trauma, malignant tumor, infectious spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, metabolic bone disease, skeletal immaturity or with an immunosuppressive treatment. In the former group, wounds were irrigated with 0.35% povidone-iodine solution followed by normal saline solution just before the bone-grafting and instrumentation procedure. However, only with normal saline solution in the latter. All the operations were done by the same surgeon with a standard technique. All the patients were treated in the same postoperative fashion as well. Later on, wound healing, infection rate, spinal bone fusion and clinical outcome were evaluated in both groups.
RESULTS: A significant improvement of back and leg pain scores, modified Japanese Orthopedic Association function scores (JOA) and ambulatory capacity have been observed in both groups. One hundred and seven patients in the study group and one hundred and nine in the control group achieved solid union. There was no infection in the study group but six deep infections in the control group. Wound dehiscence was noted in one group 1 and two group 2 patients. A subsequent statistical analysis revealed higher infection rate in the control group (P<0.05), but no significant difference in fusion rate, wound healing, improvement of pain score, function score and ambulatory capacity between the two groups.
CONCLUSION: Diluted povidone-iodine solution can be used safely in spinal surgeries, and it will not influence wound healing, bone union and clinical outcome."
16133127,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16133127/,"RATIONALE: Imipramine has often been used as positive control in studies investigating the efficacy of new antidepressants. Imipramine-controlled studies in general employ a fixed-dose design. It is unclear how many patients would achieve effective plasma levels with such a design.
OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to assess the range of doses necessary to attain a therapeutic plasma level in the imipramine arms of two double-blind, fixed-plasma-level studies and to compare them with doses administered in efficacy studies with imipramine as a positive control.
METHOD: During two double-blind studies, imipramine doses were adjusted to a predefined fixed plasma level. Here we report an analysis of the range of doses necessary to attain that level in the imipramine arms of the studies. We also computed the cumulative percentage of patients with therapeutic plasma levels (> or = 200 ng/ml) at various imipramine doses in order to compare them with doses administered in efficacy studies with imipramine as a positive control.
RESULTS: Target plasma levels were attained with a mean daily dose of 248 mg, with a dose range of 50-450 mg. We calculated a possible increase in efficacy of imipramine of about 20% if doses had been adjusted to therapeutic plasma levels in clinical trials using it as a positive control.
CONCLUSIONS: The absence of significant differences in efficacy between selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and imipramine in these trials is at least in part due to improper dosing of the latter; imipramine with therapeutic drug monitoring may be more effective than SSRIs."

METHODS: A retrospective review of case notes were undertaken from Jan 1998 to March 2003 of all the cases undergoing posterior fossa decompressions by the senior author. Forty patients were identified of which 12 had oculomotor and vestibulo-ocular manifestations.
RESULTS: Oculomotor and vestibulo-ocular symptoms were present in seven patients and eleven patients had clinical signs. There were only 2 patients who had symptoms and no objective findings. There was complete resolution of oculomotor and vestibulo-ocular manifestations in 8/12 patients and partial improvement in another one, leading to improvement in 9/12 patients. The mean time span to complete resolution was 15.5 months (range 3-71 months).

16135001,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16135001/,"BACKGROUND: The standard treatment of food allergy is elimination of the incriminated food from the diet. Specific oral tolerance induction (SOTI) seems to be a promising approach for a causal treatment; however, it is unclear whether the tolerance achieved is transient or persistent. We report on a subset of three patients of a larger ongoing study who were treated successfully with SOTI treatment, but experienced a secondary loss of tolerance after a period of allergen avoidance.
METHODS: The patients suffered from IgE-mediated allergy either to cow's milk (CM) (patient A) or hen's egg (HE) (patients B and C), confirmed by double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC). SOTI treatment was performed at home on a daily basis until tolerance to a maximum of 250 ml CM or 4.5 g lyophilized HE protein was achieved. The daily maintenance dose was 100 ml CM or 2.5 g HE protein.
RESULTS: Patients A, B and C reached tolerance to the maximum dose after 37, 41 and 52 weeks, respectively. According to the protocol, patients A and B performed a strict secondary elimination diet for 2 months prior to a follow-up DBPCFC after a maintenance phase of 27 and 39 weeks, respectively. Patient C discontinued treatment for 2 days after 4 weeks on the maintenance dose. Despite previous tolerance, on re-exposure to the allergen all patients experienced moderate systemic allergic reactions.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that SOTI can induce transient tolerance in food allergy, but does not necessarily lead to its permanent abrogation. Regular allergen intake seems necessary to maintain the established tolerance."
16135472,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16135472/,"PURPOSE: Leptin, an adipocyte-derived cytokine that is elevated in obesity, has been associated with carcinogenesis, tumor migration and invasion, enhancement of angiogenesis, and increased aromatase activity. It has been suggested that leptin may mediate adverse prognostic effects of obesity in breast cancer.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four hundred seventy-one women with surgically resected T1-3, N0-1, M0 breast cancer were studied. Leptin was assayed in stored fasting blood specimens obtained before adjuvant therapy. Women were followed prospectively for distant disease-free survival (DDFS) and overall survival (OS).
RESULTS: Patients ranged from 26 to 74 years of age, and staging was as follows: T1 = 262, T2 = 151, T3 = 23, TX = 35, N0 = 323, and N1 = 148. Estrogen receptor was positive in 286 patients, and progesterone receptor was positive in 259 patients. One hundred forty-five patients received adjuvant chemotherapy, 146 received adjuvant tamoxifen, 46 received both, and 134 received neither. Mean leptin was 15.2 +/- 10.1 ng/mL. Univariately, leptin was associated with OS (overall P = .049; P = .014 postmenopausal). Leptin was not associated with DDFS overall or in any menopausal subgroup (P > or = .19). In multivariate Cox modeling, leptin was not significantly associated with DDFS or OS (P = .11 and 0.075, respectively). Adjustment for insulin or body mass index further reduced the association of leptin with outcome.
CONCLUSION: Although leptin is strongly correlated with obesity and insulin, we could not show that it is independently associated with prognosis in early-stage breast cancer. Because we cannot rule out modest prognostic effects, we recommend additional research to explore this potential association, particularly in postmenopausal women."
16135480,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16135480/,"PURPOSE: The long duration of phase III clinical trials of overall survival (OS) slows down the treatment-development process. It could be shortened by using surrogate end points. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is the most studied biomarker in prostate cancer (PCa). This study attempts to validate PSA end points as surrogates for OS in advanced PCa.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Individual data from 2,161 advanced PCa patients treated in studies comparing bicalutamide to castration were used in a meta-analytic approach to surrogate end-point validation. PSA response, PSA normalization, time to PSA progression, and longitudinal PSA measurements were considered.
RESULTS: The known association between PSA and OS at the individual patient level was confirmed. The association between the effect of intervention on any PSA end point and on OS was generally low (determination coefficient, < 0.69).
CONCLUSION: It is a common misconception that high correlation between biomarkers and true end point justify the use of the former as surrogates. To statistically validate surrogate end points, a high correlation between the treatment effects on the surrogate and true end point needs to be established across groups of patients treated with two alternative interventions. The levels of association observed in this study indicate that the effect of hormonal treatment on OS cannot be predicted with a high degree of precision from observed treatment effects on PSA end points, and thus statistical validity is unproven. In practice, non-null treatment effects on OS can be predicted only from precisely estimated large effects on time to PSA progression (TTPP; hazard ratio, < 0.50)."
16135587,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16135587/,"OBJECTIVE: To examine how demographic and pregnancy characteristics can affect the risk of recurrent preterm delivery and the how the effectiveness of progesterone treatment for prevention alters these relationships.
METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of a randomized trial of 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate to prevent recurrent preterm delivery in women at risk. Associations of risk factors for preterm delivery (less than 37 completed weeks of gestation) were examined separately for the women in the 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (n = 310) and placebo (n = 153) groups.
RESULTS: Univariate analysis found that the number of previous preterm deliveries and whether the penultimate delivery was preterm were significant risk factors for preterm delivery in both the placebo and progesterone groups. High body mass index was protective of preterm birth in the placebo group. Multivariate analysis found progesterone treatment to cancel the risk of more than 1 previous preterm delivery, but not the risk associated with the penultimate pregnancy delivered preterm. Obesity was associated with lower risk for preterm delivery in the placebo group but not in the women treated with progesterone.
CONCLUSION: The use of 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate in women with a previous preterm delivery reduces the overall risk of preterm delivery and changes the epidemiology of risk factors for recurrent preterm delivery. In particular, these data suggest that 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate reduces the risk of a history of more than 1 preterm delivery.

16136343,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16136343/,"INTRODUCTION: External fixation has been extensively used to treat the intra-articular fractures of the distal radius and it has several distinct advantages over conventional POP cast and plate fixation. However, the limitation of external fixation to achieve articular congruity in the comminuted intra-articular fractures of the distal radius has been documented in the literature. This could be because external fixation alone does not expand crushed cancellous bone and cannot work without soft tissue hinges. This prospective study was conducted to look at the results of comminuted, displaced intra-articular fractures of the distal radius treated exclusively by external fixation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 2-year follow-up of 27 patients with comminuted, displaced intra-articular fractures of distal radius that were treated exclusively by external fixation is presented. The radiological results, functional results and complications were analyzed according to the scoring system given by Jakim et al.
RESULTS: Anatomical reduction could not be achieved in 12 patients (44%) and reduction was lost in two patients (7%). Excellent and good results were seen in 59.3%, fair results were seen in 22.2% and poor results were seen in 18.5% of the cases. Outcome scores of patients without articular step were significantly better as compared to the patients with articular step at healing. There was a positive correlation between the restoration of normal anatomy (radiological results) and the functional outcome (r=0.775). Overall nine patients (33%) had complications.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that although the external fixation is reliable in maintaining the reduction in displaced comminuted intra-articular fractures, it is inadequate in restoring articular congruity in many cases. The complications of external fixation are frequent and may be potentially serious in nature."

16137401,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16137401/,"INTRODUCTION: The influence of age on the aggressiveness of prostate cancer (PCa) is controversial. This study aims to assess the influence of age in determining the pathological features of biopsies from patients diagnosed with PCa.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We selected 1422 patients with clinical suspicion of PCa; among them, 547 (38.5%) had received a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma. Patients were categorized into the following age groups: up to 50 years old, 51 to 60 years, 61 to 70 years, 71 to 80 years, and over 80 years. The evaluated variables were histological grade, presence of perineural invasion and estimate of tumor volume through measurement of the maximum percentage of tissue with cancer in one fragment and total percentage of tissue with cancer in the sample.
RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 66.4 years, with age range from 32 to 94 years. The estimate of tumor volume by maximum percentage of tissue with cancer in one fragment (p = 0.064), total percentage of tissue with cancer in the sample (p = 0.443), and Gleason score (p = 0.485) were not statistically different in relation to the age groups under study. The presence of perineural invasion occurred more frequently among the 50 years and 81 years age groups when compared with patients aged from 51 to 60 and from 61 to 80 years (p = 0.005).
CONCLUSIONS: Age did not represent a determining factor for pathological findings concerning Gleason score and estimate of tumor volume by the variables in use."
16137512,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16137512/,"BACKGROUND: Gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) may cause chest pain. The aim was to determine the correlation between ischemia and gastro-esophageal reflux in patients with CAD and to assess the influence of short-term ""anti-reflux"" therapy on the ischemia in patients with GERD and CAD.
METHODS: Fifty patients with angiographically proven CAD underwent simultaneous 24-h continuous ECG and esophageal pH monitoring. We assessed the number of ST-segment depression episodes (ST dep.) and total duration of ischemic episodes, expressed as total ischemic burden (TIB). In pH-metry, we assessed: time percentage of pH lower than 4, total time of pH lower than 4 and the number of pathological refluxes (PR). Patients fulfilling the GERD criteria received a 7-day therapy with omeprazole 20 mg bid. On the 7th day of therapy, simultaneous Holter and esophageal pH monitoring was repeated.
RESULTS: Total number of 224 PRs in 42 patients (84%) was recorded during esophageal pH-metry. GERD criteria were fulfilled in 23 patients (46%). Out of 218 episodes of ST dep., 45 (20.6%) correlated with PR. GERD patients had larger TIB and higher number of ST dep. (p<0.015 and p<0.035, respectively). The anti-reflux therapy reduced all analyzed parameters of esophageal pH monitoring (p<0.0022) as well as the number of ST dep. (p<0.012) and TIB (p<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Gastro-esophageal reflux disease is common in patients with CAD and may provoke myocardial ischemia. Short-term proton pump inhibitors therapy that restores normal esophageal pH significantly reduces myocardial ischemia, possibly due to elimination of acid-derived esophago-cardiac reflex compromising coronary perfusion-the phenomenon known as ""linked angina""."
16137798,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16137798/,"INTRODUCTION: Sometimes, in front of a clinical setting of thrombophilia, the biological findings are helpless. Therefore we suggest to test a protein Z deficiency.
EXEGESIS: Protein Z is a vitamin-K dependent protein forming a complex with the Z protein-dependent protease inhibitor for inhibiting the activated factor X; so protein Z acts as a ""natural low molecular weight heparin"". The prothrombotic phenotype associated with protein Z deficiency includes early fetal losses (before the 20th week of gestation), early and relapsing venous thrombosis in patients with factor V Leiden mutation and somehow ischaemic stroke in young people.
CONCLUSION: The protein Z deficiency seems to be associated with a particular prothrombotic phenotype including early fetal losses as well as early and relapsing venous thromboses in patients carrying the factor V Leiden mutation. It is unclear whether or not it plays a role as a thrombophilic factor especially in the arterial vascular field."
16137997,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16137997/,"AIM OF THE STUDY: In two institutions, a retrospective analysis was performed on patients with histologically proven locally advanced pancreatic cancer without distant metastases. The aim of this analysis is to assess whether chemoradiotherapy provides survival benefit for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer.
METHODS: Forty-five patients from the Erasmus Medical Centre (Erasmus MC), Rotterdam, received 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and radiotherapy and, 38 patients from the Academic Medical Centre Amsterdam (AMC) were offered the best supportive care. Radiotherapy consisted of 50 Gy external upper abdomen radiation in two courses, concomitant with intravenous 5-FU 25 mg/kg/ 24 h continuously on the first 4 days of each treatment course.
RESULTS: The treatment protocol was completed in 38 of 45 patients (84%) without complications. Radiological response was evaluated in 38 patients. Ten patients (26%) showed a partial response, stable disease was seen in 6 (16%) patients and progressive disease in 22 (58%) patients. A second-look operation was performed in 8 of 10 patients (72%) showing a radiological response, in 3 patients the tumour could be resected. Median overall survival time for the Erasmus MC group (n = 45) was 9.8 months compared to 7.6 months when the best supportive care was given (AMC group, p = 0.04).
CONCLUSION: Although overall survival remains poor, treatment with 5-FU and radiotherapy might benefit some patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer."
16139156,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16139156/,"PURPOSE: Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is commonly used in the care of critically ill patients although the optimal means of anticoagulation is not well defined. We report our regional CRRT protocol that was developed using the principles of quality improvement and compare the effect of regional citrate with systemic heparin anticoagulation on filter life span.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective observational cohort study in a Canadian adult regional critical care system. A standardized protocol for CRRT has been implemented at all adult intensive care units in the Calgary Health Region since August 1999. All patients with acute renal failure treated with CRRT during October 1, 2002, to September 30, 2003, were identified and followed up prospectively until hospital discharge or death.
RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients with acute renal failure requiring CRRT were identified, 54 were initially treated with citrate, 29 with heparin, and 4 with saline flushes. Citrate and heparin were used in 212 (66%) and 97 (30%) of filters for 8776 and 2651 hours of CRRT, respectively. Overall median (interquartile range) filter life span with citrate was significantly greater than heparin (40 [14-72] vs 20 [5-44] hours, P < .001). The median time to spontaneous filter failure was significantly greater with citrate compared with heparin (>72 vs 33 hours, P < .001). Citrate anticoagulation resulted in greater completion of scheduled filter life span (59% vs 10%, P > .001). Citrate anticoagulation was well tolerated with no patient requiring elective discontinuation for hypernatremia, metabolic alkalosis, or hypocalcemia.
CONCLUSIONS: Regional citrate anticoagulation was associated with prolonged filter survival and increased completion of scheduled filter life span compared with heparin. These data support small studies suggesting that citrate is a superior anticoagulant for CRRT and suggest the need for a future definitive randomized controlled trial."
16139348,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16139348/,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate treatment outcomes in women with early-stage endometrial cancer (FIGO IA, IB, IC, or IIA) surgically managed by a general gynecologist (GYN) or a gynecologic oncologist (GYO).
METHODS AND RESULTS: 349 women treated from 1990-2003 were studied. Median follow-up was 3.7 years. Ninety-five were classified as high-intermediate risk (HIR: stages IB grade III, IC grade II or III, any stage IIA). 110 women received adjuvant radiotherapy. The GYO group had more unfavorable tumor characteristics based on stage and grade (P<0.0001), shorter follow-up (median 3.1 vs. 5.1 years, P=0.0002), and an absolute 12% less likelihood of receiving adjuvant radiotherapy (P=0.04). Local and distant failures were not significantly different. Overall survival favored GYN patients (P=0.02) with no difference in disease-specific survival (P=0.38). Multivariate analysis for disease-free survival revealed HIR disease (P=0.04) and GYO treatment (P=0.049) to be significant, with a trend for age<or=64 (P=0.05). Multivariate analysis for overall survival found age<or=64 (P=0.0001), HIR disease (P=0.01), and adjuvant radiotherapy (P=0.0055) to be significant.
CONCLUSIONS: Women primarily managed by a GYO for early-stage disease were significantly less likely to receive adjuvant radiotherapy. Despite significantly more unfavorable disease characteristics among GYO-managed women, disease-free and cause-specific survival were equivalent between the two groups. Favorable disease characteristics and adjuvant radiotherapy correlated with improved survival on multivariate analysis."
16139697,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16139697/,"OBJECTIVES: To compare the quality of conventional complete dentures fabricated with two different techniques. A randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted to compare traditional (T) and simplified (S) methods of making complete conventional dentures on patients' ratings of satisfaction, comfort and function at 3 and 6 months following delivery. The quality of the prostheses was rated by prosthodontists at 6 months.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred twenty-two male and female edentulous individuals, aged 45-75 years, were randomly allocated into groups that received dentures made with either T or S methods. Following delivery, patients' ratings of several denture-related factors were measured using 100mm visual analogue scales, and denture quality was assessed by blinded prosthodontists using ratings on a validated quantitative scale.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the two groups in patient ratings for overall satisfaction (3 months: mean T = 83 mm, mean S = 83 mm, P = 0.97; 6 months: mean T = 79 mm, mean S = 79 mm, P = 0.96) or in prosthodontists' ratings of denture quality (T = 66, S = 63; P = 0.38).
CONCLUSION: These results show that the quality of complete dentures does not suffer when manufacturing techniques are simplified to save time and materials. Dental educators should consider these findings when re-designing prosthodontic training programs."
16140084,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16140084/,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the high prevalence of lower urinary tract symptoms in Korean men with a small prostate, we studied the proportions of histologic components of prostatic adenoma in patients with symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia.
METHODS: Prostatic adenoma specimens were obtained from men with symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia who underwent open prostatectomy or transurethral resection of the prostate. Patients were divided into three groups according to the prostate volume as measured by preoperative transrectal ultrasonography (group 1, 20 to 40 cm3, 21 men; group 2, 41 to 80 cm3, 22 men; and group 3, greater than 80 cm3, 23 men). The age distribution and the severity of symptoms were comparable in these three groups (P > 0.05). The proportion of the stroma in the prostatic adenoma and the proportions of smooth muscle, collagen types I, II, III, and V, fibronectin, and laminin in stromal tissue were determined using automatic image analyzer quantitatively.
RESULTS: The proportions of the stroma in the prostatic adenoma specimens of groups 1 and 2 were significantly greater than in group 3 (P < 0.05). The proportions of smooth muscle, collagen types I, III, and V, fibronectin, and laminin were not significantly different in the three groups (P > 0.05). The relative smooth muscle proportion in the prostatic adenoma (proportion of stroma x proportion of smooth muscle in stromal tissue) in groups 1 and 2 was significantly greater than in group 3 (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the dynamic component of bladder outlet obstruction, which is mediated by smooth muscle tone, may play a more important role in the development of symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia in Korean men."
16140225,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16140225/,"BACKGROUND: Achieving good asthma control has become the major goal of asthma treatment. Studies have reported a high rate of psychiatric disorders among asthma patients, though the impact of these disorders on asthma control and quality of life remains unexplored. This study evaluated the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in 406 adult asthma patients, and associations between psychiatric status, levels of asthma control, and asthma-related quality of life.
METHODS: Consecutive asthma patients presenting to the asthma clinic underwent a brief, structured psychiatric interview, completed the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) and Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ), and reported the frequency of bronchodilator use in the past week. All patients underwent standard pulmonary function testing.
RESULTS: A total of 34% (n=136) of patients had one or more psychiatric diagnosis, including major depression (15%), minor depression (5%), dysthymia (4%), panic disorder (12%), generalized anxiety disorder (5%), and social phobia (4%). Though there were no differences in pulmonary function, patients with versus without psychiatric disorders had worse ACQ and AQLQ scores and reported greater bronchodilator use, independent age, sex and asthma severity.
CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that psychiatric disorders are prevalent among asthmatics and are associated with worse asthma control and quality of life. Physicians should be aware of the potential risk of poorer asthma control and functional impairment in this population."

METHODS: Forty-three patients with non-small cell lung cancer and 28 control subjects have been included to this study. H. pylori status of the patients and controls was determined by immunoblot for the detection of IgG (RIDA Blot Helicobacter). All subjects were examined to evaluate the presence of VacA and CagA gene.
RESULTS: Seropositivity of anti H. pylori IgG was significantly higher in cancer patients than in control groups, 40 (93%) and 12 (42%), respectively (P<0.01). Although both VacA and CagA seropositivity was high in lung cancer patients, only VacA positivity was statistically significant when compared with control subjects, 35 (81%) and 11 (42%), respectively (P<0.05).
CONCLUSION: H. pylori infection may be associated with development of lung cancer."
16140397,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16140397/,"BACKGROUND: Based on two clinical trials in healthy infants the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) advices immunization with a 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in children with recurrent acute otitis media (AOM).
OBJECTIVE: To study the efficacy of a 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine on acute otitis media recurrences, its immunogenicity and impact on nasopharyngeal Streptococcus pneumoniae carriage in children with a history of frequent acute otitis media.
METHODS: In this double-blind, randomized study, 74 Belgian children, aged 1-7 years, with at least 2 clinically diagnosed episodes of acute otitis media in the previous year were enrolled. Children were immunized with either a 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine followed by a 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide booster or a control hepatitis A vaccine. Total follow-up was 26 months.
RESULTS: Despite adequate serum IgG responses to all conjugate vaccine pneumococcal serotypes, no reduction of acute otitis media episodes was observed in the pneumococcal vaccine group as compared to the control group (rate ratio: 1.16; 95% CI: 0.69-1.96). Overall nasopharyngeal pneumococcal carriage remained stable. However, a transient shift from conjugate vaccine related S. pneumoniae serogroups to non-vaccine related serogroups was noted following conjugate vaccination.
CONCLUSION: Clinically no protective effect of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination on acute otitis media recurrences was found in children with a history of frequent AOM."

STUDY DESIGN: In the second to fourth day of the period, they underwent a transvaginal three-dimensional scanning with power Doppler to determine total AFC, total ovarian volume, total ovarian vascularization index (VI), flow index (FI) and vascularization flow index (VFI). Hormonal profile was also measured.
RESULTS: A total of 71 Chinese women were recruited in the study: 39 women with PCO only and 32 women with PCOS. Women with PCO only had significantly lower AFC, ovarian volume, ovarian VI, serum LH, testosterone and DHEAS concentrations but higher serum SHBG concentration when compared with PCOS women. When women with PCO only and PCOS were considered together, the rate of decline of AFC over age was 0.905 follicle per year (95% CI=0.008-1.803, p=0.048) and there was no significant decline of ovarian volume and total ovarian VI, FI and VFI over age.
CONCLUSION: PCO only represents a milder end of the PCOS spectrum."
16140510,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16140510/,"PURPOSE: We assessed the quality of European treatment guidelines in the field of mental health that have been produced by national psychiatric associations. The main focus was the question of whether the development process of the guidelines followed basic principles of evidence-based medicine.
METHODS: Sixty-one European clinical practice guidelines from 14 countries, published between 1998 and 2003, were assessed using the 'Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) Instrument'. The domain score was calculated for each of the six domains of the AGREE instrument. The seven items of the domain ""rigor of development"" and one additional item concerning national particularities were assessed in detail.
RESULTS: The mean scores in the six domains were rather low, although the quality varied among the different guidelines. The highest mean score was obtained in the domain clarity and presentation (70.8% S.D. 23.5), the lowest on editorial independence (19.7% S.D. 29.3). The recommendations of about half of the assessed guidelines could be considered to be evidence-based.
CONCLUSION: The assessed guidelines showed a broad range of quality: some producers attached importance to an evidence-based development process; but in spite of this, a large number of guidelines were only of middling quality. As national particularities are only rarely mentioned and the development process of guidelines is complex, an international collaboration that aims toward the production of shareable guidelines might be promising."
16140645,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16140645/,"OBJECTIVE: Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is a key enzyme in angiotensin II production which causes myocardial hypertrophy and hyperplasia. In this study we aimed to investigate the relation between ACE I/D gene polymorphism and left ventricular mass (LVM), dimensions and systolic functions calculated by mitral annular motion (MAM) in young healthy male subjects.
METHODS: Complete echocardiographic examination was performed in 49 male healthy subjects (mean age 22.9+/-2.1 years) consisting of 18 ACE DD, 18 ACE DI and 13 ACE II genotypes. We calculated LVM and mass index (LVMI) by M-Mode echocardiography. The systolic MAM was recorded at 4 sites (septal, lateral, anterior, and posterior) by M-mode echocardiography and the MAM-ejection fraction (EF) was calculated from above four sites. Ejection fraction was also calculated by Simpson's method.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference among the three genotypes according to age, body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate. Interventricular septum (IVS) and left ventricular posterior wall (LVPW) diastolic thickness, LVM and LVMI were found significantly different among 3 ACE genotypes. Those measurements were higher in DD genotype in comparison to the DI and II genotypes. There was no significant difference among the three genotypes according to EF-MAM and EF by Simpson's method.
CONCLUSION: In young healthy male subjects having ACE DD genotype, even though LVM and LVMI were within normal limits, their measurements were found to be higher than in subjects with ACE DI and II genotypes respectively. There was no difference among the three genotypes according to left ventricular systolic functions."

STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study was conducted at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh over a 5-year period, to identify otherwise healthy term and near-term (> or =35 weeks of gestation) breastfed neonates (<29 days of age) who were admitted with serum sodium concentrations of > or =150 mEq/L and no explanation for hypernatremia other than inadequate milk intake.
RESULTS: The incidence of breastfeeding-associated hypernatremic dehydration among 3718 consecutive term and near-term hospitalized neonates was 1.9%, occurring for 70 infants. These infants were born primarily to primiparous women (87%) who were discharged within 48 hours after birth (90%). The most common presenting symptom was jaundice (81%). Sixty-three percent of infants underwent sepsis evaluations with lumbar puncture. No infants had bacteremia or meningitis. Infants had hypernatremia of moderate severity (median: 153 mEq/L; range: 150-177 mEq/L), with a mean weight loss of 13.7%. Nonmetabolic complications occurred for 17% of infants, with the most common being apnea and/or bradycardia. There were no deaths.
CONCLUSION: Hypernatremic dehydration requiring hospitalization is common among breastfed neonates. Increased efforts are required to establish successful breastfeeding."
16140695,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16140695/,"OBJECTIVE: Language barriers may lead to medical errors by impeding patient-provider communication. The objective of this study was to determine whether hospitalized pediatric patients whose families have language barriers are more likely to incur serious medical errors than patients whose families do not have language barriers.
METHODS: A case-control study was conducted in a large, academic, regional children's hospital in the Pacific Northwest. Case patients (n = 97) included all hospitalizations of patients who were younger than 21 years and had a reported serious medical event from January 1, 1998, to December 31, 2003. Control patients (n = 475) were chosen from hospitalizations without a reported serious medical event and were matched with case patients on age, admitting service, admission to intensive care, and date of admission. The main exposure was a language barrier defined by self- or provider-reported need for an interpreter. Serious medical events were defined as events that led to unintended or potentially adverse outcomes identified by the hospital's quality improvement staff.
RESULTS: Fourteen (14.4%) of the case patients and 53 (11.2%) of the control patients were assigned an interpreter during their hospitalization. Overall, we found no increased risk for serious medical events in patients and families who requested an interpreter compared with patients and families who did not request an interpreter (odds ratio: 1.36; 95% confidence interval: 0.73-2.55). Spanish-speaking patients who requested an interpreter comprised 11 (11.3%) of the case patients and 26 (5.5%) of the control patients. This subgroup had a twofold increased risk for serious medical events compared with patients who did not request an interpreter (odds ratio: 2.26; 95% confidence interval: 1.06-4.81).
CONCLUSIONS: Spanish-speaking patients whose families have a language barrier seem to have a significantly increased risk for serious medical events during pediatric hospitalization compared with patients whose families do not have a language barrier."

METHODS: A prospective follow-up study was conducted at age 19 in individuals who born preterm in the Netherlands in 1983. Systolic, diastolic, and mean BP values and plasma renin activity concentration were obtained in 422 young adults who were born with a gestational age (GA) <32 weeks. BP values were also measured in 174 individuals who born with a GA of > or =32 weeks and a birth weight of <1500 g.
RESULTS: An increased prevalence of hypertension and probably also of prehypertensive stage was found. IUGR, birth weight, GA, and plasma renin activity were not associated with BP. Current weight and BMI were the best predicting factors for systolic BP at the age of 19 years.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of hypertension is high in individuals who were born preterm when compared with the general population. In the individuals who were born very preterm, no support to the hypothesis that low birth weight is associated with increased BP at young adult age can be given."

16141459,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16141459/,"BACKGROUND: Renal function affects thyroid function and adipocytokines in many ways. We aimed to assess the adipocytokines adiponectin and leptin in relation to thyroid function in patients with chronic renal failure treated conservatively, in haemodialysed patients and in kidney allograft recipients.
METHODS: The study was performed on 33 patients with chronic renal failure, 64 haemodialysed patients, 54 kidney allograft recipients and 38 healthy volunteers. Thyroid volume was estimated sonographically, thyroid hormones were determined by Micropartide Enzyme Immunoassay (MEIA), and serum adiponectin and leptin were assessed by radioimmunoassay.
RESULTS: Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free T4 and free T3 were within the normal range. Adiponectin correlated significantly with free T3, haematocrit, haemoglobin, platelet count, body mass index (BMI) and urea in kidney allograft recipients. In haemodialysed patients, adiponectin correlated with free T4 and TSH, whereas leptin correlated with free T3. Multiple regression analysis showed that adiponectin was independently related only to the serum concentration of free T3 and urea in kidney transplant recipients and to free T4 and adequacy of dialysis in haemodialysed patients. In univariate analysis in patients with chronic renal failure, adiponectin correlated with free T3 and platelet count, and in healthy volunteers adiponectin correlated only with free T3 and triglycerides, and leptin correlated with BMI.
CONCLUSIONS: We described novel relationships between adiponectin and thyroid hormones in patients with kidney diseases. However, possible pre-existing thyroid dysfunction prior to transplantation (during dialysis therapy) and immunosuppression after transplantation make all these findings relatively complex. Therefore, the relationships between adiponectin and the thyroid axis in patients with chronic renal failure, in haemodialysed subjects or in kidney transplant recipients merit additional studies."
16141505,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16141505/,"BACKGROUND: Tumor regression parameters and time factor during external radiotherapy (EXTRT) are of paramount importance.
AIMS: To quantify the parameters of tumor regression and time factor during EXTRT in cancer cervix.
SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Patients, treated solely with radiotherapy and enrolled for other prospective studies having weekly tumor regressions recorded were considered.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-seven patients received 50 Gy of EXTRT followed by intracavitary brachytherapy. Loco-regional regressions were assessed clinically and regression fraction (RF) was represented as RF=c + a 1D + a 2 D2 sub - a 3T, with c, D and T as constant, cumulative EXTRT dose and treatment time respectively.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Step wise linear regression was performed for RF. Scatter plots were fitted using linear-quadratic fit.
RESULTS: Coefficients of parameters D, D2 sub and T were computed for various dose intervals, namely 0--20 Gy, 0--30 Gy, 0--40 Gy and 0--50 Gy. At 0--20 Gy and 0--30 Gy, only the coefficient of D2 was significant (P 2 sub and T turned significant (P 2 sub and T showed significance, leading to an estimate of 26 Gy for a1/a2 and 0.96 Gy/day for a3/a1.
CONCLUSIONS: As with alpha/beta and gamma/alpha of post-irradiation cell survival curves, a1/a2 and a3/a1 represents the cumulative effect of various radiobiological factors influencing clinical regression of tumor during the course of EXTRT. The dynamic changes in the coefficients of D, D2 sub and T, indicate their relative importance during various phases of EXTRT."
16141717,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16141717/,"BACKGROUND: Providing stroke unit treatment for all stroke patients is a cross-national goal as stated in the WHO Helsingborg Declaration. In order to achieve specialized stroke care for a large area, two stroke centers and 12 community hospitals established an integrative stroke network. This evaluation was performed to analyze achieved advances in stroke management.
METHODS: Core network elements are: (1) establishing stroke wards in all hospitals; (2) continuous training in stroke treatment; (3) telemedicine service staffed by a 24 h/day 'strokologist' with capability for high-speed videoconferencing and transfer of CT/MRI images. Data were prospectively documented in the databank of the telestroke service, in the Bavarian Stroke Registry and in the controlling departments.
RESULTS: In 2003, 4,179 stroke patients were admitted to the regional network hospitals. Between February 2003 and January 2004 a total of 2,182 teleconsultations were conducted. 250 teleconsultations yielded a nonvascular diagnosis. Indicators for stroke management quality improved compared with other hospitals without stroke unit: the frequency of CT/MRI within 3 h was 59% compared to 46%, frequency of speech therapy 36% (21%), and of occupational therapy 38% (12%). Eighty-six (2.1%) of the patients received systemic thrombolysis compared to 10 patients in the preceding year. Mean length of in-hospital stay decreased from 12.4 in 2002 to 9.7 days in 2003.
CONCLUSIONS: This stroke network concept leads to a substantial improvement of stroke management. Telemedicine contributes to an early etiological assessment and fills the gap of specialized stroke expertise in neurologically underserved areas."

RESULTS: Current or lifetime comorbidity of anxiety and depressive disorders did not differ between AN-Rs and AN-BNs, nor between BN-Ps and BN-NPs. Only current diagnoses of agoraphobia and obsessive-compulsive disorder were significantly more frequent in anorexics than in bulimics.
CONCLUSION: The greater frequency of comorbidity between obsessive-compulsive disorder and AN compared to BN, already well documented, is not questioned. The remaining anxiety disorders are equally frequent among all the diagnostic types of ED."
16142138,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16142138/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the reliability of pretherapeutic laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy in cervical cancer as a function of lymph node recurrences according to initial lymph node status: 1) to establish the false negative rate by analyzing lymph node recurrence in patients N-, 2) to verify treatment adequacy in patients N+ by comparing the rate of node recurrence to initial node positivity.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of a prospectively registered patient database. One hundred and ninety patients treated by a combination of radiotherapy and surgery for cervical cancer stages 1b to 2b in 95% of cases had undergone, from March 1992 to June 2003, a previous laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy. Median follow-up was 40 months (range: 3-126 months).
RESULTS: Initial lymph node positivity (N+) was found in 79 patients (42%). Fourteen patients (7.4%) presented with lymph node recurrence, all of whom have died from disease. Lymph node recurrence was found in 4/111 patients N- (3.6%) and in 10/79 patients N+ (12.7%), of whom 8/10 occurred outside the radiation fields.
CONCLUSION: With a very low false negative rate, accuracy of the laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy in the determination of lymphatic spread in cervical cancer is confirmed. It can still be considered the gold standard despite recent developments (e.g. sentinel lymph node determination) to which they should be compared. Treatment adequacy in patients N+ is confirmed."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated history, physical and special neurourological examination and urodynamic studies in 213 patients with non-neurogenic bladder dysfunction.
RESULTS: 22 patients out of 213 patients with chronic bladder dysfunction reported reproducible associated symptoms involving the temporo-mandibular joint, the distal forearm/hand or feet and headache. There was an obvious clinical connection regarding the severity of bladder dysfunction and associated symptoms and possible relief of both by successful treatment.
CONCLUSION: Symptomatic lower urinary tract dysfunction may accompanied by specific muscular and or sensory disturbances in different areas of the body. These associated pathologies in patients without neurological disease can be explained by functional changes in a complex autonomic peripheral and central nervous network."
16142554,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16142554/,"OBJECTIVE: Based on clinical description of associated dysfunctional symptoms in patients with non-neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction an experimental setup was created in order to investigate the neuroanatomical basis for the clinical phenomena observed.
METHODS: Using 24 male adult Sprague-Dawley rats for retrograde mapping of the spinal cord and brain, a pseudorabies virus (PRV) tracer was subsequently injected into four pertinent locations; (a) the trigone, (b) the masseter muscle (c) the forepaw and (d) the hindpaw.
RESULTS: PRV tracing demonstrated clearly overlapping of labeled areas in the brain stem, diencephalon and thoracic-lumbar cord, from all injection sites of the rats.
CONCLUSION: There is a diffuse overlap within the brain stem and spinal cord, of autonomic innervation to peripheral tissues based on the presented animal experiments. The described autonomic network allows an understanding of the occurrence of symptoms in distant regions of the body associated to chronic bladder dysfunction."
16142762,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16142762/,"OBJECTIVE: Based on comparisons of short-term cohort studies or cross-sectional samples of patients from different calendar times, it has been suggested that present patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have a milder disease course compared with that of patients in past decades. This study was undertaken to investigate whether the course of disease activity and functional disability in patients with RA has become milder over the past several years.
METHODS: We used the Nijmegen inception cohort of early RA, which included all patients with newly diagnosed RA who had attended the department of rheumatology at Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre since 1985. Patients were assessed for disease activity by the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28) every 3 months and for functional disability by the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) disability index (DI) every 6 months. Within the total cohort, 4 subcohorts were defined, based on the date of inclusion of the patients (1985-1990, 1990-1995, 1995-2000, 2000-2005). To investigate whether the course of disease activity and functional disability (over time) was different between the subcohorts, longitudinal regression analysis (linear mixed models) was used, with the DAS28 and HAQ DI over time as outcome variables, respectively, and subcohort as the independent variable, correcting for baseline demographic and clinical characteristics. The treatment strategy was compared between the subcohorts.
RESULTS: The DAS28 at baseline and over the first 5 years of disease was lower in the more recent subcohorts. The HAQ DI did not show improvement but instead a trend toward worsening functional disability. Using longitudinal regression it was shown that disease activity improved early in the disease course and stabilized thereafter, and that this improvement was greater in patients in the more recent subcohorts and in patients with a higher baseline DAS28. Initially, the HAQ DI also improved but stabilized thereafter, and this initial improvement was less pronounced in patients in the more recent subcohorts and was greater for patients with a higher baseline HAQ DI. The treatment strategy was more aggressive in the more recent subcohorts, as shown by a shorter duration from diagnosis to the start of treatment with prednisone or disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), and a greater prevalence of DMARD therapy.
CONCLUSION: The course of disease activity in RA patients has become milder in more recent years. The reason for this improving trend remains to be elucidated, although the trend coincides with a more aggressive treatment strategy."
16143040,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16143040/,"BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to investigate whether p503S, p504S and p510S gene expression in peripheral-blood be useful as a diagnostic or prognostic marker of prostatic cancer.
METHODS: Circulating cells were identified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect p503S, p504S and p510S mRNA in peripheral blood (PB) from 11 patients with treated prostatic carcinoma (CaP), 11 with newly-diagnosed untreated CaP and 20 with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) (controls).
RESULTS: RT-PCR amplified P503S in 7 of 11 untreated and 2 of 11 treated patients with CaP and 5 of 20 with BPH; p504S in 7 of 11 untreated and in 9 of 11 treated patients with CaP and 11 of 20 with BPH; whereas it amplified p510S in all subjects with CaP and in 15 of 20 with BPH.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the investigated genes are poorly specific and probably of little use as diagnostic or prognostic prostatic markers in peripheral blood for monitoring disease progression and recurrence."
16143184,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16143184/,"OBJECTIVES: Tracheal resection is a well-established option for the management of airway stenosis. Releasing maneuvers have been described to reduce anastomotic tension. The aim of this study is to report on a series of tracheal resections performed without the use of these maneuvers.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review.
SETTING: Tertiary hospital.
METHODS: All patients undergoing tracheal resection by the first author over a 6-year period were reviewed.
RESULTS: Patients (n = 17; 7 men and 10 women, ages 23-76) were managed with tracheal resection and anastomosis without stenting or postoperative tracheotomy. 16/17 (94%) patients had successful treatment of their stenosis. 1/17 (6%) failed and 1/17 (6%) required dilation. There was no postoperative swallowing dysfunction.
CONCLUSIONS: Segmental tracheal resection without releasing maneuvers was successful in 16/17 (94%) patients.
SIGNIFICANCE: Though extrapolation from this series may be limited, future practitioners may consider forgoing additional releasing maneuvers for tracheal resection in many cases."
16143238,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16143238/,"BACKGROUND: Over 50,000 heart transplants have been performed in the last 3 decades. The global shortage of donor organs and the relaxation of candidate selection criteria over time has resulted in recent controversy about the benefits of heart transplantation for some risk groups. We assessed the survival benefit acquired in the Papworth Hospital heart transplant population overall, taking into account resuscitated marginal donors and high-risk recipients.
METHODS: All heart transplant patients listed between 1979 and June 2002 were analyzed (n = 1,212). Of these, 931 cardiac transplantations were done, including the use of 126 marginal donors. High-risk recipients (n = 163) were defined as patients being in the hospital, on intravenous inotropic drugs, and/or with a high transpulmonary gradient (>15 mm Hg). Using Cox regression with transplantation as a time-dependent covariate, we assessed the survival benefit of transplantation. In our model we assumed that after transplantation the initial risk of death is high relative to continued waiting, followed by an exponential decline in risk. The crossover point (COP) is the time at which the risk of death after transplantation is equal to that of continued waiting (i.e., the relative risk is 1). The equity point (EP) determines the time at which the early post-operative risk is offset by the later period of lower risk and, therefore, the time at which transplantation has a survival advantage.
RESULTS: Overall, the COP was at 54 days and EP at 141 days. In the marginal donor sub-group, COP was achieved at 32 days with EP at 72 days, indicating a survival benefit. The difference in the COP and EP between the borderline donor and normal donor sub-groups was not statistically significant. Post-transplant survival was not significantly different from recipients of normal cardiac allografts (p = .43). Likewise, for the high-risk recipient group, the COP and EP were at 72 and 203 days. Although post-op survival was significantly shorter than the normal-risk group, both groups achieved survival benefits.
CONCLUSION: Heart transplantation provides survival benefit in these risk groups of recipients in our population. This is a reflection of our active donor management protocol and rigorous donor and recipient selection process."
7650466,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7650466/,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether mammography raises anxiety in routinely screened women who receive a negative result.
DESIGN: Prospective design in which women completed questionnaires at three key points in the breast screening process: at baseline (before being sent their invitation for breast screening), at the screening clinic immediately before or after screening, and at follow up, about nine months after baseline. Information was obtained from non-attenders as well as from attenders.
SETTING: Bromley District Health Authority, served by the South East London Breast Screening Service.
PARTICIPANTS: Two overlapping samples were used. Sample A comprised 1500 women aged 50-64 who were due to be called for first round screening at a mobile screening unit. Altogether 1021 (68%) returned a usable questionnaire and 795 of these (78%) also provided adequate information at nine month follow up: there were 695 attenders (including 24 women who received false positive results) and 100 non-attenders. Sample B consisted of 868 women who attended the screening unit in a three month period, 732 (84%) of whom provided adequate data. A total of 306 attenders (including 10 who received false positive results) occurred in both samples and provided adequate information on all occasions. The main analyses were based on these 306 women plus the 100 non-attenders. The analysis of retrospective anxiety took advantage of the larger sample size of 695 attenders.
MAIN RESULTS: On average, the women were not unduly anxious at any of the three points in the screening process. Among attenders, there was no difference between anxiety levels immediately before and immediately after screening. Anxiety was lowest at the clinic and highest at baseline but the changes were very small in absolute terms. Anxiety did not predict attendance: there were no differences in anxiety levels between attenders and non-attenders at baseline. As expected, women who received false positive results recalled feeling extremely anxious after they had received the referral letter but their retrospective anxiety was also higher than in the negative screenees at earlier stages in the breast screening process. They also reported having experienced more pain and discomfort during the x ray.
CONCLUSIONS: Anxiety does not seem to be an important problem in routinely screened women who receive a negative result. This finding is very reassuring in relation to a major criticism of breast screening programmes. Thus, apart from maintaining current procedures such as keeping waiting times to a minimum, there seems to be no need to introduce special anxiety reducing interventions into the national programme. On the other hand, the findings for women who received false positive results suggest that there are aspects of the experience of being recalled for assessment after an abnormal mammogram that warrant further attention. The relationship between contemporaneous and retrospective anxiety should also be studied."
7650502,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7650502/,"BACKGROUND: As computer hardware becomes less expensive and computer software more sophisticated and easy to use, more physicians are using computers to take notes and keep records. Although computer use offers many benefits, there is concern about whether the use of computers in the examination room will interfere with the patient-physician relationship. This experiment surveyed patient satisfaction following examination by either of two physicians, one using pen-and-pencil note-taking, the other taking notes on a computer.
METHODS: Sixty patients consented to participate in this prospective, randomized, crossover study. In the first phase, 15 randomly selected patients were examined by Physician A, who made a written record, and 15 by Physician B, who made a computer record. In the second phase, the physicians switched roles. After the examination, patients completed a questionnaire to assess their degree of satisfaction.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in satisfaction between the group whose physician made a handwritten record as compared with those whose physician used a computer, nor was there an interaction between type of note-taking and physician. There was also no correlation between patient satisfaction and previous patient exposure to and use of computers.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated no decrease in patient satisfaction when a computerized patient record was introduced."

7651634,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7651634/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between a history of abdominal pain and laparoscopic findings in infertile women.
METHODS: From September 1993 through December 1994, consecutive infertile women were interviewed approximately 1 hour before diagnostic laparoscopy. A standardized questionnaire was used. The questions focused on medical history. Laparoscopic findings were recorded on a standardized form.
RESULTS: One hundred twelve women were prospectively studied. Thirty-six women (32.1%) had one or more of the following: adnexal adhesions, distal tubal occlusions, perihepatic adhesions. A history of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) was related to distal tubal occlusion (odds ratio [OR] 2.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.7-10.0), tubal adhesions (OR 1.9, 95% CI 0.7-5.1), ovarian adhesions (OR 2.3, 95% CI 0.9-6.5), and perihepatic adhesions (OR 6.8, 95% CI 1.1-43.9). However, only 11 of the 36 (30.6%) women with adhesions and/or distal tubal occlusion had a history of PID. By contrast, 29 of 36 (80.6%) of those with adhesions and/or distal tubal occlusion had a history of lower abdominal pain. This was true for 32 of the 76 (42.1%) remaining women (OR 5.7, 95% CI 2:0-14.6). Only four women with adhesions and/or distal tubal occlusion had no history of abdominal pain and no evidence of endometriosis at laparoscopy, and therefore qualified for a possible diagnosis of silent PID.
CONCLUSION: Silent PID does not seem to be as common among infertile women as previously thought. This study suggests that in the future, more extensive questions about medical history are needed than have been asked in the past."
7652679,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7652679/,"BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was, first to determine what proportion of clinical treatment evaluation questions involving surgical operations could be answered by a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Second, for those questions not amenable to a RCT, to determine the problems that potentially preclude the initiation of RCT in an ideal clinical research setting.
METHODS: A sample of treatment evaluation questions involving a surgical procedure was obtained by a computerized search of the surgical literature. Problems precluding a RCT were defined. Their face validity and interobserver and intraobserver reliability were assessed. By use of these criteria, the sample questions were evaluated to determine whether a RCT could be performed and, if not, the predominant reasons precluding RCT of surgical procedures.
RESULTS: Only 38.8% of treatment evaluation questions could have been answered by a RCT in an ideal clinical research setting. Patient preference was the most common precluding problem encountered (40% of all problems). The principal precluding problem was patient preference in 23.1%, an uncommon condition in 24.2%, and lack of community (clinical) equipoise in 10%. Methodologic issues (1.2%) and surgical preference (2.3%) were infrequent precluding problems. Questions evaluating therapy for malignant disease, comparing surgical with nonsurgical therapies, and where survival was the primary outcome were more likely to have problems precluding RCT.
CONCLUSIONS: In the ideal situation RCT can be performed to evaluate only 40% of treatment questions involving surgical procedures. Patient preferences, uncommon conditions, and lack of surgical community equipoise appear to be the most common reasons precluding the of RCT of surgical operations."
7653489,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7653489/,"BACKGROUND: Cimetidine is perceived as sufficiently safe that it is being considered for over-the-counter use. However, because of residual concerns about cimetidine-induced neutropenia, a study was conducted to evaluate this association.
METHODS: A population-based, case-control study was undertaken using a large database with Medicaid data from six states. Cases were defined as patients hospitalized with a discharge diagnosis of neutropenia. Medical records were sought to validate the diagnoses of neutropenia and to characterize the severity of disease. Four controls were randomly selected for each case, matched for age, sex, state, and year of diagnosis. The frequency of exposures to cimetidine in the 30 days prior to hospital admission in the cases was compared to that in the identical time periods in the controls.
RESULTS: When investigators simultaneously controlled for multiple, potentially confounding variables by using conditional logistic regression, the odds ratio associated with the use of cimetidine was 1.2 (P = 0.33), with a one-sided upper 95% confidence limit of 2.6 for all patients over 20 years of age, and 0.6 (P = 0.30) with a one-sided upper 95% confidence limit of 3.1 for validated cases over 12 years of age. Neither a dose-response relationship was evident (P = 0.899 and P = 0.716, respectively, when excluding the nonusers, or P = 0.245 and P = 0.215, respectively, when including the nonusers). From these data, one can exclude the occurrence of hospitalization with neutropenia or agranulocytosis due to cimetidine occurring more often than once in every 116,000 patients and once in every 573,000 patients receiving a 6-week course of the drug, respectively.
CONCLUSION: If there is an association between cimetidine and neutropenia, it appears to be very small."

METHOD: GH secretion, stimulated by the dopaminergic agonist apomorphine, was evaluated in 21 alcohol-dependent patients (16 men, five women) and 10 healthy comparison subjects (eight men, two women). The patients were tested during early withdrawal, after 8 days of abstinence, and after 3 months.
RESULTS: Patients who relapsed within 3 months (N = 8) showed significantly less GH secretion in all neuroendocrine tests than did either the patients who abstained from ethanol consumption for 6 months (N = 13) or the healthy comparison subjects. The relapsers and abstainers did not differ significantly in any of their clinical or pathophysiological data, in the severity of their withdrawal symptoms, or in antecedent or concomitant illnesses associated with alcoholism.
CONCLUSIONS: GH blunting appears to be a residual marker of clinical relevance in alcoholism."

PATIENTS AND OTHER PARTICIPANTS: 396 patients, who attended during the months of February and March 1993 with requests for medication or who were already taking something, were selected at random--95% Confidence Interval with 0.049 exactness.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: 76% attended when they were already taking medication, a percentage which was significantly lower among elderly people (p < 0.001). The most common pharmacological groups were analgesics (32.6%), antibiotics (19.9%) and antiflu drugs (17.6%); and the most common pathologies were respiratory conditions with or without temperature (26.2% and 32.3% respectively). Self-medication was correct in 75.5% of cases. It was least correct for antibiotics and vitamins and in descriptions of asthenia, where, in turn, demand was more frequent than self-consumption (p < 0.001). The main reason for taking medication was its previous medical prescription (38.64%).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients correctly use the commonest medicines used in primary care, especially if they have been prescribed before. This suggests the importance of daily health education for each prescription, especially for the most common pathologies."
7655203,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7655203/,"UNLABELLED: Subconjunctival steroids are often injected at the end of cataract surgery. In the present laser flare-cell meter study, we investigated whether this procedure improves the anti-inflammatory effect of steroid eye drops.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty patients (69-81 years of age) without preexisting deficiencies of the blood-aqueous barrier were investigated preoperatively and after ECCE with PC-IOL implantation. The laser flare-cell meter (model FC 1000; Kowa Company) used for examination permits sensitive and exact determination of aqueous flare. The patients were randomly assigned to one of the following two treatment groups: group A: topical therapy with prednisolone 1% eye drops (Inflanefran forte) 5 times per day; group B: subconjunctival injection of 4 mg dexamethasone (Fortecortin) immediately at the end of surgery; topical therapy as in group A. In addition, all patients received antibiotic therapy using gentamicin eye drops. Oral steroids were not administered.
RESULTS: Under topical therapy with prednisolone 1% (group A), the aqueous flare (in photon counts/millisecond) increased from a preoperative value of 10.2 +/- 2.5 (mean +/- SD) to 37.3 +/- 11.1 in the afternoon after surgery (8 h postoperatively) and decreased to 30.9 +/- 38.7 and 27.8 +/- 3.2 on days 1 and 3 after surgery. With additional steroid injection (group B), the flare accounted to 31.7 +/- 8.7 in the afternoon after surgery and to 31.3 +/- 5.9 and 27.1 +/- 4.7 on days 1 and 3 after surgery, respectively. There was no significant group difference (P > 0.3).
CONCLUSIONS: After uncomplicated cataract surgery, subconjunctival steroid injection (4 mg dexamethasone) does not improve the effect of potent anti-inflammatory topical therapy (prednisolone 1% eye drops)."
7656283,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7656283/,"OBJECTIVE: The aim was to test the role of interstitial adenosine in protective downregulation of myocardial energy demand during myocardial hibernation.
METHODS: Isolated working guinea pig hearts, perfused with glucose fortified Krebs-Henseleit, were subjected to 60 min global low flow ischaemia followed by 30 min reperfusion. Left ventricular performance was assessed from heart rate-developed pressure product and pressure-volume work. Cytosolic energy level was indexed by creatine phosphate and ATP phosphorylation potentials measured in snap frozen myocardium. Lactate and purine nucleosides (adenosine, inosine) were measured in venous effluent.
RESULTS: When coronary flow was lowered by 80% for 60 min, heart rate-pressure product and pressure-volume work fell 87% and 75%, respectively, and stabilised at these low levels, but fully recovered when flow was restored. Myocardial ATP phosphorylation potential fell by 67% during the first 10 min of ischaemia, but subsequently recovered to preischaemic levels despite continuing ischaemia, indicating down-regulation of myocardial energy demand. Lactate release increased about 10-fold during ischaemia and remained increased until reperfusion. Purine nucleoside release varied reciprocally with phosphorylation potential, peaking at 10 min of ischaemia, then gradually returning to the preischaemic level during the subsequent 50 min of ischaemia. The ecto 5'-nucleotidase inhibitor alpha,beta-methylene adenosine 5'-diphosphonate (50 microM) decreased ischaemic purine nucleoside release by 41%, but did not attenuate postischaemic contractile recovery. The unspecific adenosine receptor antagonist 8-p-sulphophenyl theophylline (8-SPT, 20 microM) doubled ischaemic lactate release and lowered coronary venous purine nucleoside release by 21%. 8-SPT increased phosphorylation potential at 10 min ischaemia relative to untreated hearts, but blunted the subsequent rebound of phosphorylation potential. 8-SPT treatment during ischaemia resulted in a significantly higher cytosolic phosphorylation potential at 30 min of reperfusion, but did not affect postischaemic contractile function.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that activation of adenosine receptors results in recovery of cytosolic energy level of moderately ischaemic working myocardium, but this energetic recovery is not solely responsible for postischaemic contractile recovery."
7656624,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7656624/,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of a week-long course of inhaled albuterol compared with ipratropium on expiratory peak flow, exercise performance, and dyspnea in patients with stable COPD.
DESIGN AND INTERVENTIONS: A double-blind, two-period, crossover evaluation, wherein the subjects inhaled albuterol, two puffs four times a day (qid) for 7 days, or ipratropium, two puffs quid for 7 days, in random sequence.
SETTING: Outpatients of the Pennsylvania State University Hospital, Lebanon VA Medical Center, and local private office practices.
PARTICIPANTS: A sample of 15 subjects with stable COPD with FEV1 < 55% predicted.
MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Variables measured at baseline (no inhaled bronchodilator) and/or on day 7 of each arm included FEV1 (liters), 12-min walk test distance (meters), ""rescue"" puffs of metaproterenol needed each week, and dyspnea scoring after walking, on the Borg Category Scale (0 to 10 = maximal). There was no significant difference in distance walked in 12 min (mean of 751.0 +/- 55.5 [+/- SE]) vs 755.7 +/- 61.3 m) or perceived dyspnea (mean 2.7 +/- 0.4 vs 3.3 +/- 0.4) during albuterol or ipratropium use. Seven patients preferred ipratropium, seven preferred albuterol, and one had no preference.

7656631,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7656631/,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate RBC transfusion practice in the ICU.
DESIGN: Retrospective chart review.
SETTING: Multidisciplinary ICU in a tertiary care center.
PATIENTS: All patients admitted to the ICU with a length of stay of greater than 1 week.
RESULTS: A total of 23% of all patients admitted to the ICU had a length of stay of greater than 1 week (19.6 +/- 1.6 days). Of these patients, 85% received blood transfusions (9.5 +/- 0.8 U per patient). These transfusions were not solely a function of acute blood loss. Patients were transfused a constant 2 to 3 U/wk. Patients receiving blood transfusions were phlebotomized on average 61 to 70 mL per day. Phlebotomy accounted for 49% of the variation in amount of RBCs transfused. No indication for blood transfusion was identified for 29% of transfusion events. A low hematocrit (< 25%) was the only identifiable indication in an additional 19% of events. Almost one third of all RBCs transfused were without a clear transfusion indication.
CONCLUSION: The long-term ICU population receive a large number of blood transfusions. Phlebotomy contributes significantly to these transfusions. There is no clear indication for a large number of the blood transfusions given. Many blood transfusions appear to be administered because of an arbitrary ""transfusion trigger"" rather than a physiologic need for blood. Blood conservation and adherence to transfusion guidelines could significantly reduce RBC transfusion in the ICU."

METHODS: Fourteen patients with excessive defecatory straining and 30 patients with idiopathic fecal incontinence were studied by electrophysiology and balloon reflex manometry. Pudendal nerve terminal motor latency (PNTML) and rectoanal excitatory reflex were evaluated for abnormalities. Results were compared with 20 controls who had no anorectal complaints and who had similar testing performed.
RESULTS: In controls, PNTML was normal in all but one person. Rectoanal excitatory reflex could be elicited in all controls with either 20 or 40 ml of air. Four different types of balloon reflex responses were observed in patient groups: diminutive excitation, delayed excitation, excitation at high volume of distention only, and absent excitation. Ten patients with fecal incontinence had normal PNTML but abnormal distal excitatory reflex, 5 patients had abnormal PNTML but normal distal excitatory reflex, and 15 patients had both PNTML and excitatory reflex that were abnormal. In patients with excessive defecatory straining, results of both tests were abnormal in six patients, and eight patients had abnormal excitatory reflex but normal PNTML.
CONCLUSION: Pudendal neuropathy may result in abnormalities of excitatory reflex morphology or other characteristics. Abnormal distal excitatory reflex may complement electrophysiologic findings or may serve as a suitable alternative to confirm pudendal neuropathy in centers where facilities for formal testing are not available."
7657011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7657011/,"OBJECTIVES: A policy aimed at the prevention of early preterm births in twin pregnancies has been evaluated. The prevention program included: early diagnosis of twinning, information of the mothers about the risk of prematurity, attempts to restrain physical activity and early work leave prescription when indicated.
STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study of all twin births in a given geographical area (Hauts-de-Seine district); 546 mothers with pregnancy duration of > or = 26 weeks were included; 1088 newborns were followed up to the 28th day of life.
RESULTS: The recommended prevention program is largely used (88% of early diagnosis of twinning, 62% of the women informed and 73% of prescription for reduced physical activity). The very preterm (26-28 weeks) and early preterm (< or = 32 weeks) birth rates are low: 1.5 and 8.5%, respectively. The stillbirth rate is 11 per thousand and the neonatal mortality rate (0-27 days) is 10 per thousand live births, with a persistent difference between the first and the second twin.
CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates the open access and acceptability of the prevention policy; in addition, the perinatal outcomes are better than those of comparable published cohorts."
7658261,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7658261/,"OBJECTIVE: To characterize the incidence of bacteremia and its potential for progression to septicemia in children with sickle hemoglobin C disease and sickle beta(+)-thalassemia to assess the need for penicillin prophylaxis.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review of the frequency and natural history of bloodstream infection in such patients not receiving prophylactic penicillin therapy and followed up in a single institution.
RESULTS: During more than 842 patient-years of observation in 242 patients with sickle hemoglobin C disease, 15 episodes of bacteremia occurred in nine patients. Septicemia was fatal in one patient. The overall incidence of bacteremia, 1.8 events per 100 patient-years (95% confidence limits: 0.8, 2.8) in patients with sickle hemoglobin C disease, was similar to that in hematologically normal children. One episode of bacteremia occurred in a patient with sickle beta(+)-thalassemia.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of bacteremia is not increased in young patients with sickle hemoglobin C disease and sickle beta(+)-thalassemia. Further, unlike its course in children with sickle cell anemia, it rarely evolves into life-threatening septicemia. This probably results from the maintenance of relatively intact splenic function during infancy and early childhood in patients with sickle hemoglobin C disease and sickle beta(+)-thalassemia. Prophylactic penicillin therapy may not be required in these patients."
7658265,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7658265/,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the findings of renal ultrasonography (RUS), 99mTc glucoheptonate renal scan (GHS), and voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) in children with urinary tract infection.
DESIGN: Prospective, masked, clinical study.
SETTING: Single center, multidisciplinary, inpatients.
PATIENTS: Consecutive cases (N = 50) of children aged 2 months to 15 years (8 boys, 42 girls) with pyelonephritis in whom uroradiologic investigation was indicated.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: All patients underwent GHS, 48 had RUS, and 2 had intravenous pyelography. All but one of the patients had a VCUG. Fifteen children were found to have vesicoureteral reflux (6 unilaterally, 9 bilaterally). Of 96 kidneys evaluated by both GHS and RUS, 53 were abnormal by GHS versus 28 by RUS (p < 0.001). Findings of both GHS and US were normal in 36 kidneys and abnormal in 21 kidneys. In 32 kidneys only GHS showed abnormalities. In 7 kidneys only RUS showed abnormalities; 5 of them had mild to moderate pelvic dilation caused by reflux, which was confirmed in all 5 by VCUG. The VCUG demonstrated reflux in another four units with normal GHS and RUS findings. All combined, GHS and VCUG detected 62 of 64 abnormal renal units (96.9%). In the other two cases, RUS showed only focal hyperechogenicity of questionable importance.
CONCLUSION: In the event that one elects to use GHS for the uroradiologic evaluation of children with urinary tract infection, it can be supplemented by VCUG alone, and RUS can be saved for special cases."
7658523,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7658523/,"PURPOSE: We determine what additional information would be detected by renal ultrasonography that was not identified by a normal excretory urogram (IVP) performed for the evaluation of microscopic hematuria.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was done of 101 patients with microscopic hematuria and a normal IVP who underwent renal ultrasonography.
RESULTS: Of the 101 patients with microscopic hematuria and a normal IVP, renal ultrasonography was abnormal in 20%. All findings were ultimately proved to be of no clinical significance, although 6 of 21 patients required a total of 10 additional studies, including 9 computerized tomography scans and 1 renal arteriogram.
CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that renal ultrasonography is unnecessary in a patient with microscopic hematuria and a normal IVP."
7658544,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7658544/,"PURPOSE: The relatively simultaneous development of spring-loaded biopsy devices and the proliferation of transrectal ultrasonography for transrectal guidance of biopsy needles have led to the general use of both technologies for transrectal prostate biopsy. This review was done because the incremental cost of ultrasonographic guidance is considerable and the marginal improvement of sensitivity over digital guidance alone is unknown.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 200 consecutive men underwent prostate biopsy with digital and ultrasound guidance.
RESULTS: Biopsy sensitivity was superior for ultrasound guidance in all categories of tumors studied, with an overall sensitivity of 88% compared to 74% for digital guidance. Nevertheless, 12% of the tumors were detected with digital rectal examination guidance alone.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the optimal method of prostate biopsy may include ultrasound and digital guidance."
7658605,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7658605/,"BACKGROUND: Two hundred dysfunctional central venous catheters used for total parenteral nutrition and administration of cancer chemotherapy were radiographically examined in order to objectively identify thrombotic occlusions as the cause of catheter dysfunction.
METHODS: Outcomes of radiographic dye injections were compared with factors such as the inability to aspirate blood or to infuse fluids, catheter type, and duration of catheter placement.
RESULTS: Catheter type and duration of placement were not significant factors for predicting the type of dysfunction. Failure to withdraw blood was associated with 96% of the thrombosed catheters; this was also associated with 65% of the catheters with nonthrombotic dysfunctions. Once the cause of catheter occlusion was correctly identified, 90% of the catheters were restored to normal function.
CONCLUSIONS: Inability to withdraw blood from a catheter does not necessarily mean it is occluded by thrombus. Mechanical complications account for a significant portion of dysfunctional catheters."
7660509,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7660509/,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of modes of administration (self-administered questionnaires, oral face-to-face interview, and telephone interview) on responses to the American Urological Association Symptom Index (AUASI) in randomly selected community men.
METHODS: An age-stratified random sample of 475 white male residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, aged 40 to 79 years, without prior prostate surgery or prostate cancer were queried about urinary symptom frequency twice at baseline and twice approximately 2 years later using questions with wording similar to the AUASI: At baseline and first follow-up, questionnaires were self-administered initially, followed by a structured interview by a female urology nurse within 2 to 28 weeks. A subset of 200 randomly selected men received a telephone interview by a female research assistant following the self-administered questionnaire given at a second follow-up approximately 4 years after baseline.
RESULTS: Mean symptom scores obtained by oral interview were 1 to 2 points lower than those from self-administered questionnaires (P < 0.01). In a random subset (n = 200) interviewed by telephone, mean AUASI scores were as much as 4 points lower than those from self-completed questionnaires.
CONCLUSIONS: Values of the AUASI obtained by interviewer administration may be lower than those obtained by self-administered questionnaires. When assessment of change in urinary symptoms over time is of interest, the same standardized method of questionnaire administration should be used at baseline and follow-up evaluations to avoid introducing artifactual differences related to the mode of administration."
7661163,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7661163/,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the actual role of physical examination of the liver in normal subjects and in cirrhotic patients.
METHODS: One hundred healthy subjects and 100 patients with liver cirrhosis underwent a physical and an ultrasonographic evaluation of the liver by independent operators. Physical examination was performed by means of percussion and palpation to determine total liver span, liver span below the costal margin, and liver consistency. Total liver span, liver span below the costal margin, and liver volume were also determined by means of ultrasonography.
RESULTS: The agreement between physical and ultrasonographic assessment of the liver span below the costal margin was poor in controls (chance corrected agreement index = 0.13) and excellent in patients (chance corrected agreement index = 0.93). Physical and ultrasonographic total liver span were correlated in patients with cirrhosis (r = 0.592) but not in controls (r = 0.205). Echo-measured liver span significantly correlated with the actual volume of the organ in both groups, whereas physical liver span significantly correlated with liver volume in cirrhosis but not in controls. The difference between actual liver volume and the value predicted by liver span was large. The cirrhotic liver was slightly reduced in size in comparison with that of healthy subjects and differed by an increase in consistency and a thickened edge.
CONCLUSIONS: The bedside examination of the liver does not provide any accurate information regarding the actual volume of the organ. Its major role remains to define the characteristics of lower edge, mainly consistency, which may help in clinical diagnosis. Liver volume proved to predict prognosis in patients with cirrhosis, but its measurement needs quantitative, reproducible methods, which can be obtained only by imaging techniques."
7661235,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7661235/,"OBJECTIVES: Incomplete external cause of injury (E) coding limits the usefulness of hospital discharge data sets for injury surveillance and research. Hospital medical records were examined to determine whether they contained adequate cause of injury documentation to allow for more complete E coding of injury discharges.
METHODS: Medical records for a sample of discharges involving a principal diagnosis of injury from the Uniform Hospital Discharge Data Set for Rhode Island were selected. We assigned E codes to these discharges and compared our E codes with those of the discharge data set.
RESULTS: Documentation of cause of injury in the medical records was sufficient to allow assignment of a specific E code to 70% of the injuries for which no E codes or vague E codes were submitted on the Uniform Hospital Discharge Data Set. It was estimated that specific cause of injury documentation is available in the medical records of 80% of all injury discharges in Rhode Island; for approximately 90%, an E code describing at least the broad cause of injury could be assigned.
CONCLUSIONS: Rates of E coding can be substantially increased by making better use of existing documentation in medical records."
7661299,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7661299/,"BACKGROUND: Despite advances in perioperative management, patients with extrahepatic biliary obstruction still experience a high rate of complications and death after surgery. The rat is commonly used as an experimental animal for research in obstructive jaundice. Ligation of the rat bile duct high in the liver hilum is assumed to produce a more severe model of biliary obstruction than low ligation. The differences are attributed to the ability of the rat bile duct to dilate. Differences in level of ligation may, thus, explain some discrepancies between studies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: To test this hypothesis, female Lewis rats underwent high ligation (HL), low ligation (LL), and sham celiotomy. Colloidal carbon clearance, bilirubin, total serum bile acids, and hematocrit were measured 12 days later. Liver and spleen weight, presence or absence of ascites, infection, and adequacy of ligation were noted and the liver was processed for routine histology and electron microscopy.
RESULTS: Although bilirubin levels were higher after HL than after LL, liver and spleen weight, total serum bile salts, and phagocytic constants K and alpha were not different between these two groups. Gross, histologic, and ultrastructural appearance did not differ between HL and LL groups.
CONCLUSION: High ligation causes greater hyperbilirubinemia than low ligation, but does not alter other parameters including phagocytic constants. The present study does not confirm the hypothesis that HL creates a more severe model than LL; therefore, it is unlikely that differences in level of ligation explain variability in results between studies."
7661417,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7661417/,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: To survey emergency care providers about their stethoscope-cleaning measures and to determine the correlation between these measures and the extent of Staphylococcus carriage.
DESIGN: Prospective cross-sectional analysis.
SETTING: University-affiliated community hospital ED.
PARTICIPANTS: One hundred fifty health care providers, comprising emergency medicine house staff and attending physicians (n = 50), ED nurses (n = 50), and prehospital personnel working in Kent County, Michigan (n = 50).
INTERVENTIONS: Providers were asked how often they cleaned their stethoscopes and which cleaning agents were used. We then cultured each stethoscope by pressing the diaphragm on mannitol agar and incubating the culture aerobically for 48 hours. Staphylococcus aureus was identified by means of standard measures. We examined the effects of different cleaning agents on 24 stethoscopes. The numbers of colony-forming units (CFUs) before and after cleaning with alcohol, nonionic detergent, and antiseptic soap were noted.
RESULTS: Overall, 48% of health care providers (74 of 150) cleaned their stethoscopes daily or weekly, 37% monthly, and 7% yearly; and 7% had never cleaned their stethoscopes. No significant differences were found in the hygiene routines of the three groups of providers surveyed. Use of an alcohol swab was the preferred method of cleaning. One hundred thirty-three stethoscopes (89%) grew staphylococci; 25 (19%) yielded S aureus. Mean staphylococcal bacterial counts ( +/- SD) were 52 +/- 78 CFUs per stethoscope among physicians, 46 +/- 92 CFUs among emergency medical service personnel, and 13 +/- 21 CFUs from the nursing staff (ANOVA, P = .01). Cleaning the stethoscope diaphragm resulted in immediate reduction in the bacterial count: by 94% with alcohol swabs, 90% with nonionic detergent, and 75% with antiseptic soap.
CONCLUSION: Our results confirm that stethoscopes used in emergency practice are often contaminated with staphylococci and are therefore a potential vector of infection. This contamination is greatly reduced by frequent cleaning with alcohol or nonionic detergent."
7661419,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7661419/,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine whether emergency IV pyelography (IVP) adds significant information to clinical judgment in the setting of possible renal colic.
DESIGN: A prospective voluntary survey of a convenience sample of physicians at the time of patient encounter.
SETTING: The emergency department of a university hospital, annual census 50,000 visits.
PARTICIPANTS: Emergency medicine faculty physicians.
INTERVENTION: Physicians were surveyed before and after IVP was performed on patients with possible renal colic.
RESULTS: Over the course of 12 months, 62 patients with possible kidney stones were evaluated by 14 different faculty ED physicians, who filled out surveys. Before IVP results were obtained, 63% of patients were thought to have a high (more than 75%) probability of ureteral obstruction. In 59% of these patients, the IVP results showed ureteral obstruction. The IVP revealed unexpected findings in 42% of all patients, including normal results in 19%, ureteral stones in 5%, higher than expected grade of obstruction in 6%, and lower than expected grade of obstruction in 6%, and lower than expected grade of obstruction in 5%. Management was reported to have been changed in 60% of all patients for a wide variety of reasons, but consideration of alternative diagnosis was the most common reason, occurring in 23%. Management changes included unexpected hospital admission in five patients (9%) and emergency urologic consultation in five patients (9%).
CONCLUSION: Emergency IVPs are useful in the evaluation of patients with suspected renal colic, primarily when they rule out ureteral obstruction and allow consideration of alternative diagnoses. Not uncommonly, emergency urologic consultation or hospitalization occurs on the basis of IVP findings."
7661829,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7661829/,"BACKGROUND: Noise and vibration are stressors that may adversely affect the well-being of infants and children being transported between facilities. Although the problem has been recognized, little has been done to rectify the situation.
HYPOTHESIS: That noise levels in transport incubators during use in transport vehicles exceed the recommended standards, and that vibration levels exceed those that are ""very uncomfortable"" for healthy adults.
METHODS: We measured noise and vibration (n/v) levels inside and outside a neonatal transport incubator in seven transport vehicles (land, air, and water), and calculated maximum and average, weighted and unweighted levels.
RESULTS: The maximum and average unweighted noise levels in all but one vehicle were over 99 dB. The incubator amplified noise at the lower frequencies (The Canadian Standards Association 1992 recommendation is that the noise level in transport incubators not exceed 60 dBA). The maximum vibration levels ranged from 0.86 m.S-2 to 2.35 m.S-2, and the average levels ranged from 0.33 m.S-2 to 1.46 m.S-2. (Vibration in excess of 1.5 is considered ""very uncomfortable,"" and in excess of 2.0 is ""extremely uncomfortable"" for healthy adults.)
CONCLUSIONS: Noise and vibration levels inside transport incubators in our most-commonly used transport vehicles often exceed the recommended limits. For neurologically immature and/or physiologically compromised infants and children, current levels of n/v in transport vehicles are too high, and could affect patient morbidity. These n/v levels require further study, and modification of equipment, primarily the incubators, is overdue."
7662202,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7662202/,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the proportion of outpatient visits that could be managed at a primary-care level, by World Health Organization (WHO) clinical staging.
DESIGN: Prospective, descriptive study. Six medical doctors in a tertiary hospital HIV ambulatory clinic recorded clinical diagnoses, WHO clinical staging and their recommendation regarding the appropriate level of care for each outpatient seen.
SETTING AND STUDY POPULATION: All HIV-infected patients attending a public-sector, urban, South African, referral and teaching hospital HIV outpatient clinic between September and November 1992.
PARTICIPANTS: There were 238 visits by 148 patients during the study period.
RESULTS: Of 238 visits, 165 (69.3%) were deemed suitable for treatment at the primary-care level. After allowing for contradictory responses, at least 141 visits (59.2%) could be appropriately treated at the primary-care level. Although all six doctors assessed more than half of their visits as suitable for primary care, there were significant differences among them. In total, 83 visits (34.8%) needed a medical specialist, and 45 (18.9%) required tertiary-care facilities. Of all the visits, 58 (24.9%), 51 (21.9%), 60 (25.8%) and 64 (27.4%) were classified as WHO stages 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. For these stages, 55 (94.8%), 38 (74.5%), 42 (70.0%) and 26 (40.5%) visits, respectively, were suitable for treatment at a primary-care facility.
CONCLUSIONS: Many of the outpatient visits to this outpatient specialist clinic could have been safely cared for at a primary-care level. As the severity of the disease increases, there is a decrease in the proportion of patients that can be treated at a primary-care level."
7662627,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7662627/,"BACKGROUND: In current ophthalmic practice day-case surgery cataract patients are conventionally discharged and then reviewed the following morning thus limiting the advantages of what 'true' day-case surgery strives to achieve. The aim of this study was to see if there was a difference in outcome between 'true' day-case cataract surgery and non-day-care surgery.
METHODS: A total of 387 consecutive cataract operations were followed, comprising 122 local anaesthetic day-cases, 149 local anaesthetic non-day-cases, 63 general anaesthetic non-day-cases, and 53 general anaesthetic day-cases.
RESULTS: Although not randomised the groups were comparable with respect to age, operator grade, sex, presence of diabetes, anaesthetic type, pre and postoperative visual acuities, and time to first planned outpatient visit. There were 10 early postoperative complications in the day-case group (5.71% of total) and 14 in the non-day-case group (6.6% of total), the commonest complications in both groups were raised intraocular pressure, corneal oedema, and wound leaks. One patient in each group had an early complication that necessitated attending the casualty department. The visual outcomes in both groups were comparable.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that there were no preventable complications within the constraints of the number of operations studied and that no additional risk is attached to 'true' day-case surgery relative to non-day-case surgery."
7662628,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7662628/,"AIMS: The risk of developing cataract in patients with untreated glaucoma or with ocular hypertension was evaluated by comparing the values of lenticular autofluorescence and light transmission in 16 patients with primary open angle glaucoma and 22 patients with ocular hypertension with those of 24 healthy controls.
METHODS: Increase of lenticular autofluorescence and decrease of transmission values in comparison with controls were considered to be precursors of cataract. The values of both variables were determined by fluorophotometry. Each value was normalised for age by dividing it by the value for a healthy control of the same age.
RESULTS: The mean age normalised autofluorescence and transmission values of all patients did not differ significantly from those of the controls (difference < 5%; p = 0.6 and p = 0.2, respectively). Also the mean age normalised autofluorescence and transmission values between glaucoma and ocular hypertension patients did not differ significantly (p = 0.8 and p = 0.9, respectively).
CONCLUSION: The study indicates that untreated primary open angle glaucoma or untreated ocular hypertension do not seem to increase significantly the risk of developing cataract."
7663627,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7663627/,"BACKGROUND: Relatively ignored in the literature on quality improvement (QI) in health care is the question of who defines the issues in quality of care and decides how those issues will be addressed.
METHODS: In late 1992, 669 hospital administrators, quality assurance (QA) coordinators, physicians, and nurses in 72 hospitals in six states were surveyed by telephone. Respondents were asked to identify the most serious issue related to quality of care in their hospital.
RESULTS: Of all the respondents, hospital administrators were most likely to identify quality issues related to organizational/institutional issues. QA coordinators, most of whom had nursing backgrounds, were most likely to identify organizational and patient care issues. Physician responses were distributed approximately evenly across issues related to physicians, to the organization, and to patient care. Nurses were most likely to identify issues related to patient care and patient satisfaction.
DISCUSSION: The findings validate the viewpoint that ""quality is in the eye of the beholder"" and that the eye is conditioned by the discipline in which hospital staff have been trained and socialized. As total quality management and continuous quality improvement approaches are implemented, and participants from many disciplines are involved in QI, a wide range of issues that have both a direct and indirect effect on patient care are likely to be addressed.
CONCLUSION: The findings of this study suggest that surveys that specifically target certain disciplinary groups may yield important information about issues related to quality of care."

CASE REPORT: A 17 year-old girl was admitted for sleepingness and vomiting after about 15 hours of voluntary but denied absorption of paracetamol. Plasma paracetamol concentration was 120 mg/l; factors VII+X level were 55% and factor V 106%. The patient was given IV N-acetylcysteine, 150 mg/kg/30 min, then 50 mg/kg/4 hours. Further decrease in facteur VII level led to pursue administration of N-acetylcysteine (total dose: 350 mg/kg/2 hours). While indication of liver transplantation was considered, clinical and laboratory findings definitely improved.
CONCLUSIONS: N-acetylcysteine may be effective even if administered late. Repeated determination of factor VII could be a good means for managing such a severe condition."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty two patients with suspected but unproven carcinoma of the prostate underwent simultaneous transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS)-guided and digitally guided systematic biopsies of the prostate. A mean of 12 cores was obtained from each patient. On average more cores were obtained with TRUS guidance (mean 6.7) than with digital guidance (mean 5.3).
RESULTS: Cancer was detected in 19 patients and the diagnosis was made by both techniques in 16. Two patients had tumour detected only with TRUS guidance and one only with digital guidance. No complications occurred.
CONCLUSION: This study indicates that there is no significant difference between TRUS guidance and digital guidance to direct systematic biopsies of the prostate. The use of routine TRUS in screening programmes is now in doubt."

7664018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7664018/,"OBJECTIVES: To study the relationship between carotid plaque morphology and the degree of stenosis on Duplex ultrasonography and symptoms.
DESIGN: Prospective open clinical study.
METHODS: 2,590 patients with 5,180 carotid arteries were scanned, 4,560 were initially analysed in terms of symptoms but 54 were excluded, leaving a total of 4,258.
RESULTS: Localising symptoms were present with respect to 1,342 vessels (29.4%). Two-thirds of symptomatic patients had normal carotid arteries. Tight stenosis (80-99%) was more likely to be associated with symptoms than low-grade (20-79%) stenosis (chi 2 = 28.0, p < 0.0001). Plaque type was identified in 1,558 bifurcations (36.6%). Heterogeneous type I & II plaques accounted for one third of plaques. There was a relationship between plaque morphology and degree of stenosis. At < 20% stenosis only 4.4% of plaques were heterogeneous whereas at 80-99% stenosis 84.5% of plaques were heterogeneous. Amaurosis fugax was the only symptom that had any association with a particular plaque morphology. Seventy-two percent of plaques associated with this symptom were heterogeneous in nature.
CONCLUSIONS: Carotid plaque morphology and degree of internal carotid stenosis are mutually dependent factors and both reflect the severity of atherosclerotic disease. Plaque morphology does not add to the sensitivity of stenosis in predicting the presence of symptoms."
7664439,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7664439/,"BACKGROUND: Brief episodes of ischemia protect or ""precondition"" the heart and reduce the size of infarcts caused by subsequent sustained coronary artery occlusion, yet the mechanisms responsible for this cardioprotection remain unresolved. We tested the theory that translocation of protein kinase C (PKC) to the myocyte membranes, initiated in response to brief preconditioning ischemia and manifest during the initial minutes of the sustained occlusion, mediates this phenomenon by attempting to (1) blunt the cardioprotective effects of preconditioning by administration of the PKC inhibitors H-7 and polymyxin B, (2) visualize by fluorescence staining and confocal microscopy changes in the amount or location of PKC, and (3) quantify by incorporation of 32P into PKC-specific peptide changes in the subcellular distribution of PKC in preconditioned versus control hearts.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In the first three limbs of this study, anesthetized open-chest dogs underwent four 5-minute episodes of preconditioning ischemia or a comparable control period before 1 hour of sustained occlusion and 4 to 5 hours of reperfusion. Collateral blood flow was assessed with radioactive microspheres; area at risk (AR) was delineated by injection of blue dye; and the area of necrosis (AN) was measured by tetrazolium staining. AN/AR was smaller in preconditioned versus control dogs that received no treatment (6 +/- 2% versus 19 +/- 3%, P < .01), H-7 (2 +/- 2% versus 14 +/- 5%, P < .02), or polymyxin B (10 +/- 3% versus 29 +/- 5%, P < .01) during the preconditioning or control period. Additional dogs underwent four 5-minute episodes of ischemia, with biopsies obtained at baseline and after the first and fourth occlusions. Frozen sections were stained with a fluorescent probe for active PKC and viewed with confocal microscopy. No differences in the intensity or distribution of fluorescence staining were observed after brief ischemia compared with baseline. Finally, myocardial samples were obtained from dogs subjected to four 5-minute episodes of preconditioning ischemia and time-matched sham-operated controls. Incorporation of 32P into PKC-specific peptide revealed no quantitative difference in the subcellular distribution of PKC between control and preconditioned cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS: H-7 and polymyxin B did not blunt the reduction in infant size achieved with ischemic preconditioning. Neither fluorescence staining and confocal microscopy nor biochemical quantification revealed evidence of preconditioning-induced translocation of PKC to the cell membranes. These results fail to support the hypothesis that translocation of PKC, triggered by preconditioning ischemia, is an important mechanism for the reduction in infarct size seen with preconditioning in the dog model."
7665439,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7665439/,"OBJECTIVE: The complement system is a group of blood proteins that play an important role in defending against viral and bacterial infections. The objective of this investigation was to study the plasma levels of the C4B protein in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in an attempt to associate infections with the development of some cases of this disorder.
METHOD: C4B plasma protein levels were studied using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in a group of 23 subjects meeting DSM-III-R criteria for ADHD and a similar number of age- and sex-matched controls. Also studied were parents of the ADHD subjects.
RESULTS: C4B plasma levels (157.0 micrograms/mL) in the ADHD subjects were significantly (p < .01) lower than those (239.3 micrograms/mL) in the normal age-matched subjects. Mothers of the ADHD subjects also had significantly lower C4B values compared with mothers of normal children. On the other hand, C4B values in the fathers were not significantly altered.
CONCLUSIONS: Decreased C4B levels in ADHD, if replicated, may represent an important marker for ADHD (or a subgroup of ADHD). It also seems plausible that C4B levels are an important etiological factor for ADHD."

SETTING: A survey conducted collaboratively by the Departments of Public Health Medicine in each of the four Health Boards in the province. Total population served, 1.5 million.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The relationship between the perceived reasons for medical treatment failure and the stated referral and prescribing practice of the GPs.
RESULTS: A total of 541 GPs replied; the response rate was 56%. The two most important reasons given for the perceived failure of medical therapy were (i) underlying disease progression and (ii) an adverse patient lifestyle such as smoking or obesity (cited as of primary importance by (i) 264 and (ii) 225 doctors respectively). The ranking differed significantly according to the doctor's propensity to prescribe triple therapy, with those doctors in the highest tertile of this distribution being less likely to cite the patient's lifestyle as a primary reason for treatment failure (chi-squared = 6.7, d.f. = 2, P = 0.035) and more likely to cite underlying disease progression as a primary reason (chi-square = 7.0, d.f. = 2, p = 0.031). The overall ranking of the primary reasons for referral differed significantly according to the proportion of patients given a trial of triple therapy and to the doctor's propensity to refer. Doctors who had given a greater proportion of their patients at least a trial of triple therapy (in the highest tertile of the distribution) were more likely to cite the need for revascularisation assessment as the primary reason (chi-square = 12.5, d.f. = 2, P = 0.0019). On the other hand, the need for further advice on medical therapy was generally ranked higher by those doctors who had given fewer of their patients at least a trial of triple therapy (chi-square = 7.3, d.f. = 2, P = 0.027). GPs who had referred fewer of their new patients to hospital were more likely to be those doctors with fewer patients given at least a trial of triple therapy. Doctors with a greater percentage of their patients managed primarily by a hospital specialist tended to have more who had had a trial of triple therapy for their symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest the need for clearer definition for GPs of the place of revascularisation and of medical therapy for patients with stable angina."
7667549,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7667549/,"BACKGROUND: A large proportion of cardiac arrests outside hospital are caused by ventricular fibrillation. Although it is frequently used, the exact role of treatment with adrenaline in these patients remains to be determined.
AIM: To describe the proportion of patients with witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest found in ventricular fibrillation who survived and were discharged from hospital in relation to whether they were treated with adrenaline prior to hospital admission.
PATIENTS AND TREATMENT: All the patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest found in ventricular fibrillation in Göteborg between 1981 and 1992 in whom cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was initiated by our emergency medical service (EMS). During the observation period, some of the EMS staff were authorized to give medication and some were not.
RESULTS: In all, 1360 patients were found in ventricular fibrillation and detailed information was available in 1203 cases (88%). Adrenaline was given in 417 cases (35%). Among patients with sustained ventricular fibrillation, those who received adrenaline experienced the return of spontaneous circulation more frequently (P < 0.001) and were hospitalized alive more frequently (P < 0.01). However, the rate of discharge from hospital did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. Among patients who converted to asystole or electromechanical dissociation, those who received adrenaline experienced the return of spontaneous circulation more frequently (P < 0.001) and were hospitalised alive more frequently (P < 0.001). However, the rate of discharge from hospital did not differ significantly between the 2 groups.
CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of 2 treatment regimens during a 12-year survey, we explored the usefulness of adrenaline in out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation. Both patients with sustained ventricular fibrillation and those who converted to asystole or electromechanical dissociation had an initially more favourable outcome if treated with adrenaline. However, the final outcome was not significantly affected. This study does not confirm the hypothesis that adrenaline increases survival among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who are found in ventricular fibrillation."
7669164,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7669164/,"PURPOSE: To further the understanding of what factors residency selection committees consider when rating candidates and how well these ratings predict residents' performances.
METHOD: The authors analyzed the application and residency files of 123 physicians who completed the internal medicine residency at the University of Michigan from 1989 through 1992; they also reviewed all 308 applications for 1993-94. Applications to the residency were reviewed by an intern selection committee (ISC) and given scores ranging from 0 (best) to 450 (worst). Multivariate analyses were used to evaluate the influences on ISC scores of seven factors: gender, internal medicine clerkship grade, number of honors in non-medicine clerkships, Alpha Omega Alpha (AOA) status, number of publications, score on the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) Part I examination, and medical school reputation. Each resident's performance was evaluated using the final overall evaluation score submitted by the program to the American Board of Internal Medicine.
RESULTS: The most significant predictors of ISC score were internal medicine clerkship grade, AOA status, medical school reputation, and NBME I score (all four at p < .01; R2 = .66 for the full model of seven factors). The residents' final evaluation scores were moderately correlated with ISC scores at the time of application (r = -.52). In a multivariate analysis, the final scores were significantly associated only with internal medicine clerkship honors (p < .01) and graduation from the University of Michigan Medical School (p < .05), and there was a trend associating them with junior-year AOA election.
CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that the intern selection committee overemphasized the predictive value of AOA election in the senior year, NBME I scores, and medical school reputation."
7669306,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7669306/,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To assess the value of end-tidal anesthetic gas monitoring with respect to intraoperative hemodynamic stability and recovery times.
DESIGN: Randomized blinded study.
SETTING: Operating rooms at a university teaching hospital.
PATIENTS: 120 ASA I and II patients receiving general anesthesia maintained with isoflurane and nitrous oxide (N2O).
INTERVENTIONS: Following a standardized induction technique, patients were assigned to either an end-tidal isoflurane monitored (n = 60) or unmonitored (n = 60) group. During each operation, the anesthesiologist attempted to maintain an adequate ""depth of anesthesia"" by varying the administered concentration of isoflurane with or without information from an end-tidal isoflurane monitor. Intraoperative hemodynamic stability was assessed by determining the variation from a preincisional ""baseline"" mean arterial pressure (MAP) value established during a 10 minute interval immediately prior to the surgical incision. Recovery times were recorded from discontinuation of isoflurane and N2O until awakening, orientation, and postanesthesia care unit discharge.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Intraoperative hemodynamic stability was assessed in each patient and reported as the average error from the baseline MAP, absolute average error from the baseline MAP, coefficients of variation of heart rate (HR), systolic and diastolic MAP, and end-tidal isoflurane concentrations. Both study groups had similar intraoperative MAP and HR values, average error and coefficients of variation for the hemodynamic variables, as well as similar numbers of episodes of hypertension, hypotension, tachycardia, and bradycardia. Finally, the two groups were comparable with respect to early recovery times and postoperative side effects.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that end-tidal isoflurane monitoring does not improve the titration of isoflurane during general anesthesia."
7669383,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7669383/,"OBJECTIVE: This study compared the crying behaviour of infants of depressed and non-depressed mothers at 3 and 6 months of age.
METHODOLOGY: Twenty-nine depressed and 44 non-depressed mothers, their infants and partners participated in this study. Mothers were asked to complete 24-hour diaries of the amount their infants cried for 1 week.
RESULTS: The diurnal variations in crying patterns of infants of depressed and non-depressed mothers were not significantly different. However, infants of depressed mothers were found to cry significantly more in total per day than infants of non-depressed mothers at 3 months of age, but not at 6 months. The results could not be explained by differences in infant temperament.
CONCLUSION: Maternal depression may be a contributory factor to infant crying at 3 months of age."
7669387,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7669387/,"OBJECTIVE: Comparison was made between the accuracy of repeated measurements of liver projection below the costal margin in the right mid-clavicular line (RMCL) and in the midline (ML).
METHODOLOGY: Clinical measurement of liver span was studied in 34 children under 5 years of age by five members of junior ward staff. Three patients were followed longitudinally by the same observers.
RESULTS: The coefficient of reliability between different observers for measurement in the RMCL was 13 mm but for that in the ML was 7 mm. Estimates of liver size in the RMCL were particularly inaccurate when examining larger livers.
CONCLUSION: More reliable sequential estimates of liver size are likely to be obtained using measurements both in the midline and in a well-defined and agreed point below the right costal margin."
7672142,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7672142/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether different isoforms of hCG are secreted by trophoblast tissue from ectopic pregnancy (EP).
DESIGN: Retrospective study of surgically confirmed EPs compared with normal pregnancies.
SETTING: Teaching hospital in South Africa.
PATIENTS: One hundred patients with EPs and 120 patients with normal pregnancies.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Isoforms of hCG were measured by specific immunoassays, lectin binding, and examination of disappearance rates of hCG after surgical clearance of EP.
RESULTS: There were no obvious differences between the two types of pregnancy apart from a lower binding of beta-subunit immunoactivity to ricin 120. No clinically useful diagnostic measures to distinguish hCG from normal and EPs were found.
CONCLUSIONS: No obvious differences were found in the isoforms of hCG between the two types of pregnancy using these methods."
7672885,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7672885/,"BACKGROUND: Several studies have documented significant relationships between a woman's reproductive career and her risk of developing certain types of cancer. This can be due to biological processes triggered by pregnancy or various other factors that are influenced by or are influencing family size. In this paper it is discussed how data on men can be used to gain insight into the nature of the cancer-parity relationship.
METHODS: Hazard regression models for cancer incidence are estimated on the basis of register data for complete Norwegian birth cohorts. Survey data are used to assess differences in tobacco and alcohol consumption according to parity.
RESULTS: It has been shown in previous studies that the effect of parity on the incidence of thyroid cancer, colorectal cancer and Hodgkin's disease is confined to women. By contrast, the present analysis demonstrates that the incidence of oral and pharyngeal cancer (379 cases) is just as strongly related to parity when the focus is on men as it is in female-oriented models. Except for the low incidence among childless men, the relationship between parity and the incidence of cutaneous malignant melanoma (4470 cases) is also similar for men and women. This suggests an association that operates through lifestyle factors, and runs counter to the hypothesis that sex hormones play an important role in the aetiology of malignant melanoma. With respect to malignancies in the oral cavity and pharynx, more frequent use of alcohol and tobacco among low-parity men and women can be intervening factor.
CONCLUSION: This research suggests that future investigations into the importance of reproductive factors for women's cancer incidence should be supplemented with corresponding model estimates for men whenever possible or relevant."
7673012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7673012/,"PURPOSE: Although the axilla is often treated with radiotherapy (RT) postoperatively when microscopic extracapsular extension (ECE) of lymph nodal metastases is present, little data are available to assess axillary failure in the absence of such treatment. As it has been the practice at this institution to withhold axillary irradiation in the presence of microscopic extracapsular spread, we retrospectively analyzed our results for axillary recurrence, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS).
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Clinical records were reviewed of 82 women with Stage II node positive breast cancer treated with lumpectomy, axillary dissection, and RT in addition to systemic chemo/hormonal therapy. Axillary surgery consisted of a level I, II, +/- III dissection, with a median of 16.5 nodes removed. Tangential radiotherapy fields were used to treat the breast. All patients were also treated with an abbreviated supraclavicular field with the lateral border medial to the humeral head. Pathological sections were available for review in 72 of the 82 women.
RESULTS: Twenty-seven of 72 (37.5%) had evidence of ECE; 45 of 72 (62.5%) had metastatic carcinoma confined within the nodal capsule. Clinical characteristics were comparable between the patients with and without ECE with the exception of (a) pathologic subtype, with a greater percentage of infiltrating ductal tumors associated with ECE (p = 0.044), and (b) number of positive lymph nodes, with 93% of patients without ECE having one to three positive nodes vs. only 56% among patients with ECE (p < 0.001). With a median follow-up of 40 months, 1 of 27 patients (4%) with ECE experienced an axillary failure as a component of first failure compared to 0 of 45 patients without ECE (p = 0.4). There were no isolated axillary failures. Five-year disease-free survival (72% without ECE vs. 57% with ECE, p = 0.12) and overall survival (83% vs. 53%, respectively, p = 0.068) suggested a less favorable outcome for patients with ECE.
CONCLUSIONS: Microscopic ECE appears to be associated with increased axillary involvement and decreased survival rather than subsequent axillary failure. Our data suggest that radiotherapy to a dissected axilla may be omitted for the sole indication of microscopic extracapsular disease."
7673024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7673024/,"PURPOSE: Numerous previous studies have attempted to relate the radiobiological hypoxic fraction (HF) to direct measures of tumor oxygenation such as HbO2 saturations, tumor pO2 levels, or hypoxic cell labeling. Although correlations have been found within tumor lines, no overall relationships were seen across tumor lines. The current objective was to examine the effect on HF of changes in the fractions of the oxygenated and anoxic tumor cells that remain clonogenic.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: A mathematical model was developed that relates the HF to direct measures of tumor oxygenation. The primary assumptions were that: (a) the tumor is divided into distinct compartments of either fully oxygenated or fully anoxic cells, and (b) the survival of the oxygenated cells is negligible compared to that of the anoxic cells. Based on these assumptions, the HF is plotted as a function of the fractions of clonogenic or nonclonogenic, and oxygenated or anoxic cells.
RESULTS: If all cells are clonogenic, then the HF equals the fraction of anoxic cells. If a higher fraction of anoxic than oxygenated cells are nonclonogenic, then the HF will be overestimated by the fraction of the tumor measured to be anoxic using direct measuring techniques. If a higher fraction of the oxygenated than anoxic cells are nonclonogenic, the HF will be underestimated by the fraction of anoxic cells.
CONCLUSION: Correlations between the HF and direct measures of tumor oxygenation have been described within tumor lines evaluated under different physiological condition. However, such relationships can be totally unpredictable between different tumors if the fraction of the anoxic cells that is clonogenic varies substantially. Clearly, if tumor anoxia cannot be detected using direct measures, this is an accurate indication that the tumor is well oxygenated. When tumor anoxia is present, however, the conclusions are ambiguous. Even when a small fraction of the tumor is measured as anoxic, direct measures of tumor oxygenation may not be representative of the HF if a substantial proportion of nonclonogenic cells is present."
7673593,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7673593/,"BACKGROUND: The number of elderly drivers is increasing. The primary purpose of public policy requiring vision screening for driver's license renewal is to identify, and, when necessary, restrict drivers with functional vision impairments. Because of age-related ocular conditions, elderly drivers, as a group, have a higher incidence and prevalence of functionally impaired vision. To date, there is no empirical evidence of a significant predictive relationship between changes in vision function and automobile crashes.
METHODS: Most states require vision screening for driver's license renewal, whereas some do not. Among those states requiring vision screening, there is considerable variation in the frequency and level of testing. Efforts to determine the role of vision in driving, while suggestive, have not been useful in identifying at-risk older drivers.
RESULTS: Researchers have observed that older drivers are often aware of their decreased functional capacity and voluntarily adjust their driving patterns by driving less frequently, for shorter distances, during daylight hours, more slowly, and during non-rush hours. However, although not statistically significant, the decline in the mean annual traffic fatality rates with increased state vision screening requirements suggests a possible beneficial effect of vision screening.
CONCLUSIONS: Because older drivers are at risk for sight-threatening conditions, they are most affected by vision screening requirements for driver's license renewal. Since a loss of driving privileges represents a major loss of mobility and independence, there is a pressing need to better understand the relationship between age-related vision changes and the frequency and severity of traffic crashes."
7674464,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7674464/,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of desmopressin acetate (DDAVP) on blood loss, transfusion requirements, and thromboembolic complications in patients undergoing elective aortic operations.
METHODS: A randomized, double-blind trial was carried out during a 3-year period with patients receiving 20 micrograms DDAVP or identical-appearing placebo at the time of aortic cross-clamp placement. In addition to major bleeding and thromboembolic end points, bleeding times and platelet counts were monitored serially.
RESULTS: Forty-three patients were randomized to receive DDAVP, and 48 were assigned to a placebo. An equivalent proportion of patients with aneurysm and patients with occlusive disease was in each group. In spite of mild prolongation in the postoperative bleeding times and moderate thrombocytopenia, DDAVP had no beneficial effect on blood loss or transfusion requirements. Total blood transfusion amount (mean +/- standard deviation) for patients receiving DDAVP was 3.1 +/- 3.0 U compared with 2.7 +/- 3.0 U for those receiving placebo. For all patients the period associated with the greatest blood loss was the time between heparin administration with cross-clamp application and reversal of heparin with protamine sulfate. The incidence of major thromboembolic complications was similar in both groups.
CONCLUSION: Thrombocytopenia and mild platelet dysfunction are common after aortic operation, but DDAVP does not improve hemostasis or lessen transfusion requirements. This study does not rule out a beneficial effect of DDAVP in patients who are undergoing more complex aortic operations or who have major hemostatic aberrations."
7675386,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7675386/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the value of cytogenetic evaluation in fetuses with isolated neural tube defects diagnosed by prenatal ultrasound.
METHODS: Fifty-five thousand two hundred sixty obstetric ultrasounds performed for various indications at the Indiana University Prenatal Diagnostic Center from July 1988 to March 1994 were reviewed using a computerized data base. Excluding all cases of anencephaly, fetuses with isolated neural tube defects were identified. Maternal demographic data, pregnancy outcomes, level of defect, and fetal karyotype when available were obtained. Statistical analysis was performed using the chi 2 test, when appropriate. P < or = .05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: Seventy-seven medical record charts of women with prenatally diagnosed isolated fetal neural tube defects were reviewed. Nineteen pregnancies were terminated, 42 pregnancies were delivered, and 16 pregnancies were lost to follow-up. Karyotypes were available in 43 of the 77 cases (55.8%). The theoretical risk of chromosomal anomalies in this sample population based solely on maternal age was 0.3%. Of the 43 documented karyotypes, seven chromosomal anomalies were discovered (16.3%). The difference was statistically significant (P = .012). Detected chromosomal anomalies included two trisomy 18, two triploid 69,XXX, one triploid 69,XXY, one balanced Robertsonian translocation t(13q,14q), and one inversion in the q arm of the X chromosome.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of karyotypic abnormalities is significantly increased in fetuses with isolated neural tube defects; therefore, prompt antenatal genetic evaluation should be considered in such cases."
7676338,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7676338/,"STUDY DESIGN: Fourteen skeletally immature patients with idiopathic scoliosis (Group I) were retrospectively studied to determine if the crankshaft phenomenon was prevented by combining anterior spinal fusion with posterior instrumentation and fusion. They were compared with 12 similar patients who underwent posterior procedures only (Group II).
OBJECTIVES: To determine whether the addition of anterior spinal fusion was beneficial in preventing progressive spinal deformity in the very young patient.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The crankshaft phenomenon had been well documented in young patients undergoing posterior fusion only. No previous study compared the results of a similar group of patients some of whom underwent combined anterior and posterior fusion and the others who underwent posterior fusion only.
METHODS: Patients who were Risser O and had open triradiate cartilages at surgery were evaluated for curve correction, correction loss, changes in rib vertebral angle differences, rotational changes, and spinal balance. Crankshaft was defined as a progression in curve magnitude greater than 10 degrees and accompanied by an increase in rib vertebral angle difference greater than 10 degrees. In Group I, age at surgery averaged 10.7 years, and follow-up averaged 37 months. In Group II, age at surgery averaged 11.0 years, and follow-up averaged 64 months.
RESULTS: Group I: Thoracic curve correction averaged 77% after surgery and 68% at follow-up. At follow-up, two patients had curves progress more than 10 degrees, and three patients had an increase in rib vertebral angle difference of 10 degrees or more, but none of the patients had these changes simultaneously. Group II: During the course of follow-up, five of the 12 patients had progressive changes of 10 degrees or more in curve size and rib vertebral angle difference. Four other patients had an increase exceeding 10 degrees in one of the two categories.
CONCLUSIONS: In skeletally immature children (open triradiate cartilage and Risser O) with idiopathic scoliosis, the addition of anterior spinal fusion to posterior instrumentation and fusion is helpful in preventing the crankshaft phenomenon."
7676341,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7676341/,"STUDY DESIGN: This was a prospective study of 24 adult patients with kyphosis or anterior column spinal defects treated with anterior fresh frozen allograft for anterior column defects and posterior instrumentation and autogenous grafting.
OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the study were to assess the effectiveness of the anterior allograft in maintaining sagittal correction and to assess anterior incorporation.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Twenty-four patients were followed for a minimum of 2 years (range, 2 + 0-5 + 4 years).
METHODS: Upright radiographs were analyzed before surgery, immediately after surgery, and at the final follow-up examination to assess success of anterior fusion and maintenance of correction. A strict four-point grading system was used. Two independent observers analyzed the radiographic results.
RESULTS: Only two patients showed some collapse of their anterior allograft. The other 22 patients maintained correction, attaining a Grade I or Grade II fusion. Semiconstrained instrumentation ws used posteriorly in the two patients who had graft collapse.
CONCLUSIONS: Anterior structural allograft worked effectively to maintain correction of kyphosis if combined with posterior instrumentation and autogenous grafting. Rigid forms of posterior instrumentation were preferred."
7676971,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7676971/,"OBJECTIVE: The clinical management of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis differs markedly from that of patients with hypersensitivity pneumonitis. However, the two diseases often cannot be differentiated on clinical grounds. The purpose of this study was to establish whether CT can be used to make the distinction.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-six patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and 27 patients with hypersensitivity pneumonitis were studied. All diagnoses were confirmed or supported by open lung biopsy. Three of the patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis had desquamative interstitial pneumonia, and the remainder had usual interstitial pneumonia. In 19 of the 27 patients with hypersensitivity pneumonitis, the disease was chronic (symptoms lasting more than 1 year), while eight had acute or subacute symptoms. Two radiologists, who had not previously seen any of the cases and were blinded to the diagnosis, reviewed the CT images by consensus. The extent and distribution of CT features (including ground-glass attenuation, honeycombing, and micronodules) were recorded. In each case, a CT diagnosis was made, and the level of diagnostic confidence was recorded.
RESULTS: A CT diagnosis was made with a high level of confidence in 39 (62%) of 63 patients. In these patients, the CT diagnosis was correct in 35 cases (90%): 23 of 26 patients with a CT diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and 12 of 13 patients with a CT diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis. In the three patients with desquamative interstitial pneumonia, the CT diagnoses were probable hypersensitivity pneumonitis in two cases and definite hypersensitivity pneumonitis in one case. Of the 19 patients with chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, only seven had a definite diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis based on CT findings; three had a definite diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and usual interstitial pneumonia were more likely to have honeycombing and peripheral or lower lung zone predominance of disease, and less likely to have micronodules, than were patients with chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis. The patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and desquamative interstitial pneumonia had widespread ground-glass opacity indistinguishable from some cases of acute or subacute hypersensitivity pneumonitis.
CONCLUSION: Our results show that CT can be used to distinguish idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis from hypersensitivity pneumonitis in most but not all cases. Desquamative interstitial pneumonia cannot reliably be distinguished from acute or subacute hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis may have findings identical to those of usual interstitial pneumonia. Lung biopsy should still be considered the gold standard for diagnosis of interstitial lung disease."
7676981,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7676981/,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether the common bile duct dilates after cholecystectomy.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: All 234 patients who had cholecystectomy at our hospital between October 1985 and April 1994 were included in this study. The luminal diameter of the proximal segment of the common bile duct was measured on antero-posterior transverse sonograms 4-15 days before cholecystectomy. In all patients, the luminal diameter was measured again on sonograms obtained 7-2160 days after surgery (mean, 393 days; median, 180 days; mode, 360 days). A diameter of 6 mm or less was considered normal. This study contained 197 patients with a normal common bile duct (< or = 6 mm) and 37 patients with a dilated common bile duct (> 6 mm).
RESULTS: The mean diameter of the common bile duct measured on sonograms was 5.9 mm before cholecystectomy and 6.1 mm after cholecystectomy. This difference was statistically significant (p < .05). The diameter of the common bile duct increased in 110 patients, decreased in 61 patients, and stayed the same in 63 patients. Of the 234 patients, 197 (84%) had a normal preoperative diameter of the common bile duct, whereas 167 (71%) had a common bile duct with a normal diameter postoperatively.
CONCLUSION: The diameters of the common bile duct as measured on sonograms increase slightly after cholecystectomy. Most patients do not have significant compensatory dilatation of the duct after cholecystectomy."
7677263,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7677263/,"OBJECTIVE: A rise in the incidence of purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test conversions among employees at our medical center between 1991 and 1993 prompted an examination of factors associated with PPD skin test conversion. We focused on the effect of bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination on PPD skin test conversion because of changes in employee health service policies in 1990 regarding testing of persons who had received BCG vaccination.
METHODS: The study took place in a university teaching hospital employee health service. Charts of employees who had PPD skin test conversion (> 10 mm increase in induration of the PPD response within 2 years if younger than 35 years of age or > 15 mm if older than 35 years of age) between 1988 and 1993 were reviewed for factors that could have influenced PPD skin test conversion and compared with data from 271 randomly selected charts of employees who underwent annual employee assessments in 1993 but did not have PPD skin test conversion.
RESULTS: PPD skin test conversions rose from 0.06% (1/1604) to 1.3% (22/1760; p = 0.000001) in employees tested between 1988 and 1993. Of 41 persons with PPD skin test conversion between 1991 and 1993, 29 (71%) had received BCG vaccination. Only 21% of control subjects (56/271) had received BCG vaccination (p < 0.000001 for comparison of BCG vaccination among those with PPD skin test conversion with that among control subjects). When BCG recipients were not included as having PPD skin test conversion, there was no significant increase in PPD skin test conversions. Twenty-three BCG recipients had PPD skin test conversion on their second PPD skin tests.
CONCLUSION: A large proportion of PPD skin test conversions at hospitals that employ large numbers of health care workers who have received BCG vaccination may not represent recently acquired tuberculosis. Rather, these conversions may be effects of previous BCG vaccination. Two-step initial PPD skin testing may help to eliminate nearly 80% of such false-positive conversions."
7677447,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7677447/,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the outcome of patients with remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting oedema (RS3PE).
METHODS: In a retrospective chart review study, we identified all the patients presenting with polyarthritis and pitting oedema in the past 20 years. We tried to recall the 24 patients with characteristics of RS3PE according to McCarty et al. Two patients had died and four could not be traced. Five could not be seen after the initial period of follow up; relevant data were obtained from their practitioner. For the remaining 13 patients, clinical, radiological, and biological evaluation was performed in our department, with the last assessment in 1993.
RESULTS: The follow up period was from one to 18 years (mean 4.6 (SD 4.5) years). Eleven patients developed one or several recurrences of articular manifestations consisting of mild oligoarthritis (n = 8), definite spondyloarthropathy (n = 2), and rheumatoid arthritis (n = 1). The delay of the first recurrence was 18 months to 12 years after the first attack. Thirteen patients had no recurrence, but three of them developed remarkable features: rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies (1/2000), Sjögren's syndrome. HLA B typing was performed in nine patients and revealed B7 (n = 2), B27 (n = 2) and B22 (n = 2). Isolated HLA B27 typing was performed in two other patients and was positive in one.
CONCLUSION: The long term outcome of RS3PE can lead to different rheumatic diseases. RS3PE appears to be a syndrome related to the elderly onset of the rheumatic diseases, including spondyloarthropathy and rheumatoid arthritis, rather than a specific entity."
7677492,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7677492/,"BACKGROUND: Controversy about operative morbidity and oncologic value of bilobectomy has led to a review of our experience over the past 12 years.
METHODS: The charts of 112 patients (100 men and 12 women with a mean age of 63 years) were reviewed for operative mortality and morbidity and long-term survival. Survival of patients with stage I or stage II disease was compared with that of stage-matched and age-matched groups having right pneumonectomy.
RESULTS: Four patients (3.5%) died postoperatively. Nonfatal complications occurred in 55 patients (49%); the most frequent problem was pleural space disease (34%). Survival studies focused on the 96 patients with nonsmall cell bronchogenic cancer (44 in stage I, 32 in stage II, and 20 in stage IIIA). The overall 5-year survival rate was 40%; the 5-year survival rate was similar for stage I and stage II (41% for stage I, 50% for stage II, and 17% for stage IIIA). The incidence of local recurrence was significantly increased after bilobectomy for stage I cancer (chi 2 = 5.066; p < 0.05) compared with pneumonectomy but did not affect 5-year survival. Local recurrence and survival were similar after bilobectomy and pneumonectomy in stage II.
CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate an increased morbidity after bilobectomy. Survival studies demonstrate an increased risk of local recurrence in patients with stage I disease, which might be partly explained by understaging."
7677539,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7677539/,"BACKGROUND: Increasingly complex cardiac procedures demand optimal myocardial protective techniques during the requisite interval of aortic cross-clamping. For complex procedures in which prolonged cross-clamp times are anticipated, we favor combined antegrade and retrograde cold blood cardioplegia. Advantages include rapid arrest, uniform distribution, and an uninterrupted operation.
METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the cases of 194 consecutive patients who underwent complex cardiovascular procedures between January 1988 and October 1994. Procedures performed included valve repair and coronary artery bypass grafting (23.7%), valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting (19.1%), complex aortic arch and valve procedures (16.6%), valve repair only (16.5%), reoperative valve (9.8%), and multiple-valve replacements (9.3%). Cardioplegic arrest times averaged 113 +/- 38.5 minutes (range, 52 to 292 minutes).
RESULTS: Postoperative left and right ventricular function was evaluated using transesophageal echocardiography. The echocardiograms revealed a 3.1% incidence of new left ventricular dysfunction and no case of right ventricular dysfunction. Of the patients evaluated, 75.7% required little (< 3 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 of dopamine hydrochloride) or no inotropic support postoperatively. The 30-day mortality rate was 3.1%, and no death was due to cardiac failure.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that myocardial protection using a combined antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia technique permits excellent myocardial protection during complex cardiovascular procedures requiring long arrest times."
8190481,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8190481/,"BACKGROUND: Intraocular smooth muscle tumors have long been a subject of controversy. The advent of immunohistochemistry with antibodies against HMB-45, S-100, smooth muscle actin, desmin, and vimentin has helped greatly in the distinction between smooth muscle tumors and melanocytic lesions.
METHODS: Twenty-seven archival tissue blocks from patients who had had intraocular leiomyomas or leiomyosarcomas diagnosed were located and fresh sections cut and stained for the above markers. The cases constituted 24 iris lesions and 3 ciliary body lesions.
RESULTS: All 24 iris tumors were reclassified as iris melanocytic lesions. Two of the three ciliary body leiomyomas retained their classification, and the third was reclassified as a spindle B-cell melanoma.
CONCLUSION: The authors suggest that intraocular leiomyomas are much rarer than previously suggested and that many of the cases previously reported in the literature are open to question."
8190572,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8190572/,"OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to assess the reported improvement in ""well-being"" perceived by parents when children who are taking anticonvulsant medications are administered carnitine.
METHODOLOGY: Forty-seven children with seizures who were taking either valproic acid or carbamazepine were enrolled in a placebo-controlled, double-blinded, cross-over study of the effects of oral carnitine administration (100 mg/kilo) on their well-being as perceived by their parents. The well-being scores were assessed weekly by phone and in person at the start and end of each 4-week phase.
RESULTS: The children's well-being scores improved weekly when either placebo or carnitine were administered. None of the analyses of improved well-being achieved statistical significance.
CONCLUSION: We believe this study documents the necessity for controlled trials when assessing the subjective, beneficial effects of medications. Carnitine is expensive, costing approximately $.30/kilogram of body weight per day ($6 per day for a 20 kilo child). It would not appear warranted to administer carnitine prophylactically to children on anticonvulsant medications for alleviating common, nonspecific symptoms. Because there are no reliable clinical or laboratory tests of symptomatic carnitine deficiency caused by anticonvulsant administration, how to identify children in need of carnitine, and when to administer carnitine therapeutically to children receiving valproate or other anticonvulsants is unclear."
8190590,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8190590/,"OBJECTIVE: Macroorchidism is one of the most well-described clinical characteristics of men with fragile X syndrome, but little information has been available regarding macroorchidism in prepubertal boys with fragile X. The purpose of this study was to learn whether macroorchidism is a characteristic of fragile X syndrome in prepubertal boys.
METHODS: Clinical assessments were performed on 73 boys, 2.2 to 10.2 years, in whom fragile X either had been diagnosed or who had been referred for fragile X evaluations because of developmental delays. As part of these assessments, we measured testicular volumes using Prader orchiometer beads to find out if macroorchidism occurs before the onset of puberty.
RESULTS: From 2.2 through 7 years, boys with fragile X have significantly larger mean testicular volumes than boys without fragile X, but macroorchidism (> or = 4.0 mL or > or = 2 times normal) only occurred in 1 of 27 boys with fragile X. From 8 to 10 years, all our patients with fragile X had clinically enlarged testicles (> or = 3.75 mL), and 7 of 9 boys with fragile X had macroorchidism (> or = 4.0 mL). The testicular volumes of control subjects were all < or = 3.0 mL.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that macroorchidism occurs in some prepubertal boys with fragile X, but in this series it did not occur until age 6 and usually did not occur until after age 8."
8192007,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8192007/,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to reassess the normal sequence and rate of marrow conversion in the femora of children as depicted on MR imaging.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 81 T1-weighted MR images of the femur for the appearance and distribution of hematopoietic (red) and fatty (yellow) marrow. Eighty-one children 2 days to 15 years old with no known bone marrow abnormalities were divided into four age groups. The signal intensity and homogeneity of the marrow in the proximal epiphysis, proximal metaphysis, diaphysis, distal metaphysis, distal epiphysis, and greater trochanter were compared with the signal intensity and homogeneity of surrounding muscle and fat and graded by two observers. In select cases, region-of-interest measurements of marrow, subcutaneous fat, and muscle were obtained to validate the visual grading system.
RESULTS: Conversion of hematopoietic to fatty marrow in the femur followed a well-defined sequence, occurring first in the proximal and distal epiphyses, followed by the diaphysis, distal metaphysis, and then the proximal metaphysis. Although high-signal-intensity fatty marrow could be seen within the femoral diaphysis as early as 3 months of age, fatty marrow with various degrees of heterogeneity was routinely seen in this region by 12 months of age. After 5 years of age, the femoral diaphysis showed homogeneous high signal intensity. These findings are in contrast to previously published data that describe homogeneous red marrow within the femoral diaphysis during the first year of life and homogeneous yellow marrow visualized by 10 years of age.
CONCLUSION: The normal age-related sequence of femoral marrow conversion we saw on MR images conforms to the sequence described in previously published reports, but this transformation, particularly in the diaphysis, occurs significantly earlier in life than has been previously reported. This discrepancy might be explained partially by the sensitivity of signal intensity in the femoral marrow to alterations in window and level settings."
8194695,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8194695/,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Colonoscopy is presently recommended for patients with any benign neoplasm found on sigmoidoscopy. The purpose of this study was to determine whether characteristics of adenomas on flexible sigmoidoscopy predict advanced lesions on baseline colonoscopy.
METHODS: A total of 226 asymptomatic and symptomatic patients with adenomas noted on flexible sigmoidoscopy at a large, multispecialty medical group were prospectively studied. The histology, size, and number of benign polyps on flexible sigmoidoscopy were compared with those on subsequent colonoscopy. Advanced lesions were defined as adenomas > 1 cm in diameter or with villous or severe dysplasia histology. Univariate comparisons were assessed using the chi 2 test and multivariate analysis with stepwise logistic regression.
RESULTS: There was a 24% prevalence of new adenomas found on colonoscopy. Six percent of the patients had advanced lesions on colonoscopy, and none had cancer. Multivariate analysis indicated that findings on flexible sigmoidoscopy predict (P < 0.01) those on colonoscopy. Patients with advanced lesions on sigmoidoscopy had a > 10% prevalence of an advanced lesion on colonoscopy. Patients with small (< or = 1 cm) tubular adenoma(s) on sigmoidoscopy had a < 1% occurrence of an advanced synchronous lesion.
CONCLUSIONS: The histology and size of benign neoplasms found on flexible sigmoidoscopy predict findings on baseline colonoscopy."
8195025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8195025/,"PURPOSE: A series of 4-(N,N-dimethylaminopropylamino)-5-nitroquinoline bioreductive drugs was studied to determine whether DNA binding influences cytotoxic potency, hypoxic selectivity or cellular uptake in cell culture.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Cytotoxicity was assessed by clonogenic assay of stirred suspension cultures of aerobic (20% O2) or hypoxic (< 10 ppm O2) late log-phase AA8 cells. Drug uptake was measured by high performance liquid chromatography of acetonitrile-extracted cell pellets and extracellular medium, or by using radiolabelled drug. Drug binding to calf-thymus DNA was measured by equilibrium dialysis. Intracellular pH was determined using the [14C]-5,5-dimethyl-2,4-oxazolidinedione method and intralysosomal pH using the fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled dextran method.
RESULT: The compounds were weak DNA binders under physiological conditions, with association constants in the range 25-480 M-1. There was no correlation between DNA binding affinity and hypoxic or aerobic cytotoxic potency, or hypoxic selectivity. These compounds were accumulated by cells to high concentrations (25-60 fold higher than extracellular), but cell uptake also showed no relationship to DNA binding affinity. Ammonium chloride selectively raised intralysosomal pH and inhibited the cellular accumulation of these drugs.
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that DNA binding is not the major determinant of cytotoxic potency, hypoxic selectivity, or cellular uptake of the 5-nitroquinolines. Instead, the variable contribution of a nonbioreductive mechanism of toxicity appears to underlie the differences in cytotoxic potency and hypoxic selectivity within this series. The high intracellular drug concentrations of these diprotic bases appear to be due primarily to lysosomal uptake rather than DNA binding. Lysosomal uptake might restrict diffusion of basic bioreductive drugs to the target hypoxic regions of solid tumors."
8195912,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8195912/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether raters using the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) Resident Evaluation Form can detect differences among residents in clinical competence.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
SETTING: Inpatient general medicine service in a university-affiliated public hospital.
PARTICIPANTS: University-based internal medicine (UCIM) residents (ABIM certifying examination pass rate, 91%; mean score, 95th percentile), community hospital-based internal medicine (CHIM) residents (ABIM examination pass rate, 68%; mean score, 42nd percentile), and residents from three university-based non-internal medicine (UC non-IM) programs all assigned to the same inpatient general medicine service over a three-year period. Four hundred eighty-nine evaluations of 110 postgraduate-year-one residents were analyzed.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Mean ratings for the UCIM residents were significantly higher than those for the CHIM or UC non-IM residents (analysis of variance [ANOVA], p < 0.05). Variance was smallest for the UCIM residents (F test, p < 0.01), and only the UCIM residents' mean scores were in the ""superior"" range (7-9) in all evaluated categories. The mean ratings for the CHIM residents while at the university-affiliated hospital were not significantly different from the ratings of the same residents at their home hospital. The ratings for the CHIM residents at either site were significantly lower than those for the UCIM residents in all categories (ANOVA, p < 0.05). Factor analysis revealed a single factor accounting for 76% of the variance among the ratings with all dimensions loading high on that factor (0.75-0.95), providing evidence for a ""halo"" effect. Mean interrater agreement over all variables was 0.87, indicating good consistency among raters.
CONCLUSIONS: Ratings on the ABIM Resident Evaluation Form detect global differences among residents in clinical competence in the expected direction based on type of training program and performance on the ABIM certification examination, but fail to differentiate among the nine evaluated dimensions of clinical care. This rating method may be valid for assessing overall clinical performance, but is less useful for providing feedback in specific areas to individual residents."
8197567,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8197567/,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of long-term pentoxifylline therapy.
METHODS: Fifty consecutive patients on long-term pentoxifylline therapy entered a weaning program. The standard dose of 400 mg three times a day was reduced to 400 mg twice a day for 1 month, 400 mg daily for an additional month, and then withdrawn completely for 3 months. Subjective evaluation of each patient's symptoms and objective measurements (treadmill testing for initial claudication distance, maximum walking distance, and ankle/brachial indexes) were evaluated during treatment withdrawal.
RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients tolerated withdrawal of therapy without symptomatic deterioration. Seven of nine patients who did not tolerate weaning had deterioration of treadmill ICD/MWD parameters; there was a significant absolute decrease (p = 0.016) in MWD from 430 +/- 78 to 221 +/- 23 feet. Patients with an initial low MWD were less likely to tolerate weaning. Sixty percent of the patients with successful weaning had clinically asymptomatic deterioration of treadmill ICD/MWD parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: A substantial number of patients who have been on long-term successful pentoxifylline therapy for claudication can be weaned from the drug. Asymptomatic deterioration of treadmill test parameters is not an indication for resuming therapy."
8198090,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8198090/,"OBJECTIVE: Because native valve bacterial endocarditis following endoscopic procedures is extremely rare, recent guidelines have discouraged indiscriminate use of pre-endoscopic antibiotics. The purpose of this study was to determine whether these guidelines have had an impact in prescribing antibiotic prophylaxis prior to endoscopic procedures.
METHODS: All ambulatory endoscopic procedures carried out from January 1, 1992, through December 31, 1992, in a 412-bed community hospital in Northern Virginia were reviewed to identify cases receiving antibiotic prophylaxis. Inpatients, percutaneous gastrostomies, and ERCPs were not included, since many had received antibiotics for reasons other than endocarditis prophylaxis. We also surveyed a random sample of board certified gastroenterologists practicing at teaching hospitals in Northern Virginia and Washington, DC, to determine their practice patterns. We used the recent recommendations of the American Heart Association with minor modification as the ""appropriate"" guideline.
RESULTS: Only 10% of physicians use antibiotic prophylaxis appropriately. Most physicians over-utilize antibiotics in a variety of settings that do not require such measures. Conversely, many physicians do not prescribe antibiotics for disorders which do require prophylaxis.
CONCLUSION: Although ""appropriate"" guidelines for prophylactic antibiotics are available, and we have estimated the risk of acquiring native valve bacterial endocarditis following endoscopic procedures to be only 1 in 5-10 million procedures, the majority of physicians do not use prophylactic antibiotics appropriately."
8198091,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8198091/,"OBJECTIVES: Evidence is accumulating supporting the use of screening for colorectal cancer. Patients at higher risk for colorectal cancer are more likely to benefit from screening. Women with breast, endometrial, or ovarian cancer are often classified as at high risk for subsequent colorectal cancer, and are urged to undergo screening, but the basis for this is uncertain.
METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis of published data to assess the risk of colorectal cancer after these cancers.
RESULTS: Based on 154,270 women and 779,251 person-yr of observation (PYO) after breast cancer, 37,266 women and 229,498 PYO after endometrial cancer, and 41,366 women and 126,688 PYO after ovarian cancer, the age-adjusted relative risk (95% CI) for colorectal cancer after breast cancer was 1.1 (1.07, 1.19), after endometrial cancer 1.4 (1.32, 1.55), and after ovarian cancer 1.6 (1.40, 1.80).
CONCLUSIONS: 1) Women with a history of breast, endometrial, or ovarian cancer are at a statistically significant increased risk for subsequent colorectal cancer. 2) Women with a history of endometrial or ovarian cancer are at higher risk than are women with breast cancer, but ascertainment bias from heightened medical surveillance after the diagnosis of a gynecologic malignancy may contribute to this observed increase in risk. 3) The association between these cancers and colorectal cancer suggests common etiologic factors, either environmental or genetic, but the degree of increased risk is small."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective serological study of 163 consecutive patients undergoing cystoscopy as new or review cases was performed to assess any correlation between beta HCG production and histological grading or stage.
RESULTS: Ten per cent of patients with TCC had a raised beta HCG level but there was no correlation with tumour differentiation, staging or prognosis.

8199833,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8199833/,"OBJECTIVE: To see if a eutectic mixture of local anaesthetics (EMLA) could be used effectively for the release of preputial adhesions as a day case procedure.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 36 consecutive symptomatic children had their preputial adhesions separated under local anaesthetic with EMLA.
RESULTS: The procedure was successful in 27 children. Of these, 16 remained symptom free at 9 to 12 months follow up although five children had slight recurrence of adhesions. The other 11 children were listed for circumcision at 2 weeks following the procedure because of marked recurrence of adhesions.
CONCLUSION: EMLA cream is a good alternative to general anaesthetics in the separation of preputial adhesions. The technique is operator-dependent and better results were obtained when one person was using it regularly. Separation of adhesions is a worthwhile procedure in boys with symptomatic non-retractile foreskins."
8199995,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8199995/,"BACKGROUND: Microscopic evaluation of excised intraductal breast carcinoma (DCIS) specimens using a serial subgross technique reveals that in many patients the lesion is larger than expected, often making complete excision impossible with less than a true quadrantectomy. Data is presented on 181 patients with DCIS in whom the initial biopsy was performed using a more cosmetic wide local excision rather than a true quadrantectomy.
METHODS: Clear margins were defined as no tumor within 1 mm of any inked or dyed margin. All of these patients subsequently underwent mastectomy or reexcision of the initial biopsy site. This allowed pathologic evaluation for residual disease.
RESULTS: At mastectomy or reexcision, 76% of patients with initially involved margins had residual DCIS, as did 43% of patients with initially clear margins (P < 0.0001). Larger tumor size was a statistically significant predictor of initial margin involvement and residual DCIS (P < 0.05). Patients with comedo-DCIS had a greater tendency toward positive initial histologic margins and residual DCIS, but this trend was not statistically significant (P < 0.1).
CONCLUSION: DCIS presents major problems to both surgeons and pathologists. It is difficult to excise completely using a wide local excision. Histologically negative margins do not guarantee that residual DCIS has not been left behind. Inadequate excision of the primary lesions may be the most important cause of local failure after conservative treatment for intraductal breast carcinoma."
8200787,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8200787/,"BACKGROUND: To analyze the differences in quality of life associated with headache diagnoses using the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form Health Survey (SF-20).
METHODS: A patient interview survey using the SF-20 Short Form Health Survey was conducted in a headache clinic within a multi-specialty group practice. All six health components of the SF-20 were included in the study. Headache diagnoses were made using IHS criteria.
RESULTS: 208 consecutive headache patients were studied. Patients with cluster headache had a significantly higher (worse) pain score (P < 0.018) and higher percentage of patients with poor health due to pain (P < 0.005) than patients with migraine headache. There were fewer cluster patients with poor health associated with physical functioning than tension-type (P < 0.020) or mixed headache (P < 0.022) patients. Poor health associated with social functioning was greater for cluster (P < 0.011) and tension-type headache (P < 0.015) than for migraine. There was a significantly higher percentage of tension-type headache patients with poor health associated with mental health (P < 0.002) than patients with migraine.
CONCLUSIONS: The SF-20 is a reliable and valid measure of quality of life for patients with different headache diagnoses. Distinct headache diagnoses are marked by unique patterns of impairment and quality of life."
8201148,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8201148/,"OBJECTIVE: To acquire data about and an understanding of the way in which Dutch nursing home physicians (NHPs) who administer voluntary active euthanasia and/or physician-assisted suicide (EAS) cope with the requirements for prudent practice. These requirements include: the patient must experience his or her suffering as unbearable and hopeless; the wish to die must be well considered and persistent; the request must be voluntary; the NHP must consult at least one other physician; the physician is not allowed to issue a certificate testifying to natural death and is obliged to keep records.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, MEASUREMENTS: See preceding paper.
RESULTS: Sixty-nine NHPs (12%) indicated that they had administered EAS on at least one occasion. The state of the patient was described by the NHP as utterly hopeless in 88% of cases and as utterly unbearable in 64% of the cases. The period of time between the first discussion of the subject and the actual administration varied from less than a day to more than a year. The most frequently given reasons for the request were unbearable suffering (53%) and hopeless suffering (49%). The majority of the NHPs (85%) indicated that it was the patient who first broached the subject of EAS. Eighty-five percent of the NHPs also requested a consultation with another physician. In the majority of cases this second opinion was given by another NHP (63%); over 50% of these NHPs worked in the same nursing home. Ninety-one percent of the physicians consulted were convinced that the request was well considered, and 93% found that there was no alternative treatment available. The nurses involved were consulted informally: 94% were questioned about the request for EAS and 93% about the physician's intention to comply. Seventy-five percent of the respondents said they had made some sort of written notes regarding the last time they had administered EAS. The number of certificates testifying to death by natural causes fell after 1988. In 41% of the cases all requirements were met.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that Dutch NHPs observe all the requirements for EAS in 41% of cases. In the remaining cases, shortcomings were found: NHPs allowed too little time between the first discussion and the actual administration; they did not always keep written records; or they signed a death certificate testifying that the patient had died a natural death."
8201715,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8201715/,"PURPOSE: Many authors have reported excellent long-term patency rates of peroneal artery bypasses. It has been suggested, however, that the hemodynamic result of the peroneal bypass is inferior to that of other infrapopliteal artery bypasses, making it suboptimal in patients with forefoot ischemic tissue loss. A retrospective review of 118 recent infrainguinal vein grafts (36 peroneal, 27 anterior tibial, 35 posterior tibial, 20 popliteal) was undertaken to assess and compare the hemodynamic results for each group.
METHODS: We reviewed the hemodynamic results of 36 peroneal bypass grafts assessed by preoperative and postoperative ankle-brachial index and transmetatarsal pulse volume recording, duplex scan-derived distal graft peak systolic flow velocity, and intraoperatively measured outflow resistance. These results were compared with a concurrent series of anterior tibial, posterior tibial, and popliteal artery bypass grafts. All but one of the infrapopliteal bypass grafts were performed for limb salvage, and 65% of patients had ischemic ulcerations or gangrene.
RESULTS: There was no difference in postoperative ankle-brachial index, postoperative transmetatarsal pulse volume recording, peak systolic flow velocity, or measured outflow resistance among the four different outflow groups. All patients with peroneal bypass grafts had healed wounds within a mean follow-up period of 17 months. There were no hemodynamic failures.
CONCLUSION: Peroneal artery bypass grafts achieved hemodynamic results equivalent to anterior tibial, posterior tibial, and popliteal artery bypass grafts."
8202983,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8202983/,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Previous studies, mainly autopsy-based, suggest that the spectrum of stroke in cancer patients differs from that of the general population. These studies also suggest that cerebrovascular events frequently are a manifestation of hypercoagulability. However, no studies that address this question in the adult oncological population from a clinical perspective are available. We therefore assessed the clinical impact of cerebral ischemic events in cancer patients and attempted to determine whether their occurrence represents a manifestation of Trousseau's syndrome.
METHODS: A computerized database that records all neurological admissions and consultations at a tertiary medical center was used to retrospectively identify all patients with cerebral ischemic events and cancer.
RESULTS: Thirty-three patients representing 3.5% of all stroke consultations and admissions seen at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center were identified during the period 1988 through 1992. Large-vessel atherosclerosis was the most frequent cause of stroke. Furthermore, although 30% were determined to have hypercoagulability as a cause using clinical criteria, in only one of nine patients in whom tests were done was sufficient evidence present to make a presumptive diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulation. Irrespective of therapy, recurrent cerebral ischemic events were noted in only 6% of patients during a follow-up period averaging greater than 9 months, a figure that is similar to that for the risk of repeated events in the noncancer population.
CONCLUSIONS: Recognizing the limitations of this retrospective study, it appears nonetheless that conventional stroke origins account for the majority of cerebral ischemic events in the adult cancer population. Although hypercoagulability is present to a greater extent than in the nononcological population, recurrent strokes seem to occur no more frequently than in the nononcological population, and antiplatelet agents seem sufficient therapy for most patients."
8203422,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8203422/,"OBJECTIVE: Second-born twin outcome was compared with that of the first-twin birth mate to determine whether there were differences, the reason for the differences, if any, and the clinical decisions that could be made to eliminate or ameliorate these differences.
STUDY DESIGN: Twin pregnancies from 1989 through 1992 were retrospectively reviewed. Charts demonstrating both twins stillborn, either twin weighing < 500 gm, or either twin with a serious congenital anomaly were excluded from evaluation. After these exclusions 200 twin pairs remained for analysis. Each twin was compared directly with its birth mate. The first twin is postulated as having the best possible outcome for the pregnancy involved, and second-twin outcomes are compared with these.
RESULTS: The second-born twin was more likely to be intubated, have respiratory distress syndrome, need resuscitation, and have lower 5-minute Apgar scores. Second-born twins had more nursery complications. The < 1500 gm group appeared to be at special risk. In this group there were more second-born twin neonatal deaths and much higher rates of intubation and resuscitation. Nonvertex presentation in the second-born twin increased chances for resuscitation, intubation, respiratory distress syndrome, and nursery complications. These outcomes in the second-born were not affected by cesarean delivery.
CONCLUSIONS: The second-born twin is at increased risk of untoward outcome compared with its birth mate. Some of this risk can be attributed to birth weight. The risk posed by nonvertex presentation is small. Cesarean section delivery does not appear to eliminate the difference between first- and second-twin outcome. Prospective studies are needed."
8203434,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8203434/,"OBJECTIVE: Previous studies demonstrate an association between abnormal umbilical artery Doppler velocimetry and the birth of a small-for-gestational-age infant and between abnormal result and adverse neonatal outcome. The hypothesis is that preterm growth-retarded infants with normal antenatal velocimetry have outcomes similar to other preterm infants, whereas preterm small-for-gestational-age infants with abnormal Doppler results define a subgroup with increased morbidity.
STUDY DESIGN: For 100 live-born infants, at risk for fetal growth retardation and undergoing antenatal Doppler and targeted ultrasonographic examinations, we assessed a number of complete neonatal outcome parameters.
RESULTS: Ten neonatal deaths occurred in the study population, seven with abnormal Doppler results and three with normal Doppler results. Of the 90 surviving infants, gestational age at delivery was not different between the Doppler normal and abnormal neonates, whereas birth weight (1714 gm vs 1379 gm) was higher in the Doppler normal group (p = 0.006). The presence of intraventricular hemorrhage (20% vs 6%) was higher in the abnormal group (p = 0.05). Abnormal Doppler results defined an infant group destined for prolonged hospitalization, mean intensive care days (21 vs 9), and special care nursery days (25 vs 9). Thirty-eight percent of small-for-gestational-age babies had a normal Doppler result. Analysis of variance indicated small-for-gestational-age infants with abnormal Doppler results (n = 20) had a mean intensive care unit stay of 31 days, significantly different (p = 0.005) from small-for-gestational-age infants with normal Doppler results (n = 14), non-small-for-gestational-age infants with abnormal results (n = 21), and non-small-for-gestational-age infants with normal results (n = 35) whose mean intensive care unit stays were 14, 12, and 7 days, respectively. Gestational age at delivery (33.0 weeks) was not different among these groupings, not accounting for the observed differences.
CONCLUSION: Normal antenatal velocimetry defines a distinct subgroup of preterm small-for-gestational-age infants at less risk for prolonged hospitalization compared with those with abnormal velocimetry."
8203686,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8203686/,"OBJECTIVES: This article examines sexual risk taking among self-identified bisexual men in San Francisco and whether risk reduction has occurred, with respect to both homosexual and heterosexual behaviors, among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody-positive and HIV antibody-negative men. It also examines psychosocial correlates of unprotected anal and vaginal intercourse.
METHODS: The participants were members of a population-based longitudinal cohort of 1034 single men aged 25 through 54 years recruited from the 19 census tracts in San Francisco that had the greatest prevalence of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in 1984. Of the total sample, 140 subjects initially identified themselves as bisexual; 85% of these men remained in the study.
RESULTS: The participants reported dramatic reductions in sexual risk taking. Prevalences of unprotected anal sex with men were similar among HIV-positive bisexual men (89% in 1984-1985 and 18% in 1988-1989) and those who were HIV negative (65% and 20%). The prevalence of unprotected vaginal sex was much lower for HIV-positive men (16% in 1984-1985 and 2% in 1988-1989) than for HIV-negative men (35% and 20%). Unprotected intercourse was associated primarily with situational and interpersonal factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Striking reductions in risk behaviors were reported. This subgroup of single, bisexually identified men appears unlikely to be a common vector for spreading HIV infection to women."
8203693,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8203693/,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to identify the role of race in seeking and receipt of care for symptoms of coronary heart disease.
METHODS: Data on medical care, sociodemographic characteristics, symptoms, risk factors, income, and insurance were collected in a telephone interview for a random sample of 2030 Black and White adults in inner-city Boston. Rates of care-seeking for symptoms, amounts of delay in seeking care, and rates of receipt of care were compared for Blacks and Whites after adjustment for other characteristics.
RESULTS: Before and after adjustment for other factors, Blacks and Whites were equally likely to seek care. Average delay time was shorter for Blacks, particularly Black women. With the exception of a lower rate of referral to cardiologists among Blacks, receipt of care was similar for Blacks and Whites who sought medical attention for symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: In an urban population of Blacks and Whites who were similar in socioeconomic status and access to medical care, there were few racial differences in coronary heart disease-related care patterns."
8203971,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8203971/,"OBJECTIVE: The authors reviewed their experience with life-threatening blunt injuries in approximately 2900 children (0-14 years) admitted to the designated state pediatric shock trauma unit between 1990 and 1993.
METHODS: During this time, the authors treated all severely injured children with a prospective, nonoperative protocol if they were hemodynamically stable after less than 40 mL/kg fluid replacement, had proven evidence of solid organ injuries and remained stable in the pediatric intensive care unit under surgical management.
RESULTS: Twenty-eight children had computed tomography (CT) or operatively proven lacerations of the spleen, 25 had lacerations of the liver, 18 had lacerations of the kidney, 7 had lacerations of the pancreas, and 11 had two or more solid organ injuries. Three of the 28 children with injured spleens required laparotomy (two splenectomy, one splenorrhaphy). Two of the 25 children with liver injuries required laparotomy (one suturing, one partial resection). One of the 18 children with kidney injuries required laparotomy (nephrectomy), and 3 of the 7 children with pancreas injuries required laparotomy (two resection, one pseudocyst). There were three deaths after laparotomy (two head, one chest/abdominal). There were no deaths in the children managed nonoperatively, and there were no immediate or long-range complications.
CONCLUSIONS: Comparison of the authors' data with the National Pediatric Trauma Registry shows similar results. The authors believe that nonoperative management of solid organ injuries under careful surgical observation in a pediatric intensive care unit is safe and appropriate."
8203974,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8203974/,"OBJECTIVE: Prophylactic cardiac revascularization in patients with ischemic myocardium could reduce postoperative cardiac complications after aortic reconstruction. However, the effectiveness of this approach has not been documented.
SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Stress-thallium scanning can identify patients with ischemic myocardium. Morbidity and mortality after aortic reconstruction appears to be largely caused by co-existent coronary artery disease, and patients who have had recent cardiac revascularization have few postoperative cardiac complications.
METHODS: Preoperative stress-thallium scanning was evaluated prospectively in 146 patients undergoing aortic reconstruction. Patients with positive studies underwent coronary arteriography and cardiac revascularization, when appropriate. Postoperative cardiac complications and long-term survival in these patients were compared with results from 172 similar patients undergoing aortic reconstruction without stress-thallium scanning. Results also were analyzed to determine predictors of postoperative cardiac events.
RESULTS: Forty-one per cent of patients undergoing stress-thallium testing underwent coronary arteriography, and 11.6% had cardiac revascularization. In contrast, 14.7% of patients treated without stress-thallium testing had coronary arteriography, and 4.1% had revascularization (p < 0.01). Despite this, cardiac mortality, serious cardiac complications, and long-term cardiac mortality were similar in both groups. Only advanced age and intraoperative complications (but not a positive stress-thallium test) predicted postoperative cardiac events.
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative stress-thallium testing confirmed a high incidence of significant coronary artery disease in patients undergoing aortic reconstruction, but prophylactic cardiac intervention does not reduce operative or long-term mortality. Thus, the risk and expense of routine stress-thallium testing and subsequent cardiac revascularization cannot be justified."
8203989,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8203989/,"BACKGROUND: In 1991, Medicare began covering screening mammograms subject to copayment and deductible. This study evaluated the effectiveness of Medicare in removing financial barriers to screening mammography among low-income older women.
METHODS: In an inner-city public hospital's General Medicine Clinic, 119 consecutive, eligible, and consenting Medicare-enrolled women without known risk factors for breast cancer other than age, and no mammogram in the previous 2 years, were entered into a randomized controlled trial with follow-up after 2 months. The mean age was 71 years; 77% were black, 92% had an annual income below $10,000, and 52% had had a previous mammogram. All patients were counseled concerning indications for screening mammograms and Medicare coverage, and all were referred to a low-cost mammography facility. Sixty-one subjects were randomly assigned a voucher for a free screening mammogram at the referral facility. Obtaining a mammogram within 60 days of study entry was the main outcome measure.
RESULTS: Of the women given vouchers, 27 (44%) obtained screening mammograms, compared with six (10%) of those without vouchers (P < .001). Adjustment by multiple logistic regression confirmed this association, yielding an adjusted odds ratio of 7.4 (95% confidence interval, 2.5 to 21.4). Knowledge concerning mammography and breast cancer increased significantly overall (and within randomization groups) between initial interview and follow-up; fear did not change. For women without the voucher, the main reason for not obtaining a mammogram was financial; the main reason for women with the voucher was transportation.
CONCLUSION: In a low-income, inner-city population of older women, financial barriers to screening mammography persist despite Medicare coverage."
8204035,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8204035/,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of Barrett's esophagus in patients with adenocarcinomas located at the gastroesophageal junction.
DESIGN: A case series of patients who underwent esophagogastrectomy for adenocarcinoma was retrospectively reviewed. Tumors were grouped by location as esophageal, cardiac, and subcardiac, and the prevalence of specialized intestinal metaplasia in the histological specimens was determined.
SETTING: A university department of surgery that specializes in esophageal diseases.
PATIENTS: One hundred patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, cardia, or proximal stomach.
MAIN OUTCOME: Cardiac adenocarcinomas were associated with Barrett's esophagus in 42% of the patients.
RESULTS: Specialized intestinal metaplasia was identified in the histological sections from the resected specimen in 42% (13/31) of cardiac adenocarcinomas and in 79% (38/48) of esophageal adenocarcinomas but in only 5% (1/21) of subcardiac adenocarcinomas. The preoperative endoscopic biopsy results concurred with the final diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus in 33 of the 38 esophageal tumors, six of the 13 cardiac tumors, and the one subcardiac tumor but failed to detect specialized intestinal metaplasia in 54% (7/13) of cardiac tumors. Cardiac tumors were associated with shorter lengths of Barrett's mucosa than esophageal tumors (2.7 +/- 1.8 cm vs 7.4 +/- 3.4 cm, P < .01). The Barrett's metaplasia was dysplastic in 36 of the 38 esophageal tumors, 10 of the 13 cardiac tumors, but not in the subcardiac tumor.
CONCLUSIONS: Adenocarcinomas located at the gastroesophageal junction were associated with Barrett's metaplasia in nearly one half of the patients. The length of the Barrett segment tends to be short and may be missed during endoscopy. The presence of high-grade dysplasia within Barrett's mucosa supports a barrett's origin for half of the adenocarcinomas arising at this location."
8204332,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8204332/,"BACKGROUND: Attendance at health checks of patients already registered with a general practitioner is known to be poor, with those in need least likely to attend. Little is known of the efficacy of such checks for newly registered patients.
AIM: This study set out to determine the characteristics of attenders and non-attenders at health checks for patients registering with a general practitioner in east London, and the effect of health checks on motivation to change unhealthy lifestyles.
METHOD: A questionnaire analysis was carried out of patients aged 16 years and over at registration and after a health check in seven east London training practices. Questionnaires asked about personal background and lifestyle including smoking status, alcohol intake, diet, weight, exercise, cervical smear uptake, and motivation to change unhealthy aspects of lifestyle.
RESULTS: Questionnaires were offered to 356 patients registering with the practices, of whom 101 declined or returned inadequate data. Of the remaining 255 patients, 118 (46%) attended a health check with 113 completing a second questionnaire after the check. Non-attenders were significantly more likely than attenders to be of lower social class, unemployed, of African origin and to be heavy smokers. Women who did not attend were significantly less likely than attenders to have had a cervical smear within the last three years. Non-attending mothers were significantly more likely than attending mothers to be single parents. Motivation among attenders to stop smoking and drink less alcohol was increased significantly after the health check.
CONCLUSION: Attendance at registration health checks at these practices was poor and non-attenders tended to be more socially deprived than attenders and had relatively unhealthy lifestyles. Although the health checks increased the attenders' motivation to alter smoking and drinking habits, inviting all new patients to a health check would appear to result in poor targeting of health promotion resources and may widen inequalities in health."
8205018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8205018/,"OBJECTIVE: To quantify the effect of selection of relatively healthy women in studies reporting reduced relative risk for cardiovascular disease in postmenopausal women taking hormone replacement therapy.
DESIGN: Review of the follow up studies reported in three recent meta-analyses to determine the effect of oestrogen therapy on both total cancer and cardiovascular disease. The same standard statistical methods as in the original analyses were used.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Relative risks of total cancer and cardiovascular disease.
RESULTS: In most of the follow up studies the relative risk for total cancer was below 1. The studies that showed the largest reduction in cardiovascular disease also showed the largest reduction in cancer, indicating a healthy cohort effect. Although heterogeneity within the studies prevented pooling, the best estimate for the protective effect on total cancer was a relative risk of 0.83 among women taking oestrogen (95% confidence interval 0.71 to 0.96), while in the same studies the relative risk for cardiovascular disease was 0.57 (0.50 to 0.64).
CONCLUSIONS: Unintended selection of relatively healthy women for oestrogen therapy may have influenced the reported beneficial effect of oestrogen therapy on cardiovascular disease. It is unclear how much of the cardioprotection is due to this selection. Universal preventive hormonal replacement therapy for postmenopausal women is unwarranted at present."
8208037,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8208037/,"BACKGROUND: The interpretation of the absence of a nocturnal fall in blood pressure (BP) (non-dipper condition) and its possible prognostic value are not clear. One possible hypothesis to be analyzed is whether the condition of non-dipper is due or not to the daily activity.
METHODS: Ninety-five doctors, 47 of whom were females, whose age ranged between 24 and 46 years participated in the study. Ambulatory monitoring BP were programmed to be randomly carried out on-call and on a day-off with measurements intervals of 15 min. Mean systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP) and heart rate (HR) were considered as measurement parameters for every period: 24 h, awake and sleep. Sleep period was considered as one of no less than 2 hours, nocturnal BP fall was defined as the difference between awake and sleep means, and dipper condition as a systolic decrease greater than 10 mmHg and diastolic decrease greater than 5 mmHg.
RESULTS: The mean nocturnal BP fall on the day-off was of 15% and 13% (SBP and DBP) and while on-call it was 18% and 15% respectively (p < 0.001). In absolute values the SBP decreased 21 +/- 10 mmHg and 18 +/- 10 mmHg and the DBP 11 +/- 6 mmHg and 10 +/- 5 mmHg, on-call and day off respectively (p < 0.001). The percentage of subjects with decrease lower than 10/5 mmHg was different in each of the two days (8% and 12%), however only one individual maintained the non-dipper condition in both period, although he reported many interruptions in the sleep. No association was established between the nocturnal BP fall and other variables (age, sex or family history of hypertension).
CONCLUSION: The non-dipper condition is changeable and is related to the activity carried out by the subject while awake, as well as the quality of sleep. It does not seem to be associated with inherent variables of the individual such as family history of hypertension, age or sex."
8208479,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8208479/,"AIM: To determine whether a numerical ranking system can provide an equitable basis for prioritising patients awaiting coronary artery bypass grafting.
METHODS: A review of the current coronary surgery waiting list was undertaken using a newly developed scoring system. The factors included in the score were age, symptoms, results of exercise testing, coronary anatomy, employment status and perceived surgical risk. This score was compared with a Canadian consensus system. Rankings were then compared with the clinical priorities given by clinicians when the patients were placed on the waiting list.
RESULTS: There was excellent correlation between the two priority ranking systems using only those items included in the Canadian system (r = 0.9179). However, correlation between the Canadian system and the full Green Lane Hospital (GLH) scoring system was weaker (r = 0.6869). The Canadian system assigned higher surgical priorities than Auckland clinicians. Comparison between the GLH system and clinical priority gradings (O, urgent out of hospital), (A) and (B) showed considerable scatter. Waiting times for these three categories considered acceptable by the Canadian consensus group were two to six weeks for priority (O), six weeks to three months for priority (A) and three to six months for priority (B). The mean times on the waiting list for the 260 patients still awaiting surgery at GLH were two months for (O), 11 months for (A) and 22 months for (B).
CONCLUSIONS: The Canadian and expanded GLH ranking systems are no more than aids to establishing priorities. They cannot replace clinical judgement because the importance of individual scoring items is heavily influenced by the ranking of other items. Waiting times for surgery are now grossly excessive despite the use of criteria for entry to the waiting list which are very conservative by international standards. There is no equitable or clinically acceptable way to modify priorities to reduce waiting times, and institution of a booking system is impractical."
8208961,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8208961/,"PURPOSE: To better understand racial differences in data for patients referred for definitive treatment of biopsy-proved adenocarcinoma of the prostate gland.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two groups of patients were defined for further analysis. Group 1 comprised all patients who received definitive external beam irradiation of prostatic carcinoma; group 2 comprised all patients with prostatic carcinoma referred between January 1988 and December 1992 for examination at the first clinical indication of adenocarcinoma of the prostate. All patients were evaluated for age, race (black vs white), differentiation of tumor, date of diagnosis, and clinical stage.
RESULTS: In group 1, black patients were significantly younger and presented with disease at higher clinical stage but equivalent grade and survival compared with white patients. In group 2, black patients were significantly younger and had similar differentiation of tumor but with significantly higher clinical stage compared with white patients and more often had obstructive symptoms and less often had been screened for elevated prostate-specific antigen levels.
CONCLUSION: Black patients should undergo earlier screening for prostate cancer."
8214230,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8214230/,"OBJECTIVES: Knowledge of infection is essential for human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) treatment initiation and epidemic control. This study evaluates infection knowledge among infected injection drug users and acceptance of confidential testing among injection drug users, particularly those infected with HIV-1.
METHODS: A total of 810 injection drug users entering treatment in Contra Costa County, Calif, were examined. Clients were tested with unlinked (blinded) tests and simultaneously counseled and offered voluntary confidential HIV-1 antibody testing. Data on confidential testing acceptance, previous testing, drug use, and demographic information were collected.
RESULTS: Of the 810 tested, 105 (13.0%) were infected. The current confidential test was accepted by 507 (62.6%). HIV seroprevalence in the unlinked survey was four times greater than in the voluntary survey (13% and 3.5%, respectively). HIV-1 infection was associated with refusal of a confidential test largely because most infected injection drug users (n = 58; 55.2%) already knew of their infection. Of the 47 injection drug users who were not aware of their infection, 12 (25.5%) accepted the test. Although African-American injection drug users presented with a higher infection rate (37.3%), they were three times less likely to know of their infection.
CONCLUSIONS: ""In-clinic"" HIV-1 testing is highly accepted, and most infected clients in treatment will learn their status. Nevertheless, voluntary testing data are likely to yield considerable underestimates of the true rate of infection among injection drug users."
8214751,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8214751/,"BACKGROUND: A greater MAC fraction of nitrous oxide than isoflurane is required to prevent response to verbal commands and suppress the capacity to learn. Speculating that this difference between these agents may be caused by nitrous oxide's capacity to increase sympathetic activity, we tested the hypothesis that nitrous oxide may antagonize the suppression of learning found with isoflurane.
METHODS: We administered a combination of isoflurane and nitrous oxide at three subanesthetic test concentrations (0.43, 0.56, and 0.68 MAC) to 24 healthy male volunteers. Assuming additivity of the anesthetics, the first test concentration was selected to suppress learning of new information by 50% (ED50 for suppression of learning); the second concentration, to suppress the ability to respond appropriately to verbal command by 50% (MAC-awake); and the third, to provide 1.4 times MAC-awake. Three tests of learning were applied. At each test concentration, we provided 7 answers to ""trivial pursuit""-type questions, resulting in a set of 21 answered questions for each volunteer; an additional 7 unanswered questions served as controls. At the highest test concentration, each volunteer also heard two examples from each of two categories (4 words) repeated 30 times (the category-example task), and a message instructing them to touch either their nose or their ear during a specified interval in the postanesthetic interview (the behavior task).
RESULTS: The MAC-awake value for the combination of isoflurane and nitrous oxide was 118 +/- 4% of the expected value (i.e., the two anesthetics were antagonistic for this effect). Consistent with antagonism, the anesthetic concentration predicted to suppress learning by 50% permitted significantly more learning, and the ED50 was 105 +/- 2% of that predicted. Neither the category task nor the behavior task demonstrated evidence of learning at 1.4 times MAC-awake.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results are consistent with an antagonism between nitrous oxide and isoflurane; however, the degree of antagonism is small."

DESIGN/SETTING/TYPE OF PARTICIPANT: Prospective cohort of 324 head CT scans performed on 322 consecutive trauma patients at an urban children's hospital.
RESULTS: Sixty-two percent of patients were male. The mean age was 7.1 years (10 days to 20.6 years); half were less than 5 years of age. The two most frequent mechanisms of injury were falls (32%) and motor vehicle accidents (25%). Abnormalities were detected in 74 scans. Intracranial injuries were apparent in 39 patients (12%); 16 had a concomitant fracture. An isolated cranial abnormality was observed on 35 scans (11%). Loss of consciousness, amnesia for the event, a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of less than 15, and the presence of a neurologic deficit were more common in children with intracranial injury (P < .05). Vomiting, seizures, and headache were not discriminating clinical features. No single characteristic consistently identified the children with an intracranial injury. Of the 195 children who were neurologically intact (GCS, 15) at the time of presentation, 11 (5%) had evidence of intracranial pathology on CT scan.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates a poor correlation between the clinical symptoms of significant traumatic brain injury and findings on CT."
8215753,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8215753/,"BACKGROUND: The complex environment and technology of intensive care unit (ICU) care may impair the ability of patients to participate in medical decision making or give informed consent. We studied the agreement of the intuitive assessments of residents and nurses of ICU patients' cognition, judgment, and decision-making capacity, and whether those assessments agreed with abbreviated formal mental status testing.
METHODS: Using a prospective survey case study, we assessed 200 English-speaking patients within 24 hours of their ICU admission. Formal assessment of cognition, judgment, and insight was performed by a research assistant. We obtained independent intuitive ratings by nurses and residents of patient cognition, judgment, and ability to participate in medical decision making or give informed consent.
RESULTS: Residents' and nurses' assessment of cognition and judgment showed a high degree of agreement with weighted ks of greater than 0.76. Assessments of cognition by residents and nurses agreed with Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination in 70% and 73.6% of cases, respectively. Forty percent of the population had an unimpaired Mini-Mental State Examination score of greater than 23, and an additional 12% of the subjects were mildly impaired with scores of 20 to 23. When asked whether they would approach patient or family for consent for an invasive procedure, nurses and physicians said they would request informed consent from 66% and 62% of the patients, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Residents and nurses caring for patients newly admitted to the ICU agree in their assessment of cognition, judgment, and capacity to participate in medical decision making, and are not unduly influenced by ventilator status. Their assessments correlate highly with abbreviated formal mental status testing."

SETTING: Mama Yemo Hospital and University Hospital morgues in Kinshasa, and Karawa Hospital in Equateur Region, Zaïre.
METHODS: Autopsy cases with a clinical diagnosis of AIDS on the death certificate or chart were studied. Evaluation included post-mortem HIV-1 serology, chart review for specific AIDS-related symptoms and signs, and application of WHO and CDC case criteria to the clinical and autopsy diagnoses.
RESULTS: Of the 68 diagnosed AIDS cases, 98% fulfilled WHO criteria for AIDS and 93% fulfilled both WHO and CDC criteria. All cases fulfilling both criteria were HIV-1-seropositive. Opportunistic infections accounted for 84% of CDC AIDS-defining conditions. Disseminated tuberculosis was the most frequent (41%) specific diagnosis; Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia was rare (< 2%).
CONCLUSIONS: There was good concordance between WHO and CDC case definitions. A diagnosis of AIDS on the chart or death certificate is adequate for surveillance purposes in this population."

DESIGN: Prospective, nonrandomized study.
SETTING: Operating room.
PATIENTS: 9 ASA physical status I and II patients.
INTERVENTIONS: A 20-gauge radial artery catheter was placed in the wrist opposite the surgical site. Sedation with midazolam was provided, and a pulmonary artery catheter was placed through an 8.5-Fr introducer into the patient's right internal jugular vein.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Before induction of anesthesia, systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressures; heart rate; central venous pressure; systolic, diastolic, and mean pulmonary artery pressures; pulmonary capillary wedge pressure; and thermodilution cardiac output measurements were obtained. Arterial and mixed venous blood gas samples also were collected and analyzed for calculation of Qs/Qt. These hemodynamic and pulmonary parameters were measured again just before cementing of each prosthesis with methylmethacrylate cement and at 1, 5, 10, and 20 minutes after cementing. There were no statistically significant changes in any of the measured hemodynamic parameters at any time. There was no statistically significant difference in the calculated intrapulmonary shunt fraction.
CONCLUSION: In this study population, the use of methylmethacrylate for total shoulder replacement was not associated with adverse hemodynamic events or increased intrapulmonary shunting."

DESIGN: A prospective randomised controlled study.
SETTING: The antenatal clinic of a district general hospital.
SUBJECTS: One hundred and ninety-five antenatal women with pregnancies proceeding beyond 40 weeks gestation.
INTERVENTIONS: A Bishop score assessment of the cervix alone or combined with a membrane sweep, on a randomised basis.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Subsequent duration of pregnancy to the onset of spontaneous labour. The incidence of induction of labour for post-maturity.
RESULTS: Sweeping the membranes significantly reduces the subsequent duration of pregnancy, from an average of five days to two days following the procedure. The proportion of inductions of labour was 8.1% in the swept group and 18.8% in the control group. No harmful side effects to the procedure were noted.
CONCLUSIONS: Sweeping the membranes is a safe and useful procedure which results in a reduced incidence of post-mature pregnancies, and a subsequent reduction in the labour induction rate."
8217973,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8217973/,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of second trimester 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurement as a screening test for pre-eclampsia.
DESIGN: Prospective interventional study.
SETTING: John Radcliffe Maternity Hospital, Oxford, and Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital, London.
SUBJECTS: One hundred and sixty-two normotensive nulliparous women recruited at hospital booking clinics.
INTERVENTION: Ambulatory blood pressure was measured at 18 and 28 weeks gestation using the TM2420 monitor.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The development of pre-eclampsia.
RESULTS: Awake systolic and mean arterial pressures were significantly increased (P < 0.02) at 18 weeks in those who later developed pre-eclampsia. Those differences were more apparent at 28 weeks at which time the diastolic pressure was also increased (P < 0.01). At both stages of gestation the higher readings were sustained during sleep so that the awake-sleep differences were similar in relation to each outcome. The group with incipient pre-eclampsia had a significantly faster heart rate at both 18 and 28 weeks (P < 0.002) The sensitivity in predicting pre-eclampsia for a mean arterial pressure of 85 mmHg or greater at 28 weeks was 65%, with a positive predictive value of 31%. The sensitivity and positive predictive value for a test combining a mean arterial pressure of 85 mmHg or greater and a heart rate of 90 bpm or greater were 53% and 45%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Although second trimester ambulatory blood pressure is significantly increased in women who later develop pre-eclampsia, the predictive values for blood pressure alone are low. The efficiency of the test is increased by combining the awake ambulatory heart rate and blood pressure measurement together. If an effective method for preventing pre-eclampsia becomes available (commencing at 28 weeks gestation), then awake ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate may have some clinical value as a screening test."

DESIGN: A retrospective observational study.
SETTING: Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, The Royal London Hospital.
SUBJECTS: One hundred and twenty-four women admitted consecutively to the gynaecology department for surgical exploration of an adnexal mass.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The sensitivities and specificities of menopausal status, serum CA 125 level and ultrasound features, in isolation and combined (the risk of malignancy index (RMI)), for diagnosing ovarian cancer.
RESULTS: Tested on a new population of women, the RMI retained the high sensitivity for diagnosing ovarian cancer seen in the original report describing its derivation. The specificity, however, was lower. The study confirmed that the RMI is more accurate than the individual criteria in diagnosing ovarian cancer, and was comparable with other scoring systems.
CONCLUSIONS: The risk of malignancy index is a simple scoring system for ovarian cancer. Application of the risk of malignancy index in clinical practice may provide a rational basis for specialist referral of patients with ovarian cancer before diagnostic surgery."
8217977,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8217977/,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility, safety and advantages of laparoscopic hysterectomy.
DESIGN: Retrospective review.
SETTING: St. John of God Hospital, Perth, Australia.
SUBJECTS: Fifty-four women scheduled to undergo laparoscopic hysterectomy for a variety of benign gynaecological conditions.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Failure to complete the operation laparoscopically, time taken in theatre, incidence of febrile morbidity, incidence of major complications, duration of post-operative stay in hospital, interval from operation to full activity and return to work.
RESULTS: Laparoscopic hysterectomy was attempted in 54 women. A total of 53 operations were completed laparoscopically with one conversion to laparotomy because of haemorrhage. Major complications occurred in two women, both of whom required further surgery. There were four cases of febrile morbidity. The average duration of post-operative stay was four days (range 2-9), with return to normal activity in two and a half weeks and to work in three weeks.
CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic hysterectomy can be successfully achieved in most women selected for the procedure. Serious complications are inherent to some of the techniques used, but these can be overcome by modifications. Proper training and supervision in laparoscopic surgery is essential during the learning phase of the technique. There are considerable advantages to eligible women in terms of a rapid return to normal activities and work."
8947822,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8947822/,"PURPOSE: This study evaluated the efficiency of in vitro fertilization with a modified sperm preparation technique for male infertility, to avoid systematic recourse to ICSI.
METHODS: The sperm function stimulants pentoxifylline, 2-deoxyadenosine, and follicular fluid were used during the sperm preparation of IVF trials for two groups of patients: couples with long-standing infertility and previous IVF failures and couples with male-factor infertility scheduled for their first treatment.
RESULTS: Forty-nine attempts were performed in the first group. The overall fertilization rate (percentage of zygotes with two pronuclei 18 hr after sperm insemination) was 30% and the clinical pregnancy rate per transfer was 33%. For the second group, 30 attempts were performed. The fertilization rate was 29.6% and the clinical pregnancy rate was 62.5% per transfer. The total number of recovered motile sperm appears to be a significant parameter: a cutoff value of 0.25 million motile sperm recovered after capacitation treatment has a good prognostic value for choosing between IVF with sperm enhancers and ICSI.
CONCLUSIONS: The described modified IVF could constitute an alternative to the systematic use of ICSI."

However, workload in general practice has increased in recent years, raising questions about its ability to maintain, let alone extend, its educational activities.
AIM: The aim of this study was examine whether recent changes in general practice have affected delivery of practice-based undergraduate education and to assess the extent to which practices will be able to increase their involvement in teaching.
METHOD: A postal questionnaire survey was conducted of the lead clinical teachers and their partners in the practices to which students from Leicester Medical School had been attached in the last 2 years.
RESULTS: The questionnaire was completed by 32 out of the 39 lead teachers and 134 of the 150 partners, an overall response rate of 88%. There was widespread support for departmental teaching requirements, but only 17 lead teachers (44%) felt that the suggested reduction by 25% of patients seen per session while teaching was feasible. A total of 14 lead teachers (47%) felt that the ability of their practice to deliver high-quality teaching had declined since 1990. Altogether, 113 (87%) of all doctors in teaching practices felt that time pressures had increased during this period, and 139 (88%) felt that present levels of remuneration were inadequate. The majority of these doctors felt that general practice was the preferred location for learning generic clinical skills and were interested in participating. Nevertheless, most were not prepared to increase their involvement in teaching under present arrangements.
CONCLUSION: Practice-based teachers appreciate the need for quality teaching, remain enthusiastic about teaching and are, in principle, willing to take an increased teaching load. However, recent changes have made delivery of teaching more difficult, and if an expansion in practice-based teaching is to occur, more realistic levels of funding and support are a prerequisite."
8949326,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8949326/,"BACKGROUND: The growing number of specialist services being provided within primary care has lead to the argument that this will reduce the clinical threshold for referrals to these clinics.
AIM: The possibility that increasing the accessibility of primary care psychology services will reduce the threshold for referral was examined by comparing levels of psychological disturbance among patients seen by practice-based clinical psychologists with those attending outpatient clinics.
METHOD: Psychological symptoms, distress, disruption in daily life and satisfaction with life were assessed using a questionnaire-based methodology. A consecutive series of 177 patients, assessed in a local general practice or an outpatient department across a wide range of urban locations, was studied over a fixed period.
RESULTS: The study revealed equivalent levels of psychopathology within both specialist and primary care clinics. Of the overall sample, 79% were likely to merit a formal psychiatric diagnosis, relating primarily to mood disorder. Levels of subjective distress and life satisfaction were also equivalent at both service locations.
CONCLUSION: The lack of evidence for a reduction in clinical threshold for referral within the primary care sample suggests that general practitioners' referral rates are similar regardless of whether practice-based clinical psychology services are available. This has implications for primary-care-led commissioning of mental health services."
8949644,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8949644/,"BACKGROUND: Activation of circulating T lymphocytes results in expression of HLA-DR, interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R), transferrin receptor (TrR), and decreased amounts of surface CD3.
AIM: To examine the activation status of human intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) by flow cytometry.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Duodenal biopsy specimens from 12 patients provided a source of intestinal lymphocytes. Dual colour analysis was used to compare activation marker expression by IELs with peripheral blood (PB) T lymphocytes from the same patients.
RESULTS: All human IEL populations express HLA-DR and their density of expression is lower than on the small population of HLA-DR+ resting PB T lymphocytes (mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) 52.9, range 19.8-94.8 v 152.6 range, 49.1-320.3; p < 0.01). The density of CD3 was significantly reduced on IELs (MFI 465.8, range 228.7-660), compared with PB T lymphocytes (756.3, range 444.5-1573.7; p < 0.009). IL-2R was not detected on IELs; nor were the activation markers, TrR, M21 C5, or M2 B3.
CONCLUSION: HLA-DR expression on IELs together with decreased CD3 expression suggest previous stimulation. However, the absence of additional markers of T cell activation may reflect a unique pathway of activation."
8950587,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8950587/,"BACKGROUND: We conducted a prospective clinical study to elucidate the role of preoperative vitreous hemorrhage in the development of postoperative proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) in primary rhegmatogenous retinal detachment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively evaluated 409 eyes of 390 patients affected by primary rhegmatogenous retinal detachment referred before any failed attempt to reattach the retina. Single and multiple logistic regression analysis were used to test 14 categories of variables.
RESULTS: Postoperative PVR occurred in 48 (11.7% of 409 eyes). Postoperative PVR developed in 41 (11.8%) of the 347 eyes with no preoperative vitreous hemorrhage, and 7 (11.3%) of the 62 eyes with preoperative vitreous hemorrhage (P = 0.90). The results of multiple logistic regression analysis showed that only four variables were significant factors which had independently and jointly an effect on the risk of postoperative PVR: (1) 90 degrees or greater circumferential extent of the retinal tears; (2) preoperative PVR grade B; (3) preoperative PVR grade C-D; and (4) the use of cyrotreatment as the method of retinopexy.
CONCLUSION: With the surgical techniques currently used, mild preoperative vitreous hemorrhage is not an independent risk factor for postoperative PVR in primary rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. The role of moderate and severe vitreous hemorrhage remains to be fully evaluated in a larger series of eyes."
8951132,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8951132/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine if combining two commonly used methods or cervical ripening (intracervical prostaglandin E2 [Pge2] gel and Foley balloon catheter) would result in a higher number of successful inductions and fewer cesarean sections when compared to PGE2 gel alone.
STUDY DESIGN: Seventy-eight patients with unfavorable cervixes eligible for induction of labor were prospectively randomized to receive either one dose (0.5 mg) of PGE2 gel followed by insertion of a 24-French Foley catheter (group 1, 41 patients) or two doses of 0.5 mg of intracervical gel (group 2, 37 patients). Outcome parameters included change in Bishop score, number of failed inductions, rate of cesarean section, rate of uterine hyperstimulation and postpartum infection.
RESULTS: Patients in group 1 had a significant increase in posttreatment Bishop scores (7.26 +/- 2.0 SD vs. 4.82 +/- 1.8 P = .0001) and fewer failed inductions (0 vs. 6, P = .009) when compared to patients in group 2. Abdominal delivery rates, uterine hyperstimulation and infections complications were not different between the two groups.
CONCLUSION: The combination of the Foley balloon and prostaglandin gel significantly improved the Bishop score and led to fewer failed inductions, although it did not increase the vaginal delivery rate."
8951140,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8951140/,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of early tubal transfer procedures, we compared outcomes of transcervical gamete intrafallopian transfer (TC-GIFT) and transcervical zygote intrafallopian transfer (TC-ZIFT) versus in vitro fertilization/embryo transfer during the first two years of our assisted reproduction (AR) program.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, nonrandomized, concurrent, controlled comparison of TC-GIFT and TC-ZIFT pregnancy outcomes versus those after IVF-ET. All cycles for patients less than age 39 undergoing transfer of at least three viable oocytes, zygotes or embryos in the first two years of our program were included. Patients with normal fallopian tubes underwent TC-GIFT (n = 9) or TC-ZIFT (n = 12), whereas those with tubal compromise underwent IVF-ET (n = 28).
RESULTS: Implantation rates were 4.2% for TC-ZIFT, 2.8% for TC-GIFT and 3.7% for combined TC procedures as compared to 7.4% for IVF-ET. Delivery rates were no different for the TC procedures than the IVF-ET procedures (14%). Patients ages, number of oocytes retrieved and number transferred were comparable between the TC and IVF-ET groups.
CONCLUSION: TC-GIFT and TC-ZIFT did not enhance the pregnancy outcome as compared to IVF-ET in the first two years of our AR program. Ultrasound-directed tubal catheterization is harder to learn and more difficult and expensive to perform than simple uterine embryo transfer. Since we could not demonstrate an improved outcome for TC transfers even in a new AR program, IVF-ET and laparoscopic GIFT are now our procedures of choice."
8951209,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8951209/,"BACKGROUND: We report experience with patients presenting with a specific combination of symptoms: unilateral sciatica, unilateral sensibility loss in the dermatomes S1 to S5 (hemi-saddle) and subjective micturation problems secondary to ruptured lumbar disc. Because of its similarities with a cauda equina syndrome, this combination of symptoms was thought to be a unilateral cauda equina syndrome and it was called hemi-cauda equina syndrome. Consequently, it was treated as an emergency.
METHODS: Ten patients were evaluated. They compromised 2.3% of all patients undergoing lumbar discectomy.
RESULTS: Outcome is good with only 10% persisting minor neurologic deficit (sensibility loss in dermatomes S3 to S5). With the exception of urinary retention or incontinence, duration of symptoms and signs does not seem to influence outcome. Comparing signs, symptoms and radiographic findings with those of a cauda equina syndrome which were recently and thoroughly studied, they were found to be more severe in cases of cauda equina syndrome. Especially, the good outcome, (apparently unrelated to the duration of symptoms in cases of hemi-cauda equina syndrome) contrasted with the treatment results of cauda equina syndrome.
CONCLUSIONS: We defined the hemi-cauda equina syndrome from ruptured disc as a combination of unilateral leg pain, unilateral sensibility loss in dermatomes S1 to S5 and sphincter paralysis (proven urinary retention or incontinence). Motor deficit is not necessarily present. Emergency surgery is warranted. Patients presenting with micturation complaints other than urinary retention or incontinence do not suffer from a hemi-cauda equina syndrome."
8951759,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8951759/,"PURPOSE: To determine whether acute cervical spine injury represents a risk factor for complications from prophylactic placement of current generation Greenfield inferior vena cava (IVC) filters.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review performed during a 7-year period identified 11 patients with acute cervical spinal cord injuries who underwent prophylactic Greenfield IVC filter insertion. Specific complications evaluated included symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE), migration, filter base diameter changes, caval perforation, and thrombosis. The amount of migration and changes in filter base dimension were compared statistically with a control population of IVC filter patients (n = 16) without cervical spine injuries.
RESULTS: Filter migration (> 10 mm) was the most common complication (46%). Migration usually is caudally directed (64%), may occur early (36% moved > 10 mm within a 30-day period), and is often asymptomatic. The prevalence of filter migration greater than 30 mm was 27%. The average amount of migration for the subpopulation under study was greater than that seen with the control population (P < .05). No statistically significant change in filter base size occurred. The study population also had rates of PE (9%-18%), caval perforation (9%), and IVC thrombus formation (18%) that were higher than the rates in historical controls. The majority of patients with these complications received vigorous pulmonary toilet (46%), including ""quad coughs"" or cardiopulmonary resuscitation (18%).
CONCLUSIONS: Acute cervical spinal cord injury and the associated supportive care may be associated with an increased risk for caudal IVC filter migration, IVC perforation, caval thrombosis, and PE."

CASE REPORT: A 16 year-old boy presented with fibrous skin hypertrophy of proximal interphalangeal joint areas of both hands suggestive of pachydermodactyly. Skin biopsy confirmed the fibromatous nature of hypertrophy. The personal history of the child confirmed that pachydermocactyly was due to compulsive rubbing stretching movements in a patient with psychological troubles.
CONCLUSIONS: Pachydermodactyly, mainly observed among male teenagers, must be considered as an induced dermatosis and distinguished from primary fibromatosis."

The aim of this study was to evaluate maternal beliefs concerning neonatal performances, to compare them with currently accepted knowledge and to analyse parameters that could influence the maternal judgement.
POPULATION AND METHODS: A total of 189 mothers in the postpartum period were prospectively questioned about their beliefs concerning the developmental visual, auditive, olfactive, gustative and sensitive functions of their neonates.
RESULTS: Only 57.7% of mothers agreed with the fact that their neonates were able to see. Similarly, there were more than 80% for the olfactive and gustative function and more than 90% for the auditive function and pain discrimination. Multiparity and high level of professional activities improved the mothers' answers about the visual abilities of their neonates. Scientific information through media appeared poorly assimilated.
CONCLUSIONS: The time spent by the mothers in the maternity home or word could be used to inform them."
8953957,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8953957/,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: Two widely used formulas for calculating the number of practicing emergency physicians (EPs) are based on the total number of US emergency departments and patient visits. In this study we hypothesized that the number of physicians now working in EDs is significantly greater than the estimates yielded by these formulas. Therefore we attempted to determine the accuracy of these methods for predicting the true number of practicing EPs. We also examined the training, board certification, and distribution of EPs.
METHODS: The EDs of all hospitals listed by the Missouri Hospital Association (MHA), excluding children's and psychiatric hospitals, were surveyed over a 9-month period in 1994 with regard to the number and board status of all physicians practicing in their EDs and the numbers of full-time equivalents (FTEs) required for adequate staffing. These numbers were compared with 1994 estimates for Missouri based on two common methods of calculation.
RESULTS: Of 134 hospitals with EDs, 118 (88%) completed our survey. These EDs employed 458 full-time EPs and 690 part-time EPs, with 41% and 7% board-certified in emergency medicine, respectively. Board-certified emergency physicians were concentrated in large cities and at university hospitals and were sparsely represented in rural areas. Adequate staffing of these EDs required 677 FTEs, compared with estimates of 358 (formula A) and 555 (formula B). Previously published formulas underestimate the need for EPs in our state by 47% (formula A) or 18% (formula B).
CONCLUSION: Current staffing estimates regarding EPs working in Missouri greatly underestimate actual staffing needs. Board-certified EPs are in severe shortage and are unequally distributed in Missouri. Extrapolated nationally, these estimates may negatively affect funding and available residency positions for emergency medicine."

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey in a public ED to determine self-reported ED visits over the preceding 3 months. The study group comprised consecutive ambulatory patients (N = 1,049) with nonemergency medical problems.
RESULTS: Blacks, whites, and Hispanics were equally likely to report one or more visits to an ED in the 3 months before study enrollment. Blacks were the most likely to report two or more ED visits in the preceding 3 months (19.0%), followed by whites (13.5%) and Hispanics (11.4%) (P = .01; unadjusted odds ratio, 1.82 for blacks versus Hispanics). In multivariate analysis, older age (P < .001), health insurance coverage (P < .001), regular source of care (P < .001), and difficulty obtaining transportation to a physician's office (P = .011) were positively associated with two or more previous ED visits. After adjustment for these variables, race/ethnicity was not significantly associated with ED use (P = .23; adjusted odds ratio for blacks versus Hispanics, 1.48 [95% confidence interval, .95 to 2.30]).
CONCLUSION: Race/ethnicity was not an important determinant of ED use after adjustment for age, health insurance coverage, regular source of care, and barriers to health care. Population-based studies of ED use should be conducted to further evaluate whether racial/ethnic differences in ED use exist that are not explained by differences in demographics, health, socioeconomic status, access to care, or other determinants of ED use."
8954002,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8954002/,"OBJECTIVES: To assess nighttime and daytime sleep patterns in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome and to examine the effects of weight change on excessive daytime sleepiness in patients with this disorder.
DESIGN: Case series (within-subject design).
SETTING: A university sleep disorders center.
PATIENTS: Eight patients (5 males and 3 females), ranging in age from 5.5 to 21 years, who met the diagnostic criteria for Prader-Willi syndrome.
INTERVENTIONS: Overnight sleep polysomnographic recording and daytime Multiple Sleep Latency Test. Four of the 8 patients were restudied after their weight had changed.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in the sleep disordered breathing rate and Multiple Sleep Latency Test measures.
RESULTS: Sleep-disordered breathing occurred in all patients and was principally characterized by obstructive hypoventilation or episodes of apnea that occurred primarily during rapid eye movement sleep. After weight reduction, 3 patients had respiratory values that were within the broad normal range (disordered breathing rate, < 15 breaths per hour). Statistically significant (P < .05) weight loss effects occurred during nonrapid eye movement sleep (decrease with weight loss, F = 6.243). Excessive daytime sleepiness was documented in 6 of 7 patients who completed the Multiple Sleep Latency Test. Excessive daytime sleepiness was not consistently correlated with body weight or any of the nocturnal sleep variables.
CONCLUSIONS: A sleep-related breathing disorder occurred during rapid eye movement and nonrapid eye movement sleep and improved with weight change in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome, emphasizing the importance of weight reduction in clinical management. However, excessive daytime sleepiness persisted despite a reduction in sleep-disordered breathing after weight loss, suggesting a primary disturbance of sleep. Our findings provide additional support for the view that primary hypersomnia is a characteristic feature of the Prader-Willi syndrome."
8955469,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8955469/,"OBJECTIVE: To give standards for quantification of the magnitude of waist circumference in children.
METHODS: We calculated the percentiles of waist circumference by age and sex from a sample of 2858 subjects (1440 males and 1418 females, aged 6-14 years). Data were from a population survey of 15,000 school-children in Pescara, a town in Abruzzo, a region of Central Italy.
RESULTS: We reported the values of the calculated percentiles by age and sex and gave the smoothed percentile curves.
CONCLUSIONS: Some recent studies in adults have indicated that measuring waist circumference seems to be the simplest way to estimate obesity and the risk of cardiovascular disease. In children, similar evidence is emerging. To date, no example of calculating standards has been published for quantitating the magnitude of waist circumference in children; therefore, our example of standard waist measurements could be used as a practical model for selecting subjects with a value of < or = or > 2 SD from the mean. The metabolic status should then be checked by complementary laboratory examination."
8956388,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8956388/,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: It is often considered that essential thrombocythemia contraindicates placement of an epidural catheter because of the danger of epidural hematoma. Thromboelastography offers a possible means of determining the appropriateness of epidural analgesia in a patient with this disorder.
METHODS: A pregnant woman with essential thrombocythemia and a history of spontaneous abortions was evaluated by thromboelastography at 38 weeks of gestation to determine the safety of using epidural analgesia for labor pain management. On the basis of the thermoelastography findings, the patient was given epidural analgesia with bupivacaine and fentanyl during her labor.
RESULTS: The patient experienced good pain relief, delivered a healthy infant vaginally, and suffered no complications.
CONCLUSIONS: Thromboelastography may be a useful diagnostic test in determining the suitability of regional techniques for labor analgesia in parturients with essential thrombocythemia. However, success in one patient does not prove the general safety of this approach."
8956396,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8956396/,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The amide-type local anesthetic articaine is unique in that hydrolysis to articainic acid by serum esterases is its main metabolic pathway. The purpose of the present investigation was to study the concentration dependence of this pathway in vitro.
METHODS: To unbuffered (pH 8.2) as well as phosphate-buffered (pH 7.4) heated serum samples were added various amounts of articaine in the range 10-300 micrograms/mL. Concentrations of articaine and articainic acid were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography after incubating the samples at 37 degrees C for intervals ranging from 5 minutes to 6 hours after addition of articaine.
RESULTS: The in vitro metabolism of articaine was shown to undergo pH-dependent Michaelis-Menten kinetics, indicating saturation at higher substrate concentrations. The Michaelis constant K(m) was determined as 175 micrograms/mL and 22.1 micrograms/mL and the maximum reaction rate Vmax as 2.1 micrograms/mL/min and 0.17 microgram/mL/min at pH 8.2 and pH 7.2, respectively. These results support previous in vivo observations that suggest saturable articaine metabolism, indicated by higher articaine/articainic acid metabolic ratio with higher articaine concentrations in alveolar blood after dental extraction.
CONCLUSION: Local saturation of the serum esterases may contribute to the advantageous relationship between persistence of the local anesthetic effect and low systemic toxicity caused by the last systemic elimination of articaine (ie, its wide toxic therapeutic ratio)."
8956702,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8956702/,"OBJECTIVE: To compare opinion of surgical inpatients with the conclusions of the report of the Nuffield Council on Bioethics regarding the ownership and uses of human tissue.
DESIGN: Survey of results of questionnaires completed by patients.
SETTING: Large teaching hospital.
SUBJECTS: 384 postoperative adult surgical patients.
RESULTS: There was strong support among patients for the use of tissues in medical education, research, and science with the exception of those tissues which may transmit disease to others. Few patients (39; 10%) believed that they retained ownership of tissue removed at surgery. Most believed that the tissue belonged to the hospital (103; 27%), to nobody (103; 27%), or to the laboratory (77; 20%). Most patients had not been given any information about the possible uses of their tissues after removal.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgical inpatients seem to endorse the conclusions of the Nuffield report regarding the ownership and uses of human tissue. The recommendations regarding patient information and consent procedures should be implemented at the earliest opportunity."

8956742,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8956742/,"BACKGROUND: An increase in the incidence of oral cancer among patients younger than 40 years has been reported worldwide. It has been suggested that the disease behaves more aggressively among young people.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical and biologic behavior of tongue cancer among younger patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data on all patients younger than 40 years in whom tongue cancer was diagnosed in Finland between 1980 and 1989 (34 cases) were collected; pertinent clinical data were available for risk factor screening. A follow-up of at least 5 years or until death was available for all 34 patients. Immunocytochemical staining techniques were used to assess the expression of p53 and bcl-2 proteins, and p53 mutation analysis was performed by using the nonradioactive single-strand conformation polymorphism technique.
RESULTS: The incidence of tongue cancer in this age group in Finland did not change during the study period. The clinical behavior of tongue cancer in young people was not more aggressive compared with that of older patients in general, with the overall 5-year survival being as good as 70.6%. Altogether, p53 mutations were found in 17 of 33 tumors (51.5%). The p53 and bcl-2 protein expression was strong or moderate in 33.3% and 30.3% of the samples, respectively. Intense p53 protein expression was associated with the larger tumor size (P < .05). The poorest prognosis was found in patients with tumors greater than 4 cm in diameter (P = .01) or moderately or poorly differentiated cancer (P = .01). There was a trend for the adverse prognosis to accumulate in patients with moderately or poorly differentiated carcinoma and mutations in p53 (P = .09).
CONCLUSIONS: The cause of tongue cancer in patients younger than 40 years seems to be multifactorial. Those patients had a similar clinical course, prognosis, and function of p53 as found in the reports of a normal age variation. Mutations of p53 seemed to be an additional prognostic marker that was associated with moderate or poor differentiation of the tumors."
8956955,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8956955/,"OBJECTIVE: To study how the information gained from axillary dissection in women (75 years old or more) with breast cancer influenced postoperative adjuvant treatment.
DESIGN: Retrospective review of casenotes.
SETTING: University departments of surgery and oncology, Sweden.
SUBJECTS: 166 women (aged 75 years or more) operated on for primary breast cancer between 1980-1989.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Type of operation and postoperative therapy given.
RESULTS: In 138/166 (83%) women axillary dissection was done, but in only 21/59 (36%) of these patients did information gained from the procedure influence the postoperative treatment according to the treatment guidelines for breast cancer. None of the 28 patients who did not undergo axillary dissection were subjected to further operations or radiotherapy for axillary nodal recurrence after a mean follow up of 47 months.
CONCLUSIONS: Axillary dissection should be reserved for local control of disease and for those patients who preoperatively agree to undergo postoperative irradiation or chemotherapy if metastases are found."

Solitary brain metastases from NSCLC have been resected with 5-year survivals of 10% to 30%. The objective of this study was to determine if resection of isolated adrenal metastases improves survival.
METHODS: Isolated adrenal metastases were found in 14 patients with NSCLC. Eight patients had resection after cis-platinum-based chemotherapy, and 6 received chemotherapy alone.
RESULTS: Median survival in the surgical group was significantly greater than that in the chemotherapy group (31 versus 8.5 months; p = 0.03). All patients in the chemotherapy group were dead by 22 months. Three-year actuarial survival in the surgical group was 38%. No difference in locoregional stage, size of adrenal metastases, patient age, or performance status was present between the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term disease-free survival is possible after resection of isolated adrenal metastases from NSCLC. Resection of isolated adrenal metastases should be considered if the primary NSCLC is resectable."
8957465,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8957465/,"BACKGROUND: Extragastric lymphadenectomy (D2 node dissection) is strongly supported by Japanese data to have survival benefit. Randomized trial data are either inconclusive or nonsupportive of this view. We have reviewed a prospectively gathered database of 18,346 cases of gastric carcinoma from a gastric cancer patient care evaluation study conducted by the American College of Surgeons to assess whether the performance of extragastric node dissection was associated with improved survival in patients who had resection with curative intent (all margins microscopically clear).
STUDY DESIGN: We reviewed a subgroup of patients with curatively resected gastric carcinoma and compared the outcome in patients having extragastric lymph node dissection with the outcome in patients who did not have dissection of N2 nodes.
RESULTS: Among the 3,804 patients having curative resection in the long-term study with more than a five-year follow-up, 695 had dissection of the nodes along the celiac axis, hepatic artery, or splenic artery (N2 nodes); 1,529 patients had removal of the adjacent nodes (N1 nodes) along the gastric tube or the gastric or perigastric nodes (N1 nodes); and 903 patients who had no nodes identified in the resection specimen (essentially N0 nodes removed). For patients having a dissection of N2 nodes, the median survival time was 19.7 months with a five-year survival rate of 26.3 percent; for patients having a dissection of N1 nodes, the median survival time was 24.8 months with a five-year survival rate of 30 percent; among patients having no nodes removed, the median survival time was 29.5 months with a five-year survival rate of 35.6 percent.
CONCLUSIONS: Lymph node dissection (D2) of N2 nodes did not augment survival compared with gastrectomy without node dissection or that included perigastric nodes in the resection. Subgroup analysis of patients with gastric carcinoma having a curative resection did not show benefit of the extragastric node dissection (D2). Continued study is warranted and the data from ongoing clinical trials may yield more conclusive information."
8957495,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8957495/,"BACKGROUND: Surgical excision of gastrinomas in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) decreases the incidence of hepatic metastases, but long-term biochemical cures are achieved in fewer than 30% of cases. A growing number of patients have persistent or recurrent disease after initial operation. The effect of reoperation in these patients has not been previously reported.
METHODS: From December 1982 to August 1995, 120 patients with ZES underwent operation for gastrinoma resection. Seventy-eight patients had recurrent or persistent ZES after operation; 17 patients underwent 18 reoperations. After initial operation all patients underwent yearly functional and imaging studies. If a tumor was unequivocally imaged, reexploration was done.
RESULTS: Five patients, all with sporadic disease, were disease free after operation, with a median follow-up of 28 months. Tumor was found in all 18 reoperations and resected in 17. In patients with continuing disease-free intervals, locations of gastrinomas included pancreatic head lymph nodes (three), liver metastasis (one), and pancreatic tail lymph node (one). There were no deaths in the cured group; two patients in the group with persistent disease have died (median follow-up, 34 months).
CONCLUSIONS: Reoperation for gastrinoma excision resulted in elimination of disease in 30% of patients and should be considered for patients with imageable disease."
8957498,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8957498/,"BACKGROUND: Since the introduction of laparoscopic adrenalectomy there has been major concern about proper indications for its use, including in pheochromocytoma. In this study we reviewed pheochromocytomas resected by means of laparoscopy to establish that procedure's usefulness.
METHODS: Between January 1992 and June 1995, 90 laparoscopic adrenalectomies were performed in 82 patients. Three to five trocars were used intraperitoneally in each patient to remove the gland, and extraction was performed with a sterile plastic bag.
RESULTS: Twenty-three pheochromocytomas were operated on. Six patients had a bilateral adrenalectomy. Pheochromocytomas were significantly larger than other tumors, required more operating time, and necessitated longer hospital stays in patients. Of all the intraoperative complications 87% occurred in the pheochromocytoma group; 67% of all postoperative complications occurred in this group. In four patients metastasis from pheochromocytoma to the liver was unexpectedly found, and in one case metastasis from a medullary thyroid carcinoma was found. There has been no local recurrence after laparoscopic adrenalectomy.
CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic adrenalectomy for pheochromocytomas is difficult because tumors are larger and more complications are seen related to their hormonal secretions, in spite of adequate pharmacologic blockade. However, metastatic extensions can be diagnosed and laparoscopic ablation can be performed in most instances without recurrence. It is not, therefore, a contraindication for this approach."

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of hours spent in the ED was made at a university hospital teaching ED for treat-and-release patients in 4 clinical categories: chest pain, asthma exacerbation, sickle-cell crisis, and seizure. The average hours per patient spent in the ED during the 4-month intervals before (August-November 1993) and after (August-November 1994) the establishment of the short-stay medicine unit were compared. Data were analyzed using the 2-tailed, unpaired t-test.
RESULTS: This short-stay inpatient medicine unit received on average 135 patients per month from the ED, with an average length of stay of 2.4 days. The mean (+/-SD) number of admitted patients per day waiting in the ED > 8 hours for an inpatient bed dropped from 9.6 +/- 4.2., before the institution of this unit, to 2.3 +/- 2.6. There was a significant reduction in the average number of hours spent in the ED by treat-and-release patients with chest pain (from 7.3 +/- 6.0 to 5.5 +/- 4.8 hr/patient, p < 0.001) and asthma exacerbation (from 5.0 +/- 3.6 to 4.2 +/- 2.9 hr/patient, p < 0.05), but not with sickle-cell crisis or seizure, after the implementation of the short-stay unit.
CONCLUSION: Reducing the number of admitted patients waiting in the ED for inpatients beds, in this case by establishment of a short-stay medicine unit, is associated with a decrease in the interval that treat-and-release patients spend in the ED."
8960949,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8960949/,"UNLABELLED: The aim of this study was to compare findings on coronary intravascular ultrasound and thallium-201 SPECT in patients following orthotopic heart transplantation.
BACKGROUND: No data are available on whether pathological thallium scintigraphic findings in heart recipients are based on coronary vessel wall alterations identifiable by intravascular ultrasound.
METHODS: 29 patients (mean age: 50.9 +/- 11.5 years; male n = 23) were investigated by means of intravascular ultrasound of selected coronary segments and thallium-201 myocardial SPECT. Patients were investigated 11.6 +/- 5.4 weeks post transplantation, a subgroup of 13 patients was re-investigated 70.2 +/- 18.4 weeks following transplantation. A total of 214 cross-sectional areas of the left coronary artery were examined using a 3.5 French intravascular ultrasound catheter to measure intimal index and the circumferential extension of a three-layer appearance of the vessel wall. Shortly after catheterisation, an ergometric stress-test was performed to examine all recipients by means of thallium-201 SPECT. In each patient, 20 segments of the left ventricle were evaluated using a score system of differentiate between persistent defects, redistribution, and reverse redistribution. A score was developed that measured the degree of inhomogeneity and severity of perfusion defects, respectively. Findings on scintigraphy were correlated to coronary intravascular ultrasound findings.
RESULTS: At first investigation, mean intimal index of all evaluated coronary cross-sectional areas was 0.06 +/- 0.1. Sixty-four cross-sectional areas demonstrated a three-layer appearance of the vessel wall, mean circumferential extension was 72 +/- 122 degrees. Thallium scintigraphy demonstrated a total of 336 (40%) pathological left ventricular segments; 168 (20%) were regarded as permanent defects, 67 (8%) demonstrated redistribution and 101 (12%) showed reverse redistribution. The score of inhomogeneity was calculated as 5.8% +/- 2.6%. In the subgroup of patients at the follow-up study, the score was 6.4 +/- 2.8%. There was no correlation between intimal index and the score, nor could any correlation be confirmed between the score and the circumferential extension of a three-layer appearance of the vessel wall. At second investigation, no significant differences of intimal index (0.05 +/- 0.07) or circumferential extension of a three-layer appearance of the vessel wall (74 +/- 118 degrees) could be confirmed. The score was slightly, but significantly increased to 8.1 +/- 4.5% at the second investigation (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Early after orthotopic heart transplantation, pathologic thallium distribution patterns of the left ventricle could be observed. These pathological patterns did not correlate with the extent of diffuse coronary vessel wall alterations identifiable by intravascular ultrasound. After more than 1 year, the degree of scintigraphic abnormalities increased significantly, not accompanied by an increase of diffuse coronary vessel wall alterations."
8961119,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8961119/,"OBJECTIVES: To study the accuracy of reviewing ward notes (chart review) as a measure of the quality of care rendered to patients with ""Do Not Resuscitate"" (DNR) orders.
DESIGN: We reviewed the charts of 19 consecutive, competent inpatients with DNR orders for evidence that the staff addressed a broad range of patient care needs called Concurrent Care Concerns (CCCs), such as withholding treatments other than resuscitation itself, and attention to patient comfort needs. We then interviewed the patient, consultant physician, house officer, and primary nurse and compared the ward notes with the understandings of these staff members.
SETTING: The medical service of an urban university medical centre.
RESULTS: The average number of documented CCCs addressed per DNR order was 1.1. The ward notes generally agreed with the perceptions of patients, house officers, and nurses (% agreement with notes = 79%, 77%, and 82%; kappa = 0.43, 0.40, 0.50). Consultant physicians' understandings were poorly reflected in the ward notes (% agreement = 59%; kappa = 0.18). They overestimated attention to CCCs compared with the notes (P < 0.0001) and with other observers (P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Chart review for attention to CCCs accurately reflects the understandings of patients, house officers, and nurses, but consultant physicians report more attention to CCCs than is recorded in the ward notes or understood by other observers. Better communication regarding end-of-life care plans should be encouraged."
8961204,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8961204/,"OBJECTIVE: to give a comprehensive description of the practice of outpatient cardiac rehabilitation in Scotland.
DESIGN: an identifying survey of 1,270 individuals in hospital, general practice and community sources nationally, followed by computer-assisted telephone interviews about programme characteristics with key personnel from identified cardiac rehabilitation schemes.
OUTCOME MEASURES: patient provision, referral criteria and programme features.
RESULTS: 65 programmes provided outpatient cardiac rehabilitation for 4,980 patients in one year, representing 17% of the 29,180 patients who survived admission to hospital with coronary heart disease. Cardiac rehabilitation practice varied widely: 53 (82%) programmes included exercise, although only 19 (29%) at the most beneficial level; 40 (62%) included relaxation training, although only three (5%) at a level shown to give benefit; 47 (72%) included education, although only 16 (25%) in a manner with reported benefits in randomised trials.
CONCLUSIONS: outpatient cardiac rehabilitation was provided to a minority of patients with coronary heart disease. Programmes varied widely, and were often more limited than those reporting mortality and morbidity benefits in randomised trials. There is a substantial gap between current provision and practice of cardiac rehabilitation and that advocated in published guidelines."
8961444,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8961444/,"STUDY DESIGN: A finite element model of a lumbar motion segment was constructed.
OBJECTIVES: The model was directed toward understanding the effect of compression, bending and twisting, and diurnal fluid changes in the disc on the propensity to disc prolapse. Tensile stresses in the anulus fibers were computed and used to determine the successive steps required to create a fissure in the disc.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Disc prolapse is more likely under combined loading involving compression and bending and twisting. Changes in fluid content in the disc also affect the mechanical behavior of the disc.
METHODS: The three-dimensional model accounted for the viscoelastic material properties of the anulus fibers and ligaments. Diurnal fluid exchange was simulated by changing the fluid content in the nucleus of the disc. Combined with bending and twisting, a compressive load was applied at different loading rates.
RESULTS: The maximum tensile stress in the anulus fibers always occurred in the fibers at the inner posterior anulus at the junction of the disc and the endplate. Of the three models tested, the ""weakest"" (or the first to fail) was the saturated disc subjected to compression and bending and twisting. As the loading rate increased, anulus fiber failure was initiated at a lower value of compressive load. An increasing compressive load applied to a flexed, twisted, and saturated disc resulted in progressive failure, or fissure propagation, starting at the posterior inner anulus at the junction of the disc and the endplate.
CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study suggest that there are several key factors involved in the initiation and propagation of anulus failure: axial compressive load, bending and twisting, and disc saturation. If one of these is lacking, anulus failure is harder to achieve."
8961448,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8961448/,"STUDY DESIGN: A prospective study of psychological risk factors for first-time low back pain with repeated use of psychological questionnaires.
OBJECTIVES: To measure the reproducibility of scores from psychological questionnaires, and to compare this with changes that follow an individual's first attack of back pain. Secondly, to determine which scores predict first-time back pain.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: ""Abnormal"" psychometric scores are associated with several aspects of back pain behavior. Little is known, however, about their reproducibility or long-term stability, and there has been no definitive answer to the question: which comes first, ""abnormal"" scores or low back pain?
METHODS: 403 volunteers with no history of ""serious"" low back pain (defined as pain requiring medical attention or absence from work) participated in a functional spinal assessment. At the time of initial assessment and at 6-month intervals thereafter, the volunteers completed the following questionnaires: the Health Locus of Control, which was subdivided into three sections labelled ""Internal,"" ""Powerful others,"" and ""Chance""; the Modified Somatic Perception Questionnaire; and the Zung depression scale. Scores from the Modified Somatic Perception Questionnaire and from the Zung depression scale were added to form a measure of psychological distress. Additional questionnaires inquired about any back pain experienced in the previous 6 months. Only three volunteers had left the study at the 18-month follow-up. At that time 162 participants had reported ""any"" low back pain, of which 79 were ""serious.""
RESULTS: Intraclass correlation coefficients for scores repeated after 6 months ranged from 0.67-0.80, and reproducibility of scores was equally high between the 0-, 6-, 12- and 18-month assessments. None of the scores were affected by ""any"" low back pain, and only the Modified Somatic Perception Questionnaire scores changed after ""serious"" back pain was reported. In a multivariate analysis, the most significant predictor of first time ""serious"" or ""any"" back pain was a history of non-""serious"" back pain (P < 0.001). Of the psychological factors, the sum of Modified Somatic Perception Questionnaire scores and Zung questionnaire scores was the best predictor of ""serious"" back pain (P = 0.037), and the Modified Somatic Perception Questionnaire score was the best predictor of ""any"" back pain (P = 0.002). The 25% of participants with the highest sum of scores from the Modified Somatic Perception Questionnaire and Zung questionnaire was 2.7 times more likely to develop ""serious"" back pain than the 25% with the lowest sum of these scores. Nevertheless, after accounting for the affects of a history of non-""serious"" back pain, psychometric scores predicted less than an additional 3% of reported back pain.
CONCLUSIONS: The scores from the Modified Somatic Perception Questionnaire and Zung questionnaire were reproducible over 18 months and were affected little by first episodes of back pain; yet these scores were significant predictors of it. ""Abnormal"" scores from these questionnaires precede back pain in a small number of people."
8963843,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8963843/,"INTRODUCTION: Thoracoscopic treatment of pleural empyema is still a controversial method, especially in the chronic stage of the disease. The issue is raised whether the thoracoscopic approach to the empyema-possibly combined with a small additional thoracotomy in advanced stages-is successful and of low risk.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1993 and May 1995 we treated 13 patients in advanced stages of pleural empyema. The patients were all seriously ill and had severe underlying disease. The procedures were performed under general anesthesia involving intubation with a double-lumen endotracheal tube. The steps of our standard operative procedure are outlined.
RESULTS: In 5 patients with a pleural empyema in stage III thoracoscopy was facilitated by a small additional thoracotomy. A complete resolution of the disease was obtained in 12 cases and a secondary intervention was necessary in 1 patient. There was no peri- or postoperative mortality, and apart from a prolonged drainage of the pleural cavity in 3 patients no morbidity was registered. In the long-term follow up, 3 patients had died. There was no correlation between the deaths and the intervention or the empyema disease.
DISCUSSION: We discuss the advantages of a limited additional thoracotomy in case of intraoperative difficulties encountered with late stages of empyema. This treatment can still be considered minimally invasive. All patients tolerated the procedure well, and the overall results were favourable in 92% of our collective. However, thoracoscopic treatment should preferably take place at an earlier stage.
CONCLUSION: We recommend the thoracoscopic approach-possibly combined with a limited thoracotomy-as primary treatment in late stages of pleural empyema."
8963854,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8963854/,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the benefit of measuring the intraocular pressure (IOP) on the first postoperative day after argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 407 ALT procedures with perioperative apraclonidine performed on 226 patients between January 1991 and December 1993. Data analyzed included type of glaucoma, extent of treatment, whether the procedure was initial or repeat, laser parameters, and IOP preoperatively and at 1 hour, 1 day, and 1 month postoperatively.
RESULTS: The percentage of patients with an IOP rise of greater than 3 mm Hg at 1 hour, 1 day, and 1 month following ALT was 11.3%, 4.2%, and 5.2% respectively. The incidence of IOP elevations greater than 10 mm Hg was 2.2%, 1.0%, and 1.5% at 1 hour, 1 day and 1 month, respectively. Of 17 cases with an IOP elevation greater than 3 mm Hg at 1 day, four eventually required a trabeculectomy. However, there were no consistent factors that distinguished which cases with elevated IOP at 1 day ultimately needed further therapy, nor did the 1-day postoperative examination predict which patients would have IOP elevation at 1 month.
CONCLUSION: IOP 1 day after ALT is rarely elevated and does not correlate with IOP elevation at 1 month. Therefore, an IOP check at 1 day is not felt to be necessary for most patients."
8964072,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8964072/,"BACKGROUND: Free radicals cause lipid peroxidation, damage cell membranes and DNA. At present attention is paid to the relationship between extracorporeal methods of blood clearance, free radicals and the antioxidant system. The objective of the present study was to ascertain the effect of membrane plasmapheresis (PF) on the antioxidant defence of the organism and whether it has an impact on lipid peroxidation.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with inflammatory polyneuropathy (n = 7), pemphigus (n = 1) and pulmonary fibrosis (n = 1) were subjected to 3 PF each (apparatus Fresenius 2008 PF, filter Plasmaflux P2S). The following were assessed: superoxide dismutase activity (SOD) in red blood cells, the antioxidant capacity (AOK) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in plasma, glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx and selenium (Se) in blood, AOK, MDA and Se in the filtrate. The values were compared with those of 43 healthy volunteers using the t-test, changes of parameters during PF, using Wilcoxon's paired test. The baseline SOD, GSHPx, AOK and MDA values of patients did not differ from those of controls. SOD did not change in the course of PF. GSHPx declined during the 30th minute of PF and after PF (44.3 +/- 16.9 U/g, haemoglobin before vs. 37.5 +/- 12.2 during the 30th minute, p < 0.01, 36.7 +/- 14.6 after PF, p < 0.01). AOK rose during the 30th minute (p < 0.01) and after PF (p < 0.01). MDA after PF declined (p < 0.05). The baseline Se was higher than in controls (132.9 +/- 43.2 micrograms/l vs. 90.5 +/- 17.3, p < 0.01), after PF Se declined (100.1 +/- 28.3, p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: The authors did not provide evidence of increased lipid peroxidation during PF. During PF the GSHPx activity declines, most probably due to Se losses. The decline of GSHPx involves the risk of deterioration of hydrogen peroxide elimination and of increased free radical formation."
8964404,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8964404/,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Alterations in plasma lipoprotein levels and bile acid metabolism observed in patients with colorectal adenoma and carcinoma may reflect a genetic background predisposing to altered lipid metabolism and tumors. This study was designed to determine whether the polymorphism of apolipoprotein E, one of the key regulatory proteins in cholesterol metabolism, is associated with proximal or distal colonic neoplasia.
METHODS: Apolipoprotein E phenotype was determined in 135 patients with colorectal adenoma, 122 patients with colorectal carcinoma, and 199 randomly selected control subjects.
RESULTS: The frequency of the epsilon 4 allele of apolipoprotein E was low (0.075 and 0.073) in patients with proximal adenoma and those with carcinoma, respectively, compared with the control subjects (0.181) (P < 0.05). In patients with distal tumors, there was no alteration in epsilon 4 frequency. In all subjects with the epsilon 4 allele compared with subjects without epsilon 4, the odds ratio for proximal adenoma was 0.36 (95% confidence interval, 0.14-0.89), and the odds ratio for proximal carcinoma was 0.35 (95% confidence interval, 0.14-0.86).
CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that the epsilon 4 allele of apolipoprotein E provides protection from the development of adenoma and carcinoma of the proximal colon. These results support the theory that there are common susceptibility genes modulating the susceptibility to external carcinogenic factors."

METHOD: For last 100 patients in which the scalp blood was sampled, scalp pH was compared with cord pH, Agpar score at birth and immediate neonatal outcome.
RESULTS: Among the 100 cases, there were 75 vaginal deliveries. There was a good correlation between scalp pH, umbilical artery pH and the 5-min Apgar score. The specificity of scalp pH > or = 7.25 to identify infants with an umbilical artery pH > or = 7.25 and 5-min Apgar score > or = 7 was 98.5 and 90.7% respectively; the corresponding negative predictive values were 70.3 and 96.7%. Immediate neonatal outcome was favorable for all the vaginal deliveries (n = 75) even though fetal heart rate was abnormal. Scalp pH presumably helped avoid unnecessary cesareans in 60 cases as in 15 case delivery occurred within 30 min or less after fetal scalp blood sampling.
CONCLUSION: Scalp blood sampling for determination of pH is questioned and other methods for evaluating fetal status are being examined. But until these methods can be validated, scalp pH provides a means of avoided some unnecessary cesareans in cases where the fetal heart rate is difficult to analyse."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the prospective study 15 patients with a preoperative astigmatism over 0.25 D axis 90 degrees +/- 15 degrees the first cataract extraction was performed by a cranial, the operation of the other eye by a temporal 6-mm no-stitch tunnel incision.
RESULTS: The mean corneal astigmatism against the rule preoperatively was 1.02 +/- 0.5 D with cranial incision and 1.27 +/- 0.8 D with temporal incision. Postoperatively the corneal astigmatism was 2.18 +/- 0.9 D with cranial incision and 0.71 +/- 0.7 D with temporal incision. In comparison to the pre-existing astigmatism, there was an increase of the astigmatism with cranial incision more than double, with temporal incision the astigmatism was significant lowered. Postoperatively the astigmatism with temporal wound location was significant lower than with cranial incision.
CONCLUSION: Under the aspect of a 1.5 D higher average astigmatism postoperatively, we conclude that a cranial 6-mm no-stitch tunnel incision in preoperative astigmatism against the rule is contraindicated."
8967589,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8967589/,"UNLABELLED: Three cases are presented dealing with rare lethal complications during the insertion of pulmonary artery catheters (PAC). Complications resulting from catheter insertion have been reported on numerous occasions; we report further examples of inadequate insertion techniques.
CASE REPORTS: Deviating from the recommended guidelines was presumably a significant factor in the development of fatal pulmonary bleeding. In the first case PAC-related perforation of the right ventricle resulting in cardiac tamponade was found at autopsy. Clinically, this perforation had not been noticed. A guidewire was allegedly employed during insertion. The diameter of the perforation (3 mm) suggests that either the balloon was deflated or the guidewire was used incautiously. In the second case during insertion the balloon was described as being inflated ""after"" reaching a wedge position. Considering this fact, catheter migration with perforation of a distal small artery was evident. Distal migration is more frequently associated with rupture of the pulmonary artery. In the third case we found a sequence of intimal lesions in the right main pulmonary artery and a segmental artery of the right lung. This high number of PAC-induced lesions is unusual and suggests inappropriate inflation technique.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on our observations, we believe the low complication rate associated with PAC insertion has led to deviations from the normal guidelines by some physicians. Despite adequate precautions and insertion technique, iatrogenic lesions cannot be avoided in all cases because of pre-existing risk factors. For the evaluation of catheter-induced complications and the development of a risk profile, more autopsies as well as more detailed clinical documentation would be necessary."
8967602,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8967602/,"UNLABELLED: Intraoperative autotransfusion is contraindicated in cancer surgery because of the possible risk of systemic tumor spread. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether a cell saver in combination with a white blood cell depletion filter can remove osteosarcoma cells.
METHODS: A defined number of osteosarcoma cells from an established cell line were added to red cell concentrates and Ringer solution. The tumor cell concentration was 1000/ ml in the first five experiments, 7111/ml in test no. 6, 1667/ml in test no. 7 and 167/ml in test no. 8. Following thorough mixing, each unit was processed separately by a cell saver (DIDECO BT 795/P) in its normal operation mode to produce a red cell concentrate. This red cell concentrate was filtered using a leukocyte depletion filter (PALL BPF 4). Samples were taken before and after processing with the autotransfuser and after filtration with the white cell depletion filter. Cytospin specimens from all samples were examined for osteosarcoma cells by three different methods (Papanicolaou stain, Vimentin antibodies, DNA analysis).
RESULTS: After processing with the autotransfuser, tumor cells were identified in the red cell concentrate. No osteosarcoma cells were evident after the combined use of cell saver and leukocyte depletion filter.
CONCLUSION: The sole use of the autotransfuser DIDECO BT 795/P during osteosarcoma surgery is not recommended because of the potential danger of retransfusion of malignant cells. In combination with the leukocyte depletion filter PALL BPF 4, no osteosarcoma cells were identified in the red cell concentrate. Since the adhesiveness of tumor cells from established cell lines may be different from that of tumor cells in the intraoperative salvaged blood, further studies with blood from the surgical field are necessary to determine the efficacy of white cell depletion filters to eliminate osteosarcoma cells."
8968700,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8968700/,"OBJECTIVE: These two studies compared the subjective assessment of how filling a snack type would be, with actual consumption of that type of snack at a snack meal.
DESIGN: Four snack types: savory high-fat, savory high-carbohydrate, sweet high-carbohydrate, each comprising of five food items, were used. Study 1 consisted of tasting followed by perceptual evaluations. Study 2 was a consumption test with a within-subjects design, each subject received each of the snack types in a counterbalanced order. A no snack condition was also included.
SETTING: The studies were carried out in the Human Appetite and Nutrition Research Unit.
SUBJECTS: Twenty-four lean male and female individuals took part in Study 1. Sixteen lean young male University students took part in Study 2.
INTERVENTIONS: In Study 1 subjects tasted 10 of the 20 food items comprising the snack types, and rated the saltiness, sweetness, fillingness and pleasantness of these on 100 mm visual analogue rating scales (VAS). In Study 2, a fixed breakfast and lunch were consumed, subjects were then offered an ad libitum selection of one of the 4 snack types. VAS to record subjective feelings of hunger and fullness were completed periodically.
RESULTS: The results of Study 1 showed the sweet high-fat snack type was rated more filling, but similar in pleasantness, than the other snack types. Study 2 showed the sweet high-fat snack type resulted in a higher energy intake than the other snack types.
CONCLUSIONS: The subjective assessment of snacks suggested sweet high-fat snacks could be filling, however when consumed these snacks resulted in a higher energy intake than the sweet high-carbohydrate and both types of savory snacks."
8969369,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8969369/,"PURPOSE: To compare prevalences and correlates of body dissatisfaction among white, Hispanic, and Asian girls.
METHODS: A total of 939 6th and 7th grade girls (mean age 12.4 years) attending four middle schools in northern California completed self-administered assessments of age, ethnicity, desired body shape, parent education levels, mother's and father's body shapes, pubertal stage, and body dissatisfaction. Body dissatisfaction was assessed with the Body Dissatisfaction scale of the Eating Disorder Inventory. Height, weight, triceps skinfold thickness, and waist and hip circumferences were measured by trained examiners.
RESULTS: Hispanic girls reported significantly greater body dissatisfaction than white girls, with Asian girls in-between. After adjustment for body mass index (weight/height), normal and overweight white, Hispanic, and Asian girls reported similar levels of body dissatisfaction. However, among the leanest 25% of girls, Hispanics and Asians reported significantly more body dissatisfaction than white girls. Body mass index was the strongest independent predictor of increased body dissatisfaction in all three ethnic groups. Shorter height among white girls and taller height among Asian girls also made significant independent contributions. Parent education level, a measure of socioeconomic status, was not significantly associated with body dissatisfaction.
CONCLUSIONS: Body dissatisfaction is not limited to white girls in middle and upper socioeconomic strata. These findings suggest Hispanic and Asian girls may be at greater risk for adopting eating disorder behaviors than previously recognized."
8969778,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8969778/,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Identification of the subgroup of asymptomatic patients with severe internal carotid artery stenosis and high risk of stroke has important clinical implications. Cerebral vasomotor reactivity provides information regarding intracranial hemodynamic features and might have a prognostic value in predicting cerebrovascular ischemic events, especially in patients with carotid stenosis. The aim of our study was to assess the cerebral vasomotor reactivity in asymptomatic patients with carotid stenosis and evaluate its role in stroke occurrence.
METHODS: Cerebral vasomotor reactivity was assessed using transcranial Doppler ultrasonology and the Diamox test (intravenous administration of 1.0 g acetazolamide) in 44 asymptomatic patients with severe (> 70%) internal carotid artery stenosis. Patients were followed up prospectively (mean, 2 years).
RESULTS: Cerebral vasomotor reactivity was estimated as good (> 40% increase of blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery ipsilateral to the carotid stenosis after undergoing the Diamox test) in 23 patients; it was impaired in the other 21. During the follow-up period, the overall annual rate for ipsilateral stokes was 2.3%; it was 7.9% for all ischemic cerebral events. No strokes or transient ischemic attacks occurred in the former group, but there were 7 cerebral ischemic events (2 strokes [1 fatal] and 5 transient ischemic attacks) in the latter group. There was a statistically significant correlation between cerebral ischemic events and impaired cerebral vasomotor reactivity (P = .009).
CONCLUSIONS: The data of this preliminary study suggest an important role of impaired cerebral vasomotor reactivity in predicting ischemic cerebral events. Preventive vascular surgery might be considered in this high-risk subgroup of asymptomatic patients with severe carotid stenosis."
8969779,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8969779/,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We used transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex to evaluate the functional state of corticospinal pathways innervating the first dorsal interosseous muscle of the hand in 26 patients suffering from a first-ever ischemic stroke in the middle cerebral artery territory.
METHODS: All patients had complete hand palsy and were tested within the first 24 hours from stroke onset. Patients were also tested clinically with the MRC, Rankin, and National Institutes of Health (NIH) stroke scales at day 1 and with MRC and NIH scales and the Barthel Index at day 14. Electrophysiological testing was repeated at day 14. Patients were divided into three subgroups according to the amplitude of the maximal response (motor evoked potential [MEP]) evoked at day 1.
RESULTS: After 2 weeks, all 6 patients with initial MEPs > 5% maximum motor response (Mmax) showed some first dorsal interosseous muscle motor function recovery, whereas 19 of 20 patients with initially absent or small (< 5% Mmax) MEPs were left with complete hand palsy. There were strong positive correlations between MEP amplitude at day 1 and MRC and Barthel Index scores at day 14. However, measurement of central motor conduction time proved to be of little prognostic value.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that early-performed transcranial magnetic stimulation is a valuable prognostic tool for motor recovery from stroke and that relatively preserved MEP amplitude shortly after stroke is a better prognostic factor than normal central motor conduction time."
8969856,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8969856/,"OBJECTIVE: To assess whether female primary care physicians' reported coverage of patients eligible for certain preventive care strategies differs from male physicians' reported coverage.
DESIGN: A mailed survey.
SETTING: Primary care practices in southern Ontario.
PARTICIPANTS: All primary care physicians who graduated between 1972 and 1988 and practised in a defined geographic area of Ontario were selected from the Canadian Medical Association's physician resource database. Response rate was 50%.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Answers to questions on sociodemographic and practice characteristics, attitudes toward preventive care, and perceptions about preventive care behaviour and practices.
RESULTS: In general, reported coverage for Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Examination's (CTFPHE) A and B class recommendations was low. However, more female than male physicians reported high coverage of women patients for female-specific preventive care measures (i.e., Pap smears, breast examinations, and mammography) and for blood pressure measurement. Female physicians appeared to question more patients about a greater number of health risks. Often, sex of physician was the most salient factor affecting whether preventive care services thought effective by the CTFPHE were offered. However, when evidence for effectiveness of preventive services was equivocal or lacking, male and female physicians reported similar levels of coverage.
CONCLUSION: Female primary care physicians are more likely than their male colleagues to report that their patients eligible for preventive health measures as recommended by the CTFPHE take advantage of these measures."

Previous studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that chronic, but not acute, exposure to therapeutic concentrations of lithium significantly reduces the expression of the protein kinase C (PKC) substrate MARCKS (myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate) in the rat hippocampus and an immortalized hippocampal cell line (HN33). The anticonvulsant drugs valproate and carbamazepine are emerging as efficacious alternative and adjunctive treatments for bipolar disorder. In the present study, we sought to determine the effects of valproate and carbamazepine on MARCKS protein levels by using our hippocampal cell model.
METHOD: HN33 immortalized hippocampal cells were exposed acutely or chronically to sodium valproate 1 mM, carbamazepine 100 microM, lithium chloride 5 mM, or lithium chloride 5 mM + sodium valproate 1 mM. Additionally, cells were exposed to lithium chloride 5 mM in the absence or presence of inositol 5 microM, or sodium valproate 1 mM in the absence or presence of inositol 40 microM. After drug exposure, cells were collected, separated into soluble and membrane fractions, and MARCKS protein assayed by Western blot analysis using polyclonal rabbit antibody. Immunoreactive bands were quantitated by densitometric analysis.
RESULTS: We report that chronic exposure of HN33 cells to either lithium or valproate produced a time-dependent down-regulation of MARCKS protein. Maximal reduction in MARCKS levels were observed after 3 days of exposure to valproate and after 7 days of exposure to lithium. The reduction of MARCKS produced by lithium and valproate alone were additive when the two drugs were combined. The reduction in MARCKS produced by lithium was reversed by the addition of inositol to the media, whereas the reduction produced by valproate was unaffected by the addition of inositol. Carbamazepine failed to affect MARCKS protein levels at each dose and time tested.
CONCLUSION: These data provide evidence that, like lithium, chronic exposure to valproate produces a significant time-dependent down-regulation of the PKC substrate MARCKS, whereas carbamazepine is without effect. The MARCKS reduction produced by valproate appears to occur independently of inositol concentrations yet is additive with the reduction produced by lithium, which is inositol-reversible. Valproate- and lithium-induced regulation of MARCKS expression appears to be mediated by different mechanisms that may utilize PKC, and may be associated with the clinical profile of these mood stabilizers. Regulation of MARCKS expression may be associated with the prophylactic efficacy of lithium in the long-term stabilization of the recurrent affective episodes in bipolar disorder, and valproate may share this property."
8970767,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8970767/,"BACKGROUND: Coronary anomalies in the absence of other major cardiac malformations are rare, with an incidence of less than 1-1.5%. Although most have been incidental findings without clinical relevance, a subgroup of anomalies has been identified that are associated with cardiac symptoms or even sudden cardiac death. This subgroup includes an ectopic origin and abnormal course of the left coronary artery from the right sinus of Valsalva.
RESULTS: We examined two patients with this anomaly. In patient I the left main coronary artery took a deep intramural course anterior to the pulmonary trunk, and in patient II the left anterior descending coronary artery took its course between the pulmonary trunk and ascending aorta. Both anomalies were identified by coronary angiography and that in patient I was confirmed by surgery. Intracoronary Doppler flow velocity measurements during cardiac catheterization, including atrial pacing in patient II, demonstrated significant flow acceleration in both patients. This occurred within the intramural segment (in patient I) and in the segment between the pulmonary artery and ascending aorta (in patient II).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that external vessel compression is one pathophysiological mechanism that leads to ischaemia and a longstanding history of cardiac symptoms in these patients. Invasive haemodynamic measurements such as these have not previously been available."
8971296,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8971296/,"BACKGROUND: Intravenous erythromycin has previously been reported to stimulate gastric emptying, to inhibit gastric acid secretion and to stimulate pancreatic secretion during continuous gastric infusion of a liquid diet in healthy volunteers.
AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of oral erythromycin (160 mg/h) on gastrointestinal function under these conditions in seven healthy subjects.
METHOD: This randomized double-blind cross-over study measured the gastric emptying rate of nutrients, gastric acid secretion, gastric pH, jejunal flow rate as well as biliopancreatic secretion and duodeno-caecal transit time during a 19.9 kJ/min continuous infusion of a nutrient solution (4.18 kJ/mL) in the antrum over a 6-h period by a perfusion method.
RESULTS: The nutrition was well tolerated except by one subject with placebo perfusion. During the 6-period, total gastric volume and gastric volume of nutrient decreased during erythromycin administration by 22 +/- 8 and 22 +/- 6%, respectively. Gastric acid secretion was not modified by erythromycin. Lipase and bile salt outputs were significantly higher with erythromycin. The duodeno-caecal transit time was not statistically different with drug and placebo (169 +/- 15 and 146 +/- 19 min, respectively).
CONCLUSION: During continuous gastric infusion of a liquid diet, the effect of oral erythromycin on gastric emptying could be useful to optimize cyclic enteral nutrition or to enhance the tolerance of enteral nutrition."
8971826,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8971826/,"OBJECTIVE: We investigate the predictive value of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow void on outcome after shunting in a prospective series of patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH).
METHODS: The degree and extension of CSF flow void were examined on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans of 37 elderly patients with idiopathic NPH who underwent subsequent shunting. The degree of flow void was assessed in comparison with the signal of large cerebral arteries. The extension was evaluated via the calculation of sum scores for the occurrence of flow void in different locations of the ventricular system. Those parameters were not considered in the decision to perform shunting. CSF flow void in the aqueduct and the adjacent third and fourth ventricles of the 37 patients with idiopathic NPH was compared with that of 37 age-matched control patients. CSF flow void scores in patients with idiopathic NPH were investigated for correlations between postoperative outcome scores and ventricular width indices.
RESULTS: No difference was found between the occurrence of aqueductal CSF flow void in patients with idiopathic NPH and the control group. A significant difference, however, was noted for the extension of the CSF flow void, which was greater in the NPH group. Postoperative improvement was found in 33 of 37 patients with idiopathic NPH at a mean follow-up of 15.6 months. Only small, statistically not significant correlations were found between CSF flow void and postoperative outcome. Flow void sum scores, however, correlated significantly with ventricular width indices.
CONCLUSION: The degree and extension of CSF flow void on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans have little predictive value for outcome after shunting in patients with idiopathic NPH. The greater extension of the CSF flow void in patients with NPH is most likely related to increased ventricular width. It is not useful to consider CSF flow void findings on conventional magnetic resonance imaging scans in making the decision to offer shunting in patients with idiopathic NPH."
8972653,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8972653/,"OBJECTIVE: The anterior acromion may appear to slope downward in a lateral direction on coronal-oblique magnetic resonance (MR) images of the shoulder. We sought to determine the significance of this finding as a marker of rotator cuff impingement.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: MR studies of 58 subjects (26 with impingement, 32 with glenohumeral instability) were retrospectively analysed. Subjective down-sloping of the acromion was compared to standardized acromial measurements made on MR (acromial axis, width of the anterior acromion, and distance of the acromioclavicular joint from the superior glenoid) and clinical diagnosis.
RESULTS: Interobserver variance for lateral down-sloping was fair (kappa = 0.5). One reader's assessment of lateral down-sloping of the acromion correlated with standardized MR measurements. Subjective lateral down-sloping of the acromion did not, however, correlate with impingement.
CONCLUSION: The subjective finding of a laterally down-sloping acromion on coronal-oblique MR images, while partially validated by standardized measurements, is not predictive of impingement syndrome."
8973067,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8973067/,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship among children's perceptions of peer and parental attitudes toward alcohol use, fifth graders' attitudes toward alcohol use and intentions to use alcohol in junior high school, and alcohol use of these same children as seventh graders.
METHODS: Subjects completed questionnaires as fifth graders that assessed their perception of parents' and peers' attitudes toward alcohol use, children's attitudes toward alcohol use, and intentions to use alcohol in junior high school. They completed a survey in the seventh grade that assessed alcohol use.
RESULTS: Path analyses indicated that perceived peer and parental attitudes were directly related to children's fifth-grade attitudes toward alcohol use. Attitudes, in tum, were related to fifth-grade intentions, which were related to seventh-grade alcohol use. Peer and parental attitudes, and children's attitudes as fifth graders, were not directly related to later alcohol use.
CONCLUSIONS: Peer and parental attitudes toward alcohol use among fifth graders exert an indirect, rather than direct, influence on later alcohol use. Similarly, attitudes of fifth graders influence later alcohol use through their influence on intentions to use alcohol. Prevention programs should be targeted toward younger children prior to initiation of alcohol use and should address both peer and parental influences on attitudes and intentions to use alcohol."
8973704,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8973704/,"OBJECTIVES: For patients with prostate specific antigen (PSA) values of 4-10 ng/mL, some urologists perform prostatic biopsies depending upon the findings of digital rectal examination (DRE) and transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS), and others perform biopsies on most of these men regardless of the findings of DRE and TRUS. The purpose of this study was to examine whether the information given by the measurement of the ratio of free to total (F/T) PSA can alter decision-making on prostatic biopsy.
METHODS: One hundred and two (102) men with PSA values between 4 and 10 ng/mL, were included in this study. All men were examined with DRE and TRUS; a F/T PSA ratio was also measured, and six prostatic biopsies were taken from each patient.
RESULTS: In 102 men who were biopsied, 22 (21.5%) prostatic carcinomas were identified. Among these 22 cancer patients, 13 had abnormal findings in DRE and/or TRUS and would have been biopsied and diagnosed anyway. If we use only the F/T PSA ratio (cut-off value 0.20) to decide whom to biopsy, we would have diagnosed 16/22 cancers; the difference between these two procedures was not statistically significant (P = 0.17). If we decide to biopsy those patients who have abnormal findings in DRE and/or TRUS and those who have a F/T PSA ratio < 0.20, we would diagnose 20/22 cancers (P = 0.05) and at the same time, reduce the unnecessary biopsies from 80 to 41 (48%). With a PSA value between 4 and 10 ng/mL and no findings in DRE and TRUS and at the same time with a F/T PSA ratio > or = 0.20, we would have to perform biopsies in 20.5 men to find one cancer. On the other hand, in patients with suspicious findings in DRE and/or TRUS and a F/T PSA ratio < 0.20, in every two men that we biopsy we would find one cancer.
CONCLUSION: We believe that among patients with PSA values between 4 and 10 ng/mL after performing DRE and TRUS, the additional information of F/T PSA ratio can help since it increases the number of cancers detected and reduces the number of unnecessary biopsies."

8974873,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8974873/,"OBJECTIVE: As hyperhomocysteinaemia is known to be an important risk factor in the early onset of arteriosclerotic occlusive disease and leg-vein thrombosis, we investigated the prevalence of hyperhomocysteinaemia in patients with thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO), a condition predominantly affecting peripheral arteries and veins.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Plasma homocysteine (HC), before and after administration of methionine (0.1 g/kg) as well as serum folic acid, vitamins B6 and B12 were measured in 15 patients with TAO (12 men, 3 women; mean age 33.3 years: group 1), in 15 non-smokers without peripheral vascular disease (group 2) and 15 smokers without peripheral vascular disease (group 3). At the time of the study, of those in group 1 seven were active smokers, seven were ex-smokers and one was a non-smoker.
RESULTS: Before methionine administration four patients (27%), none of the healthy non-smokers and one smoker without vascular disease (7%) had increased HC levels (> 13.9 nmol/ml). The difference between groups 1 and 2 was statistically significant (P < 0.05), but not that between groups 1 and 3 and between 2 and 3. 4 hours after methionine increased HC levels (> or = 31 nmol/ml) were measured in nine patients but in none of the healthy controls. The difference between patients and the two control groups without vascular disease was clearly significant (P = 0.0107). There was a difference in folic acid levels between the patients and the smokers without vascular disease: in eight patients (53%) the levels were in the lower third of normal, in six (40%) they were in the middle and in one (7%) in the upper third. Corresponding levels in group 3 were: four (27%), three (20%) and eight (53%).
CONCLUSION: Hyperhomocysteinaemia occurs frequently in patients with TAO. It may play an important and nicotine-independent role in its pathogenesis."
8975842,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8975842/,"OBJECTIVE: An international series of pulmonary retransplantation was updated to determine the factors associated with pulmonary function, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome stage, and survival after operation.
METHODS: One hundred sixty patients underwent retransplantation in 35 centers from 1985 to 1995. Logistic regression methods were used to determine variables associated with 3-month and 2-year survival after retransplantation. Values of forced expiratory volume in 1 second were contrasted between groups by unpaired, two-tailed t tests.
RESULTS: The median follow-up in surviving recipients was 780 days. Actuarial survival was 45% +/- 4%, 41% +/- 4%, and 33% +/- 4% at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively. On multivariable analysis, the only predictor of 3-month survival was preoperative ambulatory status (p = 0.005), whereas center experience with at least five pulmonary retransplantations was the sole predictor of 2-year survival (p = 0.04). The prevalence of stage 3 (severe) bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome was 12% at 1 year, 15% at 2 years, and 33% at 3 years after retransplantation. Retransplant recipients with stage 3 bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome at 1 year had a significantly worse actuarial survival than those with stages 0 to 2 (p < 0.01). By 3 years after retransplantation, the forced expiratory volume in 1 second was significantly lower in patients who underwent reoperation because of obliterative bronchiolitis than in patients who underwent retransplantation because of acute graft failure or an airway complication (p = 0.02). Only 31% of patients who underwent retransplantation because of obliterative bronchiolitis were free of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome at 3 years versus 83% of patients who underwent retransplantation because of other indications (p = 0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative ambulatory status predicts early survival and center volume predicts intermediate-term outcome after retransplantation. Improved management strategies are necessary to prevent the development of progressive graft dysfunction after retransplantation for obliterative bronchiolitis."
8975848,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8975848/,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this report is to examine the short-and intermediate-term outcome of a complex biventricular repair compared with a single ventricle repair in patients with two functional ventricles.
PATIENT POPULATION: Since 1986, 34 patients with atrioventricular concordance or discordance, ventriculoarterial discordance, ventricular septal defect, and pulmonary stenosis or atresia have undergone biventricular repair (group I). Another group of 16 patients (group II) with the same diagnoses have undergone a single ventricle repair consisting of a total cavopulmonary connection because of either a straddling atrioventricular valve (11 patients) or an uncommitted ventricular septal defect (5 patients).
RESULTS: The mean length of follow-up was 3.9 years in group I and 3.0 years in group II. Freedom from reoperation at 7 years was 45.5% in group I and 100% in group II (p = 0.014). The actuarial estimate of survival at 7 years was 68.0% in group I and 93.8% in group II (p = 0.048).
CONCLUSION: Short- and intermediate-term morbidity and mortality were greater in patients undergoing a biventricular repair than in a similar group of patients undergoing total cavopulmonary connection. It is unknown whether the long-term results of a total cavopulmonary connection in patients with two ventricles are as good as those obtained with a biventricular approach. However, there may be situations in which the short- and intermediate-term risks of a complex biventricular repair may outweigh the long-term disadvantages of a single ventricle approach."
8976215,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8976215/,"PURPOSE: We attempted to determine the relative risk of ureterointestinal anastomosis using 2 antireflux techniques of orthotopic bladder substitution, and we assessed the degree to which success is determined by surgeon experience.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 120 patients underwent surgery, including 74 with the Hautmann (Le Duc) technique and 46 with a somewhat modified Studer (Nesbit/Studer) technique. The urologists who performed the operations were classified as expert, skilled and learner. Evaluation was done retrospectively. All patients in the Studer group, except 3 who died and 1 who was lost to followup, were monitored a minimum of 12 months.
RESULTS: There was a 20.4% rate of nonneoplastic obstructions in the 142 ureters reimplanted with the Le Duc technique (Hautmann group). The variation in obstruction rates of 16.7, 18.2 and 25%, respectively, for expert, skilled and learning surgeons was statistically insignificant. Only 3 nonneoplastic obstructions (3.6%) developed in the 83 ureters reimplanted with the Nesbit/ Studer technique (Studer group). The variation in obstruction rates of 5.1, 0 and 3.6%, respectively, for expert, skilled and learner surgeons was statistically insignificant.
CONCLUSIONS: The Nesbit/Studer technique results in a generally lower rate of ureterointestinal anastomotic stricture than the Le Duc technique. Using the Le Duc technique there was no statistically significant correlation between incidence of obstruction and surgeon level of experience, indicating that obstruction with this technique probably arises from other factors."
8976235,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8976235/,"PURPOSE: We determined the role and validity of visual erotic stimulation using RigiScan monitoring as a more physiological and cost-effective diagnostic modality for primary noninvasive screening of psychogenic versus organic impotence. We also clarified the correlation between erotic and pharmacological erections, and their diagnostic usefulness in the clinical routine.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 76 impotent patients and 20 potent controls were entered into the study. A detailed medical and sexual history was obtained, and psychological evaluation and minimally invasive diagnostic studies were done, including a 15-minute visual erotic stimulation test, intracavernous pharmacological stimulation with 10 micrograms. prostaglandin E1 and penile duplex ultrasound. Responses to each test were interpreted blindly and independently of each other, and of the results of the psychological evaluation. Visual erotic stimulation results were then correlated with the results of intracavernous pharmacological stimulation and penile duplex ultrasound, and validity assessments were also obtained.
RESULTS: Results of the visual erotic stimulation test confirmed the clinical diagnosis in 10 of the 14 patients (71%) with psychogenic impotence (71% sensitivity and 96% specificity). There was a 97% correlation with the clinical diagnosis of predominantly organic dysfunction (97% sensitivity and 71% specificity). However, characterization of the etiological inferences based on visual erotic stimulation findings was poor.
CONCLUSIONS: A positive response to visual erotic stimulation is strongly indicative of a predominantly psychogenic cause of erectile dysfunction. In combination with patient sexual history and pharmacological erection testing, visual erotic stimulation can be performed as an initial, minimally invasive test for cost-effective screening of psychogenic impotence."
8976248,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8976248/,"PURPOSE: We evaluated the role of free and total serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) and prostate volume in discriminating between men with negative and positive transrectal ultrasound guided biopsies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 104 consecutive men with a positive biopsy and at least 3 mm. of prostate cancer was compared to 110 consecutive men with a negative biopsy. Prostate volume was determined by transrectal ultrasound. Total PSA was determined by the Tosoh AIA-600 PSA assay and free PSA was measured by the PSA II Dianon assay. We determined the free-to-total PSA ratio, free and total PSA densities, and the relationship of free PSA and free-to-total PSA ratio to prostate volume.
RESULTS: Using a 23% cutoff value of free-to-total PSA, only 22.7% of biopsies were preventable in patients with a negative biopsy but 9.6% of the cancers were missed. At a total PSA of 4 to 10 ng./ml. 44.4% of the biopsy negative cases were correctly identified while missing 9.1% of the cancers if a 20% free PSA cutoff is used. For total PSA more than 10 ng./ml. an 18% free PSA cutoff properly identified 30.2% of the biopsy negative cases while missing 9.3% of the cancers. Percent free PSA is a better discriminant than prostate volume for total PSA more than 4 ng./ml. and the combination was not helpful. Free PSA density was identical in patients with negative and positive biopsies. There was no relationship between free PSA or free-to-total PSA ratio levels and prostate volume.
CONCLUSIONS: Use of a single discriminant criterion of free-to-total PSA ratio in the practical clinical setting of distinguishing negative and positive biopsies appears useful in patients with a total PSA of 4 to 10 ng./ml. Since free PSA is unrelated to prostate volume in biopsy negative and positive cases the physiological basis of free PSA is an enigma."
8976255,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8976255/,"PURPOSE: The proliferative index was evaluated as an additional prognostic variable in 244 radical prostatectomy specimens from patients with prostate cancer. This study was done on the grounds that this variable has shown some promise as a prognostic tool in some other carcinomas, for example breast cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The proliferative index was evaluated in 244 patients undergoing radical prostatectomy for clinically localized disease between January 1988 and August 1994. Proliferative index was determined using the Ki-67 antibody on fresh frozen tissue and MIB-1 on paraffin embedded tissues. Patients were divided into 2 groups based on a proliferative index of less than 1 (185) or 1 or greater (59). Of the patients 49 (20%) had biochemical failure (median 23 months to progressive prostate specific antigen elevation of 0.5 ng./ml. or more). Those whose treatment failed were also divided into 2 groups according to proliferative index: 32 of 185 (18%) with an index of less than 1 and 17 of 59 (27%) with an index of 1 or more. Gleason score and deoxyribonucleic acid ploidy status were also evaluated in all patients and compared in multivariate regression analysis. Operative specimens were categorized as organ confined, specimen confined or margin positive.
RESULTS: The distribution according to margin status in the 2 groups (proliferative index less than 1 and 1 or more) was 40 versus 60% for organ confined, 67 versus 33% for specimen confined and 72 versus 28% for margin positive disease, respectively. The distribution of time to treatment failure in the 2 groups was not markedly different: 7.2 versus 9.4 months for margin positive, 10 versus 14.5 months for specimen confined and 8.5 versus 12 months for organ confined cancer, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Multivariate analysis demonstrated that, although deoxyribonucleic acid ploidy seemed to correlate with more advanced disease, only Gleason sum and pathological T stage reached statistical significance when evaluated against time to treatment failure. A high proliferative index added little above the more traditional prognostic indicators of Gleason score, pathological stage and ploidy. Therefore, we question the value of proliferative index as a prognostic indicator using the aforementioned methodology in prostate cancer."
8976259,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8976259/,"PURPOSE: We assessed the relative difficulty with which radical perineal and retropubic prostatectomy operations are learned.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The first 10 radical perineal and retropubic prostatectomies performed by 6 graduating urology residents were reviewed for patient and tumor characteristics, duration of surgery and hospitalization, and complication rates.
RESULTS: A total of 120 patients was reviewed. Mean hospital stay was 2.5 days less after radical perineal prostatectomy, and estimated blood loss, number of transfusions and complication rates were also less for this procedure. All parameters used to estimate the outcome of the procedure indicated that radical perineal prostatectomy was learned more quickly than radical retropubic prostatectomy.
CONCLUSIONS: In a residency training program radical perineal prostatectomy was learned at least as easily as retropubic prostatectomy. Due to expanding indications for this procedure, these findings should encourage urological surgeons to develop their skill with this approach."
8976262,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8976262/,"PURPOSE: When tumor extends close to the margin of resection yet does not extend to the inked edge of the gland, it is unclear whether patients have an adverse prognosis compared to cases with greater distance between the tumor and margin.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Among radical prostatectomy specimens with negative margins the distance between the most peripheral tumor and the surgical margin of resection was measured in 52 cases with and 49 without progression. All patients had clinically confined disease (stages T1 or T2) with subsequent progression or a minimum 5-year followup without evidence of disease. No patient received preoperative or postoperative radiotherapy or hormonal therapy until progression occurred. All men underwent a postoperative serum prostate specific antigen test to evaluate progression. Seminal vesicles and lymph nodes were pathologically free of tumor. All prostates were serially sectioned, completely embedded and assessable regarding margins of resection.
RESULTS: Patients with progression were no more likely to have tumor close to the margin than those without progression. In a regression analysis analyzing the effect of Gleason score, distance between tumor and margin, location of closest margin and pathological stage as related to progression, only grade was predictive of progression (p < 0.00001).
CONCLUSIONS: It is not necessary for pathologists to designate these margins as close, since biologically this finding has no significance. Furthermore, physicians who are involved in treatment of patients after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer should not alter therapy depending on whether margins are reported as close."
8976283,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8976283/,"PURPOSE: Despite numerous studies, there has been no definitive HLA association with Peyronie's disease. Results of available studies have been reviewed and compared to determine if the cumulative evidence supports any immunogenetic, HLA association with Peyronie's disease.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from reports of HLA associations with Peyronie's disease were reanalyzed by categories of reported HLA class I or class II antigens in comparison with recently available large population analysis of the frequencies of these antigens in the normal population. Data were also considered by whether they were derived from population or family analyses.
RESULTS: The results of 4 series of patients testing an association of Peyronie's disease with the HLA class I antigens, in particular the B7 related antigens, were contradictory. A B7 association was not confirmed in 2 larger series and, in fact, the B7 related antigens were observed in frequencies expected in a normal population, suggesting that the associations observed in the smaller series were due to chance. An association with the HLA class II antigen, DQ2, was found in 1 of the larger series. Reported family studies suggest a genetic basis for Peyronie's disease but do not indicate a gene closely linked to the HLA complex.
CONCLUSIONS: Considering all available data, Peyronie's disease appears to be multifactorial in pathogenesis. Because Peyronie's disease is likely heterogeneous and because available studies have analyzed serologically defined HLA antigens, future studies to define HLA alleles molecularly and to characterize patient subgroups may clarify an immunogenetic basis."

METHODS: A group of experts in the field of sexual health was convened around the module on sexual health. It was led by a genitourinary specialist and aided by a curriculum facilitator. Group contributors represented a wide variety of disciplines and included a medical student. The group met on three occasions for 1.5 hours.
RESULTS: The identified learning objectives are presented under the course themes. The values and relevance of the individual objectives are discussed with particular reference to an integrated curriculum which combines clinical and basic science in a problem based learning (PBL) format. The communication skills and attitudes necessary to take a competent sexual history are stressed. Links with other relevant modules in the PBL curriculum are described to show how the topic of sexual health develops throughout the course. Learning methods, resources and assessment procedures are also outlined.
CONCLUSION: The educational potential of sexual health and behaviour as a core topic for a novel integrated course is considerable and merits a greater importance than it appears to receive in current undergraduate courses."

METHODS: Cross sectional case control study comparing oral contraceptive use in women with and without genital warts attending a city centre genitourinary medicine clinic controlling for recent sexual activity, the presence of other sexually transmitted infections, socio-economic class and history of pregnancy using a multivariate logistic regression model.
RESULTS: After controlling for potential confounding variables women with genital warts were significantly more likely to be current users of the oral contraceptive pill (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.3-2.2).
CONCLUSION: The study suggests that women taking the oral contraceptive may be at increased risk of presenting with genital warts. Previously published papers provide some support for this hypothesis and potential biological mechanisms are discussed."
8976914,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8976914/,"OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine whether it is scientifically justified to require that women with implants or a history of treatment for breast cancer be screened in a diagnostic mammography setting and that they be excluded from mammography screening programs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The recall rates for women with breast implants or a history of treatment for breast cancer who were screened in a dedicated mammography screening program were compared with those of other women in the screening program. The computerized records for the breast screening program of the Department of Radiology at our institution for January 1, 1990, through December 31, 1995, were reviewed. The recall rates for women who had breast implants and those for women with a history of treatment for breast cancer were compared with the recall rates for the other women who underwent screening. Each recall rate included women who were called back for additional evaluation in addition to those for whom a biopsy was recommended on the basis of the screening study.
RESULTS: Of 45,134 screening examinations done during the review period, 43,454 (96%) were for women who had no history of breast cancer or of breast implants; 590 (1%) were for women who had undergone mastectomy; 991 (2%) were for women who had been treated with lumpectomy and irradiation for breast cancer; and 99 (0.2%) were for women with breast implants. Among the 43,454 examinations of women with no history of breast cancer or implants, 3081 examinations (7%) led to interpretations that produced requests for the patient to return for additional evaluation. Thirty-six women who had been treated for breast cancer by mastectomy were recalled (6%). Seventy-five women who had undergone lumpectomy and irradiation for breast cancer were recalled (8%). Five women with breast implants were recalled (5%). Statistically, these rates were not significantly different.
CONCLUSION: We find no scientific reason to exclude women who have been treated for breast cancer or who have breast implants from dedicated screening programs."
8977063,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8977063/,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the long-term effect of transurethral microwave thermotherapy (TUMT) treatment and find possible predictors of a favourable outcome.
METHODS: Men with symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) (n = 339) were examined before undergoing TUMT. The pretreatment evaluation included two or more of the following: cystoscopy, ultrasonic examination of the prostate, urine flow rate, residual urine volume and Madsen symptom score. The urodynamic measurements and Madsen score were repeated after 3, 6 and 12 months. Six different groups, based on pretreatment examinations or energy given during TUMT, were analysed.
RESULTS: The Madsen score was significantly reduced and the score reduction was similar in all groups. Residual urine did not change significantly and flow rate increased only marginally. At 12 months, 56% of the men were satisfied with the treatment result, 29% had received additional treatment because of insufficient relief symptoms, while the remaining 15% were not satisfied but decided not to undergo further treatment at present.
CONCLUSION: The reduction in the Madsen score remained stable during 1-year follow-up. None of the investigated pretreatment findings were predictive of a favourable treatment result. Since TUMT did not increase peak urinary flow significantly, men with BPH symptoms and unobstructed micturition appear to be the most suitable group for treatment. This group of men showed the same symptomatic improvement as the other investigated groups."
21519715,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21519715/,"BACKGROUND: It has been found that objects influence the adjustments to reaching of breastfeeding infants, however, it has not been investigated whether these adjustments change in older infants.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine whether the size and rigidity of objects influence the proximal and distal adjustments to reaching of infants of 6, 7, 8 and 36 months of age.
METHODS: Nine healthy infants were presented with: one large rigid, one small rigid, one large malleable and one small malleable object. The movements were videotaped and later analyzed qualitatively with regard to proximal (unimanual and bimanual reaching) and distal adjustments (horizontal, vertical and oblique hand orientation, opened, half-open and closed hand) and with regard to grasping of these objects (with and without). Friedman test and Dunn multiple comparisons were applied and 0.05 was considered as a significant difference.
RESULTS: Infants of 36 months of age performed more unimanual reaching than younger infants. Additionally, at all ages, unimanual reaching was particularly performed for small objects. At 36 months of age infants guided the hand horizontally to touch and grasp the objects, while at 6 and 7 months the hand orientation was oblique to touch and vertical to grasp the objects, regardless of the object's properties. Over the months, both at the beginning and at the end of reaching, the hands became more open, especially to touch the large rigid object, and infants increasingly performed reaching with successful grasping, especially for malleable or small objects.
CONCLUSIONS: From 6 to 36 months of age, the reaching became more refined and the infants adjusted to the different properties of the objects which were observed through changes in the proximal and distal adjustments."

DESIGN: A prospective cohort study was performed in 100 adult patients (> 18 years) undergoing bariatric surgery by malabsorptive technique for one year.
RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Patients were monitored from the beginning of the BS program until a year after the intervention, applying the NHP and the BAROS test. At baseline, the mean weight of the women was 132 ± 22 kg and the Body Mass Index (BMI) was 50.7 kg/m².
RESULTS: The values obtained from different areas applying the NHP questionnaire showed statistical significant differences (p < 0.001) with respect to baseline values. According to the BAROS test, 48% of patients lost 25-49% of weight excess and 80.8% had resolved major comorbidities at 1 yr. According to the Moorehead-Ardelt QoL score, there were major improvements in employment and self-esteem in 89% and 87% of patients, respectively, and improvements in physical activity, sexual and social relationships. According to the total mean BAROS score, the outcome was considered ""very good"".
CONCLUSION: NHP and BAROS questionnaires appear to be useful and easily applicable tools to assess the QoL of obese patients."
21519986,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21519986/,"RATIONALE: Endocannabinoids have been widely studied in the context of addiction and reward due to their role in reinstatement. However, little is known about the role of CB1 receptors during extinction learning of an appetitively motivated task.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of endocannabinoids at different stages of extinction learning.
METHODS: Endocannabinoid signaling was disrupted by injecting the CB1 receptor antagonist rimonabant (0, 200, 300 μg/kg i.v.) during the acquisition or consolidation phases of learning. The rate of extinction and its half-life were analyzed, as well as food-seeking in a reward-induced reinstatement test. We further investigated the interaction between extinction and endocannabinoids in different groups of rats that received drug treatments but did not undergo extinction training (abstinence). In addition, the effects of rimonabant on cue retrieval were investigated in a cue-induced reinstatement test in which rimonabant (0, 300 μg/kg i.v.) was given immediately prior to the reinstatement session.
RESULTS: Blockade of CB1 receptors during acquisition or consolidation of extinction learning had no effect on the rate extinction or its half-life and these pretreatments had no long term consequences on reward-seeking behavior. Furthermore, rats that underwent extinction training responded at lower levels than those that received the drug in the absence of extinction (p = 0.000, η (2) = 0.40). Rimonabant was effective in inhibiting behavior only if it was immediately given before a cue-induced reinstatement session (p = 0.000, η (2) = 0.92).
CONCLUSION: The present results clarify and isolate the role of endocannabinoids in reinstatement as key mediators of cue retrieval, rather than orchestrators of extinction learning processes."
21520104,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21520104/,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Temporal bone fractures (TBFs) are a frequent manifestation of head trauma. We investigated the prevalence of concurrent intracranial injuries (ICIs) and cervical spine injuries (CSIs) in a series of patients with TBFs and attempted to identify significant associations between current TBF classification systems and either ICI or CSI.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series with chart review.
METHODS: The records of all patients ≥18 years of age diagnosed with a basilar skull fracture, including TBF, at a level I trauma center from 2004 to 2009 were reviewed. Patient demographics, mechanism of injury, and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores were collected. Imaging studies were reviewed to classify TBF using the traditional longitudinal-transverse-mixed and otic capsule-sparing versus -involving systems and identify concurrent ICI and CSI.
RESULTS: Of 1,279 patients, 202 (15.8%) met inclusion criteria. There were 160 (79.2%) males. Sixteen (7.9%) patients had bilateral TBFs. Falls (n = 66, 32.7%) represented the most common mechanism for TBF. Longitudinal (n = 96, 44.0%) and otic capsule-sparing (n = 209, 95.9%) fractures were the most prevalent subtypes. There were 184 (91.1%) patients who sustained ICI and 18 (8.9%) who demonstrated CSI. Longitudinal, transverse, mixed, otic capsule-sparing, or otic capsule-involving TBF subtypes had no statistically significant associations with mechanism of injury, GCS score, or concomitant ICI or CSI.
CONCLUSIONS: More than 90% of patients sustaining TBF presented with concomitant ICI, and 9% sustained CSI. Current TBF classification systems do not correlate with these outcomes. A more sophisticated, multidisciplinary classification system encompassing radiographic and clinical findings may better predict neurologic, neuro-otologic, and skull base complications."
21520133,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21520133/,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To evaluate the impact of the uvular length on the efficacy of palatal implants in primary snoring.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective case series, tertiary hospital, snoring and respiratory sleep disorders center.
METHODS: Forty subjects with inserted palatal implants and diagnoses of primary snoring were included. All met the inclusion criteria of age >18 years, body mass index <30, apnea-hypopnea index <5, tonsil grade <3, soft-palate length >25 mm, and Friedman tongue position <3 following clinical, endoscopic, and polysomnographic evaluation. Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) and the snoring-intensity visual analogue scale (VAS) were recorded before and 9 months after the implant. Four subjects with extruded implants were excluded; the remaining 36 subjects were divided into two groups, Group I and Group II, with uvular lengths of ≤15 mm and >15 mm, respectively. The study assessed and compared subjective outcome measures including the partner's satisfaction (PS), partner's reported improvement (PRI), 50% VAS and ESS reduction, and subjective success (SS) defined as 50% VAS reduction. The Student t test, χ(2) test, and logistic regression models were used for statistical evaluation.
RESULTS: SS (50% VAS reduction), PS, PRI, and 50% ESS reduction were significantly higher in Group I (P < .001, P = .0257, P = .027, P < .001). The overall SS, PRI, PS, and 50% ESS reduction were 33%, 78%, 50%, and 50%, respectively. The uvular length was found to be the determinant factor of SS (P = .005; odds ratio = 0.75), PRI (P = .039; odds ratio = 0.83), and 50% ESS reduction (P = .038; odds ratio: 0.84) following implant insertion through stepwise logistic regression analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Excess uvular length (>15 mm) is an important anatomic feature decreasing the efficacy of palatal implants in snoring, and additional measures, such as uvulectomy, should be considered simultaneously for better outcomes (level 4)."
21520211,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21520211/,"BACKGROUND: Stepladder-related injuries at construction sites have increased in recent years. We aimed to quantify the prevalence of stepladder-related fall hazards in general construction and to compare the risks on renovation worksites to new construction build sites.
METHODS: Eighteen worksites were visited, resulting in the observation of 771 stepladders. Eight of the sites were new builds and ten were renovation projects.
RESULTS: High compliance with best practices was not observed for several factors, including having hands free while climbing (46%) and using minimum forces (72%). There was a notable trend toward more hazards on renovation build projects than on new construction sites; however, these differences were not statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: There was not sufficient evidence to show that stepladder fall hazards are more prevalent on renovation projects than on new build projects. Having hands free while climbing and using minimum forces were two practices needing more wide-scale adoption regardless of construction job type."
21520610,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21520610/,"BACKGROUND: The Japanese Society of Anesthesiologists (JSA) has investigated the incidence of postoperative pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) for several years.
METHODS: According to the JSA project, we surveyed the annual incidence of postoperative PTE in Kanazawa Medical University Hospital in 2008.
RESULTS: PTE was diagnosed radiographically in 6 out of 2339 patients, who were > or =15 years of age and had undergone surgical procedures under general anesthesia. The incidence was 0.257% and approximately tenfold that reported by the JSA. All the patients were subjected to lower extremity surgery. Two patients went into shock after they had first walked postoperatively. Symptoms of the other four patients were nonspecific but surgeons in charge suspected PTE.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the actual incidence of postoperative PTE in Japan may be far greater than that reported by the JSA."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three hundred and thirteen patients with 313 lower M3 were assigned to be operated by either a DS or an OS, depending on the estimated difficulty of the surgery. During the post-operative week patients recorded pain (VAS) and other complications. Complications were also recorded objectively 1 week post-operatively.
RESULTS: Operations performed by DSs lasted longer than operations performed by OSs (P < 0.001). There was no difference in immediate post-operative pain intensity between the two groups. There were no differences in patients' perception of bleeding, trismus, bad taste, use of analgesics, absence from work/school and seeking professional help between the two groups. Dry socket occurred more frequently though in patients in the DS group (P = 0.008). There was no difference in the frequency of objectively assessed swelling, paraesthesia or infection.
CONCLUSIONS: When appropriately selected, patients operated by DSs did not perceive more immediate post-operative pain or complications than patients operated by OSs. However, dry socket and the risk of severe pain caused by this condition occurred more frequently in patients operated by DSs. The criteria used for selection of operations for DSs seem acceptable."
21521038,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21521038/,"BACKGROUND: Various alternative airway devices have been developed in the last several years. Among these is the Supraglottic Airway Laryngopharyngeal Tube (SALT), which was designed to function as a basic mechanical airway and as an endotracheal tube (ET) introducer for blind endotracheal intubation (ETI).
OBJECTIVE: To determine the rate of successful placement of the SALT and the success rate of subsequent blind ET insertion by a cohort of emergency medical services (EMS) providers of varying levels of EMS certification.
METHODS: This study was a two-phase, two-group nonblinded, prospective time trial using a convenience cohort of prehospital providers to determine the success rate for SALT placement (i.e., the basic life support [BLS] phase) and ET placement using the SALT (i.e., the advanced life support [ALS] phase) in an unembalmed human cadaver model. The part 1 cohort (group 1) comprised predominantly basic and intermediate emergency medical technician (EMT)-level providers, whereas the part 2 cohort (group 2) comprised exclusively paramedic-level providers.
RESULTS: In group 1, 51 (98%) of the subjects were able to successfully place the SALT and ventilate the cadaver (BLS phase), with 48 (92.3%) subjects successfully placing it on the first attempt. In group 2, 21 (96%) of the subjects were able to successfully place the SALT, with 19 (86%) placing the SALT on the first attempt. Successful blind placement of an ET through the SALT (ALS phase) by group 1 was 48.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 34-62), with 37% (95% CI: 24-51) placing the ET on the first attempt. In group 2, 20 subjects (91% [95% CI: 71-99]) were able to successfully place an ET through the SALT, with 13 (59% [95% CI: 36-79]) doing so on the first attempt.
CONCLUSIONS: Emergency medical services providers of varying levels can successfully and rapidly place the SALT and ventilate a cadaver specimen. The success rate for blind placement of an ET through the SALT was suboptimal."
21521308,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21521308/,"OBJECTIVE: Delivery of iodine to the foetus depends not only on maternal dietary iodine intake but also on the presence of a functioning placental transport system. A role for the placenta as an iodine storage organ has been suggested, and this study compares the iodine content of placentas from women giving birth at term in Ireland and Iran, areas with median urinary iodine of 79 and 206 μg/l respectively.
DESIGN: Placental cotyledon iodine was measured using an alkaline ashing technique with Sandell-Kolthoff kinetic colorimetry. Samples were taken from six sites from the centre and periphery of each cotyledon. Placentas (Ireland n = 58; Iran n = 45) were obtained from consecutive euthyroid women delivering at term.
RESULTS: The median placental iodine (μg/g wet weight) was significantly higher in Iranian than in Irish women (187·2 μg/g vs 34·3 μg/g; P < 0·001). The distribution of individual placental iodine values showed that values >50μg/g were found in 71·0% of Iranian and in only 21·0% of Irish samples. In Irish subjects, the relationship of placental iodine to pregnant population urinary iodine (UI) (ng/g:μg/l) was 1:2 (40:79), while in Iranians this ratio is closer to 1:1 (211:206).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings, by demonstrating an apparent ability of the placenta to store iodine in a concentration-dependent manner, suggest a hitherto undetected role for the placenta. Whether placental iodine has a role in protecting the foetus from inadequacies in maternal dietary iodine intake is as yet unknown."
21521353,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21521353/,"OBJECTIVES: To address three questions: (i) does oral infection cause cardiovascular disease (CVD)? (ii) what kind of uncertainty is there in the relationship between oral infection and CVD? and (iii) how do we handle this uncertainty in practice: what should we do?
METHODS: Conceptual analysis with basis in standard methods in philosophy of science and ethics. In particular, the study refers to theories of causality and uncertainty, as well as decision making theory.
RESULTS: Whether oral infections cause CVD deeply depends on what we mean by causality. An investigation of the most prominent conceptions of causality suggests that it is far from obvious that oral infection causes CVD. A further analysis reveals that uncertainty occurs as risk, specific uncertainty, ignorance, and indeterminacy, which has implications for how we should handle oral infections. One option is to apply the precautionary principle. Another option is to attribute a cause owing to the strong social commitment to prevent CVD.
CONCLUSIONS: A conceptual analysis shows that it is not obvious that oral infections cause CVD and that the question of causality does not only involve descriptive issues of science but also moral matters of society. Hence, whether oral infections cause CVD is an ethical and not only a scientific issue."
21521884,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21521884/,"OBJECTIVE: This prospective study evaluates the efficacy of using a single miniplate at the inferior border in the management of a displaced angle fracture.
STUDY DESIGN: Case series with chart review.
SETTING: Pt. B.D. Sharma University of Health Sciences.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Fifty-two patients with angle fracture of the mandible were evaluated. All fractures were displaced. The displacement of fracture was assessed on panoramic radiography by measuring the displacement of the inferior alveolar canal. Fractures with displacement greater than 2 mm were included in the study. Fixation with a 4-hole noncompression miniplate along the inferior border and 2 bicortical screws on each side of the fracture was done.
RESULTS: Among these 52 patients, 20 sustained isolated angle fracture, 2 sustained bilateral angle fracture, and 30 sustained angle fracture associated with contralateral parasymphysis or body fracture. Five patients (9.5%) experienced complications. All were considered minor and did not require hospitalization. Two had a slight occlusal discrepancy requiring selective occlusal grinding, and 2 minor infections were managed by incision and drainage. One patient suffered from paresis of the facial nerve that resolved itself after 3 months.
CONCLUSION: Based on this single study, at a single institution, we can conclude that outcomes are acceptable in our patients, but there is very limited ability to generalize the results to different practice settings. Because of these limitations, a multicenter study with an appropriate comparison group is required to substantiate a more generalizable conclusion of efficacy of this single miniplate at inferior border."

DESIGN: Cross-sectional analyses of nationally representative data from the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys (2001-2003).
SETTING: In-person household interviews.
PARTICIPANTS: Older adults aged 60 and older (N = 1,840), including non-Hispanic Whites (N = 351), Blacks (N = 826), Hispanics (N = 406), and Asians (N = 257).
MEASUREMENTS: SRMH was measured with a single item, ""How would you rate your own mental health?"" Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), diagnoses for mood and anxiety disorders were measured with the World Health Organization's World Mental Health version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview.
RESULTS: Results from logistic regression analyses showed significant main effects of both SRMH and race/ethnicity on the presence of mood and anxiety disorders: people who have poor SRMH and are non-Hispanic Whites were more likely to have mood and anxiety disorders. There were also significant interaction effects between SRMH and race/ethnicity, such that the relation of SRMH with diagnoses of psychiatric disorders was strongest in non-Hispanic Whites.
CONCLUSIONS: Racial/ethnic variations were found in the relationship between self-perception of mental health and DSM-IV psychiatric disorders. The findings suggest the need to develop race/ethnicity-specific strategies to screen psychiatric disorders in diverse elderly populations. Future studies are needed to investigate possible reasons for the racial/ethnic group differences."
21523497,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21523497/,"BACKGROUND: While tuberculosis (TB) has been found in many parts of the body, involvement of the thyroid gland is rare. In this study we describe the clinicopathological characteristics of seven patients with primary thyroid tuberculosis (TTB).
METHODS: This report is a retrospective case study of seven patients with thyroid tuberculosis who were treated surgically in our clinic between 2004 and 2010. Data collected from the cases included age, sex, clinical presentation, concurrent medical illness, initial diagnosis, and history of pulmonary tuberculosis. Testing used to establish the diagnosis of TTB included thyroid function tests, histopathological examination, a tuberculin skin test, and FNAC (fine needle aspiration cytology). Surgical procedures, antitubercular therapy, and follow-up data were also analyzed.
RESULTS: All seven cases were females between the age of 30 and 60 years (mean = 44.1 ± 9.5 years). Four cases had neck swelling and three had additional complaints of dysphagia and dyspnea. While total thyroidectomy was performed in six patients with multinodular goiter, a lobectomy was performed in one patient in whom a solitary thyroid nodule was detected. Histopathologic changes consistent with thyroid tuberculosis were detected in all patients. Thoracic X-ray, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) test, and tuberculin skin test (PPD) were performed and all patients were screened for other possible foci of infection. In conclusion, all seven cases were diagnosed with primary tuberculosis. While the lobectomy patient was administered a 6-month antitubercular treatment, the total-thyroidectomy patients did not receive any medical treatment postoperatively. During the postoperative follow-up period, which lasted between 6 and 53 months (mean = 37.3 ± 18.6 months), none of the patients had a recurrence of disease.
CONCLUSION: Tuberculosis should be considered in the list of differential diagnoses for thyroid abscesses and nodular lesions in people living in geographic regions with a high tuberculosis prevalence."
21523511,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21523511/,"PURPOSE: Several poorly water-soluble drugs have previously been shown to bind to intestinal (I-FABP) and liver fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP) in vitro. The purpose of this study was to examine the potential role of drug binding to FABPs on intestinal permeability and gut wall metabolism in vivo.
METHODS: The intestinal permeability of ibuprofen, progesterone and midazolam (which bind FABPs) and propranolol (which does not) was examined using an autoperfused recirculating permeability model in control rats and rats where FABP levels were upregulated via pre-feeding a fat-rich diet.
RESULTS: The intestinal permeability of drugs which bind FABPs in vitro was increased in animals where FABP levels were upregulated by prefeeding a high fat diet. The gut wall metabolism of midazolam was also reduced in animals with elevated FABP levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with their role in the cellular transport of endogenous lipophilic substrates, FABPs appear to facilitate the intracellular disposition of drug molecules that bind FABPs in vitro. Drug binding to FABPs in the enterocyte may also attenuate gut wall metabolism in a manner analogous to the reduction in hepatic extraction mediated by drug binding to plasma proteins in the systemic circulation."
21523766,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21523766/,"BACKGROUND: There is limited evidence regarding the effectiveness of multidisciplinary team (MDT) meetings in lung cancer. The objective of this study was to compare the patterns of care for patients with newly diagnosed lung cancer who were presented at a lung cancer MDT meeting with the patterns of care for patients who were not presented.
METHODS: All patients who had lung cancer newly diagnosed in South West Sydney (SWS) between December 1, 2005, and December 31, 2008, were identified from the local Clinical Cancer Registry. Patient and tumor characteristics and treatment receipt were compared between patients who were and were not presented at MDT meetings. A logistic regression model was constructed to determine predictors for receiving treatment and survival.
RESULTS: In total, there were 988 patients, including 504 patients who were presented at MDT meetings and 484 who were not presented at MDT meetings. The median patient age was 69 years and 73 years in the MDT group and the non-MDT group, respectively (P < .01). There was no pathologic diagnosis for 13% of non-MDT patients compared with 4% of MDT patients (P < .01). Treatment receipt for MDT patients versus non-MDT patients was 12% versus 13%, respectively, for surgery (P value nonsignificant); 66% versus 33%, respectively, for radiotherapy (P < .001); 46% versus 29%, respectively, for chemotherapy (P < .001); and 66% versus 53%, respectively, for palliative care (P < .001). In patients with good performance status, the MDT group had significantly better receipt of radiotherapy among patients with stage I through IV nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and had significantly better receipt of chemotherapy among patients with stage IV NSCLC. MDT discussion was an independent predictor of receiving radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and referral to palliative care but did not influence survival.
CONCLUSIONS: MDT discussion was associated with better treatment receipt, which potentially may improve quality of life for patients with lung cancer. However, it did not improve survival."
21523882,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21523882/,"OBJECTIVES: To assess safety and effectiveness of balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) in patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis (AS) and significant aortic regurgitation.
BACKGROUND: BAV is a palliative procedure that has possibly been underused in patients with symptomatic AS not suitable for surgical aortic valve replacement or transcatheter aortic valve implantation. Significant aortic regurgitation is commonly perceived as a contraindication to BAV.
METHODS: Among 416 consecutive patients undergoing BAV at our Institution, 73 patients showed moderate or severe AR before the procedure. Demographics and baseline characteristics, as well as in-hospital clinical outcome, have been prospectively collected in a dedicated database. Transthoracic echocardiography was regularly performed in all patients undergoing BAV before the procedure and at hospital discharge.
RESULTS: Patients had a high-risk profile, confirmed by advanced age (77.2 ± 11.8 years) and important comorbidity (logistic Euroscore 26.5 ± 16.3%). Advanced heart failure was present in 73.9%. Indication to BAV was cardiogenic shock in 9.6%, palliation in 31.5%, bridge in 58.9% of the patients. BAV was performed with standard retrograde approach. Aortic valve area increased from 0.62 ± 0.15 cm(2) at baseline to 0.83 ± 0.17 cm(2) before discharge (P < 0.001). The degree of AR was improved or unchanged in 65 patients (89%). In-hospital mortality was 6.9%, mainly limited to terminal patients. Symptomatic status at discharge was improved in all surviving patients. Acute AR occurred in seven patients; in five of them it was successfully resolved in the catheterization laboratory.
CONCLUSIONS: When clinically indicated, BAV can be safely performed in patients with combined aortic stenosis and significant aortic regurgitation."
21524177,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21524177/,"INTRODUCTION: The intraperitoneal behavior of a prosthetic material used to repair a hernia is key to the success of the postimplant repair process. This study was designed to laparoscopically examine the real-time behavior of three composite meshes incorporating a chemical adhesion barrier when placed in contact with the visceral peritoneum.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The defects of 7 × 5 cm were created in the ventral abdominal wall of 18 New Zealand White rabbits and repaired using Parietex Composite® (n = 6), Sepramesh® (n = 6), or Proceed® (n = 6). At 24 hr, 3, 7, and 14 days postimplant, adhesion formation was quantified by subjecting photographs obtained during laparoscopy to image analysis. At 14 days, specimens of the implants and surrounding host tissue were obtained for histologic, morphometric, and immunohistochemical analyses.
RESULTS: There were no cases of infection and/or rejection of the implant. Adhesion formation followed by laparoscopy 3, 7, and 14 days after implant was significantly lower for Parietex® than the other biomaterials. Degradation of the chemical barrier occurred earliest in Sepramesh®, this barrier being most stable at 14 days for the Parietex® implants. Macrophage counts were significantly greater for Sepramesh®. The thickness of the neoformed peritoneum formed on the three implants varied significantly (p < .05): 276.89 ± 38.87 μm, 84.49 ± 19.05 μm, and 161.97 ± 47.05 μm, respectively for Paritex®, Sepramesh®, and Proceed®.
CONCLUSIONS: (a) The most stable barrier against biodegradation was that of Parietex®; (b) the first postimplant week was the most critical period for adhesion formation; and (c) all three biomaterials showed good intraperitoneal behavior."

The purpose of the present study was to define the safety of sedation and the tolerance of ERCP procedures in the extremely elderly patients at our institution, in which sedation is provided and controlled by endo team only.
METHODS: Forty-one ERCP procedures were performed in patients aged 90 years or older. All patients had chronic concomitant diseases, and 88% of the patients belonged to American Society of Anesthesiologists group IV. The patients were sedated with midazolam, and 7 out of 41 patients received fentanyl.
RESULTS: All ERCP procedures except one could be successfully completed, indicating good tolerance in 98% of the patients. There were neither sedation-related complications nor procedural mortality. In none of the cases, anesthesiologist assistance was needed.
CONCLUSIONS: Routine anesthesiological assistance in ERCP procedures in the elderly seems unnecessary."
21524650,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21524650/,"BACKGROUND: Novel strategies to improve hand function after stroke are needed. Electromyography-triggered functional neuromuscular stimulation (EMG-FNMS) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) are promising techniques to facilitate recovery of sensory-motor hand dysfunction after stroke.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate if 1Hz rTMS over the contralesional primary motor cortex enhances the effectiveness of EMG-triggered FNMS of the hand and finger extensors to improve severe sensory-motor hand dysfunction after stroke.
METHODS: 24 subjects with a first stroke received 10 daily sessions of 20 min EMG-triggered FNMS of the hand and finger extensors of the affected forearm preceded by 15 min of either 1Hz rTMS (rTMS group, n = 12) or sham rTMS (control group, n = 12) over the contralesional primary motor cortex. Prior to and after each intervention motor function and spasticity were rated at both hands, and cortical excitability of the contralesional primary motor cortex was assessed.
RESULTS: Motor function and spasticity of the affected hand were significantly improved by either intervention, whereas behavioural measures of the unaffected hand did not change. There were no significant differences between both intervention groups. Improvement of motor function of the affected hand was positively correlated with cortical excitability of the contralesional primary motor cortex after EMG-triggered FNMS preceded by 1Hz rTMS.
CONCLUSIONS: 1Hz rTMS does not enhance the general effectiveness of EMG-FNMS to the wrist and finger extensors of the affected forearm after stroke. Motor recovery of the severely affected hand after stroke appears to depend on excitability of the contralesional primary motor cortex."
21524878,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21524878/,"BACKGROUND: Vertigo is a common emergency department (ED) complaint with benign and serious etiologies with overlapping features. Misdiagnosis of acute stroke may result in significant morbidity and mortality. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is superior to computer tomography (CT) for diagnosis of acute stroke but is costly with limited availability.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify clinical characteristics associated with a cerebrovascular cause for vertigo.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review on patients with an MRI for vertigo, with or without additional historical or physical examination findings, over 18 months. Study patients were seen in the ED for vertigo within 2 weeks of MRI. Data collected included medical history, physical findings, and imaging results. Fisher's exact test was used to identify factors associated with the primary outcome, an acute stroke.
RESULTS: There were 325 eligible patients; 131 were ED patients. Patients were 57 (± 18) years, and 53% were women. There were 12 ED patients with a new stroke (9.2%). Two variables were associated with acute stroke: a presenting complaint of gait instability (odds ratio, 9.3; 95% confidence interval, 2.6-33.9) or a subtle neurologic finding (odds ratio, 8.7; 95% confidence interval, 2.3-33.1). One patient with a new stroke had a prior stroke, 3 were age >65 years, and none had coronary artery disease or dysrhythmia. Among patients with acute stroke, 5 also had head CT, and none detected the stroke.
CONCLUSIONS: This study identified 2 variables associated with acute stroke that should be considered in the evaluation of ED patients with vertigo. Head CT was inadequate for diagnosing acute stroke in this patient population."
21524968,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21524968/,"BACKGROUND: Empiric antibiotics are frequently given for children with acute exudative tonsillitis. A few studies have investigated the causative agent of acute ""exudative"" tonsillitis in children to evaluate the necessity of antibiotic therapy. This study tried to explore the common causative agent of acute exudative tonsillitis among children.
METHODS: From April 2009 to March 2010, throat swabs were obtained and cultured for viruses and bacteria from children who visited the pediatric emergency rooms of two medical centers in central Taiwan with acute exudative tonsillitis. Demographic data and microbiological results were analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 294 children with acute exudative tonsillitis were enrolled during the 1-year prospective study, and 173 (58.8%) of them were younger than 7 years. Group A streptococci were isolated from only three (1.0%) children, and they were all older than 6 years. A total of 143 viruses were isolated from 140 (47.6%) children. Adenovirus (18.7%) and enterovirus (16.3%) were the most common viral etiologies, followed by influenza virus (5.4%), parainfluenza virus (5.1%), herpes simplex virus Type 1 (2.7%), and respiratory syncytial virus (0.3%). Group A streptococcus only contributed to a minimal portion of acute exudative tonsillitis.
CONCLUSION: Routine or immediate antibiotic therapy for acute exudative tonsillitis in children is not necessary."
21525737,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21525737/,"OBJECTIVE: Early detection of uterine papillary serous (UPSC), clear cell (CCC), and grade 3 endometrioid carcinomas (G3EC) - all poor prognostic variants of endometrial carcinoma (EC) - is of particular clinical relevance. The study objective was to assess the utility of liquid-based cytology (Pap) in the detection of high-grade EC.
STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective, two-institution analysis of patients diagnosed with UPSC, CCC, or G3EC with a preoperative Pap from 1999 to 2010 was conducted.
RESULTS: One hundred and one patients were evaluated; 51.5% had UPSC, 27.7% had CCC, and 20.8% had G3EC. Stage I/II disease was found in 69.3% of patients, and 46/101 patients (45.5%) had abnormal Paps. Significantly more patients with UPSC had abnormal Paps (65.7%) than those with CCC (25%) or G3EC (23.8%; p < 0.001). An abnormal Pap was the only presenting clinical finding in a significant number of asymptomatic UPSC patients (26.9%) compared with 4% of patients with CCC and G3EC (p = 0.005). On multivariate analysis, UPSC histology was the only variable associated with an abnormal Pap.
CONCLUSIONS: A high incidence of abnormal cervical cytology was observed in women with high-grade EC, particularly in UPSC patients. Although hypothesis generating, a proportion of asymptomatic UPSC patients had abnormal cytology, signifying that Pap smear screening may help detect the disease before the patient develops symptoms."
21526872,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21526872/,"BACKGROUND: in recent years many factors have been shown to influence dose received by the patient during ERCP. Therefore it is necessary to update radio induced cancer risk.
OBJECTIVES: to calculate lifetime attributable risk of cancer during ERCP. To compare the risk with the most common X-ray examinations.
DESIGN: descriptive study with 393 consecutive ERCP performed at one center. Equipment used was Philips BV pulsera. In each exploration demographic and anthropometric variables of the patient were collected. Dosimetric quantities were calculated from exposure parameters. Effective dose was estimated using specific conversion factors. Organ doses and radio induced cancer incidence was estimated.
RESULTS: dose area product was 0.82 mGym2(IQR 0.4-1.5) with an average fluoroscopy time of 2 minutes and 45 seconds. Entrance surface dose was 30.7 mGy (IQR 15-60.8) and effective dose was 0.44 mSv (IQR 0.2-0.9). Multivariate analysis identified that difficult papillary cannulation (β 0.4; p = 0.009), patient age (β-0.01; p = 0.001) and therapeutic applied (β= 0.89; p < 0.001) influenced dose-area product. The ERCP dose would be equivalent to the radiation received by twenty chest radiographs and would be about fourteen times smaller than a barium enema or twenty times less than that received during an abdominal CT. Life-time attributable risk of cancer incidence was 4.08 and 16.81 per million procedures in diagnostic and therapeutic ERCP respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: from the radiological point of view, ERCP is a safe technique that uses low exposure levels compared to other explorations commonly used in medicine. It implies a reasonably low risk of radio induced cancer."
21527042,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21527042/,"BACKGROUND: Road safety targets are widely used and provide a basis for evaluating progress in road safety outcomes against a quantified goal. In Australia, a reduction in fatalities from road traffic crashes (RTCs) is a public policy objective: a national target of no more than 5.6 fatalities per 100,000 population by 2010 was set in 2001. The purpose of this paper is to examine the progress Australia and its states and territories have made in reducing RTC fatalities, and to estimate when the 2010 target may be reached by the jurisdictions.
METHODS: Following a descriptive analysis, univariate time-series models estimate past trends in fatality rates over recent decades. Data for differing time periods are analysed and different trend specifications estimated. Preferred models were selected on the basis of statistical criteria and the period covered by the data. The results of preferred regressions are used to determine out-of-sample forecasts of when the national target may be attained by the jurisdictions. Though there are limitations with the time series approach used, inadequate data precluded the estimation of a full causal/structural model.
RESULTS: Statistically significant reductions in fatality rates since 1971 were found for all jurisdictions with the national rate decreasing on average, 3% per year since 1992. However the gains have varied across time and space, with percent changes in fatality rates ranging from an 8% increase in New South Wales 1972-1981 to a 46% decrease in Queensland 1982-1991. Based on an estimate of past trends, it is possible that the target set for 2010 may not be reached nationally, until 2016. Unsurprisingly, the analysis indicated a range of outcomes for the respective state/territory jurisdictions though these results should be interpreted with caution due to different assumptions and length of data.
CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that while Australia has been successful over recent decades in reducing RTC mortality, an important gap between aspirations and achievements remains. Moreover, unless there are fairly radical (""trend-breaking"") changes in the factors that affect the incidence of RTC fatalities, deaths from RTCs are likely to remain above the national target in some areas of Australia, for years to come."
21527213,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21527213/,"PURPOSE: To study the relationship between the age of completion of toilet training during daytime and the onset of dysfunctional elimination syndrome (DES).
METHODS: The present study was designed as a case-control study. A total of 80 patients with DES were allocated to the case group and 80 patients age- and gender-matched without DES were allocated to the control group. The patients with DES were seen in a tertiary center and the control patients were seen in a primary care center. Early completion of toilet training was considered to be before 24 months.
RESULTS: Patients were aged 3-17 years (mean: 7.55); 24 were male (30%) and 56 female (70%). The most frequent lower urinary tract symptoms were: urgency (77%), incontinence (75%), holding maneuvers (30%), high urinary frequency (61%) and low urinary frequency (16%). There was a history of urinary tract infection (UTI) in 62% of the DES group. The first UTI episode was before toilet training in 40%. The completion of toilet training was before the age of 2 years in 48% of DES patients and in 50% of the control group (p = 0.752) [odds ratio (OR) 0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49-1.62].
CONCLUSION: The completion of toilet training before 24 months of age was not associated with DES. Some patients had DES symptoms such as UTI, infrequent voiding and constipation before toilet training. These findings suggest that DES may precede toilet training and this possibility should be confirmed in further studies."
21527360,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21527360/,"BACKGROUND: The Fontan circulation is a palliative procedure performed in patients with complex congenital heart disease (CHD), making transpulmonary blood flow dependent on the systemic venous pressure. In a Fontan circulation a low pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is crucial, as is epitomized by the observation that a high PVR is a strong predictor of mortality. Long-term follow-up has shown that PVR may rise many years after the Fontan procedure has been performed, possibly due to micro-emboli from a dilated right atrium or from the venous system. Other mechanisms of increased PVR might be aging, obstructed airways caused by lymphatic dysfunction, lack of pulsatile pulmonary flow causing a release of endothelium-derived vasoactive molecules, and prolonged overexpression of vasoconstrictors such as endothelin-1. Mean plasma level of endothelin-1 has been shown to be significantly higher in Fontan patients compared to healthy controls. In patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), therapy with bosentan, an endothelin-1 receptor antagonist, has demonstrated to improve exercise capacity and to reduce the elevated PVR. In addition, reduction of PVR is shown early and late after the Fontan procedure on treatment with exogenous NO, another advanced PAH therapy. However, the long term effect of reducing the PVR by bosentan treatment on exercise capacity in Fontan patients is still unknown.
METHODS: We designed a prospective, multicenter, randomized open label trial to study the effect of bosentan in Fontan patients. The primary endpoint will be the change in maximum exercise capacity (peak V'O2).
CONCLUSION: We hypothesize that treatment with bosentan, an endothelin-1 receptor antagonist, improves maximum exercise capacity and functional capacity in adult Fontan patients."

METHODS: In this descriptive study, 218 interns in surgery and internal medicine wards at four teaching hospitals of Tehran University of Medical Sciences were enrolled during the first semester of the 2007/2008 academic year. Each intern completed one questionnaire for faculty and one for residents in their ward.
RESULTS: The questionnaire was completed by 150 students (68.8%) for faculty and by 139 students (63.7%) for residents. In terms of overall aspects of professionalism, the mean (±SD) score on observing professionalism was 52.9±10 and 49.26±7.9 points out of 70 for faculty and residents, respectively. Students agreed that responsibility was observed better than other aspects of professionalism (119/150 (79.3%) and 115/139 (82.8%) students stated it was often or always observed by faculty and residents, respectively). In both groups, commitment to honour and integrity and excellence was less compared with other areas.
CONCLUSION: Medical faculty and residents should be more aware of their behaviour and attitudes in practice, especially their interaction with colleagues so that students' professional behaviour can be improved."

METHOD: Maternal labor/delivery and corresponding childbirth records of 172 regionally diverse, heterogeneous children, ages 3 to 25, were examined with respect to 21 potential predictors of later ADHD onset, including 17 selected obstetric complications, familial ADHD incidence, and gender. ADHD diagnosis and history of perinatal Pitocin exposure distinguished groups for comparison.
RESULTS: Results revealed a strong predictive relationship between perinatal Pitocin exposure and subsequent childhood ADHD onset (occurring in 67.1% of perinatal Pitocin cases vs. 35.6% in nonexposure cases, χ(2)=16.99, p<.001). Fetal exposure time, gestation length, and labor length also demonstrated predictive power, albeit significantly lower.
CONCLUSION: The findings warrant further investigation into the potential link between perinatal Pitocin exposure and subsequent ADHD diagnosis."
21527764,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21527764/,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Improved methods are required to identify the subgroup of patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis who will have stroke develop. It has been suggested that impaired cerebral reactivity (CVR) may predict high risk, but no multicenter studies have examined this.
METHODS: In a preplanned substudy of Asymptomatic Carotid Emboli Study, 106 patients were recruited with ≥70% asymptomatic carotid stenosis. Transcranial Doppler was used to measure CVR with a vasodilatory response of carbon dioxide or acetazolamide. A meta-analysis of the data with previously published studies was performed.
RESULTS: Thirty-two of 106 (30.2%) had severely impaired CVR ipsilateral to the study artery. Mean follow-up was 680 days. There were no ipsilateral strokes. There was a nonsignificant trend to more secondary end points of any stroke/TIA in patients with severely impaired CVR. Three of 32 (9.4%) had impaired CVR compared with 2 of 74 (2.7%) without (hazard ratio, 2.54; 95% CI, 0.61-21.74; P=0.158). On meta-analysis of the Asymptomatic Carotid Emboli Study data with previous studies, impaired CVR was associated with increased risk of ipsilateral stroke alone (OR, 6.14; 95% CI, 1.27-29.5; P=0.02), ipsilateral stroke or TIA (OR, 4.76; 95% CI, 1.86-12.16; P=0.001), and any stroke (OR, 4.66; 95% CI, 1.69-12.85; P=0.003).
CONCLUSIONS: In this international multicenter study, we found no association between impaired CVR and recurrent events, but the study was underpowered because of the low event rate. Meta-analysis of available data suggested an association between impaired CVR and future risk. However, currently there are insufficient data to justify the routine clinical use of CVR to stratify risk in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis for selection for carotid endarterectomy."
21527844,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21527844/,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the rationality of the seventh edition of TNM staging system on tumor deposits (TDs) and propose a novel subclassification.
SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The TDs had been debated for many years. The seventh edition of TNM staging system proposed a ""pN1c"" concept. However, the value of the modification is still debated.
METHODS: A total of 1541 patients with colorectal cancer were reviewed. Overall survival rates were compared between patients without LNM but TD (+), and those who were TD (-). The TDs were stratified into the ""any T + any N"" category. Two-step multivariate analysis was performed to identify significant prognostic factors. Univariate analysis was used to determine whether a correlation existed between the number of TDs and prognosis.
RESULTS: There was a significant prognostic difference between patients without LNM or TDs compared with those with positive TDs. Only in T3N2bM0 there was a significant prognostic difference between LNM (+), TD (+) patients and TD (-) patients. The seventh edition of TNM staging system was substituted by the novel TNM staging system in 2-step multivariate analysis. Only in T3N1cM0 there was a significant prognostic difference between patients with only 1 TD and those with more than 1 TD.
CONCLUSION: The seventh edition of TNM staging system on TDs satisfactorily predicts patients' outcome for those without LNM. Patients who categorized as T3N2bM0TD (+) and T4N2bM0TD (-/+) should be reclassified as stage IV. Number of TDs was not an independent prognostic parameter in the TNM staging system."
21527906,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21527906/,"OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether, among very low-birth-weight (VLBW) neonates, the platelet mass was associated with common perinatal factors, and whether a low platelet mass in the first days following birth was associated with a higher incidence and/or severity of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH).
STUDY DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional, retrospective cohort analysis of VLBW infants admitted to a level 3 neonatal intensive care unit from June 2003 to July 2006, n=408. Platelet mass was calculated and recorded on the day of birth and for 2 consecutive days thereafter. All neonates had a screening cranial sonogram on day 4 of life. Statistical analysis included analysis of variance and Mann-Whitney U-test.
RESULT: Neonates born to mothers with pre-eclampsia had a smaller platelet mass (1921 fl/nl ± 603 vs 2297 fl/nl ± 747; P<0.01). The same was found among neonates with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). In contrast, neonates born after histological chorioamnionitis had a larger platelet mass (2400 fl/nl ± 749 vs 2036 fl/nl ± 674; P<0.01). No effect of platelet mass, measured on the day of birth, was observed related the outcomes of IVH, severe IVH or death. However, those with a platelet mass <10th percentile on the 2 subsequent days following birth were more likely to have severe IVH or death.
CONCLUSION: Among VLBW neonates, pre-eclampsia and IUGR are associated with a lower platelet mass, owing to their effect on platelet count. Histological chorioamnionits is associated with a larger platelet mass. A mass <10th percentile on the days following birth was associated with severe IVH and/or death, but it remains unclear whether this is a cause of, or an effect of, the IVH."
21527907,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21527907/,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to identify whether tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (-308) and interleukin (IL)-10 (-1082; -819) genotypes were associated with preterm delivery and cystic periventricular leucomalacia (PVL).
STUDY DESIGN: Venous blood, buccal swabs or cord blood were collected from mother/child pairs with infants born at term (200) or preterm (106) in the presence and absence of neonatal PVL and of premature infants with PVL (7). Extracted genomic DNA served as template for determination of IL-10 (-1082), IL-10 (-819) and TNF-α (-308) genotypes by allele-specific PCR.
RESULT: No significant difference was observed in the frequencies of IL-10 (-1082), IL-10 (-819) and TNF-α (-308) genotypes in mothers or in children of term versus preterm deliveries with or without PVL.
CONCLUSION: Maternal and infant IL-10 (-1082, -819) and TNF-α (-308) genotypes are not indicative for an increased risk of preterm birth or the development of PVL in premature newborns."
21527908,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21527908/,"OBJECTIVE: With increasing use of routine prenatal ultrasound, prenatal counseling after diagnosis of congenital malformations is frequently offered to prospective parents. We aimed to assess if the communication of diagnosis of a congenital anomaly in the fetus meets American Psychiatric Association (APA) criteria for trauma in parents.
STUDY DESIGN: In the period ranging from 2003 to 2009 a preliminary investigation was conducted with 165 prospective mothers and 91 prospective fathers being interviewed after communication of diagnosis. Analysis of statements was made independently by two psychologists considering the APA definition of trauma.
RESULT: A total of 145 mothers and 76 fathers experienced the communication of diagnosis in their fetus as a traumatic event. There was no correlation between type of malformation and trauma nor was there statistical difference between mother and father regarding the stressor.
CONCLUSION: Communication of diagnosis of a fetal anomaly can be a traumatic event and should be dealt with consequently. Given the therapeutic value of sharing traumatic experience such practice should be encouraged as part of the consultation process."
21527909,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21527909/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether phenobarbital (PB) given before therapeutic hypothermia to infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) augments the neuroprotective efficacy of hypothermia.
STUDY DESIGN: Records of 68 asphyxiated infants of 36 weeks' gestation, who received hypothermia for moderate or severe HIE were reviewed. Some of these infants received PB prophylactically or for clinical seizures. All surviving infants had later brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The composite primary outcome of neonatal death related to HIE with worsening multiorgan dysfunction despite maximal treatment, and the presence of post-hypothermia brain MRI abnormalities consistent with hypoxic-ischemic brain injury, were compared between the infants who received PB before initiation of hypothermia (PB group, n=36) and the infants who did not receive PB before or during hypothermia (No PB group, n=32). Forward logistic regression analysis determined which of the pre-hypothermia clinical and laboratory variables predict the primary outcome.
RESULT: The two groups were similar for severity of asphyxia as assessed by Apgar scores, initial blood pH and base deficit, early neurologic examination, and presence of an intrapartum sentinel event. The composite primary outcome was more frequent in infants from the PB group (PB 78% versus No PB 44%, P=0.006, odds ratio 4.5, 95% confidence interval 1.6 to 12.8). Multivariate analysis identified only the PB receipt before initiation of hypothermia (P=0.002, odds ratio 9.5, 95% confidence interval 2.3 to 39.5), and placental abruption to be independently associated with a worse primary outcome.
CONCLUSION: PB treatment before cooling did not improve the composite outcome of neonatal death or the presence of an abnormal post-hypothermia brain MRI, but the long-term outcomes have not yet been evaluated."

OBJECTIVE: To determine the diagnostic utility of swab culture in diabetic foot ulcers.
METHODS: Comparative study of diagnostic utility. Diabetic foot ulcers were classified according to the University of Texas scale. Cultures by biopsy and swabbing were performed. Bacterial identification was performed by standard biochemical methods. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the plate diffusion method. An analysis of the diagnostic test was made, reporting descriptive measures of frequencies.
RESULTS: We obtained specimens for culture from 118 patients. Grade II and III lesions were the most frequently occurring (80%). Overall, 132 organisms were isolated from biopsies and 118 from swabs, with those of the Enterobacteriaceae family being the most frequent (56% from biopsies and 60% from swabs). Swab culture had a calculated sensitivity of 0.85, specificity of 0.86, positive predictive value of 0.98, negative predictive value of 0.43, positive likelihood ratio of 5.9, and negative likelihood ratio of 0.2.

To evaluate the effect of corticosteroids on lumbar spinal fusion we designed a randomized, placebo-controlled animal study using high-dose methylprednisolone sodium succinate, which is widely used in patients with spinal cord injury who are undergoing spinal fusion.
METHODS: Two groups of 18 rabbits underwent a postero-lateral fusion at L5-L6 with autologous bone graft. After surgery, the animals were assigned to receive: (a) methylprednisolone sodium succinate 30 mg/kg over 15 min, followed by an intravenous infusion of 5.4 mg/kg/h for 23 h, or (b) normal saline in the same volume. Animals were killed 8 weeks after surgery; the presence of fusion was analyzed by use of two different methods: a manual palpation test and an antero-posterior radiograph.
RESULTS: Both groups of animals were comparable in weight. Fusion was achieved in 5/18 rabbits (27.8%) in the methylprednisolone group and in 9/18 animals (50%) in the control group (p = 0.17).
CONCLUSION: In a lumbar posterolateral fusion rabbit model, high-dose methylprednisolone sodium succinate reduced the success of lumbar fusion; however, our data did not reach statistical significance."
21528393,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21528393/,"INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: As the subsequent risks of complications and explantation increase with the size of the cuff, we aimed to assess functional outcomes after the implantation of an artificial urinary sphincter (AUS) with a large cuff (≥8 cm) in women with severe urinary incontinence.
METHODS: Fifty women underwent an AUS placement with a large cuff between 1984 and 2007. Forty-three (86%) had previously undergone anti-incontinence procedures. The AUS was implanted with an open surgical technique using a transverse abdominal approach. The cuff was placed around the bladder neck between the periurethral fascia and the vagina. Perioperative complications were reviewed. To assess the resolution of urinary incontinence, all patients were seen at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months and yearly thereafter.
RESULTS: The mean age was 59 ± 12.4 years (26-81). The mean BMI was 27.3 ± 5.1 (19-37). The mean pre-operative closure pressure was 19.1 ± 9.4 cmH(2)O (3-46). The mean hospital stay was 14.1 ± 5 days (5-28). The mean follow-up was 8 ± 5.6 years. Incontinence was completely resolved in 34 women (68%). The protective factors to avoid explantation were a number of gestations less than two (p = 0.04), a closure pressure higher than 19 cmH(2)O (p = 0.04) and a cuff size equivalent to 8 cm (p = 0.005).
CONCLUSIONS: Specific anatomical conditions can sometimes lead to AUS implantation with a large cuff with encouraging outcomes. Thus, surgeons should not be reluctant to place a large cuff when the situation requires it."
21528465,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21528465/,"BACKGROUND: Racial and ethnic disparities in health care are significant predictors of the quality of health care received. Studies documenting these disparities are largely based on an adult chronic care model. There are only few reports in paediatric populations. Our objective was to evaluate the severity of illness of immigrants at admission to PICU, the proportion of immigrants in PICU compared to the general population and the quality of care they receive, in order to examine whether there are disparities in health care.
METHODS: Prospectively collected data of 1009 sequential first admissions in 2007 to a multidisciplinary, 19-bed, PICU of a university children's hospital in Switzerland. The main outcome measures were expected mortality, standardised mortality ratio, proportion of immigrants in general population and in PICU.
RESULTS: Children with an immigrant background are overrepresented in PICU compared with their proportion in the general population. Parents of these children are more likely to be in the lowest strata of socio-professional status than parents of Swiss children hospitalised in PICU (relative risk 9.82, 95% CI 5.16 to 18.7). However, the distribution of immigrant children and Swiss children along the strata of illness severity is equal and there is no difference in standardised mortality ratio between these two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that disparities may exist at a lower level of illness severity, due to many possible reasons (for example shortcomings in primary health care). However, once a child enters tertiary health care, nationality and socio-economic factors no longer influence quality of health care delivery."

Body mass index (BMI) Z-score, LDLcholesterol, and insulin resistance indices (FIGR, R-HOMA) were calculated.
RESULTS: Metabolic syndrome was diagnosed in ten (12.8%) children. Hyperinsulinaemia was present in 42 (53.8%) subjects, increased FIGR in eight (10.3%) and increased R-HOMA in 49 (62.3%). Significant correlations between BMI Z-score ≥ 2.5 and MS occurrence and its components (hypertriglyceridaemia, isolated systolic and diastolic hypertension) were found. Hypertriglyceridaemia, low HDL and hypertension, as well as MS occurrence, correlated significantly with stimulated hyperinsulinaemia and increased FIGR. Risk of hypertension was increased 5.6 times by fasting hyperinsulinaemia. Stimulated hyperinsulinaemia increased the risk of hypertriglyceridaemia 3.7 times, risk of low HDL 14.4 times and risk of MS 10.3 times. These risks did not change significantly when adjusted for BMI Z-score.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study results show that both BMI Z-score and OGTT stimulated hyperinsulinaemia are good predictors of MS occurrence in obese children and adolescents. The risk of dyslipidaemia and hypertension increase significantly with hyperinsulinaemia and insulin resistance, with low HDL cholesterol being the most affected."
21528626,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21528626/,"OBJECTIVE: The overall goal of this observational study was to determine whether modifiable vascular risk factors contribute to the prevalence of pressure ulcers (PrU) in veterans with traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI).
BACKGROUND: Given the increasingly limited financial resources in hospitals and clinics, identifying risk factors associated with the development of PrU in persons with SCI will be a major step in reducing the cost of care for these individuals, and may improve their quality of life.
METHOD: We retrospectively reviewed the electronic charts of 87 veterans with SCI who are being followed regularly in our SCI clinic and are enrolled in the SCI registry. The data collected included the basic demographics, presence of modifiable vascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and current smoking; presence of incontinence and depression; and results from blood drawn for hemoglobin level, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and albumin levels and lipid profile on veteran's initial enrollment. Local Institution Review Board approval was obtained for the protocol.
RESULTS: Of the 87 veterans with SCI, 27 had PrU. Comparisons between those with and without PrU found no significant differences for the demographic variables of age, gender, age of SCI onset, or SCI duration, but there was a trend for the groups to differ in ethnicity (P = 0.05). Similarly, the presence of modifiable vascular risk factors including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and current smoking did not differ between those with and without PrU. There were 36 pressure ulcer sites observed in 27 people. The proportion of pressure ulcer sites (of the 36) significantly differed by SCI severity based on the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) score (P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the presence of PrU was influenced by the severity of the SCl without any contribution from modifiable vascular risk factors."
21528657,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21528657/,"AIMS AND BACKGROUND: For the first time in 2006, cancer became the main cause of death in men in Italy, exceeding cardiovascular disease. The aim of the study was to verify whether the overtaking of cancer male mortality occurred also in Tuscany or in some of its 12 subregional areas and whether there was a geographical trend.
METHODS: Age-standardized mortality rates from the Tuscan Regional Mortality Registry, 1987-2008, were calculated for neoplasms, cardiovascular diseases, and respiratory diseases, considering the whole region and its 12 areas. Joinpoint analyses were carried out to study temporal trend.
RESULTS: Up to 2008, the number of male deaths for neoplasms (6786) in Tuscany did not exceed deaths from cardiovascular disease (7065). Instead, overtaking occurred in some subregional areas from 2004 onwards. When we compared age-standardized mortality rates, cancer became the first cause of death in Tuscany from 2004 onwards (age-standardized mortality rates for cancer 236.5 per 100,000; for cardiovascular disease 227.8 per 100,000). Age-standardized mortality rates for cardiovascular disease recorded an annual 2.4% decrease until 1998, then a 3.5% decrease. Age-standardized mortality rates for all cancers recorded an annual 1.6% decrease in the whole period.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirmed a geographical trend in cancer overtaking as the main cause of death in males: from the more urbanized areas in northern Tuscany, where the phenomenon occurred earlier, to the southern part."
21528666,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21528666/,"BACKGROUND: Accurate intraoperative diagnosis of sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases enables the selection of patients who require axillary lymph node dissection, thus avoiding an additional operation. In this study we investigated the accuracy of intraoperative macroscopic diagnosis of SLN metastases in patients with breast cancer.
METHODS: SLNs from 276 breast cancer patients with clinically negative nodes were analyzed by macroscopic examination. The results of intraoperative macroscopic diagnosis were compared with those of frozen section analysis.
RESULTS: The sensitivity, specificity, overall accuracy, and false negative rate of SLN biopsy in the assessment of node status were 82.1%, 100%, 96.4%, and 17.9%, respectively, for frozen section analysis, and 57.1%, 95.5%, 87.7%, and 42.9%, respectively, for macroscopic evaluation. Even in patients with node metastasis >7 mm, the false negative rate of macroscopic evaluation was 11.1%.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that macroscopic diagnosis is less effective in predicting lymph node status in breast cancer than frozen section analysis. These findings imply that intraoperative macroscopic evaluation of sentinel nodes is never predictive of the final pathology."
21528667,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21528667/,"AIMS AND BACKGROUND: Preoperative embolization of vertebral metastases has been shown to lower intraoperative blood loss. Nevertheless, excessive up to life-threatening blood loss can occur despite embolization. We therefore decided to evaluate possible parameters for predicting significant blood loss in a surgically homogeneous group of patients with vertebral metastases.
METHODS: Patients with vertebral metastases of the thoracic and thoracolumbar spine who underwent preoperative embolization were included. All patients had existing or impending neurological deficit as the main indication for direct metastasis reduction. The parameters evaluated were the technical feasibility of embolization, vascularization grade of metastasis, success of embolization, tumor type in relation to blood loss, and interval between embolization and surgery.
RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients fullfilled the inclusion criteria. Technically complete embolization was feasible in 14 patients (52%) and fully successful embolization was obtained in 10 patients (37%). Eighty-three percent of the renal cell carcinomas were hypervascularized, but also 67% of the breast carcinoma patients had hypervascularized tumors. No permanent complications occurred during embolization, but two patients had pain and another two experienced a transient burning sensation. A significant difference in intraoperative blood loss was only found between patients achieving partially or fully successful embolization in the subgroup of hypervascularized grade III metastases.
CONCLUSIONS: The success of embolization in the group of hypervascularized grade III metastases was the only predictor for the extent of blood loss in our study. Due to the inaccuracy of predicting high blood loss in general all possible precautions for excessive blood loss should be taken despite preoperative embolization. Further randomized studies to determine the indications and results of embolization seem desirable."
21528833,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21528833/,"OBJECTIVES: This study examines the relationship between financial performance and selected safety measures of nursing homes in the State of Florida.
METHODS: We used descriptive analysis on a total sample of 1,197. Safety information was from the Online Survey, Certification and Reporting (OSCAR) data of 2003 to 2005, while the financial performance measures were from the Medicare cost reports of 2002 to 2004. Finally, we examined the most frequently cited deficiencies as well as the relationship between financial performance and quality indicators.
RESULTS: Nursing homes in the bottom quartile of financial performance perform poorly on most resident-safety measures of care; however, nursing homes in the top two financial categories also experienced a higher number of deficiencies. Nursing homes in the next to lowest quartile of financial performance category best perform on most of these safety measures.
CONCLUSIONS: The results reinforce the need to monitor nursing home quality and resident safety in US nursing homes, especially among facilities with poor overall financial performance."
21529769,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21529769/,"BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of thoracic aortic mobile thrombus (TAMT) is rare and is usually made after debilitating embolic events. The optimal treatment strategy is unknown. We report 14 patients with TAMT and aim to better define the role of early (less than 2 weeks) surgical thrombectomy.
METHODS: Between February 1996 and February 2010, we treated 14 patients (9 women; aged 32 to 84 years, mean age 51 years) with TAMT. Hypercoagulable disorders or a strong family history of vascular thrombosis, or both, occurred in 9 patients. Diagnosis was made by transesophageal echocardiogram in 6, computed tomography angiography in 7, and digital subtraction angiography in 1. Embolic locations were extremities (n=9), cerebral (n=6), and abdominal (n=6). Aortic thrombi (n=17) locations were ascending/arch (n=7), descending (n=8), and thoracoabdominal (n=2).
RESULTS: All patients were initially treated with heparin and aspirin. Thoracic aortic thrombectomies were performed in 8 patients within 2 weeks of diagnosis: left thoracotomy (n=5), thoracoabdominal (n=1), and median sternotomy (n=2). Left atrial-femoral bypass was used in 5 patients, cardiopulmonary bypass in 2, and no support in 1. Additional procedures were celiac artery (n=1) and left subclavian artery (n=2) thrombectomies. Procedures for embolic complications were performed in 7 patients before aortic thrombectomy. Operative mortality was 0%, with no recurrent embolic events after 24±16 months. One patient had thrombectomy of the ascending aorta and medical therapy with warfarin and aspirin for a second concurrent small thrombus in the descending aorta. One patient presented with multiorgan failure and died shortly after admission. Six patients treated medically were discharged on a regimen of oral warfarin and aspirin (14±11 months follow-up), with 2 fatal recurrent embolic events within 6 weeks (p=0.09).
CONCLUSIONS: Thoracic aortic mobile thrombus is rare and is commonly associated with morbid thromboembolic events. In our experience, early surgical aortic thrombectomy had a low operative risk and may prevent fatal recurrent embolic events."
21529776,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21529776/,"OBJECTIVE: In general, ageing is a risk factor for sensory and motor deterioration, with the rate of decline varying amongst individuals. Concerning masticatory function, missing teeth along with oral disease seem to accelerate the dysfunction. Here, we aimed to confirm whether masticatory dysfunction by ageing is inevitable. This study investigated the effect of age, gender, number of natural teeth, occlusal force and salivary flow on the masticatory performance in a large sample of elderly adults.
DESIGN: The study sample consisted of 1288 independently living people aged 60-84 years. Masticatory performance was determined by the comminuted particles of test food. Bilateral maximal occlusal force in the intercuspal position was measured with pressure sensitive sheets. Stimulated whole saliva was collected.
RESULTS: Masticatory performance was significantly correlated to age, number of residual teeth, occlusal force and stimulated salivary flow rate by Pearson's correlation test. The multiple linear regression analysis showed that, with other variables controlled, masticatory performance was significantly associated with the number of residual teeth (β=0.456, P<0.001), occlusal force (β=0.244, P<0.001) and stimulated salivary flow rate (β=0.069, P=0.003). Age was not related to masticatory performance (β=-0.007, P=0.753).
CONCLUSIONS: Declines in the number of residual teeth, occlusal force and salivary flow were associated with a reduction of masticatory performance in older adults. If tooth loss is not considered as an attribute of physiological ageing, then ageing by itself may not be a risk factor for masticatory dysfunction."
21529779,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21529779/,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the pattern of neck extensor muscle use in participants with chronic mechanical neck pain to that of healthy controls during 2 different extension exercises by use of muscle functional magnetic resonance imaging (mfMRI).
DESIGN: Cross-sectional.
SETTING: University laboratory.
PARTICIPANTS: Data recorded from subjects with chronic mechanical neck pain (n=12; 10 women, 2 men) were compared with previously recorded data from healthy subjects (n=11; 7 men, 4 women).
INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: mfMRI measures of shifts in T2 relaxation were made for the multifidus, semispinalis cervicis, semispinalis capitis, and splenius capitis muscles, at C2-3, C5-6, and C7-T1 levels, prior and immediately after 2 different exercises: cervical extension in craniocervical neutral (CCN) and cervical extension in craniocervical extension. T2 shift values (difference between pre- and postexercise T2 relaxation values) for each muscle and exercise condition were used for analysis.
RESULTS: While there were observed differences in differential activation of the extensor muscles in participants with mechanical neck pain compared with controls, these differences were only evident for the CCN exercise condition and were only observed for 3 out of the 7 muscle regions of interest during this exercise.
CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study suggest some alteration in the differential activation of the cervical extensors in patients with mechanical neck pain and indicate that further investigation of this muscle group in mechanical neck pain disorders is warranted."
21529828,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21529828/,"BACKGROUND: Hispanic ethnicity is associated with a reduced risk of fatal falls in the elderly despite lower socioeconomic standing. The factors responsible for this ""Hispanic paradox"" are unknown. We hypothesized that age and gender would modify this relationship and that the association would be accentuated in a community with prominent Hispanic culture.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The number of fatal falls in a 3-year period in the United States (US) and in Miami-Dade County, Florida (MDC) were obtained through the CDC's WISQARS database and the Florida Office of Vital Statistics. US Census Bureau data were used to define the total at-risk populations by age group and gender. Age group- and gender-specific ratios of the risk of fatal fall in Hispanic to white non-Hispanic individuals were calculated.
RESULTS: In the US and MDC, Hispanic ethnicity was associated with a reduced risk of fatal fall across all age and gender subgroups. In the US, the risk reduction associated with Hispanic ethnicity grew from 11% and 23% in 65- to 74-year-old men and women, respectively, to 43% for both men and women over 84-years-old. This relationship was stronger in MDC than nationally in five of the six age and gender subgroups examined.
CONCLUSIONS: Older individuals, women, and residents of communities with prominent Hispanic culture have the greatest reduction in fatal fall risk associated with Hispanic ethnicity."

The purpose of this study, therefore, was to investigate the functionality of hearing aids in a preschool setting.
METHODS: Forty-four hearing aids worn by 24 preschool children, whose ages ranged from three to five years, (mean age=45.2 months, median age=48 months) from four state funded aural/oral habilitation preschools were evaluated using listening checks and visual examinations. Hearing aids passing both evaluations were given a pass rating and those failing one or more of the evaluations were given a fail rating. Causes of fail rates were documented.
RESULTS: Over half of the hearing aids tested were determined to have at least one or more problems (n=27). These problems were detected using listening and visual checks.
CONCLUSIONS: Failure rates based on basic listening and visual checks among the hearing aids examined in this study demonstrated no improvement over those reported in the 1970's. The results re-emphasize the need for a national dialogue on this topic."

STUDY DESIGN: Secondary data analysis of the 2006 National Clinical Audit of Falls and Bone Health.
SETTING: Acute hospitals in the UK.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 65 years and older with a fragility fracture as a result of a fall.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Data were analysed to determine whether patients with fragility fractures received an assessment of urinary function including continence status; whether impairment was detected and if action was taken to prevent continence related falls.
RESULTS: 63% (2009) of 3184 patients were assessed for urinary continence following a hip fracture and 41% (817) of these identified a problem. 21% (1187) of 5642 patients with nonhip fragility fractures were assessed and a problem was found in 27% (316). Hip fracture patients were more likely (p<0.0001) to receive a continence assessment and have problems detected. Only about half of those with problems had any intervention or a referral to a continence service. Admission to hospital for nonhip fracture patients was a strong predictor of being assessed (p<0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Rates of assessment and action for those with who fall and have continence problems are low despite current national guidelines."

METHODS: The present study is based on a self-reported questionnaire administered to a sample of 418 first-year medical students from a private faculty in January 2010. We consider a set of 12 European visual warnings that address different smoking problems. Econometric modeling is used to study the determinants of answers.
RESULTS: Our results were twofold. Firstly, the most effective symbols concern the smoker himself/herself, they are explicit and related to an advanced stage of disease. Secondly, the warnings seem to be more effective to confirm the non-smokers in their choice than to deter smokers to smoke.
CONCLUSION: This tobacco control policy seems to be effective. Therefore, visual warnings have to be carefully chosen before implementation."
21530194,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21530194/,"AIMS: About 17,000 patients receive radiotherapy for pelvic cancer in the UK annually. Up to 50% are left with altered bowel function affecting quality of life. The UK National Cancer Survivorship Initiative Vision acknowledges that the needs of cancer survivors are not being met and challenges professionals to develop new models of care.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective, observational qualitative study was carried out to assess whether nurse-delivered care is feasible for patients with radiotherapy-induced bowel dysfunction. The experience of a senior nurse, directed by an algorithm of investigation with a comprehensive treatment pathway, is reported.
RESULTS: Over 12 months, 59 new and 103 follow-up appointments were managed by the nurse. In total, 37 women and 73 men, with a median age of 69 years, were seen; 9 had been treated for gastrointestinal, 33 for gynaecological and 68 for urological cancers, 26 months (median) previously. Sixty minutes (new consultations) (median, range 35-80) and 40 minutes (follow-up consultations) (range 20-85) were required. Ordering investigations, treatment initiation, long-term care planning and discharge seemed to be manageable in 83% of patients.
CONCLUSION: An experienced nurse, working within a defined scope of practice, with medical support can manage care in patients with mild or moderate symptoms arising after pelvic radiotherapy. An ongoing randomised controlled trial is assessing patient outcomes."
21530330,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21530330/,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To determine whether an unenhanced low-dose image acquired during automated contrast bolus timing can be used to assess hepatic steatosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty subjects (29 male, 21 female; 26-92 years; mean body mass index (BMI; 26.9) with abdominal multiphasic computed tomography were included. Abdominal diameters and circumferences were derived from anteroposterior and lateral scout radiographs. Hepatic attenuation (HA) was measured on unenhanced low-dose images (120 kV; 40 mA; 0.5 seconds' rotation time) and corresponding unenhanced standard-dose images (120 kV, z-axis automatic tube current modulation, noise index 11.5). Noise estimates were measured in surrounding air. Pearson correlation was calculated between abdominal circumference and BMI. Mean HA assessed on low-dose images and standard-dose images was compared using a paired Student's t-test and Bland Altman plots.
RESULTS: Abdominal circumference (mean, 142.8cm) correlated well with BMI (r = 0.83). No significant difference was found for HA on low-dose images (mean +57.7 HU) compared to HA on standard-dose images (+56.0 HU) (P = .077). Image noise (+11.5 HU) was significantly higher on low-dose images compared to image noise (+8.1 HU) on standard-dose images (P < .05). For HA mean difference comparing low- and standard-dose images was -1.7 HU (limits of agreement: -14.6, 11.2).
CONCLUSION: In all subjects, hepatic attenuation can be correctly assessed on unenhanced low-dose images."
21530350,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21530350/,"BACKGROUND: The impact of Candida-colonized catheter tips in patients without candidemia is unclear.
METHODS: A retrospective study of patients with tip cultures positive for Candida was conducted over an 8-year period, to determine the outcomes in patients with Candida cultured from an intravascular catheter tip in the absence of preceding Candida-positive blood cultures. The primary outcome measure was definite candidemia. Secondary outcomes included possible candidemia and in-hospital mortality. A possible candidemia was defined as clinical signs and symptoms of invasive candidiasis without explanation other than a candidemia, but with negative blood cultures.
RESULTS: Sixty-eight cultures from 64 patients were included in the study. Definite candidemia developed in three cases (4%) and possible candidemia developed in five cases (7%). In-hospital mortality was significantly increased in patients with definite or possible candidemia (63% vs. 22%, p=0.028). Risk factors for the development of definite or possible candidemia were catheter time in situ >8 days (odds ratio (OR) 6.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-32.9) and abdominal surgery (OR 6.0, 95% CI 1.1-32.4).
CONCLUSIONS: Intravascular catheter tip colonization in patients without preceding blood cultures with Candida is associated with candidemia in from 4% of patients (definite candidemia) up to 12% of patients (definite and possible candidemia combined). Considering the adverse prognosis associated with delayed treatment of candidemia, preemptive treatment based on catheter tip cultures might outweigh the disadvantages of costs and side effects of antifungal therapy."
21530408,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21530408/,"BACKGROUND: In the U.S., Europe, and throughout the world, abdominal obesity prevalence is increasing. Depressive symptoms may contribute to abdominal obesity through the consumption of diets high in energy density.
PURPOSE: To test dietary energy density ([DED]; kilocalories/gram of food and beverages consumed) for an independent relationship with abdominal obesity or as a mediator between depressive symptoms and abdominal obesity.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 87 mid-life, overweight adults; 73.6% women; 50.6% African-American. Variables and measures: Beck depression inventory-II (BDI-II) to measure depressive symptoms; 3-day weighed food records to calculate DED; and waist circumference, an indicator of abdominal obesity. Hierarchical regression tested if DED explained waist circumference variance while controlling for depressive symptoms and consumed food and beverage weight. Three approaches tested DED as a mediator.
RESULTS: Nearly three-quarters of participants had abdominal obesity, and the mean waist circumference was 103.2 (SD 14.3) cm. Mean values: BDI-II was 8.67 (SD 8.34) which indicates that most participants experienced minimal depressive symptoms, and 21.8% reported mild to severe depressive symptoms (BDI-II ≥ 14); DED was 0.75 (SD 0.22) kilocalories/gram. Hierarchical regression showed an independent association between DED and waist circumference with DED explaining 7.0% of variance above that accounted for by BDI-II and food and beverage weight. DED did not mediate between depressive symptoms and abdominal obesity.
CONCLUSIONS: Depressive symptoms and DED were associated with elevated waist circumference, thus a comprehensive intervention aimed at improving depressive symptoms and decreasing DED to reduce waist circumference is warranted."

DESIGN: This study was a retrospective analysis of responses to the PHQ-9 collected in 2 previous studies. Responses to the PHQ-9 were modeled using item response theory, and the presence of DIF was evaluated using ordinal logistic regression.
SETTING: Eight primary care sites and a single trauma center in Washington state.
PARTICIPANTS: Participants (N=3365) were persons from 8 primary care sites (n=3000) and a consecutive sample of persons with complicated mild to severe TBI from a trauma center who were 1 year postinjury (n=365).
INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: PHQ-9.
RESULTS: No PHQ-9 item demonstrated statistically significant or meaningful DIF attributable to TBI. A sensitivity analysis failed to show that the cumulative effects of nonsignificant DIF resulted in a systematic inflation of PHQ-9 total scores. Therefore, the results also do not support the hypothesis that cumulative DIF for PHQ-9 items spuriously inflates the numbers of persons with TBI screened as potentially having major depressive disorder.
CONCLUSIONS: The PHQ-9 is a valid screener of major depressive disorder in people with complicated mild to severe TBI, and all symptoms can be counted toward the diagnosis of major depressive disorder without special concern about overdiagnosis or unnecessary treatment."
21531176,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21531176/,"OBJECTIVE: Previous studies of endoscopic management of vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR) have had non-compliance rates around 50%. We examined success rates of patients non-compliant with a delayed follow up protocol after endoscopic injection for VUR.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients undergoing Double HIT, dextranomer/hyaluronic acid copolymer endoscopic injection for VUR were enrolled in a 1-year, delayed voiding cysto-urethrogram (VCUG) study. All patients non-compliant with the VCUG were contacted and information on their clinical status was collected. Non-compliant patients were re-scheduled for a VCUG.
RESULTS: 49/54 (91%) patients underwent endoscopic injection for VUR and completed the 6-week ultrasound. At 1-year 49% (24/49) were non-compliant with a VCUG; 75% (18/24) were contacted and provided clinical information. All but one patient agreed to the VCUG. Patients compliant with the 1-year VCUG showed 96% (24/25) clinical and 92% (23/25) radiologic success rates. Non-compliant patients had an 89% (16/18) clinical success rate; 5 (21%) non-compliant patients underwent VCUGs with a 100% success rate.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term compliance remains an issue for patients treated endoscopically for VUR, but compliance does not predict clinical status as both groups have favorable clinical outcomes. The repeat VCUG is a barrier to long-term follow up as only 21% of patients underwent the study."
21531390,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21531390/,"BACKGROUND: Subjects with autism suffer from impairments of social interaction, deviations in language usage, as well as restricted and stereotyped patterns of behavior. These characteristics are found irrespective of age, IQ, and gender of affected subjects. However, brain changes due to age, IQ, and gender might pose potential confounds in autism neuroimaging analyses.
METHODS: To investigate gray matter differences in autism that are not related to these potential confounds, we performed a voxel-based morphometry analysis in 52 affected children and adolescents and 52 matched control subjects.
RESULTS: We observed diminished gray matter in a region of the hypothalamus, which synthesizes the behaviorally relevant hormones oxytocin and arginine vasopressin.
CONCLUSIONS: This finding provides support for further investigations of the theory of abnormal functioning of this hormonal system in autism and potentially for experimental therapeutic approaches with oxytocin and related neuropeptides."
21531412,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21531412/,"BACKGROUND: Temporary biliary stenting is both technically easy and feasible, and choleretic agents such as ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and a terpene preparation may promote a reduction in stone size. However, there are few comparative data on the effectiveness of choleretic agents available.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy of multiple double-pigtail stents with or without UDCA and terpene on difficult common bile duct (CBD) stones.
DESIGN: A prospective, multicenter study.
SETTING: Four tertiary-care referral centers.
PATIENTS: This study involved 51 patients.
INTERVENTION: In total, 51 elderly patients with comorbidities who had difficult CBD stones refractory to conventional methods were randomized to receive either multiple 7F double-pigtail stents (group A) or stents in combination with UDCA and terpene (group B) for a period of 6 months.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Stone size reduction, successful duct clearance, and complications.
RESULTS: Complete endoscopic duct clearance was achieved in 14 patients (73.7%) in group A and 19 patients (86.4%) in group B (P = .826). The mean size of CBD stones (transverse/longitudinal diameter, mean ± SD) was 19.12 ± 4.48 mm/20.47 ± 3.86 mm in group A and 21.30 ± 7.08 mm/22.58 ± 7.61 mm in group B. Stone size decreased significantly to 12.04 ± 3.26 mm/13.31 ± 5.12 mm and 13.67 ± 5.40 mm/14.04 ± 6.12 mm, respectively (P < .01). However, there was no statistical difference in stone size reduction between the two groups (P = .685, P = .289). No serious complications related to the stent or endoscopic procedures were observed, except for cholangitis (n = 1, group A) and distal stent migration (n = 2, group B).
LIMITATIONS: Small number of patients in East Asia.
CONCLUSION: Temporary multiple double-pigtail biliary stenting was a safe and feasible method of treating difficult and large CBD stones in elderly patients and contributed to a reduction in stone size and successful duct clearance. However, the addition of choleretic agents did not result in a statistical difference in stone size or rate of successful duct clearance."
21531690,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21531690/,"BACKGROUND: Despite the amount of online health information, there are several barriers that limit the Internet's adoption as a source of health information. One of these barriers is highlighted in conceptualizations of the digital divide which include the differential possession of Internet skills, or ""eHealth literacy"". Most measures of Internet skills among populations at large use self-assessments. The research discussed here applies a multifaceted definition of Internet skills and uses actual performance tests.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess how ready a sample of the general population is for eHealth. More specifically, four types of Internet skills were measured in a performance test in which subjects had to complete health-related assignments on the Internet.
METHODS: From November 1, 2009, through February 28, 2010, 88 subjects participated in the study. Subjects were randomly selected from a telephone directory. A selective quota sample was used divided over equal subsamples of gender, age, and education. Each subject had to accomplish assignments on the Internet. The Internet skills accounted for were categorized as operational (basic skills to use the Internet), formal (navigation and orientation), information (finding information), and strategic (using the information for personal benefits). The tests took approximately 1.5 hours and were conducted in a University office, making the setting equally new for all. Successful completion and time spent on the assignments-the two main outcomes-were directly measured by the test leader.
RESULTS: The subjects successfully completed an average of 73% (5.8/8) of the operational Internet skill tasks and an average of 73% (2.9/4) of the formal Internet skill tasks. Of the information Internet skills tasks, an average of 50% (1.5/3) was completed successfully and, of the strategic Internet skills tasks, 35% (0.7/2). Only 28% (25/88) of the subjects were able to successfully complete all operational skills tasks, 39% (34/88), all formal skills tasks, 13% (11/88), all information skills tasks, and 20% (18/88), both the strategic skill tasks. The time spent on the assignments varied substantially. Age and education were the most important contributors to the operational and formal Internet skills. Regarding the formal Internet skills, years of Internet experience also had some influence. Educational level of attainment was the most important contributor to the information and strategic Internet skills.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the amount of online health-related information and services is consistently growing, it appears that the general population lacks the skills to keep up. Most problematic appear to be the lack of information and strategic Internet skills, which, in the context of health, are very important. The lack of these skills is also problematic for members of younger generations, who are often considered skilled Internet users. This primarily seems to account for the operational and formal Internet skills. The results of the study strongly call for policies to increase the level of Internet skills."
21532071,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21532071/,"OBJECTIVE: Increasing patient autonomy and decreasing coercion are frequently cited goals in mental health care. Research suggests that the therapeutic relationship and patients' experiences of coercion may be associated. This study investigated the association between the therapeutic relationship and perceived coercion in psychiatric admissions.
METHODS: Associations between perceived coercion and the therapeutic relationship and sociodemographic and clinical variables were examined by using data from structured interviews with 164 patients consecutively admitted to two psychiatric hospitals in Oxford, England.
RESULTS: High levels of coercion were experienced by 48% of voluntarily and 89% of involuntarily admitted patients. A high perceived coercion score was significantly associated with involuntary admission and a poor rating of the therapeutic relationship. The therapeutic relationship confounded legal status as a predictor of perceived coercion.
CONCLUSIONS: Similar factors may influence patients' experience of both coercion and the therapeutic relationship during psychiatric hospital admission. Hospitalization, even when voluntary, was viewed as more coercive when patients rated their relationship with the admitting clinician negatively. Interventions to improve the therapeutic relationship may reduce perceptions of coercion."
21532475,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21532475/,"OBJECTIVES: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is an important cause of mortality among nosocomial infections. Recent investigations suggest that linezolid is superior to vancomycin in achieving clinical cure in patients with nosocomial pneumonia. We hypothesized that linezolid may exhibit anti-inflammatory properties in vivo model of pneumonia.
DESIGN: Prospective interventional study.
SETTING: University affiliated laboratory.
SUBJECTS: BALB/c mice.
INTERVENTIONS: Three groups of BALB/c mice were inoculated with methicillin-resistant S. aureus American Type Culture Collection 33,591 to induce pneumonia. Each group (n = 6) underwent bronchoalveolar lavage at 24 hrs, 48 hrs, and 72 hrs after inoculation after treatment with vancomycin, linezolid, or no antibiotic. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid levels of monocyte chemotactic protein-5 and interleukin-6 were quantified using cytometric bead array. Metalloproteinase-9 was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and gelatin zymography. Neutrophil apoptosis in bronchoalveolar lavage was assessed by annexin V and 7-aminoactinomycin D staining. Neutrophil activity was determined by myeloperoxidase enzyme activity. Phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils by linezolid- vs. vancomycin treated-alveolar macrophages was examined in vitro.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Infected mice had a significant reduction in lung bacterial titers compared with controls (p < .05) after treatment with linezolid or vancomycin. There was no difference in bronchoalveolar lavage levels of monocyte chemotactic protein-5 or interleukin-6 between vancomycin- and linezolid-treated groups. Both antimicrobials were comparable in modulating the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 in bronchoalveolar lavage. Neutrophil apoptosis was comparable in both vancomycin- and linezolid-treated groups at all three time points. Vancomycin showed lower myeloperoxidase activity compared with linezolid in the first 24 hrs after inoculation (p = .03), but the difference was undetectable at 48 hrs and 72 hrs. Neither compound had an impact on the process of removal of apoptotic neutrophils by alveolar macrophages.
CONCLUSIONS: Linezolid did not display an advantage over vancomycin in modulating pulmonary innate immune response in a murine model of methicillin-resistant S. aureus pneumonia."
21532962,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21532962/,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: ""Gentle handling"" has become a method of choice for 4-6 h sleep deprivation in mice, with repeated brief handling applied before sleep deprivation to induce habituation. To verify whether mice do indeed habituate, we assess how 6 days of repeated brief handling impact on resting behavior, on stress, and on the subunit content of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) at hippocampal synapses, which is altered by sleep loss. We discuss whether repeated handling biases the outcome of subsequent sleep deprivation.
DESIGN: Adult C57BL/6J mice, maintained on a 12 h-12 h light-dark cycle, were left undisturbed for 3 days, then handled during 3 min daily for 6 days in the middle of the light phase. Mice were continuously monitored for their resting time. Serum corticosterone levels and synaptic NMDAR subunit composition were quantified.
RESULTS: Handling caused a ∼25% reduction of resting time throughout all handling days. After six, but not after one day of handling, mice had elevated serum corticosterone levels. Six-day handling augmented the presence of the NR2A subunit of NMDARs at hippocampal synapses.
CONCLUSION: Repeated handling induces behavioral and neurochemical alterations that are absent in undisturbed animals. The persistently reduced resting time and the delayed increase in corticosterone levels indicate that mice do not habituate to handling over a 1-week period. Handling-induced modifications bias effects of gentle handling-induced sleep deprivation on sleep homeostasis, stress, glutamate receptor composition and signaling. A standardization of sleep deprivation procedures involving gentle handling will be important for unequivocally specifying how acute sleep loss affects brain function."
21533128,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21533128/,"BACKGROUND: Idiopathic congenital talipes equinovarus (CTEV) is a common developmental foot disorder, the aetiology of which remains largely unknown. Some aspects of the epidemiology suggest the possibility of aetiologically distinct subgroups. Previous studies consider CTEV as a homogenous entity which may conceal risk factors in particular subgroups. We investigate evidence for aetiologically distinct subgroups of CTEV.
METHODS: Parents of 785 probands completed a postal questionnaire. Family pedigrees were compiled by telephone. Case-only analysis was used to investigate interactions between risk factors and sex of the proband, CTEV laterality and CTEV family history.
RESULTS: The male:female ratio was 2.3:1, 58% of probands were affected bilaterally and 11% had a first-second degree family history. There were modest interactions between family history and twin births (multivariate case - only odds ratio [ORca] = 3.87, 95%CI 1.19-12.62) and family history and maternal use of folic acid supplements in early pregnancy (ORca = 0.62, 95%CI 0.38-1.01); and between sex of the proband and maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy (female, positive history and alcohol consumed: ORca = 0.33, 95%CI 0.12-0.89). Previous reports of an interaction between maternal smoking and family history were not confirmed. Relatives of female probands were affected more often than relatives of male probands.
CONCLUSIONS: These results provide tentative evidence for aetiologically distinct CTEV subgroups. They support the 'Carter effect', suggesting CTEV develops though a multifactorial threshold model with females requiring a higher risk factor 'load', and suggest areas where future aetiological investigation might focus. Large multi-centre studies are needed to further advance understanding of this common condition."
21533238,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21533238/,"BACKGROUND: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains have become common causes of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) among previously healthy people, a role of methicillin-susceptible (MSSA) isolates before the mid-1990s. We hypothesized that, as MRSA infections became more common among S. aureus infections in the community, perhaps MSSA infections had become more important as a cause of healthcare-associated infection.
METHODS: We compared patients, including children and adults, with MRSA and MSSA infections at the University of Chicago Medical Center (UCMC) from all clinical units from July 1, 2004-June 30, 2005; we also compared the genotypes of the MRSA and MSSA infecting bacterial strains.
RESULTS: Compared with MRSA patients, MSSA patients were more likely on bivariate analysis to have bacteremia, endocarditis, or sepsis (p = 0.03), to be an adult (p = 0.005), to be in the intensive care unit (21.9% vs. 15.6%) or another inpatient unit (45.6% vs. 40.7%) at the time of culture. MRSA (346/545) and MSSA (76/114) patients did not differ significantly in the proportion classified as HA-S. aureus by the CDC CA-MRSA definition (p = 0.5). The genetic backgrounds of MRSA and MSSA multilocus sequence type (ST) 1, ST5, ST8, ST30, and ST59 comprised in combination 94.5% of MRSA isolates and 50.9% of MSSA isolates. By logistic regression, being cared for in the Emergency Department (OR 4.6, CI 1.5-14.0, p = 0.008) was associated with MRSA infection.
CONCLUSION: Patients with MSSA at UCMC have characteristics consistent with a health-care-associated infection more often than do patients with MRSA; a possible role reversal has occurred for MSSA and MRSA strains. Clinical MSSA and MRSA strains shared genotype backgrounds."
21533521,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21533521/,"BACKGROUND: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST) is technically difficult in the patients with large extrahepaic bile duct stones. Small endoscopic sphincterotomy combined with large-balloon dilation (ESLBD) currently seems to be a promising alternative for patients with difficult bile duct stones that cannot be extracted by EST. This study compared the therapeutic benefits and complication rates of ESLBD with those of EST alone.
METHODS: This study investigated 149 patients treated for stones (≥10 mm) or multiple stones in the extrahepatic bile duct. The ESLBD group (n = 72) was compared with the conventional EST group (n = 77). Mechanical lithotripsy was performed when the stone could not be removed using a Dormia basket.
RESULTS: The two groups did not differ significantly in terms of mean bile duct diameter, common bile duct angulation, and presence of periampullary diverticulum. The ESLBD group compared with the EST-alone group had similar outcomes in terms of overall successful stone removal but showed significant differences in complete stone removal during the first session (87.5 vs. 74.0%; P = 0.036) and the use of mechanical lithotripsy for large bile duct stones (≥15 mm) (17.9 vs. 45.8%; P = 0.026). For the patients with a periampullary diverticulum, ESLBD and EST showed similar results only for efficacy and complications.
CONCLUSIONS: The ESLBD technique may be a safe, effective alternative to conventional EST for endoscopic removal of large common bile duct stones, and it can reduce the use of mechanical lithotripsy compared with EST alone."
21533570,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21533570/,"PURPOSE: To compare the concentration conformity of infusion solutions manually prepared on intensive care units (ICU) with solutions from pharmacy-based, automated production.
METHODS: A prospective observational study conducted in a university hospital in Germany. Drug concentrations of 100 standardised infusion solutions manually prepared in the ICU and 100 matching solutions from automated production containing amiodarone, noradrenaline or hydrocortisone were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis. Deviations from stated concentrations were calculated, and the quality of achieved concentration conformity of the two production methods was compared.
RESULTS: Actual concentrations of 53% of the manually prepared and 16% of the machine-made solutions deviated by >5% above or below the stated concentration. A deviation of >10% was measured in 22% of the manually prepared samples and in 5% of samples from automated production. Of the manually prepared solutions, 15% deviated by >15% above or below the intended concentration. The mean concentration of the manually prepared solutions was 97.2% (SD 12.7%, range 45-129%) and of the machine-made solutions was 101.1% (SD 4.3%, range 90-114%) of the target concentration (p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: In this preliminary study, ward-based, manually prepared infusion solutions showed clinically relevant deviations in concentration conformity significantly more often than pharmacy-prepared, machine-made solutions. Centralised, automated preparation of standardised infusion solutions may be an effective means to reduce this type of medication error. Further confirmatory studies in larger settings and under conditions of routine automated production are required."
21533783,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21533783/,"BACKGROUND: No clinical trials have been done to guide the surgeon in the optimal technique of draining a pilonidal abscess. The aim of our study was to investigate whether the location of the incision influences wound healing.
METHODS: Electronic records from the surgical database at our 200-bed district general hospital were reviewed for operative technique (midline vs. lateral) for patients who underwent incision and drainage for acute pilonidal abscess between January 2003 and February 2010. These patients were admitted from the Emergency Department with a pilonidal abscess, underwent operative drainage, and returned for follow-up. The main outcome measure was wound healing time.
RESULTS: Two hundred and forty-three pilonidal abscesses were drained, 134 with a lateral and 74 with a midline incision. All patients underwent simple longitudinal incision. No patient underwent de-roofing, marsupialisation, or closure. Forty-eight patients with midline drainage who returned for follow-up were matched for gender, age, and microbiology culture results with patients who underwent lateral drainage. Almost all were drained under general anesthesia with a median postoperative stay of 1 day. The overall length of follow-up was the same in both groups (P = 0.13). Abscesses that did not heal were followed-up for the same period of time irrespective of incision type (P = 0.48). Abscesses that healed after midline incision took approximately 3 weeks longer than those drained via a lateral incision (P = 0.02). Our study has limitations since it was a retrospective study that did not capture patients whose abscess drained spontaneously or were drained in the emergency department.
CONCLUSIONS: Pilonidal abscess should be drained away from the midline."

However, so far there have not been any systematic attempts to capture the motivational profile of seafarers when it comes to both work demands and work resources. The purpose of this study is to explore the motivational profiles of seafarers in the Danish merchant fleet by identifying factors which motivate or demotivate seafarers to stay in their specific profession. Furthermore, we examine if there is a difference in work motivators and demotivators between Danish seafaring officers and non-officers. Material and methods. A questionnaire was sent out to 560 Danish-speaking seafarers with a Danish postal address; 346 seafarers returned the questionnaire, equalling a 61% response rate.
RESULTS: The work motivators which were identified were: duration of home leave, level of responsibility, and level of challenge. The main demotivating factors that were identified were: being away from home, shipping company´s HRM, and regulatory requirements.
CONCLUSIONS: The results contribute to a deeper understanding of how seafarers perceive their occupation, and help to identify areas and aspects which might need change if employers want to retain their workforce in the long run. Overall, the results show that most of the job demands and job resources that seafarers perceive are psychosocial. When it comes to the best aspects of seafaring, over 70% of the answers were related to psychosocial factors rather than organizational or structural factors. In relation to the perceived worst aspects in seafaring, about 85% of the responses fell into psychosocial categories. The differences in the motivational profiles of officers and non-officers showed the importance of not only looking at the seafaring profession as a whole but also considering the different characteristics of various jobs onboard."

21534733,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21534733/,"INTRODUCTION: Head injuries are of great relevance for the prognosis of polytrauma patients during acute care. However, knowledge about the impact on the long-term outcome is sparse. Therefore, this study analysed the role of head injuries on the outcome of polytrauma patients more than 10 years after injury in a matched-pair analysis.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Out of 620 polytrauma patients with and without head injury, a matched-pair analysis with comparable age, injury severity and gender distribution and a minimum of 10 years follow-up was performed. The outcome and quality-of-life were measured using the Hannover Score for Polytrauma Outcome (HASPOC), Short Form 12 (SF-12), Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) and other parameters.
RESULTS: The matched-pair analysis consisted of 125 pairs (age 27.9 ± 1.2 years, ISS 20.0 ± 0.8 [head injury] vs ISS 19.8 ± 0.8 [no head injury]). A significant difference was shown for the GOS Score only (GOS head injury 4.3 ± 0.3 vs no head injury 4.9 ± 0.2, p = 0.01). The psychological outcome was similar in both groups. Both groups reported comparable subjective rehabilitation satisfaction.
CONCLUSIONS: Matching pairs of equally injured polytrauma patients of same gender with and without head injury 10 years following trauma indicated significantly worse results in the GOS due to head injury."

METHOD: Data were collected prospectively using a battery of standardized measures and individual interviews at 6 weeks pre-discharge and again at 6, 18, 36, and 84 months post-discharge.
RESULTS: While there was little functional gain at follow up, the clients, as a group, did not deteriorate. Sixty per cent of the clients were engaged in some form of structured community activity and the need for hospitalization decreased significantly in the follow-up period. The ongoing costs of the programme, while remaining high, were significantly less than inpatient alternatives.
CONCLUSION: The provision of community accommodation with adequate clinical and non-clinical support is a suitable option for a large proportion of individuals with serious mental illness."

METHODS: Neonates with early-onset infection (Group A; n=46) were compared with healthy controls (Group B; n=240). We evaluated the relationship between prenatal antibiotic therapy and early-onset infection, and for interactions with antibiotic therapy in the neonate immediately after birth.
RESULTS: In the Group A antibiotics were administered significantly more often prenatally and more often to neonates just after birth. The percentage of negative blood cultures in infected neonates was higher when antibiotic treatment was instituted prenatally. Differences in cord blood PCT and CRP concentrations were significant between both groups and were independent of prenatal antibiotic treatment. Streptococcus agalactiae was the most frequent species.
CONCLUSIONS: Almost one-third of neonates present with early-onset infection in spite of prenatal antibiotic therapy. Cord blood PCT and CRP measurements may be helpful in the diagnosis of infection also in cases when antibiotic therapy was started prenatally. Prenatal antibiotic administration reduced the number of positive blood cultures in neonates with early-onset infection and was associated with a greater rate of antibiotic treatment after birth in neonates without infection."
21535006,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21535006/,"BACKGROUND: Allergic contact dermatitis is triggered by chemicals in the environment. Primary prevention is aimed at minimizing the risk of induction, whereas secondary and tertiary prevention are aimed at reducing elicitation.
OBJECTIVES: To identify the elicitation doses that will elicit an allergic reaction in 10% of allergic individuals under patch test conditions (ED(10) patch test) for different allergens, and to compare the results with those for different allergens and with animal data indicating sensitizing potency from the literature.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The literature was searched for patch test elicitation studies that fulfilled six selected criteria. The elicitation doses were calculated, and fitted dose-response curves were drawn.
RESULTS: Sixteen studies with eight different allergens-methylchloroisothiazolinone/ methylisothiazolinone, formaldehyde, nickel, cobalt, chromium, isoeugenol, hydroxyiso hexyl 3-cyclohexene carboxaldehyde, and methyldibromo glutaronitrile-were selected. The median ED(10) value was 0.835 µg/cm(2). The ED(10) patch test values were all within a factor of 7 from the lowest to the highest value, leaving out three outliers. No obvious patterns between the sensitization and elicitation doses for the allergens were found.
CONCLUSIONS: We found a rather small variation in the ED(10) patch test between the allergens, and no clear relationship between induction potency and elicitation threshold of a range of allergens. This knowledge may stimulate thoughts on introducing a generic approach for limitations in exposure to well-known allergens."
21535034,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21535034/,"BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) can have a significant effect on quality of life (QoL). Other chronic diseases are known to not only affect the patient but to also impact the QoL of persons living with them. Scant data exist on the QoL effect of AF in spouses/significant others (SOs).
METHODS: An anonymous survey regarding the perceived effect of AF on QoL was designed and distributed to both patients and spouses/SOs during an educational symposium about living with AF. Both were asked to fill out the survey independently according to how their life was affected by either their AF or their partner's AF. Questions included demographics, perceived impairment of overall QoL on a 5-point scale, as well as effect on subcategories of QoL, namely daily activity, work life, sex life, physical activity, psychological well-being, and social activity.
RESULTS: Five hundred and sixty-eight subjects completed the survey of which 411 were AF patients and 129 were spouses/SOs. The perceived effect of AF on overall QoL (N = 527) was similar in patients and spouses (AF patients: mild 42.0%, moderate 26.0%, severe 32.0% vs. spouses: 44.1%, 25.2%, 31.7%; P = 0.917). This result did not change when adjusted for age and gender. There was also no significant difference between patients and spouses in the subcategories of QoL with the exception of the perceived effect on work life, which was greater in patients than spouses (P = 0.041).
CONCLUSIONS: AF has a similar perceived impact on the QoL of spouses and patients. QoL improvement strategies for patients with AF should take spouses into account."
21535135,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21535135/,"AIM: To study whether a dyslexia remediation programme, Audilex, improves cognition in extremely low birth (ELBW) children.
METHODS: Six-year-old ELBW children were allocated to a 5-week training with Audilex or playing control computer games. Before and after intervention, auditory event-related brain potentials (ERP) to sound changes were recorded and reading related skills assessed. Primary outcome was the mismatch negativity (MMN) component of ERP. Secondary outcomes were Audilex Test (ability to perform the Audilex games), the reading skills after the intervention and 2 years later. Of eligible children, 39 (54%) consented and 22 (30%) completed the protocol.
RESULTS: The MMN responses to the frequency (p = 0.02) and duration deviants (p < 0.01) increased after Audilex training (n = 11), but not after control game playing (n = 11). Audilex Test performance was similar in both groups. The reading skills were similar after intervention and 2 years later; word reading score 59.7, 66.8 and 74.9 and comprehensive reading score 8.1, 8.8 and 9.4 in Audilex, Control and healthy class-mate children, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Although all children did not complete the protocol, the results suggest that training with Audilex dyslexia programme might be beneficial for enhancing neural-level sound discrimation and possibly reading skills in ELBW children. A larger trial is warranted."
21535151,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21535151/,"BACKGROUND: Despite significant advances in stent technology and pharmacotherapy, drug-eluting stent thrombosis (DES-ST) remains a major complication of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and commonly presents as ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). There are currently little data comparing the in-hospital outcomes of patients presenting with STEMI due to DES-ST with those due to de novo coronary artery disease (CAD).
METHODS: Our study comprised 985 consecutive patients who underwent primary PCI for STEMI, 102 of whom were diagnosed as having a definite DES-ST. The primary end-point was the in-hospital composite of death or recurrent myocardial infarction (MI). The secondary end-point was the in-hospital maximum rise in creatine kinase (myocardial band [MB] fraction) and troponin I.
RESULTS: The DES-ST group had a higher proportion of patients with diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, history of ischemic heart disease, coronary revascularization, and chronic renal impairment. The adjusted primary end-point was higher in the DES-ST cohort (12.7% vs. 7.4%; P = 0.05). The 2 cohorts did not differ in the secondary end-point. The independent predictors of the primary end-point were age (hazard ratio [HR]= 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI]= 1.01 - 1.06; P = 0.005), cardiogenic shock (HR = 11.5; 95% CI = 6.38 - 20.07, P < 0.001), and lesions involving the left anterior descending coronary artery (HR = 1.8; 95% CI = 1.03 - 3.13, P = 0.04). DES-ST was not an independent predictor of the primary end-point (HR = 1.18; 95% CI = 0.53-2.63, P = 0.38).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with STEMI secondary to DES-ST have a poorer in-hospital outcome than do patients in whom STEMI is due to de novo CAD. This difference may be predominantly driven by differences in the baseline characteristics between these cohorts. (J Interven Cardiol 2011;24:320-325)."
21535996,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21535996/,"OBJECTIVE: Several studies report a cross-sectional association between metabolic syndrome and depression. Possibly, metabolic syndrome promotes onset or chronicity of depression. However, such a longitudinal link has not yet been confirmed. This study examines whether metabolic syndrome or its components are associated with onset and chronicity of depression.
METHOD: Secondary analyses were performed on data from 823 participants (≥ 65 years of age) in the InCHIANTI study, a prospective, population-based cohort study of older persons. From 1998 to 2000, the study sample was randomly selected from the population registry of 2 sites in Italy using a multistage stratified sampling method. Baseline data collection consisted of a home interview and a medical evaluation at the study clinic. Follow-up for each participant occurred after 3 years and 6 years. Metabolic syndrome at baseline was defined as ≥ 3 of the following: abdominal obesity, high triglycerides, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high blood pressure, and high fasting glucose. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D) at baseline and after 3 and 6 years. Sample characteristics were compared between persons with and without depression at baseline using χ² and t statistics. Logistic regression analyses were conducted separately in persons with and without depression at baseline to test whether metabolic syndrome at baseline could predict onset and chronicity of depression at follow-up.
RESULTS: At baseline, 235 persons had metabolic syndrome, and 168 were depressed (CES-D score ≥ 20). Among persons not depressed at baseline, 26.0% developed depression. Higher waist circumference increased the odds of depression onset (adjusted OR per SD increase = 1.28; 95% CI, 1.05-1.56), but there was no association between other metabolic syndrome components and onset of depression. Among persons depressed at baseline, depression had a chronic character in 69.0% of persons without and 88.5% of persons with metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome was associated with an almost 3-fold increase in the odds of chronicity of depression (adjusted OR = 2.66; 95% CI, 1.01-7.00), with almost every metabolic syndrome component contributing to this association.
CONCLUSION: In late life, waist circumference, but not metabolic syndrome, predicted onset of depression. Depressed persons with metabolic syndrome were more likely to have persistent or recurrent depression. The latter may suggest that depression with metabolic abnormalities, which could be labeled metabolic depression, identifies a chronic subtype of depression."

We compare outcomes before and after the 2005 guideline changes adjusting for underlying trends in OHCA survival.
METHODS: The Victorian Ambulance Cardiac Arrest Registry (VACAR) was searched for adult (≥16 years) OHCA of presumed cardiac aetiology, unwitnessed by paramedics with attempted resuscitation. Outcomes for OHCA occurring between 2003 and 2005 were compared with 2007-2009. Segmented regression analysis of interrupted time series data was performed, adjusting for known predictors, to examine changes in survival to hospital and survival to hospital discharge.
RESULTS: For the pre- and post- guideline periods there were 3115 and 3248 OHCAs, respectively. Asystole increased as presenting rhythm (33-43%, p<0.001) as did median EMS response times (7.1-7.8 min, p<0.001) over the two periods. VF/VT arrests decreased (40-35.5%, p=0.001) as did bystander witnessed arrests (63-59%, p=0.002). On univariate analysis survival to hospital discharge improved between the two periods (9.4-11.8%, p=0.002) due to improved outcomes in VF/VT (19-28%, p<0.001). Segmented regression analysis of interrupted time series data showed improvement in the rate of survival to get to hospital for shockable and non-shockable rhythms [OR (95% CI)=1.54 (1.10-2.15, p=0.01) and 1.45 (1.10-2.00, p=0.02), respectively] following implementation of the guidelines however survival to hospital discharge did not improve [OR=1.07 (0.70-1.62, p=0.70) and 1.40 (0.69-2.85, p=0.40), respectively].
CONCLUSIONS: OHCA outcomes have improved since introduction of the 2005 CPR guidelines, but multivariable segmented regression analysis adjusting for pre-existing trends in survival suggests that this improvement may not be due to implementation of the 2005 resuscitation guidelines."
21536403,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21536403/,"BACKGROUND: Numerous states and localities have recently passed legislation mandating the installation and use of residential carbon monoxide (CO) detectors/alarms. Interestingly, there seems to be confusion about the optimal placement, if any, of CO alarms inside the home.
OBJECTIVES: It was the goal of this study to demonstrate the behavior of CO in air and to help provide a data-based recommendation for CO alarm placement.
METHODS: CO was calculated to be slightly lighter than air. An 8-foot-tall airtight Plexiglas chamber was constructed and CO monitors placed within at the top, middle, and bottom. CO test gas (15 L, 3000 parts per million) was infused at each of the three heights in different trials and CO levels measured over time.
RESULTS: Contrary to a significant amount of public opinion, CO did not layer on the floor, float at the middle of the chamber, or rise to the top. In each case, the levels of CO equalized throughout the test chamber. It took longer to equalize when CO was infused at the top of the chamber than the bottom, but levels always became identical with time.
CONCLUSIONS: As would have been predicted by the Second Law of Thermodynamics, CO infused anywhere within the chamber diffused until it was of equal concentration throughout. Mixing would be even faster in the home environment, with drafts due to motion or temperature. It would be reasonable to place a residential CO alarm at any height within the room."
21536620,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21536620/,"BACKGROUND: Ectopic parathyroid adenoma, including intrathyroid adenoma, is a common cause of failed parathyroid operations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the operative strategy/outcome in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT), with special regard to intrathyroid adenomas.
METHOD: The authors performed an analysis of all patients receiving operative treatment for pHPT from 2003 through 2005. The operative strategy consisted of systematic perithyroid exploration followed by extended cervical exploration in cases where the adenoma was not found initially. In cases of persistent, high intraoperative parathyroid hormone levels, hemithyroidectomy was performed on the side with higher suspicion of intrathyroid adenoma or with more extended thyroid changes.
RESULTS: During the study, 115 patients received surgical treatment for sporadic pHPT. A single parathyroid adenoma (normal parathyroid position) was found in 95 patients (82.6%), ectopic single adenoma was found in 7 patients (6.1%), and double adenomas were found in 10 (8.7%) patients. Operative failure occurred in 3 cases (2.6%). In all, 4 of 7 ectopic single adenomas were intrathyroidal and were removed by hemithyroidectomy according to the authors' standard protocol.
CONCLUSION: The strategy of (a) cervical exploration, (b) extended cervical exploration, and (c) hemithyroidectomy was highly successful for removing undetectable intrathyroid parathyroid adenomas during primary intervention, thereby reducing the risks associated with reintervention."
21537864,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21537864/,"PURPOSE: Previous studies have suggested that primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) with only normal parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels is a milder, less symptomatic form of pHPT. This study investigates symptoms, laboratory values, imaging, and outcomes of sporadic pHPT patients with normal PTH values.
METHODS: We reviewed our prospectively collected database of 861 patients with sporadic pHPT who underwent parathyroidectomy between December 1999 and June 2010. Patients with only normal PTH values for 6 months before surgery were compared to a randomized control group of sporadic pHPT patients with elevated PTH, matched 1:2 for age and gender.
RESULTS: Fifty-eight (7%) patients had only normal PTH values within 6 months of surgery. The mean PTH was 55.1 pg/ml in the normal PTH group and 151.3 pg/ml in the control group (n=116). There was no difference in preoperative calcium values, subjective symptoms, bone health, or the frequency of single-gland disease (SGD; 88% vs. 91%) between the two groups, but the normal PTH group had higher preoperative vitamin D values (30.8 vs. 21.4 ng/ml; P<0.001), smaller adenomas (405 vs. 978 mg, P<0.001), and more frequently underwent bilateral neck exploration (57% vs. 49%). There was a trend toward lower sensitivity of preoperative imaging in the normal PTH group.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with pHPT and either elevated or normal PTH levels present with similar symptoms and calcium levels. The majority of patients with normal PTH have SGD, although adenomas are smaller. This may explain why patients with normal PTH values have less sensitive imaging and more frequently require four-gland exploration."
21537866,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21537866/,"BACKGROUND: Complete tumor resection is the mainstay of treatment for retroperitoneal sarcoma (RPS), but the size and quality of surgical margins for radical resection in RPS are unknown. They are believed to be pushing tumors, but recently, aggressive surgical policies leading to multivisceral resection have seemed to suggest better local control compared with simple tumor resection. We analyzed a single-institution series of RPS to provide information useful to surgical decision-making.
METHODS: From 1996 to 2008, 77 patients referred to our institution underwent surgery for primary RPS. Thirty tumors were classified as liposarcoma, and 20 as leiomyosarcoma. Potential prognostic factors were tested retrospectively. Number and pathologic status of resected organs were assessed.
RESULTS: 151 organs were resected. Ninety-two were involved by the tumor (60.9%). Liposarcoma involved 48 of 77 organs resected for this histotype (62.3%). Infiltrative pattern was observed in 39/92 organs, and expansive pattern in 53/92 viscera. The infiltrative pattern was more often observed in leiomyosarcoma and non-lipogenic tumors. The expansive pattern was more often observed in liposarcoma. Psoas was the organ most often involved by infiltrative pattern (12/14); the kidney was the organ most often involved by expansive pattern (19/28). 80% of patients had at least one viscera infiltrated by the tumor.
CONCLUSIONS: This series, in which an aggressive surgical policy was adopted along with extensive pathologic sampling, shows that RPS has a high rate of viscera infiltration. This growth pattern is characteristic of well-differentiated liposarcoma too. These pathologic data should be considered when planning surgical strategy."
21537941,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21537941/,"RATIONALE: Psychosis susceptibility is mediated in part by the dopaminergic neurotransmitter system. In humans, individual differences in vulnerability for psychosis are reflected in differential sensitivity for psychostimulants such as amphetamine. We hypothesize that the same genes and pathways underlying behavioral sensitization in mice are also involved in the vulnerability to psychosis.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of the current study was to investigate which genes and pathways may contribute to behavioral sensitization in different dopaminergic output areas in the mouse brain.
METHODS: We took advantage of the naturally occurring difference in psychostimulant sensitivity in DBA/2 mice and selected animals displaying extremes in behavioral sensitization to amphetamine. Subsequently, the dopamine output areas, prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, and cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) area of the hippocampus, were isolated by laser microdissection and subjected to DNA microarray analysis 1 h after a challenge dose of amphetamine.
RESULTS: A large number of genes with differential expression between high and low responders were identified, with no overlap between brain regions. Validation of these gene expression changes with real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that the most robust and reproducible effects on gene expression were in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Interestingly, many of the validated genes in CA1 are members of the cAMP response element (CRE) family and targets of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and myocyte enhancer factor 2 (Mef2) transcription factors.
CONCLUSION: We hypothesize that CRE, Mef2, and GR signaling form a transcription regulating network, which underlies differential amphetamine sensitivity, and therefore, may play an important role in susceptibility to psychosis."
21538192,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21538192/,"INTRODUCTION: The implementation of laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy (LPD) has been appropriately met with apprehension, and concerns exist regarding outcomes early in a program's experience. We reviewed our early experience and outcomes of LPD.
METHODS: A retrospective review of patients undergoing LPD was compared to a matched cohort of open pancreaticoduodenectomy (OPD) patients. The endpoints are as follows: age, gender, ASA score, BMI, operative time, estimated blood loss, perioperative transfusion requirement, intensive care unit stay, margin status, lymph node count, 90 day morbidity and mortality, length of stay, and adjuvant therapy treatment.
RESULTS: Fourteen patients underwent an attempted LPD. The median operative time was 456 min (interquartile range (IQR), 109.5), median estimated blood loss was 300 ml (IQR, 225), and 29% of the patients required a perioperative blood transfusion. A conversion was necessary in two patients (14%). A malignancy was present in 12 patients. The mean tumor size was 2.2 cm (standard deviation (SD), 1.1), the mean lymph node count was 18.5 (SD 6.2), and an R0 resection was achieved in all 12 cases. Clavien grade I/II complications occurred in 42% of the patients, and Clavien grade III/IV complications occurred in three (20%). There was one late postoperative death. The median length of stay was 8 days. Compared to OPD, LPD took longer to perform, but no differences were noted with respect to blood loss, morbidity, mortality, R0 resection rate, and LN harvest.
CONCLUSIONS: LPD can be implemented in a high-volume pancreatic surgery center with acceptable oncologic and patient outcomes."
21538296,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21538296/,"BACKGROUND: Although young persons with severe and complex emotional and behavioural problems are often referred to the outpatient unit of the mental health service, little information is available about whether these problems increase over the years. This information is urgently needed in order to ensure that the mental health service provides adequate care.
AIM: To obtain more insight into any increase in young persons’ emotional and behavioural problems that may occur over a period of six years following referral to an outpatient unit of the mental health service.
METHOD: The nature, severity and complexity of the emotional and behavioural problems of 123 young persons (1999) and of 149 young persons (2005) at the time of the referral - as rated by their parents on the basis of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) - were assessed; the young persons’ records were also checked for background characteristics.
RESULTS: Compared to 1999, the year 2005 saw a slight decrease in the severity of the problems existing at referral; social problems also declined significantly compared to 1999. Problems identified in the 2005 group often seemed less complex than in 1999. The severity of delinquent behaviour as measured on the Delinquent Behaviour Scale seems to have risen in the 12 to 18 age group in 2005, whereas the severity declined in the 4 to 11-year olds.
CONCLUSION: Emotional and behavioural problems as reported by the parents at the time their children were referred to the mental health service do not increase."
21538311,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21538311/,"OBJECTIVE: Recently, new classification criteria for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have been devised by methodology that used first a quantitative approach (data from databases), then a qualitative approach (consensus; based on paper patients), and finally a common sense-based approach (evaluation of the former phases). Now the individual items that make up these criteria are being evaluated. This study was undertaken to analyze the item ""autoantibodies,"" in particular rheumatoid factor (RF) level.
METHODS: Three separate cohorts comprising a total of 972 patients with undifferentiated arthritis were studied for RA development (according to the 1987 American College of Rheumatology criteria) and arthritis persistence. The positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and likelihood ratios (LRs) were compared between different levels of RF and the presence of anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA). A similar comparison was made in 686 RA patients for the rate of joint destruction and achievement of sustained disease-modifying antirheumatic drug-free remission during 7 years of followup. The variation in RF levels obtained by different measurement methods in the same RF-positive sera was explored.
RESULTS: Compared to high RF levels, presence of ACPA had a better balance between positive LR and negative LR and between PPV and NPV for RA development. The additive value of ACPA assessment after testing for RF level was higher than vice versa. The association between high RF level and RA severity was not as strong as that between ACPA antibodies and RA severity. The RF level obtained by different methods in the same patients' sera varied considerably.
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that determination of RF level is subject to large variation; high RF level has limited additive prognostic value compared to ACPA positivity. Thus, omitting RF level and using RF presence, ACPA presence, and ACPA level may improve the 2010 criteria for RA."
21538820,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21538820/,"BACKGROUND: Partial nephrectomy (NSS) for unilateral nephroblastoma may be beneficial, although in case of regional lymph node (LN) involvement, radiotherapy counteracts the functional benefit of NSS. The aim is to verify whether decrease of tumor volume under preoperative chemotherapy implies clearance of regional LN.
PROCEDURE: SIOP 9301 (1993-2001) collected 1,450 localized nephroblastoma patients of whom 1,360 (93%) had sufficiently available data and were retrospectively reviewed.
RESULTS: Histologic subtypes were classically distributed. Patients were divided in those with tumor positive LN (76, 5.5%) and those with tumor negative LN (1,284, 94.5%) at surgery. In the LN(+) group, the tumor volume changed from a median of 554 (318-772) to 192 (63-458) ml = 67% (27-88%) during preoperative ChT. In the LN(-) group-377 (200-612) to 130 (44-294) ml = 62% (28-83%) (NS). Increase of tumor volume was observed in 16% of patients with LN(+), and 11% of those with LN(-) (NS); ranges are interquartile. Initial tumor volume was significantly larger in the LN(+) patients (P = 0.00091) but not different (NS) at surgery; patients with initial tumor volume under 318 ml had the regional LN involved significantly less frequently (P = 0.00751).
CONCLUSIONS: Change in tumor volume under preoperative chemotherapy is not a predictor for LN status at surgery, although larger initial volume is associated with a higher risk of LN invasion. The decrease of tumor volume is not a good criterion for the safety of NSS. The low rate of LN(+) (5.5%) indicates that this risk is low."

METHODS: All patients who underwent at least two complete colonoscopies less than three years apart were retrospectively identified in our computerized database. We excluded patients with high risk of colonic neoplasm requiring a new colonoscopy in less than three years. We analyzed the incidence of polyps before the first and third year after the first study, and the clinical and endoscopic features related to this finding by means of multivariate logistic regression.
RESULTS: 378 paired colonoscopies fulfilled criteria, 129 were performed less than one year apart (group 1), and 249 less than three years apart (group 2). Regarding surveillance colonoscopies, 19% of patients presented adenomas and 1.5% high grade dysplasia (HGD) in group 1, and 21% presented adenomas and 2% HGD in group 2. In group 1 fair preparation (P = 0.03), and prolonged colonoscopy (P = 0.02) on the first study were independent predictors to find any polyp on the second study before scheduled. In group 2 fair cleansing (P = 0.04), history of sessile polyps (P = 0.01) and 3 or more polyps in the first study (P = 0.01) were independent predictors to find any polyp, while more than 5 polyps in the first study predicate adenomas.
CONCLUSION: During the first year incident polyps related to difficult procedures (missed polyps?) while at 3 years the history of previous polyps was also important."

We aimed to assess the potential delay in drug therapy for subjects with adverse psychosocial factors.
METHOD: The study population consisted of 6185 French men from the PRIME (Prospective Epidemiological Study of Myocardial Infarction) cohort study (1991-2003). The number of extra years to reach a risk threshold for subjects without adverse psychosocial factor compared to subject with adverse psychosocial factor was estimated using a coronary risk model including biomedical factors and a psychosocial variable (education, occupation, living conditions or a depression score).
RESULTS: Coronary risk was significantly higher only for subjects with a high depression score (odds ratio=1.34; 95% confidence interval 1.04, 1.72) or low educational attainment (odds ratio=1.39; 95% confidence interval=1.07, 1.81). For a given risk threshold, subjects with high depression scores were 4.5 years (95% confidence interval=0.0, 15.4 years) younger than subjects with low depression scores. The age difference was 4.1 years (95% confidence interval=-0.5, 15.8 years) between subjects with low and high educational attainment.
CONCLUSION: Clinical decision rules relying on classic cardiovascular risk scoring could result in delayed drug therapy for patients with depression or low educational attainment."
21540205,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21540205/,"BACKGROUND: The optimal duration of antibiotic therapy for ventilator-associated tracheitis (VAT) has not been defined, which may result in unnecessarily prolonged courses of antibiotics. The primary objective of this study was to determine whether prolonged-course (≥7 days in duration) therapy for VAT was more protective against progression to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), compared with short-course antibiotics (<7 days in duration). The secondary objective was to determine whether prolonged-course therapy was more likely to result in the acquisition of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) compared with short-course therapy.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of children ≤18 years of age hospitalized in the intensive care unit and intubated for ≥48 h from January 2007 through December 2009 who received antibiotic therapy for VAT.
RESULTS: Of the 1616 patients intubated for at least 48 h, 150 received antibiotics for clinician-suspected VAT, although only 118 of these patients met VAT criteria. Prolonged-course antibiotics were not protective against subsequent development of HAP or VAP (hazard ratio [HR], 1.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.40-2.91). Factors associated with subsequent MDRO colonization or infection included prolonged-course antibiotic therapy (HR, 5.15; 95% CI, 1.54-7.19), receipt of combination antibiotic therapy (HR, 3.24; 95% CI, 1.54-6.82), and days of hospital exposure prior to completing antibiotic therapy (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.04-1.12).
CONCLUSIONS: A prolonged course of antibiotics for VAT does not appear to protect against progression to HAP or VAP compared with short-course therapy. Furthermore, prolonged antibiotic courses were associated with a significantly increased risk of subsequent MDRO acquisition."
21540478,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21540478/,"PURPOSE: To develop new blends of emulsification-resistant silicone oil based on high molecular weight (HMW) silicone oil for use as an endotamponade in vitreoretinal surgery.
METHODS: Viscosity and elasticity of various silicone oil blends (Siluron 1000, Siluron 2000, Siluron 5000, 7% HMW + Siluron 1000, 10% HMW + Siluron 1000, and 15% HMW + Siluron 1000; Fluoron GmbH, Ulm, Germany) were measured using a piezoelectric axial vibrator. Emulsification was induced using a sonication device. Pluronic 10%, plasma, and serum were used as emulsifiers. The emulsion area was photographed and measured using ImageJ software (developed by Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD; available at http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/index.html).
RESULTS: Viscosity increased proportionally to HMW concentrations. Fluid elasticity was optimum using 10% HMW. Emulsification was at a minimum when using 10% or 15% HMW blends.
CONCLUSIONS: A new silicone oil-based tamponade was developed with a viscosity similar to Siluron 5000 (at 37°C) but with significantly less emulsification tendency than Siluron 5000 or Siluron 2000. HMW concentration increases the fluid elasticity, thereby reducing the emulsification tendency."
21540768,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21540768/,"STUDY DESIGN: Multicenter retrospective review of prospectively collected data.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the extent of rib deformity correction that can be expected with direct vertebral body derotation (DVBD) and investigate factors that may correlate with improved rib deformity correction.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: DVBD is a powerful tool in the surgical correction of axial rotation in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. The application of DVBD has decreased the use of thoracoplasty for cosmetic rib deformity correction, but the outcomes of DVBD without adjuvant thoracoplasty have not been well defined.
METHODS: A multicenter database was retrospectively queried to identify patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis who underwent posterior spinal fusion with at least 2 years of follow-up and Lenke type 1 to 3 curves. All patients had undergone DVBD maneuvers during their surgery, and patients having undergone concurrent thoracoplasty were excluded from the study. The absolute change and percentage change from preoperative inclinometer readings were correlated with preoperative clinical and radiographic data.
RESULTS: A total of 148 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The mean age was 14.7 ± 2.1 years with a mean primary thoracic curve of 55.3° ± 9.3°. The mean preoperative inclinometer reading was 14.8° ± 4.5°, which reduced to 7.5° ± 4.0° postoperatively. Patients had a mean improvement of 54% ± 29% in rib prominence using DVBD. We attempted to correlate 23 of the most commonly used preoperative clinical, radiographic, and operative measures with postoperative inclinometer improvement. Interestingly, none correlated with rib deformity correction, including preoperative rib deformity (P = 0.16), thoracic curve flexibility (P = 0.71), presence of osteotomies (P = 0.60), and thoracic curve magnitude (P = 0.78).
CONCLUSION: Utilizing DVBD, the surgeon can expect approximately 50% reduction in the rib deformity as assessed by inclinometer. This is irrespective of preoperative inclinometer measures, thoracic curve flexibility, and vertebral body rotation on standing and bending radiographs."
21540780,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21540780/,"STUDY DESIGN: In vitro cadaveric study.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to quantify the relative biomechanical protection resulting from ""saving a level"" in long spinal fusions.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: ""Saving levels"" in spinal deformity surgery is desirable. Constructs with lowest instrumented vertebra (LIV) in the lumbar spine may increase loads on unfused lumbar intervertebral discs, leading to accelerated disc degeneration. No study to date has quantified the relative pressure changes that occur in the unfused caudal discs with progressively longer fusions.
METHODS: We used a validated in vitro cadaveric long fusion model to assess intradiscal pressures (IDPs) below simulated fusions. Eight fresh frozen T8-S1 specimens were instrumented from T8 to L5. A follower-type loading system and 7.5-N·m moments were applied in flexion and extension. IDP profiles were assessed with a pressure transducer. After acquiring IDP measurements at a given construct length, the rod was cut 1 level higher until LIV = T12. IDP data from each unfused disc were averaged and normalized to the mean value of the disc when immediately subjacent to the LIV.
RESULTS: In both flexion and extension, the mean normalized IDP of the unfused discs below the LIV increased with increasing fusion length. For each 1-level increase in construct length, pressure increased by 3.2% ± 4.8% in flexion and 4.3% ± 4.5% in extension for each unfused disc. Although the differences in pressure for a given unfused disc with differing LIV were not significant, there were significant differences between unfused discs at a given LIV. With shorter fusion lengths, pressure in the disc immediately subjacent to the fusion was consistently greater than for the caudal-most discs.
CONCLUSION: Unfused caudal lumbar discs experienced increased IDPs with increasing length of instrumentation, most notably at the subjacent discs closest to the LIV."
21540778,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21540778/,"STUDY DESIGN: The effect of long, rigid fixation on adjacent level hypermobility was investigated in a human cadaver model with and without a transitional posterior dynamic stabilization (PDS) device placed at the last caudal level.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate if PDS devices are useful in the setting of spinal deformities to restore increased adjacent level motions, which occur in long constructs. The hypothesis is that load-sharing benefits of these devices will be most suitable in long constructs and may reduce thoracolumbar junctional effects. The PDS device evaluated has a compressive spacer and flexion-dampening bumper.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Mechanical factors such as excessive mobility, increased disc height due to instrumentation, and abnormal loading are thought to accentuate distal level problems, which occur in extended instrumentation. Specifically adjacent level degeneration and distal junctional kyphosis are known to occur in these cases.
METHODS: Seven cadaver spines were tested from T7 to L3. Long instrumentation was applied in 2 rigid groups, R1: Rigid (T8-L2) and R2: Rigid (T8-L1), and PDS to the last caudal level of each, RP1: Rigid (T8-L1) + PDS (L1-L2), and RP2: Rigid (T8-T12) + PDS (T12-L1). Range of motion was evaluated at surgical and distal adjacent levels after displacement controlled loading in a spine tester.
RESULTS: Distal adjacent level motion was increased after 5- and 6-level rigid fixation in flexion-extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation. Most of the increases were seen in axial rotation and lateral bending. Replacing the last caudal instrumented level with the PDS test device was able to alleviate hypermobile conditions of the adjacent noninstrumented level, closer to intact (24%, 12% reduction in RP2, RP1, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Reduction of hypermobility caused by extended arthrodesis may represent a new and ideally suited function for PDS devices. Mechanically, the devices were seen to kinematically restore abnormal distal motion, especially with placement of the PDS at the thoracolumbar junction."
21541731,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21541731/,"PURPOSE: To assess vitamin D status in children aged 2-220 months in northeastern Italy (latitude 46°). Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) concentration was assessed in 93 children afferent to the Pediatric Department of the Hospital of Udine.
METHODS: Vitamin D status was defined as follows: sufficient with serum 25OHD between 50 and 250 nmol/l (level 4); insufficient between 37.5 and 50 nmol/l (level 3); deficient less than 37.5 nmol/l (level 2); severely deficient if less than 12.5 nmol/l (level 1). We investigated the potential risk factors of vitamin D deficit.
RESULTS: We found that six children (6.4%) had level 1, 36 (38.7%) had level 2, 9 (9.7%) had level 3, and only 45.2% had sufficient level of 25OHD. Immigrate children had a higher risk for vitamin D deficiency if compared with Italians: 75% of non-Italian children had an insufficient 25OHD level compared with 47.0% of Italian children (p = 0.0036). There was a marked seasonal effect on 25OHD level: when plasma sample was withdrawn between November and May, only 29.4% of children showed sufficient vitamin D level, while 70.5% was insufficient (p < 0.0001). Among the obese children, 9.0% had sufficient level of 25OHD with 90% being deficient (p = 0.01). We did not find any significant difference in vitamin D status among children in different age groups.
CONCLUSION: Vitamin D deficiency is common in children living in northeastern Italy. The risk factors were winter season for blood withdrawal, non-Caucasian race, and obesity. These high-risk groups should be targeted for screening and educated about the need of sunlight exposure."
21541770,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21541770/,"BACKGROUNDS: Surgical resection remains the first line of treatment for earlier stages of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and it offers the best prognosis for long-term survival. Nevertheless, the recurrence rates after resection are still high in reports. Therefore, it is still essential to explore any potential prognostic factors to attain relatively longer-term survival of HCC patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the period from 1983 to 2005, 1,685 patients who underwent hepatectomy at Chang Gung Memorial hospital were enrolled in the study, and their clinicopathological data were retrospectively reviewed for survival analysis.
RESULTS: The 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates in this series were 60.3%, 39.7%, 31.3%, and 24.0%, respectively, whereas the 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year overall survival (OS) rates were 80.1%, 59.1%, 46.6%, and 27.7%, respectively. Gross vascular invasion, tumor status, lymph node involvement, satellite lesion, positive surgical margin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), albumin, presence of cirrhosis, and Child grade B or C were independent prognostic factors for prediction of DFS; while α-fetoprotein, ALP, surgical factors, including complications, blood transfusion, positive resection margin, and tumor characters including tumor status, vascular invasion, and lack of tumor encapsulation were found to be independent predicting factors for OS, as determined by Cox regression analysis. Interestingly, we found that preoperative level of ALP was one of the most important independent predictors of recurrence, even more important that α-fetoprotein (AFP) as we noticed that elevation of ALP above (82 U/L) predicted poor prognosis in patients where AFP levels was less than 66 ng/ml. It is worth to mention that ALP was statistically related to other liver function tests, but not tumor characters by hierarchical clustering; which means that we were able to correlate ALP with prognosis statistically, but not with pathological criteria of the tumor; to elucidate these finding, further basic science research is required.
CONCLUSION: ALP among liver function tests, in addition to other tumor characters were independent factors for DFS and OS; our results suggest that preoperative ALP levels could be utilized to monitor and predict recurrence in high risk HCC patients."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1993 and 2008, 6426 patients undergoing surgery for stage II breast cancer were enrolled in this prospective study. Patients were randomised into treatment and control groups. In the treatment group a nitroglycerin preparation (Nitroderm) was applied to the flap area. Major complications, recovery periods, menopausal status, additional diseases (diabetes mellitus, hypertension, atherosclerotic heart disease) and adverse effects related to nitroglycerin use were recorded.
RESULTS: The recovery rate without major complications was statistically significantly higher in the nitroglycerin-treated group than in the controls (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that topical nitroglycerin reduces flap complications after breast surgery."
21542430,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21542430/,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the validity of selected entry level characteristics in relation to the GCE A/L examination as independent predictors of performance of students in medical school.
METHODS: A retrospective, analytical study was done at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Kelaniya. Student characteristics at entry were described by sex, the average z-score, General English grade and attempt at GCE A/L examination, and average mark obtained at the English placement test on registration to medical school. Average marks at three summative examinations were used as indicators of performance in medical school. Multivariate analysis using multiple linear regression was carried out using these three outcome measures in relation to four entry point variables as predictors of performance in medical school. Causal path diagrams were constructed using standardised regression coefficients for the whole group and for male and female students separately.
RESULTS: The A/L z-score, A/L attempt and English placement test marks were all significant predictors of outcome at the First Examination. Of the variables relating to the A/L examination, the attempt had a much higher path coefficient with performance at the First Examination than the A/L z-score, as did the English marks. Separate path analyses for male and female students showed that while the significance of the relationships remained the same, the magnitude of the correlation was different.
CONCLUSIONS: Students who gain admission on their 3rd attempt at the AL examination fare much worse than those admitted to medical school on their 1st attempt. Differences between sexes in examination performance are probably linked to both A/L attempt and English language proficiency."
21542449,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21542449/,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the observed elevated levels of psychological distress in cancer survivors relate specifically to aspects of cancer diagnosis, to treatment or to disability.
DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Self-reported questionnaire data on demographic, health and lifestyle factors and mental health from 89574 Australian men and women aged 45 years or older, sampled from the Medicare database for the 45 and Up Study from 1 February 2006 to 30 April 2008. Logistic regression was used to examine the risk of high levels of psychological distress in relation to cancer diagnosis and disability, adjusting for age, sex, income and education.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: High psychological distress (Kessler Psychological Distress Scale score > or = 22).
RESULTS: Overall, 7.5% of participants had high levels of psychological distress. Among cancer survivors, the median time since diagnosis was 7.3 years. Compared with people without cancer, the odds ratios (95% CIs) for psychological distress were: 1.17 (1.09-1.26) in people reporting having had any cancer apart from non-melanoma skin cancer; 1.34 (1.08-1.67) in those with cancer diagnosed in the previous year; 1.53 (1.33-1.76) for those reporting treatment for cancer in the previous month and 1.11 (1.03-1.19) for those with cancer but without recent treatment. Using individuals with neither cancer nor disability as the reference group, the adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) for psychological distress was 6.51 (5.95-7.12) in those reporting significant disability but no cancer, 1.14(1.04-1.24) in those without disability but with cancer and 5.81(4.88-6.91) in those with both cancer and disability.
CONCLUSION: The risk of psychological distress in individuals with cancer relates much more strongly to their level of disability than it does to the cancer diagnosis itself."

STUDY DESIGN: Results of first-trimester combined aneuploidy risk assessment of singleton pregnancies from 2007-2008 were reviewed. For each level of adjusted risk, the rate of invasive testing (CVS or amniocentesis) was compared for those < age 35 and those > or = age 35. Spearman correlation, Fisher's exact test, and chi2 for trend were used for statistical comparison.
RESULTS: For all categories except adjusted risk of 1 in < or = 250, women > or = age 35 were significantly more likely to undergo invasive testing as compared with younger women of similar risk. In women > or = age 35 with low adjusted risk, we observed a trend towards lower rates of invasive testing over time.
CONCLUSION: The higher rate of invasive testing in those > or = 35 indicates that women are still being categorized based on age, though our data suggest this may be decreasing."
21543150,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21543150/,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between 25(OH) vitamin D3 levels and maternal bone turnover during pregnancy and lactation.
STUDY DESIGN: Thirty pregnant women and 30 healthy non-pregnant controls were included the study. The pregnant women were examined in the 12th, 25th and 32nd gestational weeks and 6 weeks after delivery. The controls were examined once. Serum concentrations of 25(OH) vitamin D3, parathyroid hormone (PTH), cross-linked C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX), calcium, and phosphate were measured.
RESULTS: In the 32nd week and the postpartum period, 25(OH) vitamin D3 deficiency rates were 13.3% and 33.3%, respectively. Serum 25(OH) vitamin D3 levels were below the detection limit in 10% and 33%, respectively, of the same subjects. In the control group, rates of 25(OH) vitamin D3 deficiency and ""below detection limit"" were 30% and 23%, respectively. While 25(OH) vitamin D3 and CTX levels were not correlated to each other in the first trimester, a negative correlation was found in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters and the postpartum period between 25(OH) vitamin D3 and CTX levels (r=-0.472, p=0.048; r=-0.893, p<0.0001, r=-0.881, p<0.001, respectively). No correlation between 25(OH) vitamin D3 and CTX levels was found in controls.
CONCLUSION: We consider that 25(OH) vitamin D3 supplementation of women could both decrease maternal bone resorption and lead to enhanced bone mass in offspring during later life. Since women are prone to 25(OH) vitamin D3 insufficiency, we suggest higher doses of 25(OH) vitamin D3 should be given to pregnant subjects."
21543350,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21543350/,"AIM: To explore whether it is possible to predict future United Kingdom (UK) death rate of liver cirrhosis based on birth cohort models.
METHOD: Routinely available mortality data were plotted graphically to display the trends in cirrhosis mortality by birth cohort in several countries. Data for Italy, France, Portugal, USA, Canada, Scotland and England & Wales were plotted by birth cohort.
RESULTS: The current increase in cirrhosis mortality in the UK countries is being driven by a birth cohort effect. Later birth cohorts have much higher death rates than preceding ones. This pattern was seen in Western European and North American countries, which had also experienced increases in liver cirrhosis mortality. However, after the increases, those countries had sudden and persistent falls in death rates. For each country, the dramatic reversal of death rates occurred at a single calendar period and in every age group simultaneously.
CONCLUSION: Prediction of future death rates using information from previous cohorts is not possible due to the occurrence of sudden reversals in death rates. The sudden fall in the death rates of several birth cohorts suggests that reversing the current UK trend of rising liver cirrhosis deaths is possible."
21543526,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21543526/,"INTRODUCTION: Deliberations on euthanasia are mostly theoretical, and often lack first-hand perspectives of the affected persons.
METHOD: Sixty-six patients suffering from cancer in a palliative phase were interviewed about their perspectives of euthanasia in relation to autonomy. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using qualitative content analysis with no predetermined categories.
RESULTS: The informants expressed different positions on euthanasia, ranging from support to opposition, but the majority were undecided due to the complexity of the problem. The informants' perspectives on euthanasia in relation to autonomy focused on decision making, being affected by (1) power and (2) trust. Legalization of euthanasia was perceived as either (a) increasing patient autonomy by patient empowerment, or (b) decreasing patient autonomy by increasing the medical power of the health care staff, which could be frightening. The informants experienced dependence on others, and expressed various levels of trust in others' intentions, ranging from full trust to complete mistrust.
CONCLUSIONS: Dying cancer patients perceive that they cannot feel completely independent, which affects true autonomous decision making. Further, when considering legalization of euthanasia, the perspectives of patients fearing the effects of legalization should also be taken into account, not only those of patients opting for it."
21543547,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21543547/,"INTRODUCTION: Young adults who avoid their emotions may be at risk for starting smoking or not quitting smoking. This study investigated whether a preliminary measure of avoidant coping longitudinally predicts young adults' smoking escalation and cessation.
METHODS: In a sample of the 3,305 participants, originally from Washington State, a preliminary measure of self-reported avoidant coping at age 18 was used to predict both smoking escalation and cessation at ages 20 and 28 with both probability and logistic regression models (10-year retention: 98.5%).
RESULTS: Individuals who scored high on avoidant coping at 18 were 2.52 (p = .001) times more likely to acquire smoking by 20. However, there was no evidence that avoidant coping at age 18 predicted smoking escalation at 28 or cessation for 20- and 28-year-olds.
CONCLUSIONS: An avoidant coping style may have a short-term effect on young adults' smoking acquisition. Future research using a precise and well-validated measure of avoidant coping is now needed to test this possibility."
21544016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21544016/,"BACKGROUND: Maternal smoking during pregnancy is associated with adverse perinatal outcomes. In view of concerns about underreporting, benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P)-DNA adducts could be used to provide information about long-term in utero exposure to smoking but have not previously been used with samples from neonates. This study aimed to verify whether B[a]P-DNA adducts could accurately assess tobacco smoke exposure during fetal life. The objectives were to correlate B[a]P-DNA adduct levels with active maternal and passive smoking and to determine the sensitivity and specificity of smoking and nonsmoking status by comparing neonatal B[a]P-DNA adduct levels with those of maternal self-reports.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: B[a]P-DNA adducts in neonatal buccal cell samples were determined by a competitive immunoassay. Three groups of neonates were constituted according to maternal self-reported smoking status during pregnancy: nonsmokers (n=25; control group), <10 cigarettes per day (n=18; S- group), or >10 cigarettes per day (n=21; S+ group).
RESULTS: The mean B[a]P-DNA adduct level rose significantly when comparing the controls with the S- and S+ groups. Maternal active smoking had the strongest effect on B[a]P-DNA adduct levels in neonates. A cross analysis between B[a]P-DNA adduct levels and maternal self-reported levels revealed high sensitivity and specificity.
CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study suggests that B[a]P-DNA adducts are reliable biomarkers for the screening of long-term in utero exposure to smoking and are accurate when compared with maternal self-reported levels of active smoking. Detection of B[a]P-DNA adducts in neonates could provide a useful, noninvasive tool in clinical risk assessment studies but would benefit from further confirmation with another validated biomarker."
21544158,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21544158/,"BACKGROUND: Solid pseudo papillary tumor of the pancreas is considered a neoplasm of low malignant potential. The radicality of surgical approach is controversial.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We describe and analyze retrospectively the clinical, radiological, laboratory, operative report and pathology results of seven patients who were diagnosed and operated by solid pseudo papillary tumor of the pancreas in the period 2003 to 2010, in our institution.
RESULTS: Six patients were female and one male. The median age was 35 years (range: 15-49). The most common symptom was abdominal pain (100%). Jaundice in one patient (14.3%). The radiological appearance mixed solid-cystic was the most common. We performed four Whipple procedures (57.1%), 2 distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy (28.6%), one by laparoscopy and the other by local resection. Morbidity presented in four patients. There was no postoperative mortality or reoperation. Five tumors were located in the pancreatic head (71.4%) and two in the tail (28.6%). The median tumor size was 93 mm (range: 20-150). Two (28.6%) were R1 resections. Four tumors showed malignant behavior (57.1%): splenic capsule and infiltration of metachronous liver metastases (1), infiltration of superior mesenteric artery (1), lymphatic metastasis (1) and synchronous liver metastases, and lymphovascular invasion duodenal infiltration (1). There was no mortality from the disease during the average follow-up of 26 months (range 6-70 months).
CONCLUSION: Solid pseudo papillary tumor is a neoplasm with high malignant potential in our experience. We recommend an aggressive surgical approach with radical resection including lymphadenectomy."

METHODS: A total of 1598 questionnaires were posted to all female staff, aged 35 years and above. Their knowledge on breast cancer, practice of BSE and detection rate of breast abnormality as confirmed by CBE was determined.
RESULTS: The response rate for this study was 45 percent (714 respondents). The rate of respondents having awareness on breast cancer was 98.7 percent. Eighty four percent (598) of the respondents had performed BSE in their lifetime. However, in only 41% was it regular at the recommended time. Forty seven percent (334) had undergone CBE at least once in a lifetime but only 26% (185) had CBE at least once in the past 3 years, while 23% (165) had had a mammogram. There was a significant relationship between CBE and BSE whereby those who had CBE were twice more likely to do BSE. Nineteen percent (84 respondents) of those who did BSE claimed they had detected a breast lump. Of these, 87% (73) had gone for CBE and all were confirmed as such.
CONCLUSION: BSE is still relevant as a screening tool of breast cancer since those who detect breast lump by BSE will most probably go for further check up. CBE should be done to all women, especially those at highest risk of breast cancer, to encourage and train for BSE."
21545244,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21545244/,"OBJECTIVES: Exposure to maternal smoking during pregnancy may be a significant risk factor for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) independently of family history of ADHD. The main aim of this study was to examine whether the clinical profile of ADHD differs between children with and without exposure to maternal smoking during pregnancy.
METHODS: This was a case-control study of boys and girls with and without ADHD ascertained from psychiatric and paediatric sources. Maternal smoking during pregnancy was defined by interviews with subjects' mothers. Main outcome measures were ADHD symptoms and associated clinical features in children with and without exposure to maternal smoking during pregnancy.
RESULTS: No significant differences were found between ADHD children with and without exposure to maternal smoking during pregnancy on clinical characteristics. When these analyses were repeated in the subgroup of subjects without parental history of ADHD, there were also no statistically significant differences found.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite adequate statistical power, no significant differences were found between ADHD children with and without exposure in the clinical features of ADHD and associated disorders. Results provide support for the notion that ADHD cases resulting from exposure to maternal smoking during pregnancy have similar clinical profiles as other ADHD cases."
21545379,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21545379/,"OBJECTIVES: Few studies have assessed the utility of the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) in explaining physicians' behaviour. This study uses the TPB for explaining physicians' implementation of guidelines' prescribing recommendations.
METHODS: We developed the questionnaire via conducting qualitative interviews and pilot study. A random sample of 155 general practitioners (GPs) in England participated in the study. Prescribing and practice data were collected from routine sources. We analysed the data using regression methods.
RESULTS: TPB explained 48% of variation in reported intentions to follow guidelines' prescribing recommendations. Attitude and perceived controls, but not subjective norms, were predictors of variation in intentions. TPB belief variables significantly explained variation in effective and efficient prescribing indicators (14% and 12% respectively). Normative, control and behavioural beliefs contributed to the models. Only for efficient prescribing, the TPB items retained their significance in presence of demographic variables. We found no significant relationship between intention and prescribing.
CONCLUSIONS: TPB helped understanding of GPs prescribing behaviour and their intentions to implement a clinical guideline. Beliefs (e.g. normative beliefs) were better predictors of behaviour than the composite scores for their corresponding higher-level construct (e.g. indirect subjective norm). TPB models should be tested alongside randomized trials to test the assumption of causality that change in beliefs ultimately results in change in behaviour."
21545380,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21545380/,"OBJECTIVE: To quantify antibiotics sales without a prescription and to explore provision of patient assessment and medicine information related to antibiotics requested with or without a prescription in Surabaya community pharmacies.
METHODS: Scenarios of specific product requests (ciprofloxacin tablets and tetracycline capsules) and a request of amoxicillin dry syrups based on a new prescription were presented by simulated patients to 105 purposively selected pharmacies. Data were recorded by simulated patients after their purchase of each product. They documented the questions asked in patient assessment, the content of information given, recommendations provided and pharmacy workers' characteristics.
RESULTS: Antibiotics requested without a prescription were sold in 80 (91%) pharmacies. Information related to ciprofloxacin tablets and tetracycline capsules was only provided when requested by the simulated patient in 69% and 68% of pharmacies for the two scenarios, respectively. Very few pharmacies assessed patients. Medicine information on indication, dosing, duration and direction for use was provided more frequently in all cases. Medicine information was more likely to be given when a new prescription of amoxicillin dry syrups being presented. Overall, the majority of sampled pharmacies responded antibiotics requests inappropriately.
CONCLUSION: Inappropriate responses to antibiotic requests with or without a prescription remain an issue in Indonesia with pharmacy workers often failing to adequately assess patients. The illegality of delivering antibiotics without a prescription is of a considerable concern. Therefore, strategies to control antibiotics dispensing in community pharmacies should be seriously considered."
21545469,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21545469/,"OBJECTIVE: A first step in the delivery of tailored care is answering the following question: does health care meet the needs of patients? Therefore patients' perspective on health care use and their needs was examined. The design used was cross-sectional questionnaire study.
PATIENTS: A total of 1109 adult congenital heart defect (CHD) patients attending one of eight Dutch hospitals were randomly selected from a national database (10% of all registered patients).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient reported questionnaires on in- and outpatient health care use during the past year and need for additional care.
RESULTS: A total of 66% and 40% of patients had contact with their cardiologist and general practitioner, respectively. Six to 10 percent were hospitalized, operated upon, or visited the emergency room. For the majority, the amount of contact was sufficient. Most patients indicated that the communication skills and expertise of the cardiologist and general practitioner were sufficient, and health care improvements were not necessary. Frequent health care users had a poor functional status and frequent contact with their cardiologist and general practitioner. Patients who want more contact with their cardiologist rated the communication skills of the cardiologist as insufficient.
CONCLUSIONS: For most patients, the amount and quality of care are both sufficient. Patients who rate the communication skills of the cardiologist as insufficient have need more contact. In addition to the recommended training program as described in the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines, we recommend the incorporation of communication training. This is the first study to provide insight into health care use and needs of CHD patients in countries with a compulsory health insurance system from the patient perspective."

BACKGROUND: The positive association between physical workload and both intention to leave and sickness absence in the healthcare sector is well-established. However, knowledge is limited with respect to how social contextual factors such as collective efficacy moderate these associations.
METHODS: A questionnaire was distributed over a 4-month period in 2006/2007 to all employees at elderly care centres in 35 Danish municipalities who were asked to rate their groups' collective efficacy. The final sample consisted of 6929 female employees from 290 work groups. Employees were predominantly healthcare helpers and assistants, but also nurses and other healthcare professionals participated in the study. Information on collective efficacy was aggregated to work group level.
RESULTS: Collective efficacy moderated the association between physical workload and intention to leave, i.e. employees with high levels of physical workload had lower intention to leave if they worked in a group with high levels of collective efficacy and higher intention to leave if they worked in a group with low levels of collective efficacy. No moderating effect of collective efficacy on the association between physical workload and sickness absence was found.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that enhancing the sense of collective efficacy might be a mean for organizations and managers to reduce intention to leave, but further research is needed."
21545703,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21545703/,"BACKGROUND: Multiple aspects of gait are typically impaired post-stroke. Asymmetric gait is common as a consequence of unilateral brain lesions. The relationship between the resulting asymmetric gait and impairments in the ability to properly coordinate the reciprocal stepping activation of the legs is not clear. The objective of this exploratory study is to quantify the effects of hemiparesis on two putatively independent aspects of the bilateral coordination of gait to gain insight into mechanisms and their relationship and to assess their potential as clinical markers.
METHODS: Twelve ambulatory stroke patients and age-matched healthy adults wore a tri-axial piezo-resistive accelerometer and walked back and forth along a straight path in a hall at a comfortable walking speed during 2 minutes. Gait speed, gait asymmetry (GA), and aspects of the bilateral coordination of gait (BCG) were determined. Bilateral coordination measures included the left-right stepping phase for each stride φi, consistency in the phase generation φ_CV, accuracy in the phase generation φ_ABS, and Phase Coordination Index (PCI), a combination of accuracy and consistency of the phase generation.
RESULTS: Group differences (p < 0.001) were observed for gait speed (1.1 ± 0.1 versus 1.7 ± 0.1 m/sec for patients and controls, respectively), GA (26.3 ± 5.6 versus 5.5 ± 1.2, correspondingly) and PCI (19.5 ± 2.3 versus 6.2 ± 1.0, correspondingly). A significant correlation between GA and PCI was seen in the stroke patients (r = 0.94; p < 0.001), but not in the controls.
CONCLUSIONS: In ambulatory post-stroke patients, two gait coordination properties, GA and PCI, are markedly impaired. Although these features are not related to each other in healthy controls, they are strongly related in stroke patients, which is a novel finding. A measurement approach based on body-fixed sensors apparently may provide sensitive markers that can be used for clinical assessment and for enhancing rehabilitation targeting in post-stroke patients."
21545714,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21545714/,"BACKGROUND: Single blastocyst transfer has the advantage of maximizing the fresh single pregnancy rate. However, in patients with a low number of good quality embryos on day 3, it remains unclear whether immediate embryo transfer or further embryo culture with blastocyst transfer is the most preferable option.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was carried out in which the outcome of 590 fresh in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles over a 15 months period and their cryo cycles were analyzed. A total of 341 patients cycles had an elective day 5 strategy independent of intermediate embryo evaluation while another 249 patients underwent a day 5 embryo transfer only if at least four embryos were available on day 3. Blastocyst vitrification was performed using a closed high security system.
RESULTS: Demographics, stimulation parameters and embryological data were comparable in the two groups. Patients in the elective day 5 group had a lower fresh transfer rate (90.62% vs. 95.18%, p < 0.05) as compared to patients with a day 3 or day 5 embryo transfer policy. No difference was observed in the fresh live birth rate and multiple pregnancy rate per initiated cycle (32.84% vs. 28.92%; 1.17% vs 0%) The projected cumulative ongoing pregnancy rate compensating for double counting in case subjects have more than one pregnancy is not different (42.58% vs. 39.84%).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite lower fresh transfer rates, elective single blastocyst transfer yields a similar projected cumulative ongoing pregnancy rate as in a policy with cleavage stage or blastocyst transfer depending on a good quality embryo count on day 3."

METHODS: Retrospective review was performed of all thyroidectomy patients from a tertiary care center between January 2004 and March 2010.
RESULTS: One hundred forty-eight patients met the inclusion criteria. Subtotal and hemithyroidectomies (n = 79) were compared against completion and total thyroidectomies (n = 72). Nine total thyroidectomy patients (12.5%) required unplanned overnight admission, compared with 4 hemithyroidectomy patients (5.1%) (P = .15). The majority were admitted for pain and nausea control. Overnight admissions were highest among men (32% vs 5%, P = .002) and patients with Graves' disease (36% vs 6%, P = .003). Postoperative complications occurred in 6 total thyroidectomy patients (8.3%) and 3 hemithyroidectomy patients (3.8%) (P = .31). Only 4 patients (2.6%) required readmission for complications. There were no deaths.
CONCLUSIONS: Outpatient thyroidectomy performed by an experienced surgeon is safe and feasible. Men and patients with Graves' disease have a higher probability of requiring postoperative admission."
21545911,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21545911/,"BACKGROUND: Anastomotic leak after sigmoidectomy for diverticular disease can have devastating consequences. Preservation or sacrifice of the descending colon or rectal arterial supply may affect the anastomosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether preservation of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) or superior rectal artery (SRA) was associated with a decreased anastomotic leak rate.
METHODS: A retrospective review of adult patients undergoing sigmoidectomies from 2 military tertiary care centers was performed, evaluating patient demographic and operative variables for their effects on anastomotic leak rate.
RESULTS: A total of 130 patients were identified. The overall anastomotic leak rate was 5.4%. Laparoscopy was used in 41%, and stapled anastomoses were used in 91%. The IMA was sacrificed in 29% and the SRA in 37%. There were no significant differences in leak rates when the IMA or SRA was sacrificed (0% and 3.7% with the IMA and SRA sacrificed, 9.3% and 6.5% with the vessels preserved; P = .140 and P = .610, respectively). Laparoscopic technique (P = .843), emergency surgery (P = .29), and operative time (P = .78) did not affect leak rate. Hand-sewn anastomoses were associated with a higher leak rate (33% vs 2%; odds ratio, 3.44; 95% confidence interval, 1.514-7.817; P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: IMA or SRA preservation or sacrifice was not associated with an increased leak rate from colorectal anastomoses after sigmoidectomy for diverticular disease. Stapled anastomoses were associated with a lower leak rate than hand-sewn anastomoses."
21546376,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21546376/,"AIMS: Alcohol-related crime is a substantial community problem. There is evidence to suggest that certain geographic areas experience higher rates of alcohol-related crime and that both individual and community factors are associated with alcohol-related crime. There is limited research at the community level despite communities being the target of interventions designed to reduce alcohol-related harm. This study aims to determine whether there are differences in alcohol-related crime at the community level and examines whether certain community characteristics are associated with increased alcohol-related crime.
METHODS: Routinely collected police data from 20 rural communities in New South Wales, Australia were analysed. The ratio of alcohol to non-alcohol-related criminal incidents was used as a proxy for alcohol-related crime. Predictor variables were population-adjusted community characteristics, including demographic and resource variables.
RESULTS: Regression analyses suggest that there are differences between communities in alcohol-related crime. Less socioeconomic disadvantage and more GPs and licensed premises (pubs and clubs) are associated with greater alcohol-related crime at the community level.
CONCLUSIONS: Decreasing the socioeconomic well-being of a community is not appropriate; however, introducing additional taxes to increase the cost of alcohol may decrease consumption and therefore alcohol-related crime. Reducing or capping the number of licensed premises, specifically the number of pubs and clubs, may be an appropriate strategy to reduce alcohol-related crime in rural communities."
21546403,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21546403/,"BACKGROUND: End-of-life care is deemed to be poor in the United States - particularly in large teaching hospitals. Via a brief survey, we examined satisfaction with end-of-life care for those patients who died in our academic medical center from provider and family perspectives.
METHODS: To assess the correlation between overall satisfaction between providers (attending, housestaff, and nurses) as well as family members for decedents who died in our hospital, we conducted a satisfaction survey regarding care in the last three days of life. The nine item survey was administered within 1 week of the patient s death to care providers and approximately 8 to 12 weeks to next of kin.
RESULTS: There were 166 deaths examined over the four month study period. Overall satisfaction with care was 3.02 out of 4.0, and differed by respondent group (p= 0.035). Correlation between respondents was very low (range 0.02 to 0.51). The least discordance was between residents and interns (0.5), who had the lowest level of satisfaction (2.72). Housestaff and attendings had the lowest overall correlation in mean satisfaction scores (0.05). Most providers knew their patients for 24 hours or less.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall satisfaction was high, but there was discordance among different providers. Continuity of care was limited. Age and location of death alone did not significantly affect satisfaction with end-of-life care. Implications of this type of research for improving end of life care at academic centers are discussed."
21546434,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21546434/,"BACKGROUND: It is unclear how patient preferences for autonomy vary given different severity of a single condition.
OBJECTIVE: To assess patient preferences for autonomy in making decisions about taking medication to prevent a heart attack, across a wide range of personal calculated cardiovascular disease (CVD) 5-year risk.
METHODS: Consecutive eligible patients in family practice waiting rooms in Auckland, New Zealand self-completed a questionnaire. Questions related to a hypothetical cardiovascular medication, where risks and benefits were framed from their personal predicted 5-year CVD risk. Participant preference for autonomy was measured by ranking their decision-making preference on 5-point scale from 'doctor only' to 'patient only'.
RESULTS: There were 934 participants, with personal predicted 5-year cardiovascular risks that ranged from 5% to 30%. Preference for autonomy decreased as CVD risk increased, after adjustment for age, gender, numeracy and ethnicity. Preference for autonomy increased independently among younger participants, women and those who were more numerate. Compared to participants of European ethnicity, those of Pacific, East Asian and Indian Asian ethnicity were more likely to want the doctor to decide.
CONCLUSIONS: No combination of predicted risk, demographics or attitudes strongly predicted the preference of an individual patient. Clinicians should therefore seek to understand and confirm each patient's preferences."
21546742,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21546742/,"PURPOSE: We evaluated the performance of the new 4-tiered melanoma-specific graded prognostic assessment (GPA) score and the previously published general GPA score in patients with brain metastases from malignant melanoma managed with different approaches including best supportive care.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 51 patients. Compared with the original analysis of the melanoma-specific GPA score, these patients were more representative of the general population of patients with brain metastases from this disease.
RESULTS: The present data confirmed that both scores identify patients with favorable prognosis who might be candidates for focal treatments. However, survival in the 2 unfavorable prognostic subgroups defined by the melanoma-specific GPA was not significantly different. Median survival in the melanoma-specific GPA classes was 3.1, 3.7, 7.5, and 12.7 months. Karnofsky performance status (KPS) and serum lactatdehydrogenase (LDH) level significantly predicted survival.
CONCLUSION: In order to select the right patient to the right treatment and avoid overtreatment and suboptimal resource utilization in patients with very limited survival, improved prognostic tools are needed. The melanoma-specific GPA does not include extracranial disease extent or surrogate markers such as LDH. We suggest that a combination of KPS <70 and elevated LDH might better predict short survival than any of the GPA scores. This hypothesis should be confirmed in larger studies."
21546787,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21546787/,"BACKGROUND: The Health of the Nation Outcome Scales (HoNOS) is a clinician-rated instrument for the differentiated measurement of severity in patients with mental disorder. Item 8 of the instrument, assessing 'Other mental and behavioral problems', is particularly relevant for patients with affective disorders, anxiety disorders, and eating and personality disorders. However, some studies have shown that the scale possesses unsatisfactory psychometric properties. The objective of the present study was therefore to validate the psychometric properties of a more specified version of the HoNOS-D item 8.
METHODS: The instrument's reliability and validity were tested using a large, representative, clinical sample of patients with mental disorders (study 1: n = 1,918 and n = 1,357). Additional tests of reliability and criterion validity were performed using a further clinical sample of patients with mental disorders (study 2: N = 55).
RESULTS: The extended version of the HoNOS provides a differentiated picture of additional problem areas for the patient. Although inter-rater reliability indicates a need for more detailed instructions, the problem areas of item 8 proved on the whole to be suitable for measuring the extent and severity of mental problems that are present in addition to the primary problem.
CONCLUSION: In order to make the extended assessment of the HoNOS useful for clinical routine practice, a supplemental glossary is needed."
21546790,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21546790/,"BACKGROUND: Violence is a major public health problem. Both clinical and population based studies shows that violence against men and women has physical and psychological health consequences. However, elsewhere and in Sweden little is known of the effect of individual socioeconomic position (SEP) on the relation between violence and health outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the effect of individual SEP on the relation between violence and three health outcomes (general health, pain and anxiety) among women in Stockholm County.
METHODS: The study used data from the Stockholm Public Health Survey, a cross-sectional survey carried out in 2006 for the Stockholm County Council by Statistic Sweden. 34 704 respondents answered the survey, the response rate was sixth one percent. Analyses were carried out using descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis in SPSS v.17.0.
RESULTS: Individual SEP increased the odds of reporting poor health outcomes among victimized women in Stockholm County. Regarding self-reported health women in low-SEP who reported victimization in the past twelve months had odds of 2,36 (95% CI 1.48-3.77) for the age group 18-29 years and 3.78 (95% CI 2.53-5.64) for the age group 30-44 years compared with women in high-SEP and non-victim. For pain the odds was 2,41 (95% CI 1,56-3,73) for the age group 18-29 years and 2,98 (95% CI 1,99-4,46) for women aged 30-44 years. Regarding anxiety the age group 18-29 years had odds of 2,53 (95% CI 1,58-4,03) and for the age group 30-44 years had odds of 3,87 (95% CI 2,55-5,87).
CONCLUSION: Results showed that individual SEP (measured by occupation) matters to the relationship between violence and health outcomes such as general self-reported health, pain and anxiety. Women in lower SEP and experienced victimization in the past twelve months had increased odds of reporting poorer self-rated health, pain and anxiety compared to those in higher SEP with no experience of victimization. However, further exploration of the relationship between poverty, individual SEP is needed using other Swedish population samples."
21547404,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21547404/,"BACKGROUND: In 2008, Troy et al. hypothesised that under fasting conditions, intestinal gluconeogenesis generates glucose levels in the portal vein which trigger the portal sensor to change insulin resistance and that this mechanism contributes to the effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery on type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In a recent paper, Kashyap et al. (Int J Obes 34(3):426-471, 2010) cited this hypothesis as a potential explanation for the early changes in insulin sensitivity and beta cell function seen after RYGB. We proposed a study to examine this possibility.
METHODS: We simultaneously sampled fasting portal venous blood and central venous blood in 28 patients (eight diabetics and 20 non-diabetics) before and again six days after RYGB surgery in morbidly obese patients, for measurement of glucose levels.
RESULTS: We found no significant difference in the glucose levels from the two sites either before or after RYGB in diabetic patients and a small, but significant difference in the post-operative glucose levels from non-diabetic patients (4.2 vs 4.0 mM, p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Direct simultaneous measurement of fasting glucose in portal and central venous blood before and 6 days after RYGB provides no evidence to support the hypothesis that intestinal gluconeogenesis contributes to the resolution of T2DM seen after RYGB."
21547421,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21547421/,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine whether the prophylactic use of a biologic prosthesis protects against the development of incisional hernia in a high-risk patient population.
METHODS: A prospective, nonrandomized trial was conducted on 134 patients undergoing open Roux-en-Y gastric bypass by a single surgeon, at two institutions, from January 2005 to November 2007. At Hospital A, all patients (n=59) underwent fascial closure of the abdominal midline wound with the prophylactic placement of a biologic mesh (AlloDerm®) in an in-lay fashion. Patients at Hospital B (n=75) underwent primary abdominal wall closure using #1 PDS in a running fashion. Data collected included patient demographics, abdominal wall closure technique, postoperative wound complications, follow-up period, and incidence of incisional hernia.
RESULTS: During the study period 134 patients (mean age=40.4 years, 80.7% female) underwent open Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (59.7% mesh, 41.5% nonmesh). Twenty-eight patients were excluded from the analysis secondary to a short follow-up period (mesh=13, nonmesh=11) and/or reoperative surgery unrelated to the development of an incisional hernia (mesh=2, nonmesh=2). The mean follow-up period was 17.3±8.5 months. The overall incidence of incisional hernia was 11.3% (95% CI: 5.2-17.45). The incidence of incisional hernia was significantly lower in the mesh group versus the nonmesh group (2.3 vs. 17.7%, P=0.014). In a multivariate logistic regression model that adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, albumin, smoking, diabetes, prior surgery, seroma formation, weight loss, and mesh placement, the development of incisional hernia was found to be associated with smoking (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 8.46, 95% CI: 1.79-40.00, P=0.007) while prophylactic mesh was noted to be protective against hernia development (adjusted OR 0.06, 95% CI: 0.006-0.69, P=0.02).
CONCLUSION: The prophylactic use of biologic mesh for abdominal wall closure appears to reduce the incidence of incisional hernia in patients with multiple risk factors for incisional hernia development."
21547470,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21547470/,"AIMS: Sacral neurostimulation (SNS) involves a two-stage procedure to assess outcomes prior to permanent implantation. Stage 1 involves placement of a sacral lead that is externalized and tested for 2 weeks. Stage 2 is the implantation of a pulse generator in responders (≥ 50% improved). This study's purpose was to determine the overall response rate, costs of a two-staged versus single-stage approach, and explore predictors of a positive response.
METHODS: A prospective database of 145 patients undergoing SNS was analyzed. Demographics, history, and operative data were collected from the medical records. Cost data were collected from our institutions' reported average reimbursement for all stages of Interstim implantation and explantation in 2008. Wilcoxon rank test were used for analysis.
RESULTS: Of 145 patients, 131 (90.3%) progressed to Stage 2 and 14 (9.7%) had removal. Explanted patients were older (mean 63 years) than implanted patients (56 years); however, this was not statistically significant. Total Medicare and Blue Cross/Blue Shield (BCBS) reimbursement for a two-stage procedure was calculated at $21,428/case and $26,968. Implanting the lead and generator as a single-stage would cost Medicare and BCBS $20,696 and $21,602, respectively. Since 9.7% were explanted, overall cost saving might be significant: a single-stage approach would yield savings of $3,655/case (BC/BS) over a two-stage approach (after the cost of explantation is factored in).
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients tested with SNS would benefit from a single-stage procedure (90.3%). This would reduce operative and anesthesia risks, time lost from work, and burden on patients and providers."
21547524,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21547524/,"PURPOSE: This study was designed to evaluate the safety of selective transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) with N-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA) in a swine model in terms of histological changes in the pancreas.
METHODS: Three groups of two female swine (58-64 kg) per group underwent TAE of the dorsal pancreatic artery, under anesthesia, with 1:1, 1:4, and 1:9 mixtures of NBCA and iodized oil. Blood parameters were evaluated at days 1, 4, and 10 after TAE, after which the animals were sacrificed and pancreatic tissues were examined under light microscopy.
RESULTS: All of the animals were asymptomatic and survived for 10 days. Cone beam computed tomographic angiography revealed occlusion of the dorsal pancreatic artery and no enhancement in the embolized area. The white blood cell count and C-reactive protein level were elevated slightly on day 1 after TAE (mean ± SD: 252.7 ± 27.8 × 10(2)/μl and 0.15 ± 0.07 mg/l, respectively), but they normalized or remained near the upper normal limit thereafter. The serum amylase and lipase levels also were elevated on day 1 (8831.7 ± 2169.2 U/l and 130 ± 53.4 U/l, respectively) but normalized thereafter. Histologically, necrosis and fibrosis were noted only in the embolized segment, and necrosis and acute inflammatory reactions were absent in the nonembolized segment. The border between both segments was well defined. Lymphocytic infiltration and foreign body reaction were noted around the embolized vessels.
CONCLUSIONS: Selective TAE with NBCA in the pancreas caused localized ischemic necrosis without clinically significant pancreatitis; therefore, this procedure is tolerable in swine."
21547872,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21547872/,"OBJECTIVE: Actual codes for operations and procedures (OPS) in psychiatry and psychosomatics should map cost separating therapeutic activities so far defined in Germany by the normative specifications of the psychiatry staff enactment (PsychPV). OPS codes should also allow re-estimating underlying therapy times.
METHOD: Therapeutic activities of the PsychPV fulfilling the minimal criteria of the OPS definition were classified as multiples of a therapeutic 25 minute unit.
RESULTS: Therapeutic activities of the PsychPV are mapped to OPS complex codes in a variable degree (psychiatrists 35 %, psychologists 42 %, nurses 43 %, special therapists 59 %).
CONCLUSION: Actual OPS codes are inappropriate for identifying relevant cost-separating factors in the therapy of psychiatric in-patients. They cannot assure in their actual form the standards given by the PsychPV and need substantial revision."
21547895,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21547895/,"OBJECTIVE: Impaired proprioception may alter joint loading and contribute to the progression of knee osteoarthritis (OA). Although frontal plane loading at the knee contributes to OA, proprioception and its modulation with OA in this direction have not been examined. The aim of this study was to assess knee proprioceptive acuity in the frontal and sagittal planes in patients with knee OA and healthy subjects. We hypothesized that proprioceptive acuity in both planes of movement will be decreased in patients with OA.
METHODS: The study group comprised 13 patients with knee OA and 14 healthy age-matched subjects. Proprioceptive acuity was assessed in varus, valgus, flexion, and extension using threshold to detection of passive movement (TDPM) tests. Repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to assess differences in TDPM values between the 2 groups and across movement directions. Linear regression analyses were performed to assess the correlation of the TDPM between and within planes of movement.
RESULTS: The TDPM was significantly higher (P<0.05) in the group with knee OA compared with the control group for all directions tested, indicating reduced proprioceptive acuity. Differences in the TDPM between groups were consistent across all movement directions, with mean differences as follows: for valgus, 0.94° (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.20-1.65°); for varus, 0.92° (95% CI 0.18-1.68°); for extension, 0.93° (95% CI 0.19-1.66°); for flexion, 1.11° (95% CI 0.38-1.85°). The TDPM measures across planes of movement were only weakly correlated, especially in the group with knee OA.
CONCLUSION: Consistent differences in the TDPM between the group of patients with knee OA and the control group across all movement directions suggest a global, not direction-specific, reduction in sensation in patients with knee OA."
21547980,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21547980/,"OBJECTIVES: Age at menarche (AAM) in the general population may be influenced by prenatal sex steroids. The ratio of the second and fourth digits (2D:4D) is a putative correlate of prenatal sex steroids, but the relationship of 2D:4D to AAM is controversial. Matchock ([2008]: Am J Hum Biol 20:487-489) has reported that right 2D:4D (but not left) was negatively related to AAM, but Helle ([2010a]: Am J Hum Biol 22:418-420) found no relationship. Here the association between 2D:4D, AAM, and self-reported rate of pubertal development (RPD) is considered.
METHODS: The sample consisted of self-measured finger lengths and AAM and RPD reported by women in the BBC internet study.
RESULTS: There were 70,658 white women who reported a mean (± SD) AAM of 12.54 (1.48) years. Right 2D:4D was negatively related to AAM and positively related to RPD. These relationships were independent of left 2D:4D, age and height. Between-country variation in right 2D:4D was also significantly related to AAM such that in countries with low 2D:4D women mean AAM was higher.
CONCLUSIONS: In support of the findings of Matchock, right 2D:4D was found to be negatively related to AAM. In addition, right 2D:4D was positively related to RPD. In a sample of 19 countries, mean right 2D:4D was negatively correlated with mean national AAM. These findings suggest that women with high prenatal testosterone and low prenatal estrogen tend to show late menarche and slow pubertal development."
21549378,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21549378/,"INTRODUCTION: The distal locking of an intramedullary tibial nail can be challenging and time consuming when performed freehand. This study was conducted to evaluate if a distal aiming device would reduce surgical time.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A case-controlled study was performed between 2007 and 2009 with 30 patients receiving a reamed tibial nail (Centronail) with the use of a distal aiming device and 30 patients who were treated with an Unreamed Tibia Nail (UTN), with freehand distal locking, in the same period. The primary outcome in this study was operative time. Secondary outcomes were the need for fluoroscopy, time to consolidation and complications.
RESULTS: Operation time was longer in the Centronail group compared with the UTN group (126 min vs. 96 min, p=0.000). Use of fluoroscopy for distal locking was needed in half of the cases (n=16) using a distal aiming device. No differences were found regarding time to consolidation, time to removal of the nail and complications.
CONCLUSION: The use of an aiming device for distal locking of a tibia nail lengthens operation time rather than reducing it. Fluoroscopy was still needed in about half of the cases. No difference was seen in clinical outcomes. The use of a distal aiming device to lock a tibial nail appears to have no benefit."
21549852,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21549852/,"BACKGROUND: There is a close link between fungal sensitization and asthma severity. Although Schizophyllum commune (S. commune, ""suehirotake"" in Japanese), one of the basidiomycetous (BM) fungi, is a fungus that can cause allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis (ABPM) and allergic fungal sinusitis (AFS), whether the fungus causes or sensitizes subjects to asthma is unclear.
METHODS: The bronchial provocation test using S. commune antigen was performed in two asthmatics who had demonstrated positive skin reactions to the S. commune antigen, and low dose of itraconazole (50 mg/day) was prescribed as an adjunctive therapy for 2 weeks. The allergological features and clinical manifestations of these patients are herein evaluated and discussed.
RESULTS: Case 1 was a 71-year-old female, and case 2 was a 69-year-old male. Both patients demonstrated positive reactions to the inhalation test. A diagnosis of AFS or ABPM was excluded in both patients because of the lack of a history of pulmonary infiltrates, central bronchiectasis, a history of expectoration of brown plugs or flecks, or sinusoidal findings. Although the efficacy of itraconazole in our cases was unclear, the elevated titer of the specific IgG-for S. commune in case 2 gradually decreased during the period of antifungal therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: The two patients described herein were diagnosed to have bronchial asthma caused by S. commune; so-called Schizophyllum asthma. S. commune may also be a causative fungal antigen of bronchial asthma."
21549914,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21549914/,"BACKGROUND: Cannabis implication in the pathophysiology of distal arteritis remains controversial. The aim is to assess whether cannabis co-exposure influences presentation and outcome of thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO) in tobacco smokers.
METHODS: All consecutive patients presenting with a definite TAO were retrospectively reviewed according to their tobacco and cannabis consumption status.
RESULTS: A total of 38 patients with a definite TAO were included in this study. In all, 10 patients (26%) used tobacco together with cannabis (δ9-trans-tetrahydrocannabinol [THC], THC(+)), whereas 28 patients (74%) were only tobacco smokers (THC(-)). Tobacco exposure was comparable in both groups (21.7 ± 12 vs. 26.7 ± 17 pack-years). THC(+) patients were younger than THC(-) patients at onset of symptoms (28.5 ± 7 years vs. 36.6 ± 10.5 years, p = 0.02) and have more frequently unilateral involvement of lower limbs (44% vs. 7%, p = 0.02). Although 66% of patients presented with critical ischemia of lower limbs, THC(+) patients exhibited more often rest pain without ischemic ulcers (50% vs. 5%, p = 0.048). Upper limbs were clinically affected in 50% of THC(+) patients and 32% of THC(-) patients. Repeated infusions of iloprost were required in 84% of patients. Outcome and rate of minor and major amputations (10%) did not differ between groups.
CONCLUSION: Cannabis exposure influences the age at onset and presentation of TAO, but not the outcome. The data of present study suggest that cannabis represent a co-factor of tobacco that may accelerate TAO onset and presentation."
21549916,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21549916/,"BACKGROUND: Allogeneic blood products have become a limited and expensive resource. The Continuous Autotransfusion System (CATS) has been promoted as a method for reducing the need for allogeneic blood transfusion. This study was undertaken to ascertain whether the use of CATS in emergency open AAA surgery has any benefits.
METHODS: This is a retrospective study of all patients undergoing emergency open AAA surgery in our center during a 5-year period (between July 2004 and July 2009). Patients were identified from a prospectively maintained vascular database, and data were obtained from patient records.
RESULTS: CATS was used in 69 emergency open AAA repairs. The median total blood loss was 3,500 mL (range: 751-13,796 mL) but the median volume of packed red blood cells produced by CATS was only 493 mL (~ 2 U). An average of 7 U (range: 0-19 U) of bank blood was still used despite the availability of CATS. The mean hemoglobin 24 hours postoperatively was 10.3 g/dL (6.4-14.1) with a hematocrit of 0.30.
CONCLUSION: The use of CATS in emergency AAA surgery does not seem to reduce the use of allogeneic blood transfusion. This may be because of over transfusion, as reflected by relatively high postoperative hemoglobin levels."
21550063,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21550063/,"BACKGROUND: Total thyroidectomy for treatment of Graves' disease is controversial and much of the debate centers on the concern for complications. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the morbidity of total thyroidectomy for Graves' disease and determine if it is different than for patients with nontoxic nodular goiter.
METHODS: The rates of life threatening neck hematoma, recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) injury, transient hypocalcemia, and hypoparathyroidism were determined for consecutive patients with Graves' disease treated with total thyroidectomy from 1996 to 2010. Results were compared with patients who underwent total thyroidectomy for nontoxic nodular goiter during the same period, matched for the weight of the excised thyroid gland.
RESULTS: Total thyroidectomy was performed in 111 patients with Graves' disease (group I) and 283 patients with nontoxic nodular goiter (group II). Parathyroid autotransplantation was performed in 31(28%) patients in group I and 98 (35%) patients in group II (P = NS). Comparative analysis of morbidity revealed no significant difference in neck hematoma, 0(0%) (I) versus 3(1%) (II); permanent RLN injury, 0(0%) (I) versus 2(1%) (II); and permanent hypoparathyroidism in 1(1%) (I) versus 1 (0.4%) (II) (P = NS). Transient hypocalcemia was more common in patients with Graves' disease, 80(72%) (I) versus 170 (60%) (II) (P < 0.05), but not when matched for thyroid weight.
CONCLUSIONS: Total thyroidectomy can be performed with low morbidity in patients with Graves' disease; only transient hypocalcemia occurred more often than in patients with nodular goiter. Total thyroidectomy should be presented as a therapeutic option for all patients with Graves' disease."
17234825,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17234825/,"BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to determine if level of educational attainment, a marker of cognitive reserve, was associated with the cumulative risk of delirium among hospitalized elders.
METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of two hospital-based studies. The first (study 1) was an observational study involving 491 admissions. The second study (study 2) involved consecutive admissions assigned to the usual care condition in a controlled clinical trial, and included 461 persons. All participants were elderly (aged 70+) and free from delirium at admission. The outcome was the occurrence of delirium, as rated by the Confusion Assessment Method during hospitalization.
RESULTS: In study 1 and 2, 22% and 14% of persons developed delirium (cumulative incidence), respectively. In both studies, risk of delirium was higher among persons with fewer years of education. Controlling for the effect of age, sex, dementia, comorbidity, and severity of illness, each year of completed education was associated with a 0.91 lower odds of delirium (95% confidence interval: 0.87, 0.95): compared to persons with 12 years of education, persons with 7 years of education had 1.6-fold increased odds of delirium (95% confidence interval: 1.4, 2.0).
CONCLUSION: Hospitalized older persons with low educational attainment are at increased risk for delirium relative to persons with more education. This finding may have implications for the role of cognitive reserve in characterizing individual differences in risk for delirium."
17235509,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17235509/,"OBJECTIVE: Several studies have reported a close relationship between an increased dose of dialysis and survival in patients treated for acute renal failure. Unfortunately, the quantification of dialysis in critically ill patients based on the urea nitrogen formula Kt/V is not applicable. Ionic dialysance is a new parameter calculated in real time from the dialysate conductivity and correlated with the effective urea clearance in chronic hemodialysis patients. The aim of our study was to evaluate ionic dialysance in the quantification of dialysis in critically ill patients with acute renal failure.
DESIGN: Prospective open-label study.
SETTING: An 18-bed medical intensive care unit.
PATIENTS: Thirty-one patients with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and acute renal failure requiring intermittent hemodialysis were included.
MEASUREMENTS: Using the first dialysis session of each patient, we compared the delivered dose of dialysis based on ionic dialysance measurement (Kt(ID)) with the well-accepted gold standard method based on fractional dialysate sampling (Kt(dialysate)). The data were analyzed using linear regression and Bland-Altman analysis.
RESULTS: Thirty-one intermittent hemodialysis sessions were performed in 31 critically ill patients (mean age 58+/-12 years, SAPS II score 56+/-10). We found a close correlation between Kt(dialysate) and Kt(ID) (Kt(dialysate) = 36.3+/-11.4 l; Kt(ID)=38.4+/-11.8; r=0.96) with excellent limits of agreement (-2.2 l; 6.4 l).
CONCLUSION: The feasibility of dialysis quantification based on ionic dialysance in the critically ill patient is good. This method is a simple and accurate tool for the determination of dialysis dose in critically ill patients."
17235717,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17235717/,"BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to identify genomic alterations in resectable pancreatic cancer (PCA). Chromosomal imbalances were correlated with histopathological and clinical data to verify their prognostic significance.
METHODS: Specimens of 33 PCA were investigated by comparative genomic hybridization. Microdissection was used for separation of PCA from the normal cells before isolation of DNA; nick-end labeling and hybridization were performed according to standard protocols. Aberrations were correlated with staging and grading using log-rank test and Cox regression. Survival rates were plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method.
RESULTS: Twenty-eight (85%) PCA showed aberrations. Gains of chromosomal material were most frequently identified on 8q (42%), 13q (30%), 18p (21%), and 3q (18%). Genetic losses were frequently detected on 1p (45%), 22 (42%), 19 (36%), 17p (27%), 18q and 8p (15% each), and 3p (12%). Losses of 8p (n = 5) and 3p (n = 4) were only detected in stages III and IV (P < 0.05). Median survival time of all patients was 13 months. Median survival time of patients with aberration of 8q (n = 14) was 8.5 months compared to 16 months in patients without gain of 8q (n = 19; P = 0.029).
CONCLUSIONS: The chromosomal regions containing genetic alterations represent potential loci for new target genes in PCA. The significant correlation of gain of chromosome 8q with short survival time suggests that 8q may be a new marker to assess prognosis and malignant potential of resected PCA in the individual patient, thereby helping to identify patients at risk for recurrence that might profit from adjuvant therapy."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 383 consecutive patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism were prospectively studied. Patients underwent MSCT pulmonary angiography and lower-limb venography, as well as pulmonary scintigraphy and lower-limb ultrasound examination. Patients with negative MSCT results for both pulmonary embolism and venous thrombosis were not administered anticoagulants and were followed up for 6 months to rule out thromboembolism.
RESULTS: At MSCT, 156 patients were positive for pulmonary embolism, venous thrombosis, or both; 224 were negative; and findings were inconclusive in three. False-negatives were five patients with high probability scintigram and two with venous thrombosis detected at US. A total of 184 patients with negative MSCT and without anticoagulation were followed up for 6 months. During this period of time just one recurrence of pulmonary embolism was detected. The negative predictive value of MSCT pulmonary angiography plus lower-limb venography was 95.8% (183/191).
CONCLUSION: MSCT is efficacious in diagnosing pulmonary embolism, with negative predictive values reported in the literature ranging from 94% to 100%. This enables omission of anticoagulation in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism after negative MSCT findings without the need for other diagnostic tests."
17236846,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17236846/,"BACKGROUND: With the advent of trauma systems, time to definitive care has been decreased. We hypothesized that a subset of patients who are in extremis from the time of prehospital transport to arrival at the trauma center, and who ultimately die early after arrival, may in fact have a potentially salvageable single-organ injury.
METHODS: We reviewed all deaths that occurred in the first hour after hospital admission. Trauma registry, medical records, and autopsy reports for 556 patients were evaluated.
RESULTS: The median time to arrival was 39 minutes, and the median Injury Severity Score was 29. Blunt injuries (53%) were most commonly auto-accident injuries (134 of 285 patients; 47%). Penetrating wounds (42%) were mostly gunshot wounds to the chest (73 of 233 patients; 31%). For patients with initial vital signs, the most common cause of death was isolated brain injury (26 patients; 28%). Possibly survivable injuries (single organ or vessel) occurred in 35 (38%) patients, of which 4 were isolated spleen injuries (4%).
CONCLUSIONS: Some patients with potentially survivable single organ injuries did not have associated head injuries. An aggressive approach is warranted on patients with detectable vital signs on at least one occasion in the field but who arrive at the trauma center in extremis."
17236853,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17236853/,"BACKGROUND: Oral examination interrater consistency has been questioned, supporting the use of at least paired examiners and consensus grading. The scheduling flexibility of video recording allows more examiners to score performances. The purpose of this study was to compare live performance with video performance scores to assess interrater differences and the effect on grading.
METHODS: A total of 283 consecutive, structured, videotaped 30-minute examinations were reviewed. A 5-point Likert scale ranked problem solving (2 cases), verbal skills, and nonverbal skills. Nonparametric paired analyses tested for differences.
RESULTS: Live performance scores were higher for verbal and nonverbal skills and total scores. Video performance scores were higher for problem solving for the first presented case. The largest difference (.29 Likert point) was in nonverbal skills.
CONCLUSIONS: The minor yet statistical differences in several scores did not actually impact student grades. The use of video recording is sufficiently reliable to be continued and advocated."
17236856,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17236856/,"BACKGROUND: Intraoperative decision making requires both knowledge and experience. The script concordance test (SCT), based on cognitive psychology script theory, is a new tool of clinical-reasoning assessment that may be used to evaluate a candidate's approach to ill-defined problems encountered in the operating room.
METHODS: To develop and validate an SCT for assessment of intraoperative decision making. One hundred questions were prepared based on the objectives for residency training of the American Board of Surgery. These questions were reviewed for face and content validity by 3 board-certified general surgeons. The SCT was administered to 36 general surgical residents ranging from R1 to R5. The scoring grid was obtained by giving the test to 10 board-certified general surgeons who completed the test independently. Aggregate scoring was used. After question optimization, the final test used for statistical analysis was composed of 62 questions.
RESULTS: The test had excellent reliability (Cronbach alpha, .85). Scores increased with higher levels of training except for a small decrease in the R5 scores (R1, 52.5 +/- 9.9; R2, 62.4 +/- 5.1; R3, 68.3 +/- 9.2; R4, 75.7 +/- 9.6; R5, 68 +/- 6.4) There was a significant difference in scores between the junior (R1 + R2) and senior (R3 + R4 + R5) residents: 56.8 +/- 9.5 versus 70.2 +/- 8.8 (P < .0001).
CONCLUSIONS: SCT, applied to the assessment of intraoperative clinical judgment, can discriminate successfully between junior and senior residents. Results from an SCT test must be compared with the present gold standard, the oral examination, to better determine its place as an assessment tool."
17236918,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17236918/,"PURPOSE: To estimate and compare the frequencies of inflammatory complications after third molar (M3) surgery in subjects receiving intravenous prophylactic antibiotics or saline placebo.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical trial, the investigators enrolled a sample composed of subjects who required extraction of at least 1 impacted M3 and requested intravenous sedation or general anesthesia. The predictor variable was treatment group classified as active treatment (penicillin or clindamycin for penicillin-allergic subjects) or placebo (0.9% saline). Study medications were randomly assigned. Both surgeon and subject were blinded to treatment assignment. The medication was administered intravenously prior to any incision. The outcome variable was postoperative inflammatory complication classified as present or absent and included alveolar osteitis (AO) or surgical site infection (SSI). Other variables were demographic, anatomic, or operative. Descriptive and bivariate statistics were computed. Statistical significance was set at P < or = .05, single-tailed test of hypothesis.
RESULTS: The sample was composed of 118 subjects (n = 59 per study group). In the active treatment group, there were no postoperative inflammatory complications. In the placebo group, 5 subjects (8.5%) were diagnosed with SSI, (P = .03). No subject met the case definition for AO. All SSIs were associated with the removal of partial bony or full bony impacted mandibular M3s.
CONCLUSION: In the setting of third molar removal, these results suggest that the use of intravenous antibiotics administered prophylactically decrease the frequency of SSIs. The authors cannot comment on the efficacy of intravenous antibiotics in comparison to other antibacterial treatment regimens, eg chlorhexidine mouthrinse or intrasocket antibiotics."
17236926,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17236926/,"PURPOSE: Advances in the management of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) have confounded the importance of site in predicting overall prognosis. The purpose of this retrospective study was to review the outcome of patients with OSCC and to determine if site is a significant predictor of survival or disease-free survival.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The records of 233 patients that underwent surgery for resectable OSCC treated at a single institution from 1993 to 2003 were identified. Patients with positive surgical margins, high grade histology, aggressive biologic behavior, or advanced stage disease underwent adjuvant radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. The demographics, site, stage, pathologic, treatment, and survival data were collected and statistically analyzed in an attempt to identify predictors of loco-regional control and disease-free survival. Descriptive statistics were calculated for each variable and survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. For purposes of comparison, patients were divided into 2 groups: those with tongue lesions (n = 73) and all other sites (n = 152). The Cox proportional hazards model was used to distinguish different survival rates between the groups.
RESULTS: Two hundred fifteen patients consisting of 104 males (48%) and 111 females (52%) met the criteria for inclusion in the study. Overall and disease-free survival rates were 56% and 58%, respectively. Stage and grade were identified as having a statistically significant effect on survival (P = .0014, likelihood ratio chi2 = 0.04, 1 degree of freedom; and P = .026, chi2 = 5, 1 degree of freedom, respectively). There was no significant difference in survival between patients with tongue cancer and other sites in the oral cavity (P = .8, chi2 = .04, 1 degree of freedom).
CONCLUSIONS: Grade and stage are significant predictors of overall and disease-free survival for patients with OSCC. In this study, however, there was no survival difference between patients with tongue cancer and cancers located at other sites in the oral cavity."
17236993,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17236993/,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To determine whether emergency department (ED) preliminary reports rendered by subspecialist attending radiologists who are reading outside their field of expertise are more accurate than reports rendered by radiology residents, and to compare error rates between radiologists and nonradiologists in the ED setting.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was performed at a large academic medical center with a busy ED. An electronic preliminary report generator was used in the ED to capture preliminary interpretations rendered in a clinical setting by radiology residents, junior attendings (within 2 years of taking their oral boards), senior attendings, and ED clinicians between August 1999 and November 2004. Each preliminary report was later reviewed by a final interpreting radiologist, and the preliminary interpretation was adjudicated for the presence of substantial discordances, defined as a difference in interpretation that might immediately impact the care of the patient. Of the 612,890 preliminary reports in the database, 65,780 (11%) met inclusion criteria for this study. A log-linear analysis was used to assess the effects of modality and type of author on preliminary report error rates.
RESULTS: ED clinicians had significantly higher error rates when compared with any type of radiologist, regardless of modality. Within the radiologists, residents and junior attendings had lower error rates than did senior attendings, but the differences were not statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: Subspecialized attending radiologists who interpret ED examinations outside their area of expertise have error rates similar to those of radiology residents. Nonradiologists have significantly higher error rates than radiologists and radiology residents when interpreting examinations in the ED."
17237496,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17237496/,"BACKGROUND: There is concern over delayed diagnosis of dementia in primary care.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether primary care record review can facilitate earlier diagnosis of dementia.
METHODS: Retrospective notes-based case-control study. Older people with dementia (cases) were identified through older age psychiatrists in the north-east of England. Age- and sex-matched controls were identified in primary care. Frequency and place of consultations, symptoms, presentation, tests and investigations, management, referrals and selected prescription data during the 5 years prior to the diagnosis of dementia were recorded.
RESULTS: Relevant symptoms, involvement of family members, unpredictable consulting patterns and problems with management were more likely to be recorded in the notes of cases than controls. Key variables predicting subsequent diagnosis of dementia included the absence of nurse and outpatient consultations and the presence of cognitive symptoms, consultations with primary care physicians and referral for clarification of diagnosis or management. Regression models were better at predicting cases (sensitivity=80.2%) than controls (specificity=69.8%). Applying the models to a typical primary care physician's list would result in the identification of 93 false positives in order to identify two new cases 18 months earlier than currently occurs.
CONCLUSIONS: Differences in consultation patterns can be observed up to 4 years prior to formal diagnosis of dementia, indicating that primary care physicians are attending to possible signs of early dementia. However, it is not practicable to use the systematic review of primary care records to facilitate earlier diagnosis without identifying large numbers of false positives requiring investigation."
17237686,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17237686/,"PURPOSE: To compare the results of external dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR), using two different patterns of flap anastomosis with creation of both sac and nasal mucosal anterior and posterior flaps: one that includes suturing of both flaps and the other that involves excision of the posterior flaps.
METHODS: This randomized, clinical trial included 63 consecutive patients undergoing DCR. Patients were alternately assigned to two groups on the basis of the pattern of flap anastomosis. An H-shaped incision was created in the lacrimal sac and the nasal mucosa in all patients. In group A, posterior and anterior flaps were separately approximated; in group B, only the anterior flaps were sutured after resection of both posterior flaps. Postoperative hemorrhage, epiphora, and patency of the tract were assessed on follow-up visits. Final scores and success rates of the two groups were compared by using the Mann-Whitney U and chi.
RESULTS: The mean length of follow-up was 10.87 +/- 4.75 months for all patients. One patient in group B was lost to follow-up. The difference between the groups in postoperative bleeding, epiphora, and patency scores was found to be statistically insignificant (p = 0.451, p = 0.974, p = 0.583, respectively). The final success rates in groups A and B were 93.75% and 96.67%, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in success rate between the groups (p = 0.593).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that DCR with double-flap anastomosis has no advantage over DCR with only anterior flaps. Anastomosis by suturing only anterior flaps and excision of the posterior flaps is easier to perform and does not appear to adversely affect the outcome of DCR surgery."
17237692,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17237692/,"PURPOSE: To identify medial canthal tilt as an important cue used by judges in evaluating human female facial attractiveness.
METHODS: An experimental study was conducted with the use of SuperLab Pro, and judges had to make a forced choice between unmodified faces and faces that had their medial canthal tilt accentuated through the use of Adobe Photoshop CS.
RESULTS: Female faces with accentuated medial canthal tilt were preferred 93% of the time over unmodified faces (p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Medial canthal tilt appears to be a powerful cue used in judging human female facial attractiveness. Its power may be due to its relation to the neotenic and sexually dimorphic cue of palpebral fissure inclination."
17238943,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17238943/,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the use of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention body mass index percentiles for adolescents to classify adolescents for gestational weight gain recommendations.
DESIGN: A descriptive study using secondary data analysis.
SETTING: Memphis, Tennessee.
PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred forty-seven primiparous Black adolescents, aged 12 to 19 years, who delivered full-term infants.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Adult and adolescent body mass index categories, gestational weight gain patterns, and neonatal birthweight.
RESULTS: Adolescents, especially smaller adolescents, were misclassified when the current Institute of Medicine adult body mass index categories were used to classify them for gestational weight gain when compared to the use of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention body mass index percentiles for adolescents as a gestational weight gain classification schema. Mean neonatal birthweights were similar no matter which schema was used. A large proportion of adolescents gained more than is recommended by the Institute of Medicine.
CONCLUSIONS: The current gestational weight gain recommendations based on adult body mass index categories may not be sufficiently specific to attain the best maternal and neonatal outcomes for adolescents. Creation of gestational weight gain recommendations based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention body mass index percentiles would potentially assist clinicians in counseling adolescents regarding gestational weight gain."
17239220,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17239220/,"BACKGROUND: Management of patients with severely impaired left ventricular function (LVF) associated with diffusely atheromatous coronary artery disease is a real dilemma. Coronary revascularization can be done only after endarterectomy to facilitate anastomosis. The aim of the present work is to present our experience and see whether performing endarterectomy during off-pump bypass can be of any benefit.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Five patients with a mean ejection fraction of 27 +/- 4.5 underwent coronary revascularization facilitated by endarterectomy using off-pump technique. There were three males and two females with a mean age of 64.4 +/- 7.4 years. All patients were in NYHA class III or IV. Close endarterectomy was done to left anterior descending artery (LAD), right coronary artery (RCA), and intermediate artery.
RESULTS: All patients survived the procedure. A total of seven closed endarterectomies were performed. Five of these were done on LAD and the other two were done on RCA and intermediate artery. Two patients (40%) received inotropic support. One patient had perioperative infarction (20%). Mean follow-up period was 14.2 months +/- 19.7 (range, 1 month to 48 months). All patients were free of angina according to Canadian Cardiovascular Society and were in class NYHA I or II except one, who was in class III. Postoperative catheterization showed that all bypasses to endarterectomized arteries were patent. Patency rate was 83.4%. The mean postoperative ejection fraction was 29.8 +/- 6.9, which was not significantly different from preoperative one (p= 0.12).
CONCLUSION: Performing endarterectomy on beating heart in patients with compromised left ventricle is not an easy task. But it can be done with difficulty. Although the procedure is associated with high incidence of infarction, our early results, follow-up clinical status, and graft patency justify its use among patients with compromised left ventricular function who were previously considered inoperable."
17239958,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17239958/,"BACKGROUND: Diurnal variation in mood is a prominent symptom of depression, and is typically experienced as positive mood variation (PMV - mood being worse upon waking and better in the evening). The present study sought to advance understanding of PMV by measuring daily mood variation in non-clinical individuals with varying levels of depressed mood. Based on research into normative variation in mood and evidence that circadian amplitudes may be decreased in depression, it was hypothesised that compared to those with low levels of depression, individuals meeting Centre for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) cut-off for probable depression would exhibit an attenuated circadian component in diurnal variation of Positive Affect (PA).
METHOD: Ninety-nine young healthy women (mean age=21.5, SD=3.0) living on a normal sleep-wake schedule provided mood reports every two hours between 0800 h and 2200 h for 7 days.
RESULTS: The high depression group (CES-D > or = 23, n=22) exhibited a pattern of diurnal variation consistent with PMV (increased PA in the evening relative to the morning). As predicted, evidence was also found that the high depression group was characterized by a decreased circadian component to diurnal variation in PA relative to the low depression group (CES-D < 23, n=77).
CONCLUSIONS: It is provisionally concluded that diurnal mood variation in depression can usefully be understood from the perspective of weakened circadian function. Findings are discussed in terms of limitations of the study's naturalistic design and future research avenues identified."
17240143,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17240143/,"SUBJECTS: Sixteen rigid-akinetic idiopathic Parkinson's disease patients (PD) and 13 healthy control subjects (controls) were included in this study.
METHODS: Gait analysis was performed using an optoelectronic system. The experimental design involved double evaluation of PD patients (before and after motor rehabilitation program) and a single evaluation of controls. ANOVA was performed in both groups for each gait variable (kinetic and kinematic) and for clinical conditions.
RESULTS: Analysis of kinetic data highlighted a statistically significant difference for all gait variables studied between controls and PD patients either before, or in the same PD patients before and after the motor rehabilitation program. After the rehabilitation program, natural walking speed increased (p<.000). The stance percentage was significantly decreased in the single support (p<.000). After the rehabilitation program, the double support limb phase did not show a reduction in statistical significance. Kinematic data showed statistical differences between controls and PD patients in hip, knee and ankle joint angles, both before and after the motor rehabilitation program.
CONCLUSION: Our results confirm that gait analysis is a valid tool for evaluating changes in PD patients' ability to walk and for quantifying the improvements gained through a motor rehabilitation program."
17240233,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17240233/,"OBJECTIVE: The null hypothesis is that local anesthesia does not decrease pain perception during amniocentesis.
STUDY DESIGN: We performed a prospective randomized study comparing local anesthesia (1% lidocaine) with no anesthesia before amniocentesis in a racially diverse population. Immediately after the procedure, subjects were asked to assess their pain using both a Visual Analogue Scale and a 101-point Numerical Rating Scale.
RESULTS: Two hundred four women were enrolled; 101 women received local, 102 women received no local, and 1 woman declined the amniocentesis after randomization. There was no difference in pain perception between the 2 groups as measured by either the visual analogue scale or the numeric rating scale (P = .28 and .18 respectively). The correlation coefficient between the 2 pain scales was strong with 0.86 for the local group and 0.92 for the no local group, (P < .001).
CONCLUSION: Administration of local anesthesia before amniocentesis does not decrease maternal pain perception."
17240244,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17240244/,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the expression of Her-2/neu in nonepithelial ovarian malignancies.
STUDY DESIGN: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded archival tissue blocks of 20 unselected nonepithelial ovarian malignancies (12 granulosa cell tumors and 8 germ cell tumors) diagnosed between 1993 and 2005 were immunohistochemically stained for Her-2/neu.
RESULTS: Immunohistochemical staining for Her-2/neu was not present in any of these nonepithelial malignancies examined.
CONCLUSION: Our limited sample size does not allow a generalized conclusion concerning the lack of Her-2/neu expression in nonepithelial ovarian malignancies, but it adds information with regard to the expression of this oncogene in these rare neoplasms and seems to indicate that it is not a frequent occurrence."
17240377,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17240377/,"BACKGROUND: It is recommended that process indicators (PI) for trauma-care be validated in the setting where they are applied for quality assurance (QA) and quality improvement (QI). In a pilot attempt at trauma QA and QI, we evaluated pre-hospital time (PT) and emergency department disposition time (EDt) as possible PIs in three Italian trauma-referral hospitals.
METHODS: We used registry data on all the 753 major (ISS>15) trauma cases admitted to the participating hospitals between the 1 July 2004 and the 31 June 2005. The distribution of PT and EDt in the hospitals was investigated together with the performances of the hospitals. The performances were evaluated in terms of patient outcome with multivariate regression models. Outcome measures were trauma death, Euroqol 5-D (EQ5D), and Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS). The possible PIs were then evaluated as independent predictors of outcome.
RESULTS: In the hospital with the best outcome-measures (Hospital A) PT and EDt were also the shortest. The differences in PT and EDt were significant (p<0.05) versus Hospital B and Hospital C, respectively. However, at the patient level, longer PT and EDt were not independently associated with bad outcome. Neither a threshold could be found that indicated higher risks of bad outcome. EDt>120 min was paradoxically associated with lower mortality.
CONCLUSION: Although PT and EDt were significantly shorter in the hospital with best outcome performances, we could not confirm at the patient level their expected independent association with outcome. More evidence is needed before these indicators can be validated as standard tools for system analysis in our setting."
17240416,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17240416/,"PURPOSE: To compare reaction time (RT) to rod incremental and decremental stimuli expressed in physical contrast units or psychophysical threshold units.
METHODS: Rod contrast detection thresholds and suprathreshold RTs were measured for Rapid-On and Rapid-Off ramp stimuli.
RESULTS: Threshold sensitivity to Rapid-Off stimuli was higher than to Rapid-On stimuli. Suprathreshold RTs specified in Weber contrast for Rapid-Off stimuli were shorter than for Rapid-On stimuli. Reaction time data expressed in multiples of threshold reversed the outcomes: Reaction times for Rapid-On stimuli were shorter than those for Rapid-Off stimuli. The use of alternative contrast metrics also failed to equate RTs.
CONCLUSIONS: A case is made that the interpretation of RT data may be confounded when expressed in threshold units. Stimulus energy or contrast is the only metric common to the response characteristics of the cells underlying speeded responses. The use of threshold metrics for RT can confuse the interpretation of an underlying physiological process."
17240720,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17240720/,"OBJECTIVE: Does adding situation awareness (SA) to a battery of cognitive tests improve prediction?
BACKGROUND: Identifying variables that predict skilled performance in a complex task aids in understanding the nature of skill and also aids in the selection of operators to perform that task. SA is thought to be an important predictor of performance. SA is often thought to be based on underlying cognitive mechanisms.
METHOD: Three performance measures taken from the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA's) Air Traffic Scenarios Test, the low-fidelity simulation component of the FAA's controller selection battery, were used as criterion variables in a hierarchical regression. After predicting performance based on a battery of cognitive (e.g., intelligence, working memory, spatial memory) and noncognitive tests (e.g., cognitive style, personality, demographics), we added measures of SA.
RESULTS: SA did provide increases in prediction, but only when measured with the Situation Present Assessment Method, an on-line query method. When the same questions were asked off line, SA did not enter the model in two cases and improved prediction by only 2% in the third.
CONCLUSION: Thus, some measures of SA do show incremental validity, even against a backdrop of a large number of cognitive variables.
APPLICATION: On-line measures of SA can be a worthwhile addition to standard batteries of tests used to predict performance in cognitively oriented industrial tasks."
17240738,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17240738/,"BACKGROUND: Cardiac embolism is estimated to be the aetiology of ischemic cerebral-vascular insults (CVI) in 25% of cases. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is a reliable and widely used examination in the diagnosticwork-up of stroke. TEE is superior to transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) in the search of minor sources of cardiac embolism but it is time consuming and has its inherent risks.
AIM: The aim of this study was to determine whether in patients younger than 65 years of age with CVI our TEE-findings would alter their management. Only patients in whom nor the medical record, nor TTE, nor Carotid Ultrasonography could establish an aetiology, were included.
METHODS: A 3-year retrospective study was done in patients admitted to the stroke unit of a regional medical centre covering 110,000 inhabitants. The TEE-database was reviewed and all TEE's performed in eligible patients were selected. Minor and major sources of cardiac embolism were listed. The impact of TEE-findings on the management of CVI was evaluated.
RESULTS: Fifty-four patients fulfilled the criteria for this study. The mean age was 52 years (range 18 - 65). A major source of cardiac embolism was seen in 6 cases (11.1%). Four patients (7.4%) had infective endocarditis (IE) with vegetations. A small apical thrombosis in a patient with isolated left ventricular non-compaction was noted and in 1 patient dysfunction of a mechanical prosthetic valve was documented. The most frequently encountered minor source of cardiac embolism was a patent foramen ovale (PFO) or small atrial septal defect (ASD) with documented right-to-left shunt during Valsalva manoeuvre (15 patients, 27.8%). Of these 15 patients, an atrial septum aneurysm(ASA) was seen in 7 patients (13%). Our TEE-findings altered the management of CVI substantially in 21 cases (38.9%). The 4 patients with IE and the patient with mechanical valve dysfunction had cardiac surgery. Twelve patients (22.2%) were referred for percutaneous closure of the PFO/ASD. Three patients with PFO/ASD and the patient with IVNC were treated with maintenance therapy of oral anticoagulation.
CONCLUSION: In 1 out of 3 patients, younger than 65 years, suffering from CVI in whom nor medical history, nor TTE, nor Carotid Ultrasound could reveal the cause of the CVI our TEE-findings altered their management."
17241211,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17241211/,"OBJECTIVE: The concept of ""rational polypharmacy"" has been associated with anticonvulsant management for decades, but the term has not been applied to nonpharmacologic therapies.
METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, retrospective study of children who received concurrent diet (ketogenic or modified Atkins) and vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) treatment for medically intractable epilepsy.
RESULTS: Thirty children in total from six epilepsy centers were treated over a 6-yr period. The median age at the initiation of combination therapy was 10 yr (range, 4-24 yr). Sixteen (53%) received dietary therapy followed by VNS; no differences were noted between centers. After 3 months, 21 (70%) had seizure reduced by >50% over the previous single nonpharmacologic treatment, of whom 13 (62%) had improvement within the first month. A 5-min VNS off-time correlated with >90% seizure reduction (p = 0.02). The median duration of nonpharmacologic polytherapy was 12 months (range, 0.5-96 months); 17 (57%) remain on dual therapy at this time. No side effects were noted. Most patients who discontinued combination therapy did so because of a lack of efficacy rather than restrictiveness.
CONCLUSIONS: In this small group, the combined use of diet and VNS appeared synergistic and yielded rapid benefits. It may be more effective with longer VNS off-times. Further prospective studies of this combination in refractory pediatric epilepsy are needed to help guide optimal use."
17241422,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17241422/,"BACKGROUND: Because well-controlled studies examining the efficacy and safety of various dilutions of botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) have not been performed, dilutions used in clinical practice are chosen at the discretion of the clinician.
OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to determine the most effective BTX-A dilution for the glabellar region, the relationship between dilution and duration of effect, and the side effect profile of each dilution in women with glabellar rhytides.
METHODS: Eighty women with moderate-to-severe wrinkles at maximum frown were randomized to one of four dilution groups in a 48-week, single-center, double-blind, parallel-group study. Subjects received 30 U BTX-A (BOTOX, Allergan, Inc.) injected into the glabellar region at dilutions of 100, 33.3, 20, or 10 U/mL. Outcome measures included trained-observer and subject assessment of wrinkle severity at repose and at maximum muscle contraction using the Facial Wrinkle Scale (FWS) and adverse events.
RESULTS: All dilutions of BTX-A effectively improved glabellar rhytides as assessed by both trained observers and subjects using the FWS. No significant differences on FWS scores were seen among the dilution groups by trained observers at any time point. Although a difference among groups was seen in subject-assessed responder rates, there was no obvious relationship between dilution and response. BTX-A treatment was well tolerated, and there were no significant differences between the four dilution groups in the number of subjects reporting adverse effects.
CONCLUSION: In this study, the dilution of BTX-A was not critical to the success of treatment."

METHODS: One hundred and fifty patients, scheduled for elective surgery with general anaesthesia, were divided into five groups: saline (Group 1), dexmedetomidine 0.25 microg kg(-1) (Group 2), lidocaine 0.5 mg kg(-1) (Group 3), dexmedetomidine 0.25 microg kg(-1) plus lidocaine 0.25 mg kg(-1) (Group 4) or dexmedetomidine 0.25 microg kg(-1) plus lidocaine 0.5 mg kg(-1) (Group 5) were administered at a rate of 0.5 mL s(-1) after tourniquet application. The occlusion was released after 1 min and 5 mL of propofol was injected over 20 s. Pain was evaluated by use of a 10-point verbal analogue scale. Then, the rest of the induction dose of propofol, 3 mL of saline bolus and 0.6 mg kg(-1) of rocuronium, was injected. The response to injection of rocuronium was assessed with a four-point scale (0-3).
RESULTS: Groups 1 and 2 were found to have higher propofol injection pain scores than Groups 3, 4 and 5 (P < 0.05). When the study groups were compared according to the overall incidence of withdrawal movements due to rocuronium (1 response) in Groups 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, they were different (86.7%, 60%, 36.7%, 50% and 40%, respectively) (P < 0.05). Except Group 1, there was no significant difference between the groups according to incidence of withdrawal movement after rocuronium injection (P = 0.325).
CONCLUSIONS: Pretreatment with dexmedetomidine is not effective in reducing injection pain of propofol, but may attenuate the hand withdrawal associated to rocuronium, as lidocaine does."
17241831,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17241831/,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of type and dose of serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) on treatment outcome in quetiapine addition trials for obsessive-compulsive disorder.
METHODS: Results from all available, double blind, placebo-controlled quetiapine addition trials were pooled. Treatment outcome was assessed in a sample of 102 patients by change from baseline to end point on the Yale-Brown obsessive-compulsive scale (Y-BOCS).
RESULTS: Quetiapine addition was superior with a mean Y-BOCS decrease of 6.8 +/- 6.7 compared with placebo with a decrease of 3.9 +/- 6.5 points. Patients with the lowest SRI dose showed the largest decrease on the Y-BOCS (11.6 +/- 7.7) compared with patients with the median dose (6.1 +/- 6.1) and highest dose (5.9 +/- 6.4).
CONCLUSIONS: We found a superior response in the quetiapine addition group compared with the placebo group. The best response was achieved with the combination of clomipramine, fluoxetine, and fluvoxamine and with the lowest SRI doses."
17242052,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17242052/,"OBJECTIVE: This article seeks to determine whether medical students can estimate the appropriate score for the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) compared with psychiatry residents and staff psychiatrists. The authors hypothesized that medical students' estimations of GAF scores for patients in clinical vignettes would differ from those assessed by the psychiatry residents and staff psychiatrists.
METHOD: The authors designed a cross-sectional confidential survey of medical students, psychiatry residents, and staff psychiatrists. Consenting participants were asked to provide demographic information and then complete the accompanying questionnaire after reading two vignettes. One of the vignettes described a depressed patient and the other a psychotic patient. The subjects were asked to estimate the GAF scores for the patients in both vignettes. Then the subjects were given the GAF scoring guide to review and were asked to re-assess their initial GAF scores for the patients in the vignettes.
RESULTS: Medical students assigned much higher GAF scores for the patient in the vignette with less severe symptoms than the psychiatry residents and staff psychiatrists. The GAF scores of all three groups for the patient in the vignette with more severe symptoms were comparable.
CONCLUSIONS: The ability of medical students to assign proper GAF scores needs to be studied further. Our study suggests that current 1-month rotations in psychiatry, without specific training on assigning GAF scores, may not provide medical students with enough information to assess GAF scores accurately. This might need to be addressed in psychiatry clerkships."
17242102,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17242102/,"BACKGROUND: We compared the efficacy of granisetron and ondansetron for the prevention of subarachnoid morphine-induced pruritus after cesarean delivery.
METHODS: The incidence of pruritus was assessed in parturients who were randomly allocated into Group G (granisetron 3 mg IV, n = 45), Group O (ondansetron 8 mg IV, n = 42), and Group S (saline IV, n = 42).
RESULTS: The incidence of pruritus was not significantly different among the 3 groups (86.6% in Group S, 83.3% in Group O, and 88% in the Group G).
CONCLUSION: Neither prophylactic ondansetron nor granisetron reduced the incidence of subarachnoid morphine-induced pruritus when compared with the saline group."
17242107,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17242107/,"BACKGROUND: In this prospective, randomized, double-blind trial we investigated the use of stimulating catheters in patients during and after shoulder surgery; functional improvement being the primary outcome measurement.
METHODS: After eliciting an adequate muscular twitch at < or =0.5 mA nerve stimulation output, the perineural catheter was advanced either blindly (conventional catheter = CC group, n = 20) or guided by stimulation via the catheter (stimulating catheter = SC group, n = 20). A bolus of 40 mL prilocaine 1% and 10 mL ropivacaine 0.75% was injected, followed by a patient-controlled infusion of ropivacaine 0.2% (8 mL/h infusion rate, bolus 2 mL, lockout time 20 min).
RESULTS: Onset of motor block was faster in the SC group, whereas sensory block did not differ between groups. Median pain scores on two postoperative days were equal. Improvement of the objective shoulder function score (Constant Murley Score) 6 wk postoperatively was enhanced to a clinically relevant extent in the SC group compared to the CC group (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the use of a stimulating catheter results in a faster onset of motor block, unaltered postoperative pain, and a significantly improved functional outcome 6 wk after shoulder surgery."
17242331,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17242331/,"OBJECTIVE: To examine seizure predictability in a cohort of adult patients using a prospective seizure diary study, to assess the validity of a patient's predictions, and to determine if a subgroup of patients with epilepsy were able to reliably predict their seizures.
METHODS: Eligible subjects were 18 or older, had localization-related epilepsy, had > or =1 seizure within 12 months, and were able to self-maintain a seizure diary. Seizure self-prediction was assessed by a rating scale: ""Do you think you will have a seizure in the next 24 hours?"" Seizure prediction and seizure occurrence were modeled as binary outcomes. OR, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were calculated for group and individuals, adjusted for the within person correlations.
RESULTS: Seventy-one subjects returned 15,635 diary entries. A positive prediction of seizures was associated with a twofold increased risk of seizure (Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel OR 2.25 (1.91 to 2.65). Overall, the specificity of positive prediction was 83.2% while the sensitivity was 31.9%. Twelve subjects (21% of subjects who had seizures) demonstrated significant within person OR; Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel OR for positive prediction in this predictor subgroup 3.14 (2.53 to 3.89). Predictors were younger (p = 0.026) and had a higher seizure rate (p = 0.003) than nonpredictors.
CONCLUSIONS: A significant subgroup of our adult patients with epilepsy were able to self-predict their seizures, which may yield novel therapeutic opportunities."
17243021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17243021/,"OBJECTIVES: To prevent perinatal HIV transmission, providers must identify HIV status for all women in labor and newborns, and provide timely antiretroviral therapy if necessary. The objective of this study is to evaluate the availability and accessibility of zidovudine (AZT) in Illinois birthing hospitals.
METHODS: We surveyed all Illinois birthing hospital pharmacies by telephone in February 2005 regarding availability, accessibility, and protocols surrounding AZT use in the perinatal period.
RESULTS: All 137 pharmacies participated. Only 43.1% reported having syrup and IV AZT available and only 37.2% indicated the ability to have AZT available on labor and delivery within 30 min during off hours. Protocols for treating HIV positive women in labor and exposed newborns were available in only 37.2% of pharmacies while 72.4% had protocols for antiretroviral therapy for occupational post-exposure prophylaxis. Variables associated with pharmacies having AZT available included being a major academic hospital and serving a predominately (greater than 96%) white patient population. Timely provision of AZT was more likely to occur in urban, major academic hospitals serving a predominately white population.
CONCLUSIONS: In order to further reduce perinatal HIV transmission, availability and timely access to both syrup and IV AZT must be improved in Illinois birthing hospitals."
17243951,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17243951/,"BACKGROUND: Atlases on CD-ROM first substituted the use of paediatric dermatology atlases printed on paper. This permitted a faster search and a practical comparison of differential diagnoses. The third step in the evolution of clinical atlases was the onset of the online atlas. Many doctors now use the Internet image search engines to obtain clinical images directly.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to test the reliability of the image search engines compared to the online atlases.
METHODS: We tested seven Internet image search engines with three paediatric dermatology diseases.
RESULTS: In general, the service offered by the search engines is good, and continues to be free of charge. The coincidence between what we searched for and what we found was generally excellent, and contained no advertisements. Most Internet search engines provided similar results but some were more user friendly than others. It is not necessary to repeat the same research with Picsearch, Lycos and MSN, as the response would be the same; there is a possibility that they might share software.
CONCLUSIONS: Image search engines are a useful, free and precise method to obtain paediatric dermatology images for teaching purposes. There is still the matter of copyright to be resolved. What are the legal uses of these 'free' images? How do we define 'teaching purposes'? New watermark methods and encrypted electronic signatures might solve these problems and answer these questions."
17244136,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17244136/,"OBJECTIVES: To determine if self-weighting of the items in an oral health-related quality of life questionnaire improves its psychometric properties.
METHODS: The Surgical Orthodontic Outcome Questionnaire (SOOQ) was designed to assess the oral health-related quality of life of individuals before and after corrective surgery. Each of its 33 'items' consists of two questions: a question concerning the frequency with which a given functional or psychosocial problem had been experienced and a 'weighting' question which asked about how much the individual was bothered by that problem. The questionnaire was completed by three groups of individuals: (i) pretreatment; (ii) immediate (i.e. 2-6 months) postsurgery and (iii) postsurgery (i.e. more than 2 years after surgery). Unweighted scale scores were obtained by summing the response codes to the frequency question and weighted scores by summing the products of the frequency and bother questions. These scores were calculated for the full questionnaire and a short form consisting of 15 items. The discriminative and correlational construct validity of these scores was compared along with internal consistency reliability. The sensitivity to change and longitudinal construct validity of unweighted and weighted scores was assessed in a simulated evaluative study in which pretreatment and postsurgery subjects were paired.
RESULTS: For both the long and short forms of the questionnaire, unweighted and weighted scores discriminated between the groups enrolled in the study. Correlations with a general health rating were similar, as were Cronbach's alpha values and test-retest reliabilities. The simulated evaluative study suggested no differences in sensitivity to change or longitudinal construct validity. When subscale scores were examined, there was a suggestion that weighting improved their reliability.
CONCLUSIONS: Self-weighting of items did not substantially improve the performance of the SOOQ. Domain weights should be developed and tested to determine if they have an effect on its properties."
17244137,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17244137/,"OBJECTIVES: To explore whether there is a relationship between children's objectively determined oral health status and their oral health-related quality of life, specifically the evaluations of their smiles as assessed by the children, their parents, and through measurements of the children's videotaped smiles.
METHODS: Chart review data were collected from 99 children (56 boys, 43 girls; average age: 7.06 years; range: 4-12 years) to determine their oral health status. The children responded to the Michigan Oral Health-Related Quality of Life Scale - Child Version (MOHRQOL-C), and the parents responded to the Michigan Oral Health-Related Quality of Life Scale - Parent Version (MOHRQOL-P) to assess the smiling-related aspect of the children's oral health-related quality of life. Parents also responded to questions concerning their own evaluations of their child's smile. The children were videotaped while they watched a funny cartoon. Two independent raters measured the width and openness of the children's mouth plus the number of teeth shown at 25 predetermined time points during these taped sessions to assess the children's video-based smiling patterns.
RESULTS: The children's self evaluated smile scores correlated with the video-based ratings of the children's smiles, and with the number of positive adjectives parents chose to describe their children's smiles. There were significant relationships between several indicators of oral health status and all smile assessment scores. Children without caries evaluated their own smiles more positively, showed more teeth when smiling, and received more positive parent evaluations for their smiles than children with decay.
CONCLUSION: Poor oral health is significantly related to children's smiling patterns and the way others perceived their smiles. Poor oral health may prevent children from expressing positive emotions, which can impact their social interactions and the way they feel about themselves."
17244180,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17244180/,"UNLABELLED: Lycanthropy is a rare psychiatric condition in which the patient believes in being transformed into an animal. Belief in the transformation of another person into an animal has not been reported, so far. Here, a patient with an impression of bipolar mood disorder (mixed type) and such delusion is reported.
METHOD: A single case is reported.
RESULTS: A young male patient in his first psychiatric episode, developed delusional conviction of his mother's transformation into a wolf. He did not have any delusions regarding the transformation of himself into an animal, although he reported drooling for months before developing a delusional belief regarding his mother.
CONCLUSION: Belief in the transformation of another person into an animal may have similar roots as lycanthropy and could be considered as a variant of this syndrome."
17244384,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17244384/,"INTRODUCTION: A recent modification to the Norwood procedure involving a shunt placed directly from the right ventricle to the pulmonary arteries may improve postoperative haemodynamics. Concerns remain, however, about the potential problems produced by the required ventriculotomy.
METHODS: We compared 76 patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome who underwent the Norwood procedure, 35 receiving a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt and the remaining 41 a shunt placed directly from the right ventricle to the pulmonary arteries. We reviewed their subsequent progress through the second stage of palliation. A single observer graded right ventricular function, and the severity of tricuspid regurgitation, based on blinded review of the most recent echocardiograms prior to the second stage of palliation.
RESULTS: At the time of catheterization prior to the second stage, patients with a shunt placed from the right ventricle to the pulmonary arteries, rather than a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt, had higher arterial diastolic blood pressure, at 44 versus 40 millimetres of mercury, p equal to 0.02, lower ventricular end diastolic pressures, at 8 versus 11 millimetres of mercury, p equal to 0.0002, and larger pulmonary arteries as judged using the Nakata index, at 270 versus 188 millimetres squared per metres squared, p equal to 0.009. There was no difference in qualitative ventricular systolic function or tricuspid regurgitation between groups. No differences were found between groups during the hospitalization following the second stage of palliation. A trend towards improved survival to the second stage was seen following the construction of a shunt from the right ventricle to the pulmonary arteries.
CONCLUSIONS: Construction of a shunt from the right ventricle to the pulmonary arteries is associated with lower right ventricular end diastolic pressures, larger pulmonary arterial size, and higher systemic arterial diastolic pressures. No apparent deleterious effects of the right ventriculotomy were observed in terms of qualitative ventricular systolic function or tricuspid regurgitation."
17244396,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17244396/,"OBJECTIVE: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) benefit from specialist interventions to retard progression of renal failure and prevent cardiovascular events. Certain patient groups have poor access to specialist renal services when dialysis is required. This study used a population-based laboratory database to investigate access to and timeliness of referral to renal specialists relatively early in the course of the disease.
METHODS: All tests for serum creatinine and haemoglobin (Hb) A(1)c in Northern Ireland in a two-year period (2001 and 2002) were retrieved for 345,441 adults. Of these, 16,856 patients had at least one serum creatinine level above 150 micromol/L in 2001 not deemed to be due to acute renal failure (crude prevalence 1.42%). This cohort was followed until the end of 2002 and the differences in the time to referral to a specialist were assessed using Cox's proportional hazards regression.
RESULTS: Diabetic patients, older patients and those living in deprived areas were significantly more likely to have serum creatinine testing, compared with non-diabetic, younger and those living in more affluent areas. Delays in referral to renal specialists for patients with raised serum creatinine levels were significantly shorter among diabetic patients, women, younger individuals, those living in rural areas, those living close to renal centres and those living in deprived areas. Overall, only 19% of diabetic patients and 6% of non-diabetic patients who had CKD had seen a renal specialist within 12 months of their index creatinine test.
CONCLUSION: Contrary to other diseases, disadvantaged patients do not seem to be under-investigated for renal disease compared with their more affluent neighbours and are generally referred earlier for specialist assessment. However, the absolute rate of timely specialist assessment is low. Recent changes in referral criteria for CKD will result in more referrals and will have serious resource implications. Opportunities for health gain among patients with declining renal function are being missed, particularly among the old and those living furthest from specialist centres."
17244964,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17244964/,"BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of reactive arthritis is a challenging clinical problem in daily practice. Although there are many triggering infectious agents for reactive arthritis, Toxoplasmosis, a worldwide parasitic infection has not been reported.
AIM: We investigated the serologic evidence of Toxoplasma gondii ( T. gondii ) infection in patients with newly diagnosed reactive arthritis after six weeks of the onset of the first symptom but no demonstrable triggering agent for reactive arthritis.
SETTING AND DESIGN: Clinical controlled study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We screened serologically the serum toxoplasma IgM and IgG antibody (Ab) titers which revealed toxoplasma infection in 50 patients with reactive arthritis (40 female, 10 men) and no demonstrable triggering agent and control subjects (32 female, 8 male).
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: SPSS 10.0 software package program was used.
RESULTS: The mean age of the patients and controls was similar (41.3+/- 12.0 vs. 39.6+/-11.8 years) respectively. The prevalence of IgG Ab titers of T. gondii in patients and controls were found to be 52% and 47.5%, respectively. Mean serum Toxoplasma IgG Ab levels were found to be 16.5+/-14.5 IU/ml, and 16.9+/-13.8 IU/ml in patients and control subjects respectively ( P> 0.05). We did not find any Toxoplasma IgM Ab titer demonstrating the acute or sub-acute infection in the serum of patients or controls.
CONCLUSION: Although past Toxoplasma infection was prevalent in both groups, we did not find any subject with acute Toxoplasma infection in patients with newly diagnosed reactive arthritis and healthy controls. Despite the fact that our study group was small, we suggest that T. gondii does not seem to be a triggering agent for reactive arthritis and past infection may be a coincidental finding."
17245060,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17245060/,"OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were (1) to investigate the pathophysiological characteristics of the middle ear mucoperiosteum against the caustic nature of the gastric content (GC), which consists largely of acid and pepsin components, and (2) to investigate the possible role of gastroesophageal reflux and postoperative vomiting (POV) in the etiology of poststapedectomy granuloma.
METHODS: 40 Spraque-Dawley rats of either sex and with a body weight of 200-300 g were used, and divided into different study groups: group 1: GC administration to the middle ear (n = 8); group 2: phosphate-buffered saline administration to the middle ear (n = 8); group 3: GC (pH: 2) administration in the presence of a Teflon piston (TP) (n = 6); group 4: phosphate-buffered saline administration in the presence of a TP (n = 6); group 5: GC administration in the presence of a wired piston (WP) (n = 6); group 6: phosphate- buffered saline administration in the presence of a WP (n = 6). GC was administrated to the middle ear cavities by way of the eustachian tube (ET). In order to overcome the pressure of the ET, a pump mechanism was used. The increased nasopharyngeal pressure caused a passive opening of the ET, and transferred a bolus to the middle ear. The animals were decapitated after 1 week, and the bullae were isolated. The tympanic bullae were serially cut and examined with light microscopy.
RESULTS: In the saline controls, there was only a mild amount of polymorphonuclear cell (PMN) infiltration in the mildly thickened subepithelial space, indicating a less pronounced inflammation as compared to the gastric acid group. In the GC group, in addition to focal hemorrhage and severe subepithelial infiltration of PMNs, the middle ear mucosa was dramatically thickened with subepithelial edema and dilated capillaries. In the subepithelial tissue, retention cysts and granulation tissue were present. In the piston groups (TP and WP), there was extensive subepithelial inflammation and edema after GC and saline administrations. Granulation tissue filling the entire bulla around the piston segments was detected.
CONCLUSION: The relationship between the administration of GC and middle ear inflammation, and the possible role of POV in the etiology of poststapedectomy granuloma are emphasized with our experimental study. The length of the TP may be considerably important to prevent POV which may lead to gastric reflux to the middle ear."

OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study is to confirm the effectiveness of iridium brachytherapy combined with surgery and to evaluate patient satisfaction.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled 24 patients with 30 keloids, treated by surgical excision and iridium 192 high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy.
RESULTS: We observed a significant difference in scar thickness before and after the treatment (P < 0.001). With regard to patient satisfaction and complaints, 79.1% of them had no pain and irritation after treatment, 79.2% of patients would recommend this treatment to other patients, and 87.5% would undergo this treatment again if necessary.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm the effectiveness of surgical keloid excision followed by HDR brachytherapy in primary treatment or if other alternative methods have failed."
17245778,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17245778/,"AIMS: Although measurement of maximum flow rate (Qmax) is a standard and straightforward test, it is often difficult to obtain reliable readings. We obtained multiple measurements using a simple home uroflow device which categorizes Qmax into ranges. We hypothesize that the average of a series of relatively coarse measurements of Qmax would be more repeatable and therefore more representative of an individual's voiding function than a single, albeit more precise measurement.
METHODS: We studied 22 male volunteers with a wide range of Qmax. They were asked to record flow category (<10 ml/sec; 10-15 ml/sec; 15-20 ml/sec; >20 ml/sec) and voided volume twice daily for 12 days using the home flow device. In addition, a clinic-based flow recording using a spinning-disc uroflowmeter was obtained at both the start and the end of the 12-day period.
RESULTS: Good agreement between mean home flow and mean clinic flow was seen with mean (SD) difference of 1.3 (5) ml/sec. The mean for consecutive halves of an individual's home flow data showed excellent agreement (-0.2 (1.3) ml/sec). The two clinic readings showed poorer agreement (2.3 (6.8) ml/sec) than the home readings, and poorer agreement even than between clinic and home flows.
CONCLUSIONS: Although simple in design, the home flowmeter actually shows greater accuracy than might be expected when used repeatedly to study the flow rates of men. Simple flow devices such as this could be used in conjunction with voiding diaries to give a more representative picture of patients' day-to-day voiding function."
17249858,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17249858/,"BACKGROUND: Medication review by pharmacists is increasingly being implemented in the primary care setting and has been incorporated into the new pharmacy contract in the UK. This study aims to determine the cost effectiveness of home-based medication review in older people.
METHODS: This economic evaluation was based on a randomised controlled trial (the HOMER [HOME-based medication Review] trial). Patients aged >80 years (n = 872) were recruited if admitted as an emergency to an acute or community hospital in Norfolk or Suffolk (any cause), returning to their own home or warden-controlled accommodation, and taking two or more drugs daily on discharge. Patients randomised to the intervention group received two home visits by a pharmacist within 2 and 8 weeks of discharge to educate patients and carers about their drugs, remove out-of-date drugs, inform GPs of drug reactions or interactions and inform the local pharmacist if an adherence aid was needed. The control arm received usual care. Economic evaluation was performed from the UK NHS perspective, with follow-up for 6 months and cost data from 2000. Resource use data were collected from hospital episode statistics and from a sample of GP records of trial participants. Intervention, hospital, ambulance and general practice costs were considered to determine average costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Use of the EQ-5D questionnaire permitted outcomes to be expressed as QALYs. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was employed to calculate cost-effectiveness acceptability curves.
RESULTS: Mortality and admission data were available for 829 of 855 patients included in the study (415 intervention and 414 control patients). Of those patients randomised to the intervention group, 358 had a medication review at a total intervention cost of 51,622 pound (or 124 pound per randomised patient). The intervention did not reduce hospital admissions. The average cost per intervention group patient was 1695 pound compared with 1424 pound for control patients. The incremental cost per life year gained through the intervention was 33,541 pound. The incremental cost per QALY gained in the intervention was 54,454 pound. Sensitivity analysis suggested a 25% probability that home-based medication review is cost effective using a threshold of 30,000 pound per QALY.
CONCLUSION: The current policy imperative for implementing medicines review needs to be reconsidered in the light of the findings of this study: a small, non significant gain in quality of life, no reduction in hospital admissions and a low probability of cost effectiveness."
17250539,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17250539/,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A study was undertaken to evaluate the relationship between dermal thickness and bone density. Ninety-eight female subjects were recruited from a population of patients attending a university hospital osteoporosis clinic. The subject population ranged in age from 30 to 88 years with a mean age of 60. The weight range was from 91 to 274 pounds, mean 142 pounds.
METHODS: Dermal thickness measurements were taken at the right forearm using a Longport high resolution 20 MHz ultrasound scanner. Bone density measurements were taken using a GE Lunar Prodigy DXA scanner at both hips.
RESULTS: Statistical analysis using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of the skin measurements showed that the dermal measurement technique was highly reliable (CI=0.87, 0.92). Linear regression was used to examine the value of dermal thickness as a predictor of bone density. The correlation coefficient between dermal thickness and hip T score was statistically significant in the positive direction (corr.=0.304, P=0.001). We further investigated the relationship between dermal thickness and T scores using penalized splines.
CONCLUSION: This analysis indicated that the strongest association with bone density occurred between 1.0 and 1.5 mm of dermal thickness. In those subjects identified as having osteoporosis dermal thickness measure of > or =1.04 corresponds to 4% of the subjects having osteoporosis. If dermal thickness is <1.04 then 23% have osteoporosis."
17250579,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17250579/,"AIM: To determine whether application of a periodontal dressing stopped pain arising from dentine hypersensitivity, objectively assessed with evaporative and thermal stimuli and recorded with Visual Analogue Scale scoring (VAS).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 22 subjects completed the single-centre, subject-blind, stratified, randomized, split-mouth study, with a minimum of two sensitive teeth, in at least two different quadrants, displaying a response of >or=30 mm with VAS to evaporative stimulus. One tooth in two different quadrants was identified and randomized to test or control groups. A dressing was applied to all the sensitive teeth in the test quadrant, and either side of the chosen sensitive tooth on the control side. The test teeth were then stimulated for hypersensitivity using evaporative stimuli and then using thermal stimuli.
RESULTS: Analysis showed that dressing application produced significantly greater reduction in pain (P<0.0001) compared with no periodontal dressing. Single application of a dressing to sensitive dentine provided 95% pain relief associated with thermal stimulus and 85% pain relief associated with evaporative stimulus.
CONCLUSIONS: Application of the dressing to sensitive teeth, dramatically reduced the pain of dentine hypersensitivity following tooth stimulation. When assessing subjects' response to pain-evoking stimuli, perception of pain appears to be altered by sensory factors, prompting a heightened pain response."
17250745,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17250745/,"BACKGROUND: Physostigmine is the drug of choice in the central anticholinergic syndrome, but has also been used in post-operative mental derangement secondary to sedatives and volatile anaesthetics. The aim of this double-blind, randomized, prospective study was to determine whether physostigmine alters recovery after desflurane anaesthesia.
METHODS: One hundred patients undergoing urologic or surgical procedures were enrolled to receive either NaCl 0.9% (n = 50) or 2 mg of physostigmine (n = 50) at the end of general anaesthesia with propofol, fentanyl, cisatracurium and desflurane. Times to extubation, stating name, birthday and place of residence, and obeying commands such as eye opening and hand squeezing were noted. Haemodynamics, Aldrete and pain scores, the analgesic requirements, and any adverse side-effects were documented until the 1st post-operative day.
RESULTS: Demographic, peri-operative data including duration of anaesthesia, surgery and postanaesthetic care unit (PACU) stay, and consumption of anaesthetics were comparable in both groups. No significant difference between the groups was found for extubation time or other emergence parameters. Patients undergoing anaesthesia >150 min showed after receiving physostigmine significantly (P < 0.05) faster spontaneous breathing (2.6 +/- 3.1 vs. placebo 5.0 +/- 4.2 min) and extubation time (6.2 +/- 3.7 vs. placebo 8.8 +/- 5.0 min). Women showed significantly shorter extubation times (5.5 +/- 3.4 min) and eye opening (5.5 +/- 2.6 min) with physostigmine than placebo (7.7 +/- 4.5 and 7.8 +/- 4.0 min). The incidence of post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) was significantly higher after physostigmine than placebo, whereas shivering occurred more often after placebo.
CONCLUSION: Physostigmine does not alter desflurane-based anaesthesia compared with placebo. An option is to use physostigmine in patients with a duration of anaesthesia >150 min who profit in earlier return to spontaneous breathing and shorter extubation time."
17250779,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17250779/,"BACKGROUND: The aetiology of maxillary mucosal cysts is uncertain. Chronic rhinosinusitis has been proposed as a probable aetiological explanation for their formation.
METHOD: We recruited 500 consecutive patients who had undergone computed tomography scanning of the paranasal sinuses for possible chronic sinus disease. We identified 110 (22 per cent) cases of maxillary mucosal cysts.
RESULTS: Patients' mean age was 42.65 years, with a female to male ratio of 0.69:1 (45:65). The mean cyst size was 14.27 mm, and most were located on the inferior surface of the antrum. Only in two cases did the cyst obstruct the sinus ostium. Of patients with antral cysts, 52.7 per cent had computed tomography evidence of sinus disease, whereas only 41.3 per cent of noncyst (control) patients had sinus pathology. The total Lund-Mackay score was significantly greater in the cyst group (n=390) compared with the noncyst group (Mann-Whitney; p<0.05).
CONCLUSION: Chronic rhinosinusitis plays an important role in the aetiology of maxillary mucosal cysts."
17250781,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17250781/,"INTRODUCTION: Temporal bone dissection is essential training for otological surgery. Organ retention scandals have made it difficult to obtain consent for cadaveric temporal bone removal. The current literature does not address the means of acquiring a steady supply of cadaveric temporal bones for medical education and training. The US national temporal bone registry has established a temporal bone donor bank for medical education and research. Could a similar programme in the UK be an answer to the paucity of temporal bones?
OBJECTIVES: (1) To ascertain the degree of interest amongst our regional patient population in a 'living will' pledge for temporal bone donation for medical education and research. (2) To delineate a demographic profile of potential temporal bone donors.
DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: One thousand questionnaires were distributed to patients and relatives attending out-patient clinics; 920 people responded.
RESULTS: Seventy per cent of respondents supported temporal bone donation for medical education and research. Potential temporal bone donors tended to be ENT clinic attenders, to suffer from hearing difficulties or to have had previous ear surgery (p<0.001). Strong support also came from non-ENT clinic attenders.
CONCLUSIONS: There was strong support amongst our regional patient population for a 'living will' pledge for temporal bone donation for medical education and research. Based on our donor profile, we propose a temporal bone donor programme, starting on a regional basis with possible expansion nationwide. This programme would recruit donors from amongst patients attending ENT out-patient clinics, as a long term solution to improve the supply of temporal bones."
17251280,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17251280/,"OBJECTIVE: Successful disease management is heavily influenced by access to care issues and patient behavior. Screening tests to detect chronic complications are part of diabetes management and may be influenced by access to care or patient decisions. The objective of this research was to examine how strongly access to care and patient behavior predict screening practices.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Information on screening practices, access to care, and diabetes management were identified from the Pittsburgh Epidemiology of Diabetes Complications Study at two time points: 1998-2001 and 2002-2006. Information on access to care and patient behavior identified in 1998-2001 were examined relative to screening practices observed in 2002-2006.
RESULTS: Access-to-care issues positively predicted subsequent screening practices. Specifically, specialist care visits, number of doctor visits, and intensive insulin therapy were all strong predictors for screening use. Receipt of the recommended level of screening tests was also positively associated with the patient behavior of daily blood glucose testing.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study show that access to care, in general, and access to quality diabetes care, in specific, play a key role in the use of recommended screening tests in type 1 diabetic patients. These data suggest that future efforts to improve screening practices in the type 1 diabetic population should address issues related to access to care."
17251609,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17251609/,"BACKGROUND: Elbow injuries account for approximately 2-3% of presentations to the emergency department. This is associated not only with a very high rate of x rays but also with a very high rate of ""missed fractures"" This study examines which components of elbow examination have the best correlation with a normal radiograph.
DESIGN SETTING: A district general hospital's emergency department seeing 83,000 new attendances per annum (pa) (approximately 1600 elbow injuries pa).
METHODS: After estimating the power before data collection, all patients presenting with elbow injuries were considered for inclusion, and were excluded only if they were unable to follow instructions owing to either reduced conscious levels or mental conditions. A proforma was completed after patient examination, indicating the features of clinical examination, and the results of radiographs if any. The formal report of all radiographs taken was sought from the radiology department.
RESULTS: 407 patients were entered into the study, of whom 331 received a radiograph of the elbow. Full extension of the elbow had a specificity of 0.916 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.863 to 0.969, sensitivity 0.478) for detection of a normal radiograph. An equal range of movement ROM had a specificity of 0.976 (95% CI 0.940 to 0.991, sensitivity 0.211). Subgroup analysis of patients aged < 16 years showed a specificity of equal ROM of 1 (95% CI 0.941 to 1.000) for the detection of a normal x ray. Logistic regression analysis showed that best predictive values were achieved by a combination of full extension, flexion and supination.
CONCLUSION: A two-tier clinical rule for management of elbow injury is proposed: (1) Those patients aged < or = 16 years with a ROM equal to the unaffected side may be safely discharged; (2) Those patients with normal extension, flexion and supination do not require emergent elbow radiographs."
17251611,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17251611/,"BACKGROUND: Recent evidence shows a substantial short-term risk of ischaemic stroke after transient ischaemic attack (TIA). Identification of patients with TIA with a high short-term risk of stroke is now possible through the use of the ""ABCD Score"", which considers age, blood pressure, clinical features and duration of symptoms predictive of stroke.
AIM: To evaluate the ability of dichotomising the ABCD Score to predict stroke at 7 and 90 days in a population with TIA presenting to an emergency department.
METHODS: A retrospective audit was conducted on all probable or definite TIAs presenting to the emergency department of a metropolitan hospital from July to December 2004. The ABCD Score was applied to 98 consecutive patients with TIA who were reviewed for subsequent strokes within 90 days. Patients obtaining an ABCD Score > or = 5 were considered to be at high risk for stroke.
RESULTS: Dichotomising the ABCD Score categorised 48 (49%) patients with TIA at high risk for stroke (ABCD Score > or = 5). This high-risk group contained all four strokes that occurred within 7 days (sensitivity 100% (95% confidence interval (CI) 40% to 100%), specificity 53% (95% CI 43% to 63%), positive predictive value 8% (95% CI 3% to 21%) and negative predictive value 100% (95% CI 91% to 100%)), and six of seven occurring within 90 days (sensitivity 86% (95% CI 42% to 99%), specificity 54% (95% CI 43% to 64%), positive predictive value 12.5% (95% CI 5% to 26%) and negative predictive value 98% (95% CI 88% to 100%)). Removal of the ""age"" item from the ABCD Score halved the number of false-positive cases without changing its predictive value for stroke.
CONCLUSION: In this retrospective analysis, dichotomising the ABCD Score was overinclusive but highly predictive in identifying patients with TIA at a high short-term risk of stroke. Use of the ABCD Score in the emergency care of patients with TIA is simple, efficient and provides a unique opportunity to prevent stroke in this population of patients."
17252242,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17252242/,"OBJECTIVE: Human urotensin II (UII) acts on the urotensin (UT) receptor and is the most potent mammalian vasoconstrictor identified to date. The role of UII in human cardiovascular regulation remains unclear, and the results of plasma measurements have been conflicting, perhaps because different measurement techniques have been used. The effects of cigarette smoking on plasma UII concentrations are unknown. The primary aim of our study was to demonstrate whether cigarette smoking had any effect on plasma UII concentrations in otherwise healthy volunteers. Our secondary aim was to compare the results obtained from assaying simultaneously using both radioimmunoassay (RIA) and immunoluminometric assay (ILMA).
METHODS: Blood was taken from 20 healthy male non-smokers and 20 healthy male cigarette smokers. Plasma was separated and stored at -70 degrees C. Samples were batch analysed simultaneously for UII using RIA and ILMA.
RESULTS: Median (range) plasma UII concentrations were lower in non-smokers [1.67 (1.0-2.27) pg ml(-1)] compared to smokers [2.62 (1.87-3.46) pg ml(-1)] (P = 0.03) measured using RIA. Those who had smoked a cigarette in the 10 min before sampling had greater concentrations of UII [3.10 (1.87-4.60) pg ml(-1)] compared to controls (P = 0.01). Plasma UII concentrations determined by ILMA were consistently low with no differences between groups.
CONCLUSION: The data obtained by RIA show that smoking may increase plasma concentrations of UII with a more pronounced increase when a cigarette has been smoked recently. There was a complete lack of correlation between RIA and ILMA for the whole data set, which suggests that some of the variability in plasma UII reported in the literature may result from differences between assays."
17252588,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17252588/,"BACKGROUND: We sought to determine the effect of positive neural margins on subsequent facial nerve function following facial nerve grafting.
METHODS: In this retrospective review, 19 patients had sacrifice of their facial nerve with immediate facial nerve grafting, 8 had positive neural margins, and 11 had negative neural margins. Facial nerve function was analyzed using the House-Brackman scale.
RESULTS: In the first group (8 patients), 5 had positive proximal margins and 3 had positive distal neural margins. Outcome by House-Brackman score was III (2 patients), IV (3 patients), V (1 patient), and VI (2 patients). In the second group (no evidence of neural spread, 11 patients), outcome was III (3 patients), IV (2 patients), V (2 patients), and VI (4 patients).
CONCLUSION: No significant difference in the outcome of facial nerve function was seen between these 2 groups. Facial nerve grafting should be considered in patients whose facial nerve is sacrificed, even when there is evidence of tumor in the perineurium at the margin of resection."
17252883,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17252883/,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: Daytime sleepiness is a common clinical presentation in both obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and cardiovascular diseases. The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between degree of subjective daytime sleepiness and cardiac performance in patients with obstructive sleep apnea.
DESIGN: Observational study.
SETTING: General Clinical Research Center.
PATIENTS: The study sample was comprised of 86 patients (68 men and 18 women) with an average age of 47 years. All were suspected of having obstructive sleep apnea and underwent confirmatory diagnostic polysomnography (respiratory disturbance index > or = 15).
MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Stroke volume and cardiac output were measured using impedance cardiography and corrected for body surface area to yield stroke index and cardiac index. Daytime sleepiness was quantified using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. A higher Epworth Sleepiness Scale score, suggesting more daytime sleepiness, was significantly related to lower stroke index and cardiac index. In multiple regression analyses, the relationships of Epworth Sleepiness Scale score with both stroke index and cardiac index were significant (p < .05), even after controlling for age, sex, ethnicity, respiratory disturbance index, and mean sleep oxygen saturation.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that daytime sleepiness is independently associated with decreases in cardiac function as assessed by impedance cardiography in patients with obstructive sleep apnea."
17253105,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17253105/,"BACKGROUND: Preliminary results showed that contrast-enhanced intraoperative ultrasonography (CEIOUS) could provide information not obtainable with conventional IOUS during surgery for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of the study was to prospectively validate the role of CEIOUS on the basis of a larger experience and to establish a new classification that takes into account its findings.
METHODS: Eighty-seven consecutive patients underwent hepatecomies for HCC. Those patients with new lesions at IOUS underwent CEIOUS: for that patients received intravenously 4.8 mL sulphurhexafluoride microbubbles. Pattern of enhancement was classified in 4 categories: A1 (full enhancement in the arterial phase and wash-out in the delayed phases), A2 (intralesional signs of neovascularization during all phases), A3 (no nodular enhancement but detectability during the liver enhancement), and B (undetectability during the liver enhancement). Resection was recommended for A1-3 nodules and no treatment for B nodules.
RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients (33%) had 59 new lesions at IOUS and underwent CEIOUS. Twenty-seven nodules showed a B pattern at CEIOUS and were not removed; 32 nodules were classified as A1 in 5 patients, A2 in 11 patients, and A3 in 16 patients. The nodules were removed, and by histology, five A1, nine A2, and six A3 nodules were confirmed to be HCC. CEIOUS modified the operative decision making in 79% of these patients.
CONCLUSIONS: CEIOUS is useful during surgery for HCC; it complements the accuracy of IOUS and affects the radicalness of the surgical. Specificity of CEIOUS has to be further improved, although intrinsic drawbacks exist in the diagnostic criterion of tumor vascularity."
17253337,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17253337/,"INTRODUCTION: Computer-assisted surgery (CAS) has found widespread use in functional endonasal sinus surgery (FESS) over the past few years. The present study investigates if CAS leads to a better outcome in FESS.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: All patients who underwent endonasal sphenoethmoidectomy were enrolled in a prospective, non-randomized study. The procedures were done without CAS (group A) in 2003 and in 2004 with CAS (group B), using a Stryker navigation unit. 62 patients (113 sphenoidectomies) were included in group A and 61 patients (109 sphenoidectomies) in group B. The underlying disease was recurrent chronic sinusitis or polyposis nasi in all patients except for inverted papilloma in one patient of group A and in two patients of group B. The follow-up period was 6 months. Preoperatively and at 6 months postoperatively, a CT-scan was obtained and symptom scores were assessed using a questionnaire.
RESULTS: No significant difference was found between group A and B with respect to symptom scores, and CT-scans preoperatively and at 6 months postoperatively. The operation strategy did not change by the introduction of CAS. The frontal sinus was entered in group A and B in 59% and 64%, respectively. All parameters significantly improved postoperatively, compared to the preoperative values. As far as complications are concerned, two anterior orbital injuries and one retrobulbar haematoma occurred in group A and one postoperative lacrimal stenosis in group B.
CONCLUSIONS: CAS does not lead to a better clinical outcome in FESS. Our data suggest that the rate of complications may be reduced using CAS. However, studies with a much larger number of patients would be necessary for a definite answer to this issue."
17254322,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17254322/,"BACKGROUND: Because training of the lumbar muscles is a commonly recommended intervention in low back pain (LBP), it is important to clarify whether lumbar muscle atrophy is related to LBP. Fat infiltration seems to be a late stage of muscular degeneration, and can be measured in a non-invasive manner using magnetic resonance imaging. The purpose of this study was to investigate if fat infiltration in the lumbar multifidus muscles (LMM) is associated with LBP in adults and adolescents.
METHODS: In total, 412 adults (40-year-olds) and 442 adolescents (13-year-olds) from the general Danish population participated in this cross-sectional cohort study. People with LBP were identified through questionnaires. Using MRI, fat infiltration of the LMM was visually graded as none, slight or severe. Odds ratios were calculated for both age groups, taking into account sex, body composition and leisure time physical activity for both groups, and physical workload (in adults only) or daily bicycling (in adolescents only).
RESULTS: Fat infiltration was noted in 81% of the adults but only 14% of the adolescents. In the adults, severe fat infiltration was strongly associated with ever having had LBP (OR 9.2; 95% CI 2.0-43.2), and with having LBP in the past year (OR 4.1; 1.5-11.2), but there was no such association in adolescents. None of the investigated moderating factors had an obvious effect on the OR in the adults.
CONCLUSION: Fat infiltration in the LMM is strongly associated with LBP in adults only. However, it will be necessary to quantify these measurements objectively and to investigate the direction of this link longitudinally in order to determine if the abnormal muscle is the cause of LBP or vice versa."
17254933,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17254933/,"BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive parathyroidectomy has become the first surgical option for patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) in many places. Preoperative localization studies are mandatory, and the use of a quick parathyroid hormone (PTH) assay is highly recommended. The aim of this study was to analyze our initial series of targeted parathyroidectomies.
STUDY DESIGN: In a 2-year period, 50 patients underwent unilateral neck exploration for HPT under local anesthesia and light sedation. After biochemical diagnosis, a technetium 99m sestamibi scan was performed on all patients, and cervical ultrasonography was obtained in some patients. Frozen section analysis was used to confirm parathyroid tissue in all patients. There was no biochemical intraoperative evaluation of PTH. Demographics, surgical details, results, and complications were analyzed.
RESULTS: There were 35 women and 15 men, with a mean age of 56 years (range 23 to 85 years). Mean preoperative calcium was 11.4 mg/dL (range 10.0 to 14.8 mg/dL), and PTH was 342 pg/mL (range 105 to 2,231 pg/mL). Mean surgical time was 52 minutes (range 30 to 100 minutes), and mean hospital stay was 2 days (range 1 to 7 days). Mean parathyroid weight was 1,000 mg (range 117 to 17,000 mg). Sestamibi scan correctly localized the abnormal gland in 47 patients (94%). There was one postoperative complication (bleeding); two patients required contralateral exploration, and persistent hypercalcemia developed in one that required surgical reintervention. After a mean followup of 12 months (range 3 to 25 months), all patients were normocalcemic.
CONCLUSIONS: Targeted parathyroidectomy is safe and effective. Despite the fact that quick intraoperative PTH assay was not used, the cure rate was 98%."

We aimed to compare the risks of hospitalization for AMI and GI bleeding among elderly patients using COX-2 inhibitors, NS-NSAIDs and acetaminophen.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using administrative data of patients > or =65 years of age who filled a prescription for NSAID or acetaminophen during 1999-2002. Outcomes were compared using Cox regression models with time-dependent exposures.
RESULTS: Person-years of exposure among non-users of aspirin were: 75,761 to acetaminophen, 42,671 to rofecoxib 65,860 to celecoxib, and 37,495 to NS-NSAIDs. Among users of aspirin, they were: 14,671 to rofecoxib, 22,875 to celecoxib, 9,832 to NS-NSAIDs and 38,048 to acetaminophen. Among non-users of aspirin, the adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) of hospitalization for AMI/GI vs the acetaminophen (with no aspirin) group were: rofecoxib 1.27 (1.13, 1.42), celecoxib 0.93 (0.83, 1.03), naproxen 1.59 (1.31, 1.93), diclofenac 1.17 (0.99, 1.38) and ibuprofen 1.05 (0.74, 1.51). Among users of aspirin, they were: rofecoxib 1.73 (1.52, 1.98), celecoxib 1.34 (1.19, 1.52), ibuprofen 1.51 (0.95, 2.41), diclofenac 1.69 (1.35, 2.10), naproxen 1.35 (0.97, 1.88) and acetaminophen 1.29 (1.17, 1.42).
CONCLUSION: Among non-users of aspirin, naproxen seemed to carry the highest risk for AMI/GI bleeding. The AMI/GI toxicity of celecoxib was similar to that of acetaminophen and seemed to be better than those of rofecoxib and NS-NSAIDs. Among users of aspirin, both celecoxib and naproxen seemed to be the least toxic."
17255180,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17255180/,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the association between placental location in diamniotic-dichorionic twins as determined at the time of anatomic survey and birth weight.
METHODS: We retrospectively identified all diamniotic-dichorionic twins in our Maternal-Fetal Medicine sonography database between 2000 and 2005 who had an anatomic survey, went on to be delivered at our hospital, and had records available for review (n = 304). Placental location for each twin was determined at the time of anatomic survey and grouped into both anterior or both posterior versus separate anterior and posterior. Maternal and fetal characteristics were collected from chart review. Placental pathologic findings were available for 249 (83%) patients. Outcomes analyzed were percent discordance, small size for gestational age of twin A or B, and difference in birth weight as a continuous variable. Multivariable logistic regression using stepwise backward elimination was used to adjust for potential confounders.
RESULTS: There was no difference in discordance of 20% or greater or incidence of small size for gestational age when both placentas were both anterior and both posterior compared with separate anterior and posterior: adjusted odds ratio (AdjOR), 1.38 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.64-2.95); and AdjOR, 1.29 (95% CI, 0.57-2.89). The actual birth weight difference (A - B) was not affected by placental location (P = .36). Opposite sex fetuses and nulliparity were significantly associated with birth weight discordance: AdjOR, 2.68 (95% CI, 1.39-5.17); and AdjOR, 0.34 (95% CI, 0.28-0.94).
CONCLUSIONS: We did not find a correlation between birth weight and placental location in our cohort analysis. The presence of sex-discordant twins was associated with birth weight discordance of 20% or greater, whereas nulliparity was protective."
17255566,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17255566/,"RATIONALE: Treatment and prognoses of diffuse parenchymal lung diseases (DPLDs) varies by diagnosis. Obtaining a uniform diagnosis among observers is difficult.
OBJECTIVES: Evaluate diagnostic agreement between academic and community-based physicians for patients with DPLDs, and determine if an interactive approach between clinicians, radiologists, and pathologists improved diagnostic agreement in community and academic centers.
METHODS: Retrospective review of 39 patients with DPLD. A total of 19 participants reviewed cases at 2 community locations and 1 academic location. Information from the history, physical examination, pulmonary function testing, high-resolution computed tomography, and surgical lung biopsy was collected. Data were presented in the same sequential fashion to three groups of physicians on separate days.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Each observer's diagnosis was coded into one of eight categories. A kappa statistic allowing for multiple raters was used to assess agreement in diagnosis. Interactions between clinicians, radiologists, and pathologists improved interobserver agreement at both community and academic sites; however, final agreement was better within academic centers (kappa = 0.55-0.71) than within community centers (kappa = 0.32-0.44). Clinically significant disagreement was present between academic and community-based physicians (kappa = 0.11-0.56). Community physicians were more likely to assign a final diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis compared with academic physicians.
CONCLUSIONS: Significant disagreement exists in the diagnosis of DPLD between physicians based in communities compared with those in academic centers. Wherever possible, patients should be referred to centers with expertise in diffuse parenchymal lung disorders to help clarify the diagnosis and provide suggestions regarding treatment options."

OBJECTIVES: To compare the pattern of AIDS-defining events, CD4 cell count at the time of AIDS diagnosis, survival from time of AIDS, and CD4 cell count near time of death in HIV-1 and HIV-2-infected patients.
METHODS: Adult patients with AIDS who attended the clinics of the MRC in The Gambia were enrolled. AIDS was diagnosed according to the expanded World Health Organization case definition for AIDS surveillance (1994).
RESULTS: Three hundred and forty-one AIDS patients with HIV-1 and 87 with HIV-2 infection were enrolled. The most common AIDS-defining events in both infections were the wasting syndrome and pulmonary tuberculosis. The median CD4 cell count at AIDS was 109 cells/microl in HIV-1 and 176 in HIV-2 (P = 0.01) and remained significantly higher in HIV-2 after adjustment for age and sex (P = 0.03). The median time to death was 6.3 months in HIV-1 and 12.6 months in HIV-2-infected patients (P = 0.03). In a multivariable analysis adjusting for age, sex and CD4 cell count, the mortality rates of HIV-1 and HIV-2-infected patients were similar (P = 0.25). The median CD4 cell count near time of death was 62 and 120 cells/microl in HIV-1 and HIV-2-infected patients, respectively (P = 0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: HIV-2 patients have a higher CD4 cell count at the time of AIDS, and a longer survival after AIDS. The mortality after an AIDS diagnosis is more influenced by CD4 cell count than HIV type."
17255861,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17255861/,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of tracheostomy on intensive care unit (ICU) and in-hospital mortality for patients requiring prolonged (> 3 days) mechanical ventilation (MV).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of all consecutive patients admitted to our 18-bed tertiary care ICU over 3 yrs (2002-2004) and who received prolonged MV. Outcomes of tracheostomized and nontracheostomized patients were evaluated using univariable and multivariable logistic-regression analyses and by constructing a case-control cohort using a propensity score for performing tracheostomy. MV duration for controls was at least equal to the time from MV onset to tracheostomy for the matched case.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of the 506 patients requiring prolonged MV, 166 were tracheostomized after a median of 12 days of MV. Nontracheostomized patients had higher ICU (42% vs. 33%, p = .06) and in-hospital (48% vs. 37%, p = .03) mortality rates and shorter MV durations and ICU lengths of stay. Performing a tracheostomy (odds ratio, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.37-0.90) was independently associated with a lower probability of ICU death, even after adjusting for other important prognostic factors. No significant differences were detected between the 120 cases and their matched controls regarding ICU admission and day-3 clinical characteristics. After conditional logistic-regression analysis, tracheostomy was associated with lower risk of ICU (odds ratio, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.24-0.89) and in-hospital (odds ratio, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.25-0.90) death.
CONCLUSIONS: Tracheostomy performed in our ICU for long-term MV patients was associated with lower ICU and in-hospital mortality rates, even after carefully controlling for ICU admission and day-3 clinical and physiologic differences between groups. Whether these results reflect that physicians were able to adequately select for tracheostomy patients who, despite having similar physiologic and demographic variables, had the highest probabilities of survival or that the procedure itself really affected the outcomes of these patients will remain speculative."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We evaluated administrative health plan data from 1996 to 2002 covering dental and periodontal treatment utilization, dental extractions, and prescription medication fills of 12,631 adults aged 48-64 in 2002. With tooth loss as the outcome, we evaluated a number of different patterns of statin prescription across time in multivariate generalized linear models.
RESULTS: Unadjusted, statin use was associated with increased tooth loss. After adjustment for potential confounders, there was no suggestion of either increased or decreased tooth loss associated with statin use.
CONCLUSIONS: Statin use was not associated with either a decreased or an increased risk of tooth loss."
17257274,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17257274/,"AIMS: To determine whether higher than average albumin excretion during early puberty identifies subjects who will subsequently develop microalbuminuria (MA) and clinical proteinuria.
METHODS: Longitudinal data from the Oxford Regional Prospective Study of Childhood Diabetes (ORPS; n = 554, median duration of follow-up 10 years; range 3.0-16.7) with assessment of albumin/creatinine ratios in three early morning urine samples collected annually. An albumin excretion phenotype was derived from longitudinal data, for each individual, defining deviation from the mean of regression models, including covariates gender, age, duration of diabetes and age at assessment. Tracking of the phenotypes was confirmed in a second independent cohort from Perth, Australia.
RESULTS: The albumin excretion phenotype showed reasonable correlation between age 11-15 years and age 16-18 years in both cohorts, indicative of good 'tracking'. In the ORPS cohort, tertiles of the albumin excretion phenotype at aged 11-15 years were predictive of subsequent risk for the development of MA. All of the subjects developing clinical proteinuria had an albumin excretion phenotype in the upper tertile or an HbA(1c) > 9% at aged 11-15 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Identification of adolescents at risk of diabetic nephropathy using an albumin excretion phenotype is feasible. When combined with elevated HbA(1c), it may identify subjects for trial of early intervention with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin-II receptor antagonists and statins to improve long-term prognosis in these subjects where sustained improvement in glycaemic control may be difficult to achieve."
17257472,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17257472/,"BACKGROUND: The UK has traditionally had strong proxy demand-side measures favouring generic drug use, including prescribing guidance, financial incentives and encouraging generic prescribing. At distribution level, pharmacies are paid a salary for their dispensing work, based on volume dispensed, and procure generic products on the basis of discounts given to them by manufacturers or wholesalers. The supply-side has been subject to price regulation, and the recent requirement for manufacturers/wholesalers to report prices net of discounts to the DoH, indicate that reimbursed prices for generics may be higher than commodity level.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the level of discounts off the Drug Tariff Price made available to pharmacies and, determine whether the NHS could have a better deal than currently from generic drug purchasing.
DATA AND METHODS: Data on net prices were acquired for different presentations of 12 generic molecules selected across different therapeutic categories and included in the 50 most selling generic prescription only products in the UK in the first quarter of 2005. For these products, 31 out of a possible 34 presentations (90%) were surveyed. The data sources were price lists of three leading full-line wholesalers (one national, two regional), out of a possible 11 full-line wholesalers (27.2%), and three leading generic drug manufacturers, out of a possible 15 manufacturers (20%).
RESULTS: Generic prescribing in the selected molecules was 94.6%, above the national average of 80%, and the total net ingredient cost (NIC) was 675 million pounds, of which 607.5 million pounds (90%) was generic. In 20 of the product presentations reviewed (64.5%), maximum discounts exceeded 60%, whereas in seven (22.6%) maximum discounts ranged between 50 and 60% off the Drug Tariff Price. Reimbursed prices for leading generic molecules are significantly higher than their pharmacy acquisition cost.
CONCLUSIONS: The NHS is reimbursing generics at too high prices and a significant proportion of the reimbursed price accrues to the distribution chain in a fashion that resembles an indirect subsidy. The NHS can improve efficiency as well as increase savings, by purchasing generics closer to their market price. This would require changes in the way pharmacies are reimbursed, for instance, by changing the way the clawback is calculated, or altogether abolishing discounts and introducing a fixed dispensing fee; it could also mean introducing transparency in the determination of Drug Tariff prices by the relevant stakeholders. As the cost per generic script is, in the majority of cases, below the dispensing fee, the current reimbursement system for generics results in a re-distribution from patients and the NHS to the retail distribution chain."
17257959,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17257959/,"BACKGROUND: The current international staging system for lung cancer designates intralobar satellites as T4 disease. In this study, we sought to determine the impact of multifocal, intralobar non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) on patient survival and its potential relevance to stage designation.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of our thoracic surgical cancer registry from 1990 to 2005. Included were 53 patients with a resected lung cancer containing intralobar satellites detected preoperatively (n = 8) or in the resected specimen (n = 45). Patients with multicentric bronchioloalveolar cancer were excluded. All patients had an anatomic resection with mediastinal lymph node dissection. Median follow-up for the entire group was 31 months. Survival was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was performed to examine simultaneously the effects on overall survival of age, gender, nodal disease, number of satellite lesions, lymphatic invasion, and T status.
RESULTS: The median age of the 53 patients with multifocal, intralobar (T4) disease was 68 years and 31 were women. Ten patients had more than one satellite lesion. Overall 5-year survival was 47.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 27.36% to 65.30%) for all patients with resected intralobar satellites. Patients without nodal metastases had a 5-year survival of 58.4% (95% CI, 28.76% to 79.30%). The Cox regression identified female gender (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.31; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.96; p < 0.04) as a significant prognostic variable but only a trend towards significance for nodal status (adjusted HR, 2.3; 95% CI, .83 to 6.26; p < 0.11).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with intralobar multifocal NSCLC detected in the resected specimen have a more favorable prognosis after surgical resection than might be predicted by their stage T4 designation. Five-year survival rates, especially in T4N0 patients, more closely approximate those with stages IB or II NSCLC."
17257983,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17257983/,"BACKGROUND: One of the potential mechanisms to explain the occurrence of postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF) is imbalance of autonomic nervous system tone. The myocardium is innervated not only by cholinergic and adrenergic nerves but also by peptidergic nerves that synthesize and secrete neuropeptides. To investigate the possible role of cardiac neuropeptides in the development of AF after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), we analyzed the plasma levels of substance P (SubP), neuropeptide Y (NPY), and angiotensin II (Ang II) in patients who underwent elective on-pump CABG.
METHODS: This prospective study group included 83 consecutive patients scheduled for elective, on-pump CABG. Depressed left ventricular (LV) function (ejection fraction [EF] less than 0.30), concomitant cardiac procedures, history of atrial fibrillation, second or third degree atrioventricular block, implanted pacemaker, postoperative myocardial infarction, use of class I or III antiarrhythmic drug, and hemodynamic deterioration were exclusion criteria. Preoperative and postoperative serum levels of SubP, NPY, and AngII were measured by radioimmunoassay technique.
RESULTS: Postoperative AF occurred in 27 patients (32.5%). Using multivariate logistic regression analyses, only a decrease in SubP level (odds ratio [OR] = 1.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.767 to 0.99, p = 0.031) and an increase in AngII level (OR = 2.61, 95% CI = 1.002 to 1.021, p = 0.023) after CABG were found to be independently associated with AF. Increased age (p = 0.02), diabetes mellitus (p = 0.023), preoperative use of beta blocker (p = 0.024), proximal right coronary artery involvement (p = 0.024), low preoperative sodium levels (p = 0.023), low LVEF (p = 0.013), and increased mitral E wave deceleration time (p = 0.044) were also associated with AF.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the increase in AngII and the decrease in SubP after CABG may play a role in the occurrence of postoperative AF. Further studies are needed to define the physiologic and pathologic relevance of these substances at the occurrence of AF in patients who undergo CABG."
17257986,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17257986/,"BACKGROUND: Consensus reports over the past 10 years from the United States, Europe, United Kingdom, and Canada have not provided consistent guidelines for antithrombotic therapy of aortic valve bioprostheses for the three-month period after surgery. This study was conducted to determine if antithrombotic therapy was protective against TE with aortic bioprostheses 30 days or less after aortic valve replacement (AVR).
METHODS: From 1994 to 2000, 1,372 patients implanted with three currently marketed aortic bioprostheses, Medtronic Mosaic (Medtronic, Inc, Minneapolis, MN) (415 patients), Carpentier-Edwards SAV (462), and Carpentier-Edwards PERIMOUNT (495) (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA), with a mean age of greater than 70 years were evaluated. Patient populations were comparable, inclusive of concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) for the overall populations and for patients greater than 70 years.
RESULTS: There were 37 thromboembolic (TE) events: major TE, 14; reversible ischemic neurologic deficit (RIND), 12; and minor TE, 11. There were 4 TE deaths. Multivariate (stepwise logistic regression) analysis revealed no predictive risk factors for overall TE. For the combination of major TE plus RIND there were two predictive risk factors with analysis of 12 risk variables: preoperative cerebrovascular accident (odds ratio [OR] 4.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.17 to 16.87, p = 0.028); and concomitant CABG (OR 3.19, 95% CI 1.16 to 8.76, p = 0.025). Neither anticoagulant nor antiplatelet therapies gave significant protection.
CONCLUSIONS: There does not appear to be an indication for routine antithrombotic management. The study supports the potential use of antithrombotic therapy for comorbidities of preoperative cerebrovascular accident and concomitant CABG but not atrial fibrillation, left ventricular dysfunction, or elderly age greater than 70 years. Vascular burden and advanced age are likely contributing factors to these independent predictors. There may still be a need for, or at least consideration of, a randomized trial for AVR with bioprostheses."
17258094,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17258094/,"OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to evaluate the outcome of stent placement (SP) for conduit discrete stenosis using predefined criteria.
BACKGROUND: Right ventricle (RV) to pulmonary artery (PA) conduits are often associated with complications, such as stenosis, requiring multiple surgical replacements.
METHODS: Patients who underwent primary or repeat SP were included. Indications for SP were clinical symptoms and/or RV to systolic blood pressure (SBP) ratio (RV:SBP) >0.65 by echocardiography. Our definition of success was a decrease in RV:SBP by >20%, a final RV:SBP ratio of <0.65, or resolution of symptoms.
RESULTS: Stents were placed successfully in 28 of 31 patients (90%), including 3 patients who underwent the procedure solely for symptoms. The RV:SBP ratio decreased (0.75 +/- 0.17 vs. 0.52 +/- 0.12, p < 0.001), and the conduit diameter increased (postero-anterior 9.1 +/- 2.9 vs. 12.0 +/- 2.8 mm, lateral 8.3 +/- 2.2 vs. 11.6 +/- 2.4 mm, p < 0.001). In the 28 patients with successful SP, 8 (29%) remained free from second intervention. In the remaining patients, the median time to re-intervention was 16 months (range 6 to 44 months). Second transcatheter interventions (4 SP, 4 balloon dilation) were successful in 8 of 13 patients. Complications included balloon rupture (n = 4), stent fracture (n = 2), and pseudoaneurysm formation (n = 1).
CONCLUSIONS: Initial SP has excellent intermediate outcomes, successfully postponing surgical intervention for the majority of patients. Conduit restenosis may be successfully treated with a second transcatheter intervention. On the basis of these data, SP is likely the procedure of choice for patients with a discrete stenosis of the RV to PA conduit."
17258340,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17258340/,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Parameters and indices related to the implant geometry in use for describing the quality of volume implants in interstitial brachytherapy were developed on the basis of LDR-brachytherapy. The aim of our study was to evaluate their usefulness for predicting late toxicity and local control in the PDR-brachytherapy of head-and-neck-tumors.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 2000 and October 2004, 210 patients were treated with PDR-brachytherapy which was administered either postoperatively or as definitive treatment. Brachytherapy was used as sole treatment in some cases while in others a combination with EBRT was used. For assessment of quality of implants we analyzed the following indices and parameters using the univariate chi2 test and multivariate logistic regression analysis: V85, V120 and V150 (volume enclosed by the surface of the 85%-, 120%- and 150%-isodose), UI (uniformity index), QI (quality index), HI (homogeneity index), VGR (volume gradient ratio), DNR (dose non-uniformity ratio), LD (low dose), HD (high dose), PD (peak dose) and the intersource spacing.
RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 24 months (4-50) the rate of - usually transient - soft tissue necrosis (STN) was 11%, osteoradionecrosis (ORN) was seen in 7.6% of cases and local relapse occurred in 7% of cases. Univariate analysis shows a significant influence on the development of soft tissue necrosis for V85, and on osteoradionecrosis for HD and PD. In the multivariate analysis a correlation between soft tissue necrosis and QI was found. For local control a correlation with QI, VGR and minimal tube distance was found using univariate analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Using interstitial PDR-brachytherapy in head-and-neck-tumors the probability of local control and of the development of soft tissue necrosis or osteoradionecrosis is dependent on dose and volume parameter like the volume of the reference isodose, the high and peak dose values, on the homogeneity of the dose distribution, quantified by the quality index or the volume gradient ratio as well on the minimal tube distance."
17258958,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17258958/,"OBJECTIVE: To examine if food group consumption varies by differences in socioeconomic, demographic, and lifestyle factors in young adults from a semirural setting in Louisiana.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional.
SUBJECTS: Young adults (n=1,266, 74% European American, 26% African American; 39% men, 61% women) aged 20 to 38 years, enrolled in the Bogalusa Heart Study.
MEASURES: Food group consumption was assessed by a food frequency questionnaire. Socioeconomic (eg, income and education), demographic (eg, age, sex, and ethnicity), and lifestyle (eg, marital status and physical activity) information was obtained by a self-administered questionnaire and the subjects were stratified according to these groups.
STATISTICAL ANALYSES: Analysis of covariance (adjusted for covariates) was used to detect differences in the mean servings of food groups consumed per day between the various socioeconomic, demographic, and lifestyle groups.
RESULTS: Compared to income<or=$15,000, those with an income>$45,000 had lower consumption of burgers/sandwiches (P<0.05) and those with income levels from $30,001 to $45,000 had lower consumption of mixed dishes (P<0.05). Intake of cereals/breads (P<0.05), dairy products (P<0.01), fruits/100% fruit juices (P<0.001), and vegetables (P<0.001) was higher in subjects with >12 years of education. European-American men consumed more servings of dairy products (P<0.05) and sweetened beverages (P<0.05) than African-American men. European-American women consumed more servings of dairy products (P<0.05), vegetables (P<0.05), and fats (P<0.05) than African-American women. African Americans (men and women) consumed more servings of fruits/100% fruit juices (P<0.0001) than European Americans (men and women), respectively. Married individuals consumed more servings of snacks/desserts (P<0.05), but fewer servings of alcoholic beverages (P<0.0001) than those who were unmarried. Active individuals consumed more servings of fruits/100% fruit juices (P<0.05) and fewer servings of burgers/sandwiches (P<0.05) than inactive individuals.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that food group consumption varies by socioeconomic, demographic, and lifestyle factors in young adults from a semirural setting. Food and nutrition professionals who encounter diverse populations need to consider the influence of income, education, sex, ethnicity, marital status, and physical activity on food consumption patterns when planning diets, nutrition education programs, and interventions for young adults."
17259505,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17259505/,"OBJECTIVE: The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) proposes that central obesity is an ""essential"" component of the metabolic syndrome, while the American Heart Association/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (AHA/NHLBI) proposes that central obesity is an ""optional"" component. This study examines the effect of the metabolic syndrome with and without central obesity in an Asian population with ischemic heart disease (IHD).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: From the population-based cohort study (baseline 1992-1995), 4,334 healthy individuals were grouped by the presence or absence of the metabolic syndrome and central obesity and followed up for an average of 9.6 years by linkage with three national registries. Cox's proportional hazards model was used to obtain adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for risk of a first IHD event.
RESULTS: The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 17.7% by IDF criteria and 26.2% by AHA/NHLBI criteria using Asian waist circumference cutoff points for central obesity. Asian Indians had higher rates than Chinese and Malays. There were 135 first IHD events. Compared with individuals without metabolic syndrome, those with central obesity/metabolic syndrome and no central obesity/metabolic syndrome were at significantly increased risk of IHD, with adjusted HRs of 2.8 (95% CI 1.8-4.2) and 2.5 (1.5-4.0), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Having metabolic syndrome either with or without central obesity confers IHD risk. However, having central obesity as an ""optional"" rather than ""essential"" criterion identifies more individuals at risk of IHD in this Asian cohort."
17259507,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17259507/,"OBJECTIVE: We examined whether biomarkers of endothelial function, fibrinolysis/thrombosis and adiponectin, predict the progression from normal to pre-diabetes more strongly among women than men over 6 years of follow-up from the Western New York Health Study.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In 2002-2004, 1,455 participants from the Western New York Health Study, who were free of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease at baseline (1996-2001), were selected for reexamination. An incident case of pre-diabetes was defined as fasting glucose <100 mg/dl at the baseline examination and > or =100 and <126 mg/dl at the follow-up examination. Biomarkers of endothelial function (E-selectin and soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1 [sICAM-1]), fibrinolysis/thrombosis (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 [PAI-1]), and fasting insulin, adiponectin, and inflammation (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein) were measured in frozen (-190 degrees C) baseline samples.
RESULTS: Multivariate analyses revealed higher adjusted mean values of biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction (E-selectin and sICAM-1) and fibrinolysis (PAI-1) and lower mean values of adiponectin only among women who developed pre-diabetes compared with control subjects. Formal tests for interaction between sex and case/control status were statistically significant for E-selectin (P = 0.042), PAI-1 (P = 0.001), sICAM-1 (P = 0.011), and frequency of hypertension (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: These results support the concept that women who progressed from normoglycemia to pre-diabetes have greater endothelial dysfunction than men as well as more hypertension and a greater degree of fibrinolysis/thrombosis. Whether this relates to the higher risk of heart disease among diabetic women awaits further study."
17259904,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17259904/,"BACKGROUND: Better childhood conditions, proxied by greater height, are usually protective against ischemic heart disease in western countries. These relations are less evident in other settings.
METHODS: We used multivariable logistic regression to examine the relation of height to the metabolic syndrome and its components in a rapidly developed Asian population using a representative, cross-sectional Hong Kong Chinese sample of 2860 adults from 1994 to 1996.
RESULTS: Height was inversely associated with increased blood pressure (odds ratio = 0.74; 95% confidence interval = 0.58-0.94) and raised fasting plasma glucose (0.71; 0.55-0.91), but only after adjustment for central obesity. Central obesity was also positively associated with height (2.09; 1.67-2.62) for tallest compared with shortest tertile, confounding these relationships. The association between height and central obesity was much stronger in men than in women.
CONCLUSION: The relation of height to cardiovascular risk may relate to a society's history and stage of socioeconomic development."
17260317,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17260317/,"BACKGROUND: For prism correction of associated phoria (at 5-6 m viewing distance), Hans-Joachim Haase developed--among other tests--the prevalence test, which consists of a central fixation target and two triangles that appear stereoscopically about 1.5 m in front of or behind the fixation target; the vertex of each triangle is directed towards the centre of the fixation target. Only when both eyes contribute equally to the perception of visual directions do the triangles appear centred (equivalence), while any perceived horizontal offset between the triangles and fixation target indicates a prevalence of one eye. Provided that monocular vision is equal in both eyes, Haase interpreted ocular prevalence as being due to a small vergence error (fixation disparity with a shift of retinal correspondence). This vergence error indicates, according to Haase, a (not yet fully corrected) heterophoria. From practical experience, Haase developed rules for transferring ocular prevalence into equivalence with prisms (MKH). If equivalence has been reached, Haase assumed that the heterophoria was fully corrected.
METHOD: In 19 subjects we examined whether spherical and prismatic corrections reduce ocular prevalence. The perception of the subjects was ascertained with three methods: they were asked 1. to describe their perception orally--as proposed by H.-J. Haase--, 2. to make a drawing of their perception, and 3. to align the position of the stereo images to the central fusion target with a computer-controlled device.
RESULTS: Based on the group mean, the three methods did not reveal a consistent reduction of prevalence. Only in two individuals did the drawing and the computer-controlled alignment showed reductions of prevalence that were confirmed statistically on the individual level. However, it has to be noted that these two individuals not only received prisms but also a correction of their hyperopia and anisometropia.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of one eye is a common phenomenon in normal binocular vision (with the amount of prevalence often being different for triangles presented in front of or behind the fixation target). In only a few subjects can prevalence be reduced with prisms. Equivalence as reported by oral description (method 1) was often not confirmed by drawing (method 2) or by the computer-controlled alignment (method 3). As an explanation for the differences between methods 1, 2 and 3 we assume that the oral description of the test perception was influenced by imponderables such as the expectation on the side of the experimenter and/or the desire to please on the side of the subject. The present results do not support the prevalence test--as developed by H.-J. Haase--for the correction of associated phoria."
17260490,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17260490/,"AIMS AND BACKGROUND: A number of documents assess the need for quality assurance in radiotherapy, which must be constantly monitored and possibly improved. In this regard, a system that confirms the quality of a department has been suggested and quality indicators have been used to improve the quality of the service. The National Health Service (Istituto Superiore di Sanità) approved a National Research Project to increase the quality of radiotherapy. The aim of the present study was to analyze the practical feasibility and efficacy of the quality indicators elaborated by the National Health Service study group in a radiotherapy unit.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The voluntary accredited program was carried out by the Radiotherapy Department of IRCC in Candiolo from June to August 2002. We analyzed 8 of the 13 indicators according to the National Health Service Project. For this purpose, 133 consecutive patients treated in our Unit were analyzed, and the results are reported according to the appropriate indicator (number of staff related to patients treated, waiting list, case history accuracy, multidisciplinary approach, number of treatment plans performed by CT, number of fields per fraction, number of portal imaging performed per overall treatment, and patient satisfaction).
RESULTS: The number of professional staff related to the number of patients treated was easy to calculate and it could be the basis for further evaluation. The overall waiting time was 55.4 days, and it changed for different radiotherapy goals. We obtained 80% conformity in case-history accuracy. The number of multidisciplinary consultations performed ranged between 50% and 100%. The number of CT plans was about 1.6 +/- 0.9 plans per patient. The mean number of fields performed per day and per patient is 3.5 +/- 1.7 and was in agreement with the fact that more than 50% of treatments in our Center were performed with conformal radiotherapy. An average of 16.7 +/- 10.0 portal imaging per case was performed. The percentage of patient satisfaction with the staff obtained a very high compliance.
CONCLUSIONS: The self evaluation promoted by the National Health Service Project allows the monitoring of the activities of the service in order to asses critical factors and it can be the starting point to improve the quality of the service and to compare national and international quality assurance results."
17261213,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17261213/,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: This study follows up an initial audit in 1992 indicating that anaesthetic machine checking practices were often incomplete. The aims were to ascertain if there has been any improvement during this period with special reference to the latest guidelines.
METHODS: Following the Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland machine checking guidelines, a structured questionnaire, was used to interview 41 anaesthetists in the South West region on one particular day.
RESULTS: Despite 80% of subjects stating that they had read the latest guidelines recently, only one undertook a complete check and 39/41 (95%) performed partial checks (omitting one or more steps in the guidelines). Steps most commonly omitted were additional monitoring, ventilator function, availability of an alternative means of ventilation and function of ancillary equipment such as laryngoscopes. Only 5/41 subjects performed any check between cases. Several of these checks have been introduced in the 2004 guidelines.
CONCLUSIONS: Although there has been a significant increase in the proportion of anaesthetists undertaking machine checks since 1992 (P = 0.0007), we conclude that machine checking guidelines are still poorly followed, with checks specific to the latest guidelines most likely to be omitted."
17261478,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17261478/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether electronic media exposure is associated with decreased parental reading and teaching activities in the homes of preschool children.
METHODS: A convenience sample presenting for well-child care to an urban hospital pediatric clinic was enrolled. Inclusion criteria were: child's age 3 to 5 years and not yet in kindergarten. Electronic media exposure (TV, movies/video, computer/video games) was assessed with a 24-hour recall diary and characterized on the basis of industry ratings. Reading aloud and teaching activities were assessed with the StimQ-Preschool READ and PIDA (Parental Involvement in Developmental Advance) subscales, respectively.
RESULTS: A total of 77 families were assessed. Children were exposed to a mean (SD) of 200.8 (128.9) minutes per day of media, including 78.2 (63.7) minutes of educational young child-oriented, 62.0 (65.6) minutes of noneducational young child-oriented, 14.8 (41.4) minutes of school age/teen-oriented, and 29.2 (56.6) minutes of adult-oriented media, as well as to 16.6 (47.5) minutes of media of unknown type. A total of 79.2% watched 2 or more hours per day. Noneducational young child-oriented exposure was associated with fewer reading (semipartial correlation coefficient [SR] = -0.24, P = .02) and teaching (SR = -0.27, P = .01) activities; similar relationships were not found for other media categories. Children exposed to 2 or more hours of total electronic media per day had 1.6 (95% confidence interval, 0.4-2.9) fewer days per week of reading than children exposed to less than 2 hours (SR = -0.27, P = .01).
CONCLUSIONS: This study found an association between increased exposure to noneducational young child-oriented media and decreased teaching and reading activities in the home. This association represents a mechanism by which media exposure could adversely affect development."
17262180,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17262180/,"BACKGROUND: Proper timing of stabilization for spinal injuries is discussed controversially. Whereas early repair of long bone fractures is known to reduce complications, few studies exist that investigate this issue in acute spinal trauma. In particular, the importance of coexisting lung injuries has to be determined, as it might influence clinical course and outcome.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We investigated retrospectively 30 severely injured patients who were stabilized dorsally for fractures of the thoracic and upper lumbar spine. The mean Injury Severity Score (ISS) was 41 points. Patients were divided into two groups: group I: acute trauma/stabilization <72 h and group II: acute trauma/stabilization >72 h. All patients in groups I and II presented radiological or clinical signs of lung contusion.
RESULTS: The average duration of the procedures in group I was 199 min (115-312 min) and in group II 139 min (98-269 min). Intraoperative blood loss and P(a)O(2)/F(i)O(2)-ratio did not differ significantly between the two groups. The overall in ICU and hospital stay was significantly shorter in group I: 16 days (1-78 days) versus 24 days (7-86 days) in the late group II. Postoperative respirator therapy was necessary in group I for 15 days (0-79 days) and in group II for 19 days (4-31 days). The mortality rate was 10% in this series.
CONCLUSION: Our data provide further evidence that early stabilization of spinal injuries is safe in severely injured patients, does not impair perioperative lung function, and results in a reduced overall ICU and hospital stay. Further prospective randomized investigations are warranted to prove these results."
17262797,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17262797/,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) as consolidation therapy for children with high-risk Ewing sarcoma (ES) treated at The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids), Toronto.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The charts of children treated for high-risk ES (defined as metastatic at diagnosis or relapsed) between 1990 and 2005 at SickKids were reviewed. Forty-five children were identified. Twenty patients received ASCT after induction with vincristine, doxorubicin, ifosfamide, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide. Patients with resectable tumor or lung metastases underwent surgery and those with non-resectable tumors were treated with irradiation. Twenty-five patients were treated with conventional chemotherapy (CC). Primary metastatic patients were treated with either a local protocol or as per POG 9354. At relapse, patients were treated with topotecan, cyclophosphamide, then ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide (ICE). Local control was attained with surgery and/or irradiation.
RESULTS: Ten of the 20 patients treated with ASCT are alive (median follow-up 6 years), with 8/10 being in remission more than 5 years from diagnosis. The 3-year overall survival (OS) for ASCT was 59%, (95% CI: 36%, 81%) compared to 34% (14%, 53%) for patients treated with CC (P-value = 0.06). The 3-year event-free survival (EFS) for the ASCT was 39% (17%, 60%) compared to 32% (13%, 50%) in the CC group (P = 0.08).
CONCLUSION: ASCT appears to add some benefit to conventional multimodality therapy for children with high-risk ES. Randomized controlled trials are warranted."
17263601,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17263601/,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Multidetector CT angiography (MDCTA) is being used increasingly to evaluate vascular anatomy prior to donor nephrectomy. To improve the ability of MDCTA to predict donor renal anatomy, a novel protocol including four-phase imaging with three-dimensional reconstruction and maximum intensity projections (MIPs) was incorporated into the standard donor evaluation. The purpose of this study was to determine the results of this protocol.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy consecutive patients who underwent hand-assisted laparoscopic donor nephrectomy between January 2003 and September 2004 were reviewed. All MDCTA studies were examined initially by a radiologist alone, after which, a second preoperative reading was performed by a radiologist and the operating surgeon together. The two reviews were compared with the operative findings.
RESULTS: Using this protocol to detect the total number of renal arteries, veins, and ureters, the sensitivity of the initial radiologist was 97%, 100%, and 96%, respectively. These values increased to 100%, 100%, and 99% when the films were reviewed by a radiologist together with the surgeon who would operate on the donor. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in predicting supernumerary arteries, including early (< or =1-cm) arterial branching was 89%, 100%, and 97%, respectively after the single reading but increased to 100%, 100%, and 100% with the combined reading.
CONCLUSIONS: An MDCTA study with this protocol provides excellent anatomic detail prior to donor nephrectomy. Its ability to predict renal-arterial and ureteral anatomy is enhanced when the films are reviewed simultaneously by a radiologist and the operating surgeon."
17263602,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17263602/,"PURPOSE: We investigated the effect of pelvicaliceal differences on stone clearance after extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (SWL) in patients with solitary upper-caliceal stones.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The clinical records of patients with solitary upper-caliceal stones who underwent SWL between 1996 and 2004 were reviewed. After excluding patients with hydronephrosis, significant anatomic abnormalities, non-calcium stones, metabolic abnormalities, recurrent stone disease, multiple stones, and previous renal surgery, 42 patients with a mean stone size of 153.47 mm2 (range 20-896 mm2) were enrolled in this study. They were divided into three groups according to stone burden (group 1 < or =100 mm2, group 2,101 mm2-200 mm2, and group 3 >200 mm2). Upper-pole infundibulopelvic angle (IPA), infundibular length (IL), and infundibular width (IW) were measured from intravenous urograms.
RESULTS: Of the total, 29 patients (69%) were stone free after SWL treatment. The differences in the upperpole IPA, IL, and IW of stone-free patients and patients with residual stones were not statistically significant (P = 0.85, P = 0.89, and P = 0.37, respectively). Again, there were no statistically significant differences in terms of upper IPA, IW, and IL in comparing the three groups divided by initial stone size.
CONCLUSION: Upper-caliceal anatomy does not exert a significant impact on stone clearance after SWL for isolated upper-caliceal stones. To best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the effects of pelvicaliceal anatomy on SWL treatment for upper-caliceal stones, so there is a need for further investigations to confirm our findings."
17263931,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17263931/,"BACKGROUND: Guidance from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommends one or two questions as a possible screening method for depression. Ultra-short (one-, two-, three- or four-item) tests have appeal due to their simple administration but their accuracy has not been established.
AIM: To determine whether ultra-short screening instruments accurately detect depression in primary care.
DESIGN OF STUDY: Pooled analysis and meta analysis.
METHOD: A literature search revealed 75 possible studies and from these, 22 STARD-compliant studies (Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy) involving ultra-short tests were entered in the analysis.
RESULTS: Meta-analysis revealed a performance accuracy better than chance (P<0.001). More usefully for clinicians, pooled analysis of single-question tests revealed an overall sensitivity of 32.0% and specificity of 97.0% (positive predictive value [PPV] was 55.6% and negative predictive value [NPV] was 92.3%). For two- and three-item tests, overall sensitivity on pooled analysis was 73.7% and specificity was 74.7% with a PPV of only 38.3% but a pooled NPV of 93.0%. The Youden index for single-item and multiple item tests was 0.289 and 0.47 respectively, suggesting superiority of multiple item tests. Re-analysis examining only 'either or' strategies improved the 'rule in' ability of two- and three-question tests (sensitivity 79.4% and NPV 94.7%) but at the expense of being able to rule out a possible diagnosis if the result was negative.
CONCLUSION: A one-question test identifies only three out of every 10 patients with depression in primary care, thus unacceptable if relied on alone. Ultra-short two- or three-question tests perform better, identifying eight out of 10 cases. This is at the expense of a high false-positive rate (only four out of 10 cases with a positive score are actually depressed). Ultra-short tests appear to be, at best, a method for ruling out a diagnosis and should only be used when there are sufficient resources for second-stage assessment of those who screen positive."
17264202,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17264202/,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the change in prevalence of bioterrorism training among emergency medicine (EM) residencies from 1998 to 2005, to characterize current training, and to identify characteristics of programs that have implemented more intensive training methods.
METHODS: This was a national cross sectional survey of the 133 U.S. EM residencies participating in the 2005 National Resident Matching Program; comparison with a baseline survey from 1998 was performed. Types of training provided were assessed, and programs using experiential methods were identified.
RESULTS: Of 112 programs (84.2%) responding, 98% reported formal training in bioterrorism, increased from 53% (40/76) responding in 1998. In 2005, most programs with bioterrorism training (65%) used at least three methods of instruction, mostly lectures (95%) and disaster drills (80%). Fewer programs used experiential methods such as field exercises or bioterrorism-specific rotations (35% and 13%, respectively). Compared with other programs, residency programs with more complex, experiential methods were more likely to teach bioterrorism-related topics at least twice a year (83% vs. 59%; p = 0.018), to teach at least three topics (60% vs. 40%; p = 0.02), and to report funding for bioterrorism research and education (74% vs. 45%; p = 0.007). Experiential and nonexperiential programs were similar in program type (university or nonuniversity), length of program, number of residents, geographic location, and urban or rural setting.
CONCLUSIONS: Training of EM residents in bioterrorism preparedness has increased markedly since 1998. However, training is often of low intensity, relying mainly on nonexperiential instruction such as lectures. Although current recommendations are that training in bioterrorism include experiential learning experiences, the authors found the rate of these experiences to be low."
17264700,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17264700/,"PURPOSE: Patient-centeredness has been advocated to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in health care quality, but no empirical data support such a connection. The authors' purpose was to determine whether students with patient-centered attitudes have better performance and are less likely to demonstrate disparities with African American compared with white standardized patients (SPs).
METHOD: Third-year medical students were assessed by SPs at the Clinical Educational Center of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in 2002. One African American and one white actor were trained as SPs for each of four case scenarios; students were randomly assigned to interact with either SP for each case. Before the exam, students were surveyed about their attitudes towards patient-centered medicine. Students with and without patient-centered attitudes were compared with regard to their performance with African American and white SPs. Outcome measures were student exam scores in interpersonal skill, history taking, physical exam, and counseling.
RESULTS: All 177 of eligible students participated in all four case scenarios. With white SPs, students with patient-centered attitudes performed similarly to students without patient-centered attitudes in all four areas. However, with African American SPs, students with patient-centered attitudes performed significantly better than students without patient-centered attitudes in interpersonal skills (71.4 versus 69.4, P = .010), history taking (63.8 versus 61.1, P = .003), and counseling (92.1 versus 88.7, P = .002) and not significantly different in physical exam performance (73.6 versus 68.6, P = .311).
CONCLUSIONS: Patient-centered attitudes may be more important in improving physician behaviors with African American patients than with white patients and may, therefore, play a role in reducing disparities."
17264810,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17264810/,"BACKGROUND: Preemptive kidney transplantation (prior to the institution of dialysis) avoids the morbidity and mortality of dialysis; however, detailed studies of high-risk patients are lacking. The aim of the current study was to compare recent outcomes of preemptive (P) versus nonpreemptive (NP) living donor kidney transplantation with an emphasis on high-risk recipients.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 438 sequential solitary living donor kidney transplants at our institution between January 2000 and December 2002. In all, 44% were preemptive. NP recipients were dialyzed for 21+/-36 months (range 1-312 months).
RESULTS: Overall, three-year patient survival was similar in the NP and P groups. When stratified by diabetes and age >65 years, P and NP recipients again showed similar survival. Death-censored three-year graft survival was better in the P group (97% vs. 90%, P=0.01), but was not significant by multivariate analysis. Delayed graft function was more frequent in NP vs. P (10% vs. 4%; P=0.01), but other early complications were similar including: acute rejection, 16% vs. 11% (P=0.11); primary nonfunction, 3% vs. 2% (P=0.38); and wound complications, 19% vs. 17% (P=0.54). Glomerular filtration rate at three years was similar in the two groups (53+/-23 preemptive vs. 52+/-20 ml/min nonpreemptive; P=0.37).
CONCLUSION: With prompt referral and workup, preemptive kidney transplantation can be performed successfully in a large percentage of renal allograft recipients. Preemptive transplantation avoids unnecessary dialysis and should be emphasized as initial therapy for many patients with end-stage renal disease."
17265117,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17265117/,"BACKGROUND: Bowel function is an important outcome after rectal cancer surgery that affects quality of life (QOL). Postoperative bowel function is often assessed with QOL instruments, but their ability to detect functional differences has not been evaluated. This study evaluated the efficacy of the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Core (C)-30 and Colorectal (CR)-38 QOL instruments in identifying functional differences among patients undergoing sphincter-preserving surgery, grouped by clinical and treatment-related factors known to be associated with bowel function.
METHODS: A total of 123 patients who underwent sphincter-preserving surgery for stage I to III rectal cancer completed the EORTC C-30 and CR-38 a median of 22.9 months after restoration of bowel continuity. The global QOL, Social and Physical Function subscales of the EORTC C-30, and Gastrointestinal (GI) Symptom and Defecation subscales of the EORTC CR-38 were hypothesized to be affected by bowel function. Known factors associated with function (age, sex, radiation, procedure, rectal reconstruction) were used to group patients. Differences in the QOL scores between patient groups were evaluated (t-test or analysis of variance).
RESULTS: The global QOL was high, with a mean score of 76.84 +/- 18.6. The Defecation subscale detected differences in patients grouped by age (P = .002), use of radiation (P = .04), and procedure type (P = .05). However, the remaining subscales failed to identify any differences.
CONCLUSIONS: We found neither the EORTC C-30 nor CR-38 to be sensitive instruments in delineating differences in bowel function. The use of a validated instrument designed to assess function in patients with rectal cancer will more effectively and efficiently identify those patients with poor postoperative function."
17266748,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17266748/,"BACKGROUND: In many countries, community pharmacists can be consulted without appointment in a large number of convenient locations. They are in an ideal position to give advice to patients at the onset of low back pain and also reinforce advice given by other healthcare professionals. There is little specific information about the quality of care provided in the pharmacy for people with back pain. The main objectives of this survey were to determine the attitudes, knowledge and reported practice of English pharmacists advising people who present with acute or chronic low back pain.
METHODS: A questionnaire was designed for anonymous self-completion by pharmacists attending continuing education sessions. Demographic questions were designed to allow comparison with a national pharmacy workforce survey. Attitudes were measured with the Back Beliefs Questionnaire (BBQ) and questions based on the Working Backs Scotland campaign. Questions about the treatment of back pain in the community pharmacy were written (or adapted) to reflect and characterise the nature of practice. In response to two clinical vignettes, respondents were asked to select proposals that they would recommend in practice.
RESULTS: 335 responses from community pharmacists were analysed. Middle aged pharmacists, women, pharmacy managers and locums were over-represented compared to registration and workforce data. The mean (SD) BBQ score for the pharmacists was 31.37 (5.75), which was slightly more positive than in similar surveys of other groups. Those who had suffered from back pain seem to demonstrate more confidence (fewer negative feelings, more advice opportunities and better advice provision) in their perception of advice given in the pharmacy. Awareness of written information that could help to support practice was low. Reponses to the clinical vignettes were generally in line with the evidence base. Pharmacists expressed some caution about recommending activity. Most respondents said they would benefit from more education about back pain.
CONCLUSION: Those sampled generally expressed positive attitudes about back pain and were able to offer evidence based advice. Pharmacists may benefit from training to increase their ability and confidence to offer support for self-care in back pain. Further research would be useful to clarify the representativeness of the sample."
17266766,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17266766/,"BACKGROUND: The enhancer (Emu3') of the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus (IGH) of the channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) has been well characterized. The functional core region consists of two variant Oct transcription factor binding octamer motifs and one E-protein binding muE5 site. An orthologue to the Oct2 transcription factor has previously been cloned in catfish and is a functionally active transcription factor. This study was undertaken to clone and characterize the Oct1 transcription factor, which has also been shown to be important in driving immunoglobulin gene transcription in mammals.
RESULTS: An orthologue of Oct1, a POU family transcription factor, was cloned from a catfish macrophage cDNA library. The inferred amino acid sequence of the catfish Oct1, when aligned with other vertebrate Oct1 sequences, revealed clear conservation of structure, with the POU specific subdomain of catfish Oct1 showing 96% identity to that of mouse Oct1. Expression of Oct1 was observed in clonal T and B cell lines and in all tissues examined. Catfish Oct1, when transfected into both mammalian (mouse) and catfish B cell lines, unexpectedly failed to drive transcription from three different octamer-containing reporter constructs. These contained a trimer of octamer motifs, a fish VH promoter, and the core region of the catfish Emu3' IGH enhancer, respectively. This failure of catfish Oct1 to drive transcription was not rescued by human BOB.1, a co-activator of Oct transcription factors that stimulates transcription driven by catfish Oct2. When co-transfected with catfish Oct2, Oct1 reduced Oct2 driven transcriptional activation. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that catfish Oct1 (native or expressed in vitro) bound both consensus and variant octamer motifs. Putative N- and C-terminal activation domains of Oct1, when fused to a Gal4 DNA binding domain and co-transfected with Gal4-dependent reporter constructs were transcriptionally inactive, which may be due in part to a lack of residues associated with activation domain function.
CONCLUSION: An orthologue to mammalian Oct1 has been found in the catfish. It is similar to mammalian Oct1 in structure and expression. However, these results indicate that the physiological functions of catfish Oct1 differ from those of mammalian Oct1 and include negative regulation of transcription."
17267099,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17267099/,"OBJECTIVES: Noninvasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB) causes an enormous economic burden to public health systems due to its life-long character and frequent recurrences. While white light (WL) cystoscopy is considered to be the gold standard for transurethral resection of the bladder, photodynamic diagnostic (PDD) has been shown to improve final outcome. Escalating healthcare costs warrant increased effectiveness in treating noninvasive UCB. No data based on assessment of costs have been published to date.
METHODS: A series of 301 patients with noninvasive UCB were randomized prospectively to standard WL or PDD transurethral resections of the bladder. Intravesical adjuvant therapy was administered as reflected in the appropriate guidelines. Expenditures of subsequent procedures and PDD-associated costs were assessed.
RESULTS: Median follow-up was 7.1 yr. Disease recurrence was found in 42% and 18% of WL and PDD patients, respectively (p=0.0003). In the WL group 2.0 and in the PDD group 0.8 transurethral resections of the bladder were noted per patient. In the WL group 1.0 and in the PDD group 0.3 recurring UCB occurred per patient, resulting in costs of 1750 euro per WL patient versus 420 euro per PDD patient in the follow-up period, respectively. Because a single expenditure of 135 euro was assessed for PDD, overall costs were significantly lower (by 1195 euro) in PDD patients. As the median follow-up was 7.1 yr, costs saved by PDD per patient per year were 168 euro.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that PDD significantly cut costs related to recurring UCB. Further studies are needed from an economic point of view."
17267233,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17267233/,"BACKGROUND: Severe vascular disease is a relative contraindication to heart transplantation (HTx). We addressed the effect of vascular disease on HTx outcomes.
METHODS: This is a nonconcurrent cohort study of 402 patients who received HTx at our institution between 1985 and 2004. Pre-transplant vascular evaluation included carotid, lower extremity, and renal artery duplex studies, and CT angiogram when indicated. Patients with severe and nontreatable vascular disease were excluded. Patients were divided into Group 1: those with pre-transplant vasculopathy, and Group 2: those without pre-transplant vasculopathy. Group 1 had 24 patients with 25 vascular lesions: 1 aortic dissection, 2 abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)'s, 5 carotid artery stenoses, 1 renal artery stenosis, and 16 peripheral vascular lesions. Interventions were performed to 15 lesions prior to HTx and to 2 lesions after HTx.
RESULTS: Median follow-up was 5.5 years. Group 1 had higher incidence of ischemic cardiomyopathy (p<0.001), hypertension (p=0.028), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (p=0.004), and smoking history (p<0.001). There were no differences in sex, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, stroke, or renal dysfunction. Multivariate analysis revealed odds of post-transplant death in Group 1 was 1.4 (95% CI: 0.48-4.1, p=0.54) times greater than that in Group 2. Cox proportional hazards model for survival showed a 50% increase in the hazard of death in patients with pre-transplant vasculopathy, but without statistical significance. Group 1 had higher incidence of post-transplant stroke (p=0.001) but no difference in allograft coronary atherosclerosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Pre-transplant vascular disease seems to have negative effect on outcomes after HTx. Larger scale study is needed for further evaluation."
17267307,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17267307/,"BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease is a complex disorder influenced by environmental and genetic factors. A genome wide linkage study identified the myosin IXB (MYO9B) as a gene possibly associated with coeliac disease. Recently, a Dutch study reported a strong association of a single SNP, rs 2305764, of MYO9B with coeliac disease. However, two successive studies carried out on British and Swedish/Norwegian cohorts reported lack of association of the MYO9B variant with coeliac disease.
AIMS: The aim of the present study is to verify the effects of the MYO9B rs 2305764 polymorphism on disease risk in a Mediterranean population of coeliac children.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: To address this issue, an association study was performed in 223 (127 females) Italian coeliac children and adolescents and in 600 controls.
RESULTS: The allelic frequencies of the MYO9B rs 2305764 polymorphism found in our patients and in the population control were not statistically different (P=0.46).
CONCLUSION: The MYO9B gene rs 2305764 polymorphism is not associated to coeliac disease in coeliac children from Southern Italy. This is in accordance with the most recent reports. Ethnic differences or a false positive result might explain the discrepancy with the Dutch study."
8490480,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8490480/,"OBJECTIVE: To examine whether there are too many hospital beds in London.
DESIGN: Analysis of data from the Hospital In-Patient Enquiry, Mental Health Enquiry, health service indicators, and Emergency Bed Service.
SETTING: England, London, and inner London.
RESULTS: Hospital admission rates for acute plus geriatric services for London residents were very similar to the national values in all age groups. In the special case considered in the Tomlinson report--acute services in inner London--the admission rate was 22% above the value for England. However, the admission rate of inner deprived Londoners was 9% below that of comparable areas outside London. For psychiatry, admission rates in London roughly equalled those in comparable areas. When special health authorities were excluded, in 1990-1 there were 4% more acute plus geriatric beds available per resident in London than in England. Bed provision has been reduced more rapidly in London than nationally. Extrapolating the trend of bed closures forward indicates that beds (all and acute) per resident in London are now at about the national average. Data from the Emergency Bed Service indicate that the pressure on available hospital beds in London has been increasing since 1985.
CONCLUSIONS: Data regarding bed provision and utilisation for all specialties by London residents do not provide a case for reducing the total hospital bed stock in London at a rate faster than elsewhere. Bed closures should take account of London's relatively poorer social and primary health care circumstances, longer hospital waiting lists, poorer provision of residential homes, and evidence from the Emergency Bed Service of increasing pressure on beds. Higher average costs in London, some unavoidable, are forcing hospital beds to be closed at a faster rate in London than nationally."
8490819,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8490819/,"BACKGROUND: Differing survival rates have been reported between patients having undergone surgical intervention for the treatment of gastric carcinoma in Japan and Western industrialized countries. Through the actual availability of the data compiled at a major Japanese medical center (National Cancer Center, Tokyo), it was possible, for the first time, to compare the patients and therapeutic results of a Japanese center (n = 1475) with that of a German center (Department of Surgery, Technical University of Munich, Munich; n = 453).
METHODS: The prognostic factors involving both groups were compared. Survival rates were analyzed in univariate and multivariate fashions.
RESULTS: Some of the examined prognostic factors, such as sex, histologic type, tumor size, and Borrmann classification, were similarly distributed. Differences in frequency were discovered concerning pathologic tumor (pT), node (pN), and metastasis (pM) categories, localization, and age groups. Univariate analysis showed a 2-year survival rate of 88% for all Japanese patients with gastric cancer compared with 58% for German patients. The 5-year survival rates were 77% and 44%, respectively. The difference in the 2-year and 5-year survival rates for both departments may be related to differences in frequencies of several characteristics. In performing the same analysis in a multivariate fashion for the patient populations at both centers, it became clear that an important prognostic factor was the center itself. The survival curves of patients from Tokyo and Munich with the same prognostic factors demonstrate this difference. These differences, however, were small in comparison with those of univariate analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Using a similar classification of the tumor stage and similar prognostic characteristics, the prognosis for gastric cancer in Japan and Germany may be the same."
8490831,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8490831/,"BACKGROUND: The effect of alcohol intake on mammographic densities and the possible interaction between these two factors in regard to the risk of breast cancer were assessed using information from the Breast Cancer Detection and Demonstration Project.
METHODS: Mammograms taken during the first year of screening for patients whose breast cancer was detected in the 5th year of follow-up (n = 266) and their matched controls (n = 301) were blindly assessed for the percent of mammographic densities, which were measured by planimetry.
RESULTS: Among controls, alcohol intake was weakly, positively associated with the percent of mammographic densities (Spearman rank correlation coefficient, 0.09), although the association may have been the result of chance (P = 0.12). After adjustment for confounding factors, the lifetime alcohol intake did not appear to modify the effect of the percent mammographic densities on the risk of breast cancer (P for the interaction, 0.09).
CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal studies and larger case-control studies should be conducted to assess the relationship between diet and changes in mammographic densities further."
8490838,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8490838/,"BACKGROUND: Although radical cystectomy is accepted by most urologists as the treatment of choice for invasive carcinoma of the bladder and age alone is not considered a contraindication for radical surgery, many consider radical major operations to be unsuitable for elderly patients.
METHODS: The authors compared the results of radical cystectomy in 42 elderly patients to those in patients 69 years old or younger and to a group of 21 elderly patients, matched by stage of disease and severity of medical problems, who received alternative treatment.
RESULTS: The overall operative mortality rate was 6.3% (seven patients). Three (4.3%) postoperative deaths in the younger group and four (9.5%) deaths among elderly patients were recorded. The operative morbidity and mortality did not differ significantly between those two groups (P = 0.1). Among the patients who received alternative therapy, 13 (61.9%) died within the first 6 months, and only 3 survived more than 12 months. Morbidity was encountered in 97% of these patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The authors showed that radical cystectomy is a relatively safe procedure for elderly patients. The elderly patient who is thought to be unsuitable for surgery not only is deprived of his right to definite curative therapy but also is exposed to higher morbidity and mortality and worse quality of life than are those who undergo operations. The authors conclude that it is unjustified to avoid radical cystectomy in the elderly population on the basis of age alone."
8491003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8491003/,"BACKGROUND: Various prospective studies have found that lean hypertensive patients have greater cardiovascular morbidity and mortality than obese hypertensive subjects. It was therefore hypothesized that hypertension is more benign when associated with obesity. In the present study, we evaluated effects of obesity on early target organ damage in patients with essential hypertension.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In a total of 207 subjects, systemic and renal hemodynamics as well as left ventricular structure and function were assessed by measuring cardiac output (indocyanine green dye dilution), renal blood flow (clearance of 131I paraimmunohippuric acid), and mean arterial pressure (invasively) and by two-dimensionally guided M-mode echocardiographic findings. Systemic and renal vascular resistance, compliance of the large arteries evaluated by the stroke volume/pulse pressure index, and left ventricular mass served as parameters for early target organ damage. All individuals were categorized into four groups: lean and obese normotensive as well as lean and obese hypertensive subjects. In obese hypertensive patients, total peripheral resistance was significantly lower and stroke volume/pulse pressure index was higher than in the lean hypertensive group, almost reaching values of normotensive control subjects. No effect of obesity on the renal circulation was noted, whereas in hypertension, renal vascular resistance was elevated. The degree of left ventricular hypertrophy was more pronounced in the hypertensive groups than in their normotensive counterparts and progressively increased with obesity. Nevertheless, in obese hypertensive patients, left ventricular function, as measured by fractional fiber shortening and velocity of circumferential fiber shortening, was maintained despite the fact that the heart had been exposed to the double burden of an increased preload (obesity) and afterload (hypertension).
CONCLUSIONS: Obesity had a disparate effect on target organs in hypertension. At rest, obesity seemed to mitigate cardiovascular changes in the systemic vascular bed caused by hypertension. However, no such mitigation was observed in the renal vasculature, and left ventricular hypertrophy was even exacerbated by the presence of obesity. Our findings in part negate the concept that obesity is able to exert a protective effect on early target organ damage in hypertensive patients and, in particular, on the heart."
8491934,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8491934/,"BACKGROUND: The need for antimicrobials in the treatment of subacute sinusitis was evaluated in 96 afebrile children who were prescribed antimicrobial (amoxicillin, amoxicillin clavulanate potassium, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) or no antimicrobial medication in addition to a decongestant and saline nasal spray for 3 weeks.
METHODS: Response was determined by complete clearing of the initial radiologic abnormalities or in the case of mucosal thickening, by a significant decrease in thickness to < 6 mm within the maxillary sinuses associated with improvement of the clinical signs and symptoms of sinusitis. If there was evidence of partial clearing by radiograph, the same therapy was continued for another 3 weeks. Nonresponders demonstrated no change or worsening of clinical and radiologic findings.
RESULTS: Sixty-seven of the 96 subjects (70%) responded: 58 (87%) in 3 weeks and 9 (13%) in 6 weeks. Fifty-five of the responders were in the antimicrobial treatment group, and 12 were prescribed no antimicrobial medication. Twenty-nine of the 96 subjects (30%) did not respond to treatment; 22 received an antimicrobial and seven received no antimicrobial medication.
CONCLUSIONS: The number of responders and nonresponders was similar in the antimicrobial- and nonantimicrobial-treated groups (p = NS), and no single antimicrobial medication demonstrated greater treatment effectiveness."
8492400,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8492400/,"OBJECTIVE: To identify the extent to which meta-analyses currently include unpublished data and whether editors, meta-analysts, and methodologists believe unpublished material should be included.
DESIGN: This article describes two related studies: a literature review and a cross-sectional survey. SAMPLE SELECTION: For the literature review, we identified all articles indexed by the key word meta-analysis from January 1989 to February 1991 and determined whether unpublished material had been searched for, obtained, and included in the meta-analyses. For the cross-sectional survey, we surveyed authors of these meta-analyses, authors of articles addressing methodological issues in meta-analysis published during the same period, and editors of journals in which both types of articles were published.
INTERVENTION: We asked the respondents about their attitudes concerning inclusion of unpublished data and publication of articles from which data had previously been included in a scientific overview.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Inclusion of unpublished data and opinions about whether unpublished material should be included in overviews and whether prior inclusion of data in an overview should bear on publication.
RESULTS: Of 150 meta-analyses, 46 (30.7%) included unpublished data in their primary analysis. Of authors surveyed, 85% responded. Of the meta-analysts and methodologists, 77.7% felt that unpublished material should definitely or probably be included in scientific overviews; this was true of 46.9% of the editors. A total of 86.4% of the meta-analysts and methodologists and 53.2% of the editors felt that inclusion of data in a prior overview should have no bearing on full publication of original research.
CONCLUSION: While inclusion of unpublished data in scientific overviews remains controversial, most investigators directly involved in meta-analysis believe that unpublished data should not be systematically excluded. The most valid synthesis of available information will result when meta-analysts subject published and unpublished material to the same rigorous methodological evaluation and present results with and without unpublished sources of data."
8493001,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8493001/,"PURPOSE: When the optic disc has normal appearance with no abnormalities in routine automated perimetry, the subject is not considered to have glaucoma. The purpose of this study is to show how such patients may have localized retinal nerve fiber layer defects with corresponding functional abnormality.
METHODS: The authors selected eight eyes of eight patients who had a localized retinal nerve fiber layer defect extending within a few degrees from fovea but in whom the optic disc appearance and Humphrey 30-2 visual fields were normal. Of the eight patients, three had positive family history of glaucoma, two had suspected retinal nerve fiber layer abnormality in routine eye examination, two had increased intraocular pressure (IOP), and one had advanced low-tension glaucoma in one eye with a normal fellow eye. The authors examined the central 10 degrees visual field with 1 degree resolution using Humphrey perimeter and the Ring and Centring programs of the high-pass resolution perimeter.
RESULTS: A central field defect corresponding to retinal nerve fiber layer defect was found in six of eight patients: in both 10 degrees Humphrey field and Centring programs (2 eyes), in Humphrey only (2 eyes), and in Centring only (2 eyes).
CONCLUSION: The results indicate that retinal nerve fiber layer photographs are helpful in diagnosing glaucoma because early glaucomatous abnormalities cannot be excluded without nerve fiber layer photography. Currently available routine perimetric examination programs do not always detect very early functional damage."
8494066,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8494066/,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the pattern of affective psychopathology in families ascertained for genetic linkage studies through bipolar I probands to that in families ascertained through bipolar II probands.
METHOD: All available first-degree relatives (N = 266) of 48 bipolar I and eight bipolar II probands were interviewed with the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia--Lifetime Version by one of two psychiatrists who had attained high interrater reliability for bipolar II disorder and other diagnoses.
RESULTS: Bipolar II disorder was the most common affective disorder in both family sets. Forty percent of the 47 first-degree relatives of the bipolar II probands and 22% of the 219 first-degree relatives of the bipolar I probands were diagnosed with bipolar II disorder. On the other hand, only one bipolar I relative was found in the bipolar II families.
CONCLUSIONS: Bipolar II disorder was the most prevalent affected phenotype in both bipolar I and bipolar II families and was the only expressed phenotype in half of the bipolar II families. This suggests that bipolar II disorder is genetically related to but less complex than bipolar I disorder. Accurate diagnosis of bipolar II disorder may be crucial in finding the genetic loci underlying bipolar disorders generally."
8496420,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8496420/,"BACKGROUND: The cause of lichen sclerosus et atrophicus (LSA) is unknown, but on the penis it is associated with chronic occlusion, that is, phimosis. Microscopic changes of LSA were seen unexpectedly in two acrochordons.
OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to further characterize this phenomenon.
METHODS: A total of 449 acrochordons examined in our histopathologic laboratory in the past 2 years were studied for changes of LSA, and clinical data were collected.
RESULTS: Eight additional cases were found. All of the acrochordons exceeded 0.5 cm, and three were 1 cm or larger. At least six were under chronic occlusion or pressure. The dermal changes of LSA predominated over the epidermal changes. All showed collagenous homogenization, sclerosis, and inflammation. Elastic fibers were characteristically decreased.
CONCLUSION: These observations strengthen the evidence that LSA in flaccid skin may be caused by chronic occlusion."
8496459,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8496459/,"BACKGROUND: Dermatomyositis sine myositis may have various connotations. Controversy exists as to nomenclature, degree of evaluation required, therapy, and course (e.g., does true dermatomyositis of the skin only exist?).
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess prospectively patients with the clinicopathologic features of dermatomyositis and normal muscle enzyme serum levels to determine their course in terms of the onset of muscle disease.
METHODS: Thirteen patients were studied by complete history and clinical examination, laboratory studies, electromyography, and skin and muscle biopsy. They were observed for 1 to 6 years.
RESULTS: Patients were classifiable into three groups: (1) cutaneous changes only, (2) cutaneous changes only at baseline with subsequent development of myositis, and (3) cutaneous changes with normal muscle enzyme serum levels at baseline but with myositis demonstrated by electromyography and/or muscle biopsy specimens.
CONCLUSION: Significantly different prognostic and therapeutic implications are present in patients with dermatomyositis with normal muscle enzyme serum levels depending on the results of electromyography, muscle biopsy, and clinical observation."
8496531,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8496531/,"OBJECTIVES: This study was done to provide information on the potential benefit of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy regarding sudden and arrhythmia-related deaths and to examine whether such therapy improves survival.
BACKGROUND: Implantation of automatic cardioverter-defibrillators is reported to abort sudden cardiac death due to malignant tachyarrhythmias.
METHODS: Between 1989 and 1992, 107 patients were screened for implantation of a third-generation implantable cardioverter-defibrillator combined with endocardial leads. Mean age was 57 +/- 13 years and mean ejection fraction was 40 +/- 15%. Sudden death, total arrhythmia-related death and total cardiac death were compared with the occurrence of fast ventricular tachyarrhythmias (> 240 beats/min), assuming that most of these arrhythmias would have been fatal without treatment by the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.
RESULTS: The surgical mortality rate was 2.7% in all 107 patients and 1% in the 99 patients who qualified for endocardial leads. During a follow-up period of 12 +/- 8 months, actuarial survival rate free of events at 6 months as well as at 12 and 18 months was 100% for sudden death, 97% for total arrhythmia-related death and 95% for total cardiac death. In contrast, after 6, 12 and 18 months, the rate of survival free of fast ventricular tachycardia was only 83%, 74% and 69%, respectively, and the rate of survival free of any ventricular tachyarrhythmia was only 59%, 49% and 40%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The outcome of patients treated with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator and endocardial defibrillation leads is excellent. For many patients, this treatment is probably lifesaving."
8498431,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8498431/,"OBJECTIVE: In an effort to elucidate possible causes of preterm labor, we undertook a prospective study of 50 patients consecutively admitted with intact membranes and preterm labor who eventually had a preterm delivery despite the use of tocolysis.
STUDY DESIGN: A comprehensive evaluation plan was instituted. This included a detailed history and physical examination, targeted ultrasonography, amniocentesis for Gram stain, culture, and glucose determination, laboratory analysis for infection (complete blood cell count, urinalysis, and cervical and urine cultures) and for antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (antinuclear antibody, lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibody), pathologic examination of the placenta, and a urine toxicology screen.
RESULTS: The following groups of possible causes of preterm labor were identified: (1) faulty placentation, 50% (25/50); (2) intrauterine infection 38% (19/50); (3) immunologic factors, 30% (15/50); (4) cervical incompetence, 16% (8/50); (5) uterine factors, 14% (7/50); (6) maternal factors 10% (5/50); (7) trauma and surgery, 8% (4/50); (8) fetal anomalies, 6% (3/50); and (9) idiopathic conditions, 4% (2/50). Among the 50 patients two or more possible causes were identified in 58% (29/50).
CONCLUSION: We suggest that an exhaustive evaluation plan can identify possible causes in the majority (96%) of cases of ""idiopathic"" preterm labor that result in preterm delivery."
8498696,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8498696/,"BACKGROUND: Nurses are responsible for the collection of sputum samples for culture in most institutions, yet they receive little formal training on what a good specimen looks like.
METHODS: Three hundred thirty-three consecutively collected expectorated sputum samples and tracheal aspirates were examined to determine the relationship of macroscopic specimen appearance (watery, mucoid, mucopurulent) to specimen quality (good, fair, poor).
RESULTS: Of the expectorated sputum samples, 21% were watery, 65% were mucoid, and 14% were mucopurulent. Sixty-five percent of the expectorated sputum samples were good or fair, regardless of appearance. Eighty-seven percent of mucopurulent expectorated sputum samples were good or fair. In the remaining nonmucopurulent specimens, however, there were no predictable markers of specimen quality.
CONCLUSIONS: The only specimens that were predictably good were those that were mucopurulent yellow, yellow, or tracheal aspirates."
8499817,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8499817/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the sex differences in access to cardiac surgery observed in the United States exist in the United Kingdom.
DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of routinely collected data.
SETTING: South West Thames and North West Thames regional health authorities.
SUBJECTS: 8564 patients discharged from hospital with a principal diagnosis of coronary heart disease in 1987-8 in South West Thames region and 15243 discharges in North West Thames region in 1990-1.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Performance of angiography or coronary artery bypass surgery.
RESULTS: In all age groups and among patients with a principal diagnosis of either angina or chronic ischaemia men were significantly more likely than women to undergo revascularisation in both regions. Using multiple logistic regression to control for potential clinical and demographic confounders, the male to female odds ratio for revascularisation among all cases was 1.59 (95% confidence interval 1.25 to 2.03) in South West Thames region and 1.47 (1.32 to 1.63) in North West Thames region.
CONCLUSION: There appears to be a systematic difference in the treatment received by men and women in the United Kingdom. The reasons for this are uncertain."
8500719,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8500719/,"BACKGROUND: Patients with Crohn's disease have increased intestinal permeability, which may precede the development of clinical disease and be involved in disease pathogenesis. Subsequent studies have suggested that, as a group, first-degree relatives of patients with Crohn's disease do not have significantly increased small intestinal permeability rates. The present study proposes that conventional data analysis, used in these studies, may be inappropriate and has overlooked an important observation.
METHODS: Lactulose and mannitol permeabilities were defined in healthy controls and in patients with Crohn's disease and their first-degree relatives.
RESULTS: Intestinal permeability in relatives was similar to that in the control group, but a subpopulation had abnormally high permeability rates in the absence of clinical evidence for disease. Raw data from another investigator confirmed this finding in an additional study; consequently, it is concluded that the original hypothesis is still viable. A small proportion of individuals, at high risk of developing Crohn's disease, have increased intestinal permeability.
CONCLUSIONS: Increased intestinal permeability may precede clinical manifestations of Crohn's disease."
8503994,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8503994/,"PROBLEM: Is an additional immunotherapy necessary or not for patients who have obtained successful results after initial immunotherapy?
METHODS: The successive pregnancy outcome was analyzed in 22 patients out of 29 unexplained recurrent aborters who had undergone immunotherapy with their husband's lymphocytes according to our previously reported protocol (Takakuwa et al., Am J Reprod Immunol Microbiol. 10:1-9, 1986; Takakuwa et al., Am J Reprod Immunol. 23:37-41, 1990) and had obtained successful outcome between January 1983 and December 1989. In addition, the alteration of blocking antibodies (BAbs), which was evaluated by a one-way mixed lymphocyte culture reaction (MLR) blocking assay between the spouses, was analyzed in 26 patients out of 29.
RESULTS: None of the 22 patients underwent further immunotherapy because a significantly high titer of MLR-BAbs had been detected before the new pregnancy. In 19 out of the 21 patients (90.5%), pregnancy was successful.
CONCLUSION: Additional immunotherapy is not necessary for patients who have obtained successful results after the initial immunotherapy and are positive for MLR-BAbs after their first delivery."
8504513,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8504513/,"BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of blockade of the inwardly rectifying K+ current (IK1) in prevention of arrhythmias is unknown. We have examined the antiarrhythmic potential of a new selective IK1 blocker, RP58866, in rat, rabbit, and primate (marmoset) isolated hearts in the settings of acute ischemia and reperfusion.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In concentration-response studies (n = 12 per group), the drug reduced ischemia-induced ventricular fibrillation (VF) in rat from control incidence of 100 to 50%, 17% (p < 0.05), and 0% (p < 0.05) at 1, 3, and 10 mumol/L, respectively. RP58866 produced significant bradycardia at the 3- and 10-mumol/L concentrations and significant QT interval widening at all three concentrations (p < 0.05). When rat hearts (n = 12 per group) were paced (5 Hz) via the left atrium to prevent bradycardia, the antiarrhythmic effects of 10-mumol/L RP58866 were unmodified (ischemia-induced VF incidence was reduced by drug from 83% in control hearts to 8%; p < 0.05). Similarly, pacing did not prevent the drug's QT-widening activity at 90% repolarization (QT90 was 64 +/- 3 msec in control hearts versus 128 +/- 17 msec in the presence of 10 mumol/L of drug after 10 minutes of ischemia; p < 0.05). These values are similar to equivalent values in unpaced hearts (65 +/- 3 msec in control hearts versus 159 +/- 15 msec with 10 mumol/L of drug; p < 0.05). In separate groups of rat hearts (n = 10 per group) subjected to 10 minutes of ischemia, reperfusion-induced VF incidence was reduced from 90% in control hearts to 10% (p < 0.05), 0% (p < 0.05), and 0% (p < 0.05) by 1-, 3-, and 10-mumol/L RP58866. To examine whether drug actions were species-specific, we performed further studies in rabbit and primate using the middle concentration of RP58866 (3 mumol/L). Ischemia-induced VF incidence was too low in these species to assess the effects of the drug. However, RP58866 widened QT interval (p < 0.05), slowed heart rate (p < 0.05), and reduced the incidence of reperfusion-induced VF from 67% to 8% (p < 0.05) in rabbit. Furthermore, in the more clinically relevant primate species (marmoset; n = 9-12 per group), RP58866 (3 mumol/L) abolished ischemia-induced VT (36% incidence in control hearts; p < 0.05) and significantly reduced the incidence of ischemia-induced ventricular premature beats from 91% to 33% (p < 0.05). The drug was also effective against reperfusion VF in primates (incidence reduced from 64% in control hearts to 11%; p < 0.05). As in rat and rabbit, RP58866 significantly widened QT interval in primate and caused bradycardia before and during ischemia. RP58866 had no significant influence on coronary flow in any species. Finally, in further studies on rat, QT widening by RP58866 was found to persist relatively unmodified in nonischemic hearts perfused with solution containing K+ elevated to 8 mmol/L to mimic the early ischemic milieu.
CONCLUSIONS: RP58866, a selective IK1 blocker, is a potent and efficacious new antiarrhythmic drug in ischemia and reperfusion in rat, rabbit, and primate. When tested in rat, pharmacological activity was undiminished by cardiac pacing or elevation of extracellular K+."

DESIGN: Case-control study.
PARTICIPANTS: Familial caregivers to community-dwelling elders.
MEASUREMENTS: Risk of malnutrition as defined by body mass index < or = 5th percentile of the national average for elders aged 65-90.
RESULTS: Compared with caregivers of elders without risk for malnutrition, caregivers to undernourished elders are significantly more likely to give elders protein supplements, to make foods accessible to elders, and to encourage and pressure the elder to eat.
CONCLUSIONS: Caregivers recognize gross signs of malnutrition in elders, increase nutritional care in response, and deserve some measure of support for their claims of health expertise."
8505785,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8505785/,"PURPOSE: Graft thrombectomy is often an effective method for restoring inflow in an occluded limb of an aortobifemoral graft. A major determinant for its success is the completeness of thrombus removal from the graft, verification of which can be performed by angioscopy.
METHODS: A retrospective review since January 1989 identified 51 unilateral graft limb thrombectomy operations in 35 patients. At the discretion of the surgeon 20 of these procedures included angioscopic inspection of the graft for significant retained thrombus, which was found and retrieved in 11 (55%).
RESULTS: Visualization of the graft limb was very good, but inspection of the graft body was not possible. There were no angioscopy-related complications. Within the first 4 months after graft limb thrombectomy and reconstruction, four of 20 patients in the group inspected by angioscopy and nine of 31 in the conventionally treated group had reocclusion of the treated limb.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that angioscopy can be a helpful adjunct in the successful inflow management of aortic graft limb thrombectomy to verify the completeness of clot removal."
8505786,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8505786/,"PURPOSE: Risk factors for postoperative wound infection in patients undergoing vascular surgery may include age, comorbid conditions, wound classification, use of prosthetic grafts, and repeat operations. Groin incisions, in particular, pose substantial risk during placement of prosthetic grafts.
METHODS: To investigate the role of infected inguinal lymph nodes (LN) in groin wound infection (GWI), we excised an inguinal LN from 69 consecutive patients (89 groins) undergoing 36 infrainguinal reconstructions, 24 aortobifemoral bypasses, 12 extra-anatomic femoral bypasses, 11 vein stripping, and 6 femoral pseudoaneurysm repairs. LN Gram staining was performed, and aerobic and anaerobic cultures were obtained. In addition cultures were taken from any ulcerated or gangrenous lesion on the ipsilateral open extremity lesion.
RESULTS: Bacteria were isolated from 10 of 89 LN (11.2%) and included Staphylococcus species, gram-negative rods, diphtheroids, and Peptostreptococcus. Three of the 10 LN were taken from extremities with open lesions; seven were not. In no case did organisms cultured from a groin LN correlate with its corresponding open extremity lesion. Four GWI developed after operation (4%). In each case results of the groin LN cultures were negative. Three of the GWI were associated with an ulcerated or gangrenous lesion on the ipsilateral extremity (p = 0.08, odds ratio = 7.6), but in only one case did the organisms from the GWI correspond to that in the open lesion. The development of a GWI was strongly associated with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (p = 0.009, odds ratio = 22.9).
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, 11% of groin LN harbored bacteria, but none of these were associated with subsequent development of a wound infection. Instead, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and the presence of an open skin lesion on the ipsilateral extremity seemed to be associated with an increased risk of wound infection."
8506548,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8506548/,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We sought to find an explanation for the geographical variation in the incidence of nonfatal stroke detected in the FINMONICA stroke register during the period 1983-1985.
METHODS: Two separate investigations were made. In the first, a sample of approximately 100 nonfatal events drawn from each of the three monitoring areas (North Karelia, Kuopio, and Turku/Loimaa) participating in FINMONICA was recoded by an independent coder. In the second, 29 nonfatal events from Kuopio and 29 from North Karelia were recorded by the neurologist of the other area. Kappa coefficients (kappa) were calculated to measure the proportion of agreement beyond chance among the different coders.
RESULTS: A good level of agreement with the independent coder was found for each of the three areas; it was best for the cases from Turku/Loimaa (kappa = 0.896), followed by Kuopio (kappa = 0.792) and North Karelia (kappa = 0.616). In the second part of the investigation, agreement was higher for the stroke cases originating from Kuopio (kappa = 0.861) than for those from North Karelia (kappa = 0.563). In the latter there was discrepancy in the classification of the cases originally classified as no stroke.
CONCLUSIONS: The results from the first part of the investigation suggest that the lower incidence of nonfatal stroke in Turku/Loimaa was real, confirming findings in previous studies. Differences in data entry, rather than in the interpretation of signs and symptoms of stroke, were the main cause of disagreement in the second part of the investigation, where the disagreement primarily concerned the cases classified as no stroke in North Karelia. The results also indicate that the different proportions of patients submitted to computerized brain tomography conceivably account for a good part of the difference in the incidence rates of nonfatal stroke between Kuopio and North Karelia."
8506885,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8506885/,"PURPOSE: To identify the type, rate, burden, and pattern of contamination of boxed, clean but nonsterile gloves in our intensive care unit (ICU).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The fingertips of the first, middle, and last two pairs of gloves in 29 boxes in routine service in our ICU were cultured. The first of each of these three sets were removed aseptically, the second in a routine fashion.
RESULTS: We found 16 of 29 (55%) first pairs removed aseptically to be contaminated with a mean bioburden of 1.8 colony-forming units (CFU). The percentage contamination and bioburden did not change significantly with position in the box. Use of routine compared with strict aseptic technique increased the rate of contamination by only 11% (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.05 to +0.27 percentage points) and bioburden by only a mean of 3.4 colonies per pair (CI -0.51 to +4.90 CFU). The length of the time the boxes were open and in use was unrelated to whether the final aseptically removed pair was sterile or contaminated. The predominant organisms were coagulase-negative staphylococci.
CONCLUSIONS: One half the pairs of latex examination gloves in our ICU were sterile despite repeated barehanded access to the boxes. Those contaminated exhibited a small bioburden of low pathogenic potential. No pattern of contamination or unsafe duration of box use were observed. The use of boxed, clean, nonsterile gloves appears safe for routine use in an ICU."
8506890,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8506890/,"PURPOSE: To assess the effects of standardized garlic powder tablets on serum lipids and lipoproteins, glucose, and blood pressure.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Forty-two healthy adults (19 men, 23 women), mean age of 52 +/- 12 years, with a serum total cholesterol (TC) level of greater than or equal to 220 mg/dL received, in a randomized, double-blind fashion, either 300 mg three times a day of standardized garlic powder in tablet form or placebo. Diets and physical activity were unchanged. This study was conducted in an outpatient, clinical research unit.
RESULTS: The baseline serum TC level of 262 +/- 34 mg/dL was reduced to 247 +/- 40 mg/dL (p < 0.01) after 12 weeks of standard garlic treatment. Corresponding values for placebo were 276 +/- 34 mg/dL before and 274 +/- 29 mg/dL after placebo treatment. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) was reduced by 11% by garlic treatment and 3% by placebo (p < 0.05). There were no significant changes in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, serum glucose, blood pressure, and other monitored parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with standardized garlic 900 mg/d produced a significantly greater reduction in serum TC and LDL-C than placebo. The garlic formulation was well tolerated without any odor problems."
8506894,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8506894/,"PURPOSE: To determine how internal medicine house staff spend their days and compare activities during the day with those previously observed during night call.
SETTING: University-affiliated Veterans Affairs Medical Center.
DESIGN: Two internal medicine house staff teams (one PGY-1 [postgraduate year] and one PGY-2 or PGY-3) observed during 5 short call admitting days.
MEASUREMENTS: Time in each activity recorded by trained observers, computed, summed, and compared with that of similar activities of house staff on night call.
RESULTS: House staff admitted an average of two patients each day. They spent, on average, 25 minutes per patient performing new patient histories and physical examinations, 29 minutes charting new patient information, and were interrupted after an average of 12 minutes during the new patient evaluation compared with 20, 19, and 7 minutes at night (p > 0.05). The average house officer spent 44 minutes in nonphysician duties and 11 minutes answering pages during the day. On average, house staff spent 3 minutes each day talking in person with patients' families.
CONCLUSIONS: A significant amount of time each day was spent performing nonphysician duties. Little time was spent evaluating each patient or in person with patients' families and similar amounts of time were spent in charting and in patient evaluation. House staff appeared to spend more time with new patients during the day than they did at night, although this finding was not statistically significant. As noted during night call, evaluations were frequently interrupted. Future studies should examine why house staff choose to distribute their time in the manner described in this and similar studies."
8507073,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8507073/,"BACKGROUND AND DESIGN: We sought to test the hypothesis that warts are seen more commonly in individuals with eczema by analyzing skin examination data from a national birth cohort study of 9263 British children born between March 3 and 9, 1958.
RESULTS: Warts were seen less frequently in those with visible eczema at ages 11 and 16 years (relative risk, 0.60; 95% confidence intervals, 0.37 to 0.95; P = .03). This inverse association persisted after adjustment for potential confounders and was consistent within each age and sex group for children with a history of eczema who did not have visible eczema at the time of examination and for children with asthma/wheezy bronchitis regardless of eczema status. Visible acne or psoriasis was not associated with a decreased prevalence of warts.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings contradict previous suggestions of an increased risk of viral warts in atopic eczema and raise new questions regarding the role of cell-mediated immunity in atopic subjects."
8508403,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8508403/,"BACKGROUND: Besides the well-known association between endometrial carcinoma (EC) and unopposed estrogen, androgens also may play a role in this respect; however, previous studies on endogenous estrogens and androgens in patients with EC and control subjects have yielded mostly divergent results, probably because of the use of poorly defined control groups.
METHODS: Circulating steroid and pituitary hormones and sex hormone-binding globulin were measured in patients with EC and matched control groups of either patients with nonmalignant postmenopausal bleeding (hospital control subjects) and healthy, symptom-free women (nonhospital control subjects).
RESULTS: Patients with EC had higher serum levels of adrenal C21 and C19 steroids, estrogens, and biologically active testosterone than nonhospital control subjects, whereas the hospital control subjects constituted an intermediate group in this respect.
CONCLUSIONS: The results clearly indicate an altered steroid homeostasis, probably reflecting an increased ""adrenal drive"" in patients with EC. The results also stress the necessity of using strictly defined, healthy, symptom-free control subjects instead of the frequently used hospital control subjects when studying more subtile endocrine aberrations."
8509090,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8509090/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the variation in management of genital herpes by genitourinary physicians, and whether their duration of experience or gender influence their clinical management.
METHODS: A postal questionnaire was sent to UK consultant genitourinary physicians with detailed questions about management of primary and recurrent herpes. The gender and duration of genitourinary medicine experience of the physicians were also recorded.
RESULTS: One hundred and eighty two questionnaires were sent, 112 (62%) returned. Eighty-one (72%) physicians treat all patients with primary genital herpes, but physicians with more than 20 years experience were significantly (p < 0.05) more likely to treat only ""severe"" primary attacks. Most experienced physicians were also most likely (p < 0.05) to prescribe topical acyclovir. Prescription of suppressive acyclovir was also influenced by the experience of the physician, the least experienced physicians being more likely to prescribe to patients who were HIV antibody positive or to those entering new relationships, whereas the more experienced prescribed to those patients who were particularly anxious (p < 0.05 for each of these). Male physicians were significantly more likely to agree with the proposition that men cope better with genital herpes (54%) than female physicians (24%, p < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: The response to the questionnaire illustrates that management of genital herpes is influenced by the duration of the physicians clinical experience. Gender of the physician may have an indirect role to play as we have shown that physicians differ in their perception of how the sexes cope with genital herpes."
8511704,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8511704/,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Infertility after murine chlamydial salpingitis can be prevented by tetracycline treatment given before or at the time of infection. This study evaluates the efficacy and timing of tetracycline treatment and anti-inflammatory agents in the prevention of inflammation and subsequent infertility.
STUDY DESIGN: The left ovarian bursae and uterine horns were inoculated with the mouse pneumonitis strain of Chlamydia trachomatis. Mice were mated 54 days after inoculation.
RESULTS: Infected mice treated with tetracycline beginning 2 days after infection showed mild inflammation and no significant reduction in fertility. However, when tetracycline treatment was delayed until 5 days after infection, a moderate degree of inflammation and a significant reduction in fertility (P < 0.01) was noted. Treatment with ibuprofen, prostaglandin E1 (PGE-1), or hydrocortisone beginning day 2 post-inoculation did not significantly alter the degree of inflammation or subsequent fertility. Mean anti-chlamydial IgG titers were significantly lower in mice treated with either PGE1 or hydrocortisone compared with infected, untreated mice.
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that while early treatment of chlamydial salpingitis may prevent infertility, delay in treatment may result in significant inflammatory damage and infertility. There was no apparent benefit from the addition of anti-inflammatory agents."
8512100,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8512100/,"BACKGROUND: Preterm and ex-preterm infants are at risk for life-threatening apnea after general anesthesia. The authors attempted to define the postconceptual age beyond which apnea is less likely to occur and to identify the factors that predispose to postanesthetic apnea.
METHODS: Ninety-one infants younger than 60 weeks postconceptual age undergoing 101 general anesthetics were prospectively studied. All infants were admitted to the hospital for cardiorespiratory monitoring overnight. The presence of coexistent medical conditions that could influence the incidence of apnea was determined by a review of current and previous medical records and by history.
RESULTS: Of 38 procedures performed in 35 infants younger than 44 weeks postconceptual age, 10 (26.3%) procedures in 9 infants were associated with postanesthetic apnea. In eight of these, apnea did not resolve spontaneously: four infants required stimulation, and four required continuous positive airway pressure by face mask. Apnea occurred after 2 of 63 procedures performed in infants 44 weeks postconceptual age or older. Both episodes occurred in one patient who had neurologic disease. Of the remaining 61 procedures in the latter age group, 7 were associated with episodes of bradycardia (lowest heart rate was 79 beats/min) postoperatively without apnea. These episodes lasted up to 5 s, were not associated with apnea or cyanosis, and resolved spontaneously in all cases. All infants with postanesthetic apnea and/or bradycardia experienced their first episode within 12 h after surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: Ex-preterm infants younger than 44 weeks postconceptual age are at greater risk for apnea after general anesthesia than are infants older than 44 weeks postconceptual age. Based on these results, the maximum long-run risk of postanesthetic apnea in preterm infants older than 44 weeks postconceptual age is 5% with 95% confidence."

DESIGN: Retrospective case series.
SETTING: University-based IVF-ET program.
PATIENTS: Eighty-one patients in whom initial transvaginal ultrasound (US) study, performed at 5 to 6 weeks of gestation, identified more than one gestational sac. Total number of sacs was 191.
INTERVENTION: Patients were followed by serial US examinations.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Outcome of pregnancies.
RESULTS: Twenty-four empty gestational sacs were identified in 21 patients, of whom 15 delivered, 2 miscarried, and 4 are currently ongoing beyond first trimester. Of the 167 initially viable embryos, 9 (5%) underwent spontaneous fetal demise. In 5 of these 9 pregnancies, initial US identified significant interfetal size variation.
CONCLUSIONS: The rate of spontaneous fetal demise for a specific embryo in multiple gestation, after fetal heartbeats have been identified in early pregnancy, is 5%. This rate is similar to that seen in spontaneous conceptions. The chance of future fetal demise increases if first trimester interfetal size variation is significant."
8517565,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8517565/,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: To determine if the complications associated with skull base fractures are increased when nasotracheal intubation is performed in the field.
DESIGN: Retrospective, case-control study over a five-year period.
SETTING: A helicopter service returning to a Level I trauma center.
TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: All injured patients treated in the field who had either radiographic or clinical evidence of skull base fractures in whom nasotracheal intubation was attempted (38) compared with all patients with skull base fractures in whom nasotracheal intubation was not attempted (48) and a convenience sample of patients without skull base fractures in whom nasotracheal intubation was attempted (45). Patients with obvious midface motion on initial examination were excluded. Complications of skull base fractures were categorized as cerebral spinal fluid leak of longer than 24 hours and/or meningitis, cranial nerve injury, diabetes insipidus, and intracranial placement of the endotracheal tube.
INTERVENTIONS: Blind nasotracheal intubation was performed by experienced flight nurses.
RESULTS: There were no patients in whom an endotracheal tube was placed intracranially. There was no significant difference in complication rate between the two groups with skull base fractures (with nasotracheal intubation, 24%; 95% confidence interval, 11% to 40%; without nasotracheal intubation, 25%; 95% confidence interval, 14% to 40%). The group without skull base fracture had none of the complications usually associated with skull base fractures.
CONCLUSION: Patients with skull base fracture have a significant complication rate (25%). The complications associated with skull base fractures are not markedly increased by attempts at nasotracheal intubation in the field."
8518240,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8518240/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether antepartum X-ray pelvimetry (XRP) reliably identified women suitable for a trial labour or repeat elective caesarean section after one previous section.
DESIGN: A prospective controlled trial in which women were randomly allocated to either an antepartum XRP group who had XRP at 36 weeks gestation to determine mode of delivery, or a control group who had a trial labour without antepartum XRP. Following delivery, all controls had postpartum XRP.
SETTING: Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, King Edward VIII Hospital, Durban, South Africa.
SUBJECTS: Three hundred-six women with a history of one previous caesarean section.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mode of delivery, birthweight and maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity in the two groups.
RESULTS: In the antepartum XRP group, 23 of 144 (16%) of women delivered vaginally compared with 60 of 144 (42%) controls (P < 0.0001). Of the 84 women with adequate antepartum XRP only 23 (27.7%) delivered vaginally. In the control group, 33 of 60 (55%) women who had vaginal deliveries had inadequate postpartum XRP and would have had a caesarean section if this information was known in the antepartum period; 62 of 84 (74%) caesarean sections in the control group had adequate postpartum XRP. Birthweight of the infants was similar in the two groups. There were no maternal or perinatal deaths. Maternal morbidity was similar in the two groups. Neonatal morbidity was minimal.
CONCLUSION: Antepartum XRP is not necessary prior to a trial labour in women with one previous caesarean section. It increases the caesarean section rate and is a poor predictor of the outcome of labour."
8518640,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8518640/,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the validity, reliability, and acceptability of the short form 36 (SF 36) health survey questionnaire (a shortened version of a battery of 149 health status questions) as a measure of patient outcome in a broad sample of patients suffering from four common clinical conditions.
DESIGN: Postal questionnaire, followed up by two reminders at two week intervals.
SETTING: Clinics and four training practices in north east Scotland.
SUBJECTS: Over 1700 patients aged 16-86 with one of four conditions--low back pain, menorrhagia, suspected peptic ulcer, or varicose veins--and a comparison sample of 900 members of the general population.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The eight scales within the SF36 health profile.
RESULTS: The response rate exceeded 75% in the patient population (1310 respondents). The SF36 satisfied rigorous psychometric criteria for validity and internal consistency. Clinical validity was shown by the distinctive profiles generated for each condition, each of which differed from that in the general population in a predictable manner. Furthermore, SF36 scores were lower in referred patients than in patients not referred and were closely related to general practitioners' perceptions of severity.
CONCLUSIONS: These results provide support for the SF36 as a potential measure of patient outcome within the NHS. The SF36 seems acceptable to patients, internally consistent, and a valid measure of the health status of a wide range of patients. Before it can be used in the new health service, however, its sensitivity to changes in health status over time must also be tested."

DESIGN: Morbidity and health care utilization patterns were examined for a 12-month period using the claims administrative data from the Alberta Health Care Insurance Plan (AHCIP).
SETTING: General medical practice specializing in the treatment of addiction disorders.
PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred seventy-eight (73 male, 205 female) subjects were identified between 1987 and 1990. No members of the subject group were Natives, and none were dependent on chemicals during the study period. A control group, matched for age, sex, and family size, was randomly selected from AHCIP records.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number and type of health care services and diagnoses listed in health care claims classified using the International Classification of Diseases.
RESULTS: In 91% of cases, the chemical-dependent family member was male. Members of the subject group presented more often with mental disorders, digestive system problems, obstetrical problems, injuries, and poorly defined conditions. Also, they were more likely to have nonreferred visits, to have specialist visits, and to use laboratory services than population-matched controls. The subject group's use of specialists and laboratory services amounted to twice the cost of the control group's use of these services.
CONCLUSIONS: Results show that individuals who have a chemical-dependent family member use more health care services than the general population. Morbidity among the subject group appears to be similar to that among chemical-dependent individuals; diagnoses related to stress and trauma are common."
8520334,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8520334/,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of tuberculosis on mortality in patients with AIDS.
DESIGN: Community based cohort study.
SETTING: 52 centres in 17 countries (AIDS in Europe study).
SUBJECTS: 5249 patients who were alive and free of tuberculosis one month after the diagnosis of AIDS, enrolled between 1979 and 1989, and followed up until 1992.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Onset of clinically active tuberculosis or death, or both.
RESULTS: During a mean follow up period of 15 months 201 (4%) patients developed tuberculosis and 3889 (74%) died. Patients who developed tuberculosis survived significantly longer (median 22 months) than those who did not (median 16 months). This apparent survival advantage was due to patients who survived longer having more opportunity to develop tuberculosis (or any other disease). In models that took into account the time at which tuberculosis was diagnosed, the onset of tuberculosis was associated with a significant increase in mortality (adjusted relative hazard of death 1.34; 95% confidence interval 1.12 to 1.60).
CONCLUSIONS: The onset of tuberculosis in patients with AIDS predicts a substantial increase in mortality. Whether this increased mortality is directly attributable to the tuberculosis remains uncertain. If the association is causal preventive chemotherapy and aggressive treatment of tuberculosis could improve survival in AIDS."

DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial with each practice receiving one set of guidelines but providing data on the management of both conditions.
SUBJECTS: 24 inner city, non-training general practices.
SETTING: East London.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Recording of key variables in patient records (asthma: peak flow rate, review of inhaler technique, review of asthma symptoms, prophylaxis, occupation, and smoking habit; diabetes: blood glucose concentration, glycaemic control, funduscopy, feet examination, weight, and smoking habit); size of practice disease registers; prescribing in asthma; and use of structured consultation ""prompts.""
RESULTS: In practices receiving diabetes guidelines, significant improvements in recording were seen for all seven diabetes variables. Both groups of practices showed improved recording of review of inhaler technique, smoking habit, and review of asthma symptoms. In practices receiving asthma guidelines, further improvement was seen only in recording of review of inhaler technique and quality of prescribing in asthma. Sizes of disease registers were unchanged. The use of structured prompts was associated with improved recording of four of seven variables on diabetes and all six variables on asthma.
CONCLUSIONS: Local guidelines disseminated via practice based education improve the management of diabetes and possibly of asthma in inner city, non-training practices. The use of simple prompts may enhance this improvement."
26650423,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26650423/,"PURPOSE: While many studies on mood disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following childbirth have been conducted, little is known regarding posttraumatic growth (PTG) and disordered eating in the postpartum period. This study aims to (a) identify the typology of women following childbirth based on anxiety, depressive, PTSD symptoms and level of PTG and (b) evaluate whether these profiles differ on disordered eating symptoms.
METHODS: Up to 2 years after childbirth, 306 French-speaking mothers [mean age (SD) = 29.4 (4.6) years] completed questionnaires assessing PTSD, depressive, anxiety and disordered-eating symptoms and level of posttraumatic growth.
RESULTS: Four profiles were highlighted: a first one labeled growing cluster (22.2 % of the sample, n = 68), a second one labeled low level of symptoms cluster (37.6 % of the sample, n = 115), a third one labeled vulnerable cluster (21.6 % of the sample, n = 66) and a last one labeled anxious-depressed-traumatized cluster (18.6 % of the sample, n = 57). Our findings also highlight an impact of these profiles on disordered eating symptoms, suggesting that disordered eating in postpartum would not be the result of pregnancy.
CONCLUSION: Consistent with our expectation, our findings suggest a potential protective role of posttraumatic growth on the development of disordered eating symptoms. Further researches focusing on traumatic experience, disordered eating and posttraumatic growth in postpartum are warranted."
26650715,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26650715/,"BACKGROUND: Advanced imaging and serum biomarkers are commonly used for surveillance in patients with early-stage breast cancer, despite recommendations against this practice. Incentives to perform such low-value testing may be less prominent in integrated health care delivery systems. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate and compare the use of these services within 2 integrated systems: Kaiser Permanente (KP) and Intermountain Healthcare (IH). The authors also sought to distinguish the indication for testing: diagnostic purposes or routine surveillance.
METHODS: Patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer stage 0 to II breast cancer diagnosed between 2009 and 2010 were identified and the use of imaging and biomarker tests over an 18-month period were quantified, starting at 1 year after diagnosis. Chart abstraction was performed on a random sample of patients who received testing to identify the indication for testing. Multivariate regression was used to explore associations with the use of nonrecommended care.
RESULTS: A total of 6585 patients were identified; 22% had stage 0 disease, 44% had stage I disease, and 34% had stage II disease. Overall, 24% of patients received at least 1 imaging test (25% at KP vs 22% at IH; P = .009) and 28% of patients received at least 1 biomarker (36% at KP vs 13% at IH; P<.001). Chart abstraction revealed that 84% of imaging tests were performed to evaluate symptoms or signs. Virtually all biomarkers were ordered for routine surveillance. Stage of disease, medical center that provided the services, and provider experience were found to be significantly associated with the use of biomarkers.
CONCLUSIONS: Advanced imaging was most often performed for appropriate indications, but biomarkers were used for nonrecommended surveillance. Distinguishing between inappropriate use for surveillance and appropriate diagnostic testing is essential when evaluating adherence to recommendations."
26650823,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26650823/,"BACKGROUND: The National Reporting and Learning System (NRLS) collects reports about patient safety incidents in England. Government regulators use NRLS data to assess the safety of hospitals. This study aims to examine whether annual hospital incident reporting rates can be used as a surrogate indicator of individual hospital safety. Secondly assesses which hospital characteristics are correlated with high incident reporting rates and whether a high reporting hospital is safer than those lower reporting hospitals. Finally, it assesses which health-care professionals report more incidents of patient harm, which report more near miss incidents and what hospital factors encourage reporting. These findings may suggest methods for increasing the utility of reporting systems.
METHODS: This study used a mix methods approach for assessing NRLS data. The data were investigated using Pareto analysis and regression models to establish which patients are most vulnerable to reported harm. Hospital factors were correlated with institutional reporting rates over one year to examine what factors influenced reporting. Staff survey findings regarding hospital safety culture were correlated with reported rates of incidents causing harm; no harm and death to understand what barriers influence error disclosure.
FINDINGS: 5,879,954 incident reports were collected from acute hospitals over the decade. 70.3% of incidents produced no harm to the patient and 0.9% were judged by the reporter to have caused severe harm or death. Obstetrics and Gynaecology reported the most no harm events [OR 1.61(95%CI: 1.12 to 2.27), p<0.01] and pharmacy was the hospital location where most near-misses were captured [OR 3.03(95%CI: 2.04 to 4.55), p<0.01]. Clinicians were significantly more likely to report death than other staff [OR 3.04(95%CI: 2.43 to 3.80) p<0.01]. A higher ratio of clinicians to beds correlated with reduced rate of harm reported [RR = -1.78(95%Cl: -3.33 to -0.23), p = 0.03]. Litigation claims per bed were significantly negatively associated with incident reports. Patient satisfaction and mortality outcomes were not significantly associated with reporting rates. Staff survey responses revealed that keeping reports confidential, keeping staff informed about incidents and giving feedback on safety initiatives increased reporting rates [r = 0.26 (p<0.01), r = 0.17 (p = 0.04), r = 0.23 (p = 0.01), r = 0.20 (p = 0.02)].
CONCLUSION: The NRLS is the largest patient safety reporting system in the world. This study did not demonstrate many hospital characteristics to significantly influence overall reporting rate. There were no association between size of hospital, number of staff, mortality outcomes or patient satisfaction outcomes and incident reporting rate. The study did show that hospitals where staff reported more incidents had reduced litigation claims and when clinician staffing is increased fewer incidents reporting patient harm are reported, whilst near misses remain the same. Certain specialties report more near misses than others, and doctors report more harm incidents than near misses. Staff survey results showed that open environments and reduced fear of punitive response increases incident reporting. We suggest that reporting rates should not be used to assess hospital safety. Different healthcare professionals focus on different types of safety incidents and focusing on these areas whilst creating a responsive, confidential learning environment will increase staff engagement with error disclosure."
26650875,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26650875/,"STUDY DESIGN: This was a pilot, cross-sectional study. Its site was West China Hospital in Chengdu, Sichuan Province.
OBJECTIVE: An objective was to explore whether, in China, chronic low back pain (cLBP) characteristically is one symptom among co-occurring subjective symptoms. More basic objectives were to test a supplemented list of symptoms and to reconfigure findings from the literature on co-occurrence of symptoms so that they pertain specifically to cLBP. The governing metaphor was a constellation of symptoms in which cLBP is located.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: With the exception of small, isolated societies, previous studies of co-occurrence of symptoms were conducted in the affluent West. Although China's population is larger than the combined populations of affluent countries of the West, research on co-occurring symptoms has been neglected in China. Unknown is whether results from studies conducted in the affluent West may be extended to China.
METHODS: A survey with the supplemented symptom list was cross-culturally adapted into Chinese and administered to cLBP patients (N = 72) and normal controls (N = 102). Multiple regression analysis was used to determine the effects of covariates (age, gender, education) on symptom reporting.
RESULTS: cLBP patients reported higher median numbers of symptoms than normal controls, including total symptoms (9 vs. 3), musculoskeletal symptoms (4 vs. 1), and nonmusculoskeletal symptoms (6 vs. 2.5); differences between cLBP and normal controls were highly significant (p < 0.001). Covariates had a little effect on symptom reporting.
CONCLUSION: cLBP characteristically was one symptom in a constellation of symptoms. This finding came from one research site in China. Nevertheless, consistency between studies is notable, with findings from the affluent West supporting the finding from the Chinese site. The tendency to concentrate on a discrete clinical entity, cLBP itself, may obscure the constellation of symptoms. The more expansive view of cLBP has implications for clinical practice and research.

BACKGROUND: Drug eluting stent (DES) implantation is the treatment of choice for coronary artery disease (CAD) leaving only marginal indications for the use of bare metal stents (BMS). However, selected treatment populations with DES contraindications such as patients who cannot sustain 6-12 months of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) remain candidates for BMS implantations.
METHODS: Thin strut bare metal stenting in a priori defined subgroups were investigated in a non-randomized, international, multicenter «all comers» observational study. Primary endpoint was the 9-month TLR rate whereas secondary endpoints included the 9-month MACE and procedural success rates.
RESULTS: A total of 783 patients of whom 98 patients had AF underwent BMS implantation. Patient age was 70.4 ± 12.8 years. Cardiovascular risk factors in the overall population were male gender (78.2%, 612/783), diabetes (25.2%, 197/783), hypertension (64.1%, 502/783), cardiogenic shock (4.9%, 38/783) and end stage renal disease (4.9%, 38/783). In-hospital MACE was 4.1% (30/783) in the overall population. The 9-month TLR rate was 4.5% (29/645) in the non-AF group and 3.3% (3/90) in the AF group (P = 0.613). At 9 months, the MACE rate in the AF-group and non-AF group was not significantly different either (10.7%, 69/645 vs. 6.7%, 6/90; P = 0.237). Accumulated stroke rates were 0.3% (2/645) in the non-AF subgroup at baseline and 1.1% (1/90) in the AF subgroup (P = 0.264).
CONCLUSION: Bare metal stenting in AF patients delivered acceptably low TLR and MACE rates while having the benefit of a significantly shorter DAPT duration in a DES dominated clinical practice. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
26651157,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26651157/,"OBJECTIVE: Since acute otitis media (AOM) is the most prevalent bacterial infection in young children, the reliable exclusion of AOM by nurses might save physicians' time for other duties. The study aim was to determine whether nurses without otoscopic experience can reliably use tympanometry or spectral gradient acoustic reflectometry (SG-AR) to exclude AOM.
DESIGN: Three nurses were trained, who performed examinations with tympanometry and SG-AR. Pneumatic otoscopy by the study physician served as the diagnostic standard.
SETTING: Study clinic at primary health care level.
PATIENTS: 281 children 6-35 months of age.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Predictive values (with 95% confidence interval) for tympanometry and SG-AR, and the clinical usefulness, i.e. the proportion of visits where nurses obtained the exclusive test result from both ears of the child.
RESULTS: At 459 visits, the negative predictive value of type A and C1 tympanograms (tympanometric peak pressure >-200 daPa) was 94% (91-97%). Based on type A and C1 tympanograms, the nurse could exclude AOM at 94/459 (20%) of visits. The negative predictive value of SG-AR level 1 result (>95°) was 94% (89-97%). Based on the SG-AR level 1 result, the nurse could exclude AOM at 36/459 (8%) of visits.
CONCLUSION: Type A and C1 tympanograms and SG-AR level 1 results obtained by nurses are reliable test results in excluding AOM. However, the clinical usefulness of these test results is limited by their rarity. Type A and C1 tympanograms were obtained by nurses from both ears of the child only at one-fifth of the symptomatic visits. Key Points Acute otitis media (AOM) is the most prevalent bacterial infection in young children. Nurses' role in excluding AOM is unknown. Type A and C1 tympanograms (tympanometric peak pressure >-200 daPa) obtained by nurses are reliable test results in excluding AOM. With type A and C1 tympanograms, nurses could exclude AOM only at one-fifth of the symptomatic visits. The clinical usefulness of the exclusion of AOM performed by nurses seems to be limited."
26651283,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26651283/,"AIM: Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomies (PEGs) with or without a jejunal extension (PEGJs) are a well-accepted method of enteral feeding. They are associated with a number of complications, including the buried bumper syndrome (BBS). We aimed to identify risk factors for BBS, our current management strategies, and optimal timing for surgical treatment.
METHODS: Hospital coding and a database compiled by our specialist nutrition nurse were used to identify all cases of buried bumpers from January 2012 to December 2014 as well as all PEG/PEGJ devices inserted during this time. A retrospective case note review was performed for each patient with BBS to identify risk factors, management strategies, and outcomes.
RESULTS: Two hundred twelve PEGs and 22 PEGJs were inserted. Nine patients were identified with BBS. Patients with PEGJ tubes were significantly more likely to develop BBS (7/22, 32%) than those with PEG tubes (2/212, 0.9%) P<0.01. There was one death in the study group because of abdominal sepsis associated with an intraperitoneal PEG bumper 33days after BBS was diagnosed and before removal was attempted. All other patients underwent laparotomy to remove the bumper. Mean hospital stay was 22days postoperatively.
CONCLUSIONS: Buried bumper syndrome is a serious condition which warrants urgent intervention. We have demonstrated a higher than expected rate of BBS associated with PEGJ tubes. We hypothesize that this may be related to the jejunal extensions leading to difficulty in the usual maintenance regimen that all carers are taught after PEG/PEGJ insertion."
26651828,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26651828/,"BACKGROUND: Back pain is one of the most expensive health complaints. Comparing the economic aspects of back pain interventions may therefore contribute to a more efficient use of available resources. This study reports on a long-term cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) and cost-utility analysis (CUA) of two treatments as viewed from a societal perspective: 1) exposure in vivo treatment (EXP), a recently developed cognitive behavioral treatment for patients with chronic low back pain who have elevated pain-related fear and 2) the more commonly used graded activity (GA) treatment.
METHODS: Sixty-two patients with non-specific chronic low back pain received either EXP or GA. Primary data were collected at four participating treatment centers in the Netherlands. Primary outcomes were self-reported disability (for the CEA) and quality-adjusted life years (for the CUA). Program costs, health care utilization, patient and family costs, and production losses were measured by analyzing therapy records and cost diaries. Data was gathered before, during, and after treatment, and at 6 and 12 months after treatment. Non-parametric bootstrap analyses were used to quantify the uncertainty concerning the cost-effectiveness ratio. In addition, cost-effectiveness planes and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were performed.
RESULTS: EXP showed a tendency to reduce disability, increase quality adjusted life years and decrease costs compared to GA. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of both the CEA and CUA are in favor of EXP.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on these results, implementing EXP for this group of patients seems to be the best decision.

26651846,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26651846/,"BACKGROUND: The behavioral health care environment in the United States is changing and many experts expect seismic shifts in access, accountability and reimbursement policies. Students in professional psychology training programs will be called upon to administer, manage, supervise and deliver clinically sound as well as cost effective services. While in general, traditional professional psychology training curricula prepare students well for clinical challenges, most students enter the profession naïve to the economic, financial and business enterprise crucibles in the behavioral health care marketplace.
AIMS: This article examines the problem of such naiveté and offers several recommendations for improving graduate students' economic literacy. Moreover, the article argues that increased business and economic acumen may serve to close the research-practice gap in professional psychology.
METHODS: The article reviews literature pertinent to training psychologists and highlights pedagogical gaps.
RESULTS: Several recommendations for curricular development are offered. Specifically, adding courses in health care economics and basic business principles is suggested. Integrating cost-effectiveness analyses across all course content is proposed. The article also emphasizes both didactic and experiential learning opportunities.
CONCLUSION: Course work should be augmented with training opportunities at the practicum, internship, and post-doctoral fellowship level."
26651995,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26651995/,"BACKGROUND: Aboriginal peoples in Canada (First Nations, Metis and Inuit) are experiencing an epidemic of diabetes and its complications but little is known about the influence of factors attributed to colonization. The purpose of this study was to investigate the possible role of discrimination, residential school attendance and cultural disruption on diabetes occurrence among First Nations adults.
METHODS: This 2012/13 cross sectional survey was conducted in two Saskatchewan First Nations communities comprising 580 households and 1570 adults. In addition to self-reported diabetes, interviewer-administered questionnaires collected information on possible diabetes determinants including widely recognized (e.g. age, sex, lifestyle, social determinants) and colonization-related factors. Clustering effect within households was adjusted using Generalized Estimating Equations.
RESULTS: Responses were obtained from 874 (55.7 %) men and women aged 18 and older living in 406 (70.0 %) households. Diabetes prevalence was 15.8 % among women and 9.7 % among men. In the final models, increasing age and adiposity were significant risk factors for diabetes (e.g. OR 8.72 [95 % CI 4.62; 16.46] for those 50+, and OR 8.97 [95 % CI 3.58; 22.52] for BMI 30+) as was spending most time on-reserve. Residential school attendance and cultural disruption were not predictive of diabetes at an individual level but those experiencing the most discrimination had a lower prevalence of diabetes compared to those who experienced little discrimination (2.4 % versus 13.6 %; OR 0.11 [95 % CI 0.02; 0.50]). Those experiencing the most discrimination were significantly more likely to be married and to have higher incomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Known diabetes risk factors were important determinants of diabetes among First Nations people, but residential school attendance and cultural disruption were not predictive of diabetes on an individual level. In contrast, those experiencing the highest levels of discrimination had a low prevalence of diabetes. Although the reasons underlying this latter finding are unclear, it appears to relate to increased engagement with society off-reserve which may lead to an improvement in the social determinants of health. While this may have physical health benefits for First Nations people due to improved socio-economic status and other undefined influences, our findings suggest that this comes at a high emotional price."
26652034,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26652034/,"BACKGROUND: Australian mental health policy requires that mental health services facilitate meaningful and genuine consumer participation in all aspects of mental health services. Roles for practitioners who work from their own experience of significant mental health challenges and mental health service use have been implemented in many services to promote participation and the development of more consumer focused services.
AIMS: To enhance understanding of perspectives of individuals working in lived experience roles to more closely understand their experiences and opinions about these roles.
METHOD: A grounded theory study interviews were conducted with 13 lived experience practitioners.
RESULTS: The medical model was a core category arising from this work. Participants described the medical model as a prevailing culture within mental health services from their personal and professional experiences. This culture imposed a major limitation on the implementation, effectiveness and development of lived experience roles and themselves as individuals. It was also seen as a major limitation to the progress of Recovery orientated reform.
CONCLUSIONS: The development of Recovery oriented services requires a strong lived experience practitioner workforce, with appropriate resourcing and support available. The current medical model approach requires critique to facilitate reform and avoid tokenism."
26652591,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26652591/,"OBJECTIVE: Functional neurological symptoms (FNS) are hypothetically explained as a shift of emotion processing to sensorimotor deficits, but psychophysiological evidence supporting this hypothesis is scarce. The present study measured neuromagnetic and somatic sensation during emotion regulation to examine frontocortical and sensorimotor activity as signals of altered emotion processing.
METHODS: Magnetoencephalographic (MEG) activity was mapped during an emotion regulation task in 20 patients with FNS and 20 healthy comparison participants (HC). Participants were instructed to (A) passively watch unpleasant or neutral pictures or (B) down-regulate their emotional response to unpleasant pictures utilizing cognitive reappraisal strategies. Group- and task-specific cortical activity was evaluated via 8-12 Hz (alpha) power modulation, while modulation of somatic sensation was measured via perception and discomfort thresholds of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation.
RESULTS: Implementing emotion regulation strategies induced frontocortical alpha power modulation in HC but not in patients, who showed prominent activity modulation in sensorimotor regions. Compared to HC, discomfort threshold for transcutaneous stimulation decreased after the task in patients, who also expressed increased symptom intensity.
CONCLUSIONS: Reduced frontocortical, but enhanced sensorimotor involvement in emotion regulation efforts offers a trace to modeling a conversion of (aversive) feelings into (aversive) somatic sensations in FNS."
26652696,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26652696/,"BACKGROUND: Current evidence suggests that distinct scapular morphologies may predispose patients to a rotator cuff tear. The objective of this longitudinal study was to evaluate the relationship between symptomatic degenerative cuff tears and different radiographic acromial characteristics, including acromion shape, indices (acromial index [AI], critical shoulder angle [CSA]), and acromial spur.
METHODS: We divided 166 patients into 3 groups matched for age and sex: group 1, degenerative full-thickness tear; group 2, partial thickness bursal tear; and group 3, normal cuff. Patients were evaluated with standard radiographs and ultrasonography.
RESULTS: The presence of an acromial spur was strongly associated with a full-thickness cuff tear (odds ratio, 3.5; P = .001). AI and CSA revealed a statistically significant difference between means of group 1 (P = .006) and group 3 (P < .001). There was no statistically significant difference in means of AI between groups 1 and 2 (P = .695) and between groups 2 and 3, with respect to AI (P = .071) and CSA (P = .125). Receiver operating characteristic curve revealed a higher area for CSA (0.70) than for AI (0.61). Stepwise logistic regression rejected AI as a cuff tear predictor but confirmed CSA and a spur to be stronger predictors of a full-thickness cuff tear. There was no association between the Bigliani acromial type and rotator cuff tear (P = .06).
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of an acromion spur is strongly associated with full-thickness cuff tear. Higher AI and CSA are associated with a full-thickness tear but not with partial tears. The type of acromion is not related to cuff tear."
26652869,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26652869/,"BACKGROUND: Thoracolumbar burst fractures are common clinical entity encountered in neurosurgical practice, accounting for 10-20% of all spinal fractures. Clinical picture could be devastating due to severe neurological deficits which lead the patients dependent both socially and emotionally.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study compared two groups of patients who were operated because of thoracolumbar burst fracture secondary to spinal trauma in terms of neurologic deficits, degree of improvement, and radiologic measurements at one-year follow-up. The first group (group I) included the patients who underwent posterior total laminectomy, peroperative reduction of intracanal bone fragments, and posterior spinal instrumentation and the second group (group II) included the patients who underwent total laminectomy, and spinal instrumentation without reduction of free bone fragments.
RESULTS: Neither group showed significant correlation with any measurement parameter. Radiological assessments and clinical improvements did not disclosed significant difference between the two groups at one-year follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Retropulsion of free bone fragments extend the time of surgery and causes complications. This study found that there is no need to retropulse the bone fragments in the spinal canal in patients with unstable burst fractures who underwent total laminectomy and posterior long segment stabilization."
26653269,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26653269/,"INTRODUCTION: It has been postulated that the complex patterns of spinal injuries have prevented adequate agreement using thoraco-lumbar spinal injuries (TLSI) classifications; however, limb fracture classifications have also shown variable agreements. This study compared agreement using two TLSI classifications with agreement using two classifications of fractures of the trochanteric area of the proximal femur (FTAPF).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Six evaluators classified the radiographs and computed tomography scans of 70 patients with acute TLSI using the Denis and the new AO Spine thoraco-lumbar injury classifications. Additionally, six evaluators classified the radiographs of 70 patients with FTAPF using the Tronzo and the AO schemes. Six weeks later, all cases were presented in a random sequence for repeat assessment. The Kappa coefficient (κ) was used to determine agreement.
RESULTS: Inter-observer agreement: For TLSI, using the AOSpine classification, the mean κ was 0.62 (0.57-0.66) considering fracture types, and 0.55 (0.52-0.57) considering sub-types; using the Denis classification, κ was 0.62 (0.59-0.65). For FTAPF, with the AO scheme, the mean κ was 0.58 (0.54-0.63) considering fracture types and 0.31 (0.28-0.33) considering sub-types; for the Tronzo classification, κ was 0.54 (0.50-0.57). Intra-observer agreement: For TLSI, using the AOSpine scheme, the mean κ was 0.77 (0.72-0.83) considering fracture types, and 0.71 (0.67-0.76) considering sub-types; for the Denis classification, κ was 0.76 (0.71-0.81). For FTAPF, with the AO scheme, the mean κ was 0.75 (0.69-0.81) considering fracture types and 0.45 (0.39-0.51) considering sub-types; for the Tronzo classification, κ was 0.64 (0.58-0.70).
CONCLUSION: Using the main types of AO classifications, inter- and intra-observer agreement of TLSI were comparable to agreement evaluating FTAPF; including sub-types, inter- and intra-observer agreement evaluating TLSI were significantly better than assessing FTAPF. Inter- and intra-observer agreements using the Denis classification were also significantly better than agreement using the Tronzo scheme."
26653683,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26653683/,"PURPOSE: To determine the accuracy of imaging features, such as tumor dimension, multinodularity, nonsmooth tumor margins, peritumoral enhancement, and radiogenomic algorithm based on the association between imaging features (internal arteries and hypoattenuating halos) and gene expression that the authors called two-trait predictor of venous invasion (TTPVI), in the prediction of microvascular invasion (MVI) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This single-center retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board, and the requirement for informed consent was waived. One hundred twenty-five patients (median age, 63 years; interquartile range, 53-71 years) with a diagnosis of HCC and indications for hepatic resection were included. Two observers independently reviewed radiologic images to evaluate the following features for MVI: maximum diameter, number of lesions, tumor margins, TTPVI, and peritumoral enhancement. Interobserver agreement was checked, and diagnostic accuracy of radiologic features was investigated.
RESULTS: The total number of HCC nodules was 140. Large tumor size, nonsmooth tumor margins, TTPVI, and peritumoral enhancement were significantly related to the presence of MVI (P < .05 in all cases and for both observers). Multinodularity was not significantly related (P = .158). Moreover, the diagnostic accuracy of the three ""worrisome"" radiologic features (nonsmooth tumor margins, peritumoral enhancement, and TTPVI) was associated with tumor size: The negative predictive value of the absence of worrisome features decreased from 0.84 for observer 1 and 0.91 for observer 2 for tumors smaller than 2 cm to 0.56 and 0.71, respectively, for tumors larger than 5 cm, whereas the presence of all three worrisome features returned to a positive predictive value of 0.95 for observer 1 and 0.96 for observer 2 independent of tumor size, with no significant interobserver differences (P > .10).
CONCLUSION: ""Worrisome"" imaging features, such as tumor dimension, nonsmooth tumor margins, peritumoral enhancement, and TTPVI, have high accuracy in the prediction of MVI in HCC."
26653895,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26653895/,"BACKGROUND: Bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) improves the likelihood of survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), yet it is performed in only 30% of cases. The 2010 guidelines promote chest-compression-only bystander CPR-a change intended to increase willingness to provide CPR.
OBJECTIVES: 1) To determine whether the Canadian general public is more willing to perform chest-compression-only CPR compared to traditional CPR; 2) to characterize public knowledge of OHCA; and 3) to identify barriers and facilitators to bystander CPR.
METHODS: A 32-item survey assessing resuscitation knowledge, and willingness to provide CPR were disseminated in five Canadian regions. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize response distribution. Logistic regression analysis was applied to assess shifts in intention to provide CPR.
RESULTS: A total of 428 completed surveys were analysed. When presented with a scenario of being a bystander in an OHCA, a greater proportion of respondents were willing to provide chest-compression-only CPR compared to traditional CPR for all victims (61.5% v. 39.7%, p<0.001), when the victim was a stranger (55.1% v. 38.8%, p<0.001), or when the victim was an unkempt individual (47.9% v. 28.5%, p<0.001). When asked to describe an OHCA, 41.4% said the heart stopped beating, and 20.8% said it was a heart attack. Identified barriers and facilitators included fear of litigation and lack of skill confidence.
CONCLUSIONS: This study identified gaps in knowledge, which may impair the ability of bystanders to act in OHCA. Most respondents expressed greater willingness to provide chest-compression-only CPR, but this was mediated by victim characteristics, skill confidence, and recognition of a cardiac arrest."
26653987,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26653987/,"OBJECTIVES: The relationship between infant behaviors during routine immunization, pre- and post-needle, and infant attachment was explored.
METHODS: A total of 130 parent-infant dyads were recruited from a larger longitudinal study and videotaped during routine immunization at 12 months and the Strange Situation Procedure (SSP) at 14 months. Six infant behaviors were coded for 1-minute pre-needle and 3-minutes post-needle. Attachment was operationalized according to the secure/avoidant/resistant/disorganized categories.
RESULTS: As expected, none of the pre-needle behaviors predicted attachment. Proximity-seeking post-needle significantly discriminated attachment categorizations. Secure infants were more likely to seek proximity to caregivers post-needle in comparison with avoidant and disorganized infants. Proximity-seeking following immunization was positively correlated with proximity-seeking during the SSP and negatively correlated with avoidance and disorganization during the SSP.
CONCLUSIONS: Infant proximity-seeking during immunization is associated with attachment security and parallels behaviors observed during the SSP. More research is needed to identify behavioral markers of disorganization."
26654106,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26654106/,"BACKGROUND: The China's 1-3-7 strategy was initiated and extensively adopted in different types of counties (geographic regions) for reporting of malaria cases within 1 day, their confirmation and investigation within 3 days, and the appropriate public health response to prevent further transmission within 7 days. Assessing the level of compliance to the 1-3-7 strategy at the county level is a first step towards determining whether the surveillance and response strategy is happening according to plan. This study assessed if the time-bound targets of the 1-3-7 strategy were being sustained over time. Such information would be useful to improve implementation of the 1-3-7 strategy in China.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study involved country-wide programmatic data for the period January 1st 2013 to June 30th 2014. Data variables were extracted from the national malaria information system and included socio-demographic information, type of county, date of diagnosis, date of reporting, date of case investigation, case classification (indigenous, or imported, or unknown), focus investigation, date of reactive case detection (RACD), and date of indoor residual spraying (IRS). Summary statistics and proportions were used and comparisons between groups were assessed using the chi-square test. Level of significance was set at a P-value ≤ 0.05.
RESULTS: Of a total of 5,688 malaria cases from 731 counties, there were 55 (1 %) indigenous cases (only in Type 1 and Type 2 counties) and 5,633 (99 %) imported cases from all types of counties. There was no delay in reporting malaria cases by type of county. In terms of case investigation, 97.5 % cases were investigated within 3 days with the proportion of delays (1.5 %) in type 2 counties, being significantly lower than type 1 counties (4.1 %). Regarding active foci, 96.4 % were treated by RACD and/or IRS.
CONCLUSIONS: The performance of 1-3-7 strategy was encouraging but identified some challenges that if addressed can further improve implementation."
26654349,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26654349/,"BACKGROUND: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a major factor for the occurrence of cardiovascular events. Causal factors for MetS are not well defined or yet unidentified. Preliminary investigations suggest that infections and inflammation may be involved in the etiology of this syndrome. This study aims to estimate the association between the severity of periodontitis (exposure) and MetS (outcome).
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 419 participants recruited from the Diabetes and Hypertensive Treatment Center, Feira de Santana, Bahia, Brazil. After administration of a questionnaire, general and oral clinical examination and laboratory tests were performed. Diagnosis of periodontitis and MetS was performed according to various criteria. The analysis of the effect of periodontitis on MetS used logistic regression analysis with adjustment for confounders.
RESULTS: The prevalence of periodontitis was found to be between 34.61% and 55.37%, depending on the classification definitions used, and the prevalence of MetS ranged from 60.86% to 67.06%. In the group with periodontitis, 14.08% had severe and 41.29% had moderate levels of periodontitis. There was an association between severe periodontitis and MetS after adjustment for sex, age, household density, alcoholic beverage consumption, smoking habit, and cardiovascular disease (odds ratio ORadjusted_6 = 2.11, 95% confidence interval = 1.01 to 4.40, P = 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that periodontitis is associated with MetS, and that MetS prevalence is related to severe periodontitis."

Although several studies have assessed the awareness of different risk factors in the general public, there are limited data available on how well acute stroke patients know their own risk factors. The aim of this study was to assess stroke patients' informedness of their own stroke risk factors.
METHODS: All consecutive eligible acute stroke and transient ischemic attack patients hospitalized at the Tartu University Hospital, Department of Neurology, during 9 months in 2010 were interviewed about different stroke risk factors within 72 hours from hospitalization. The respective information was also retrieved from medical records.
RESULTS: Of the 341 patients admitted during the study period, 195 were eligible for the interview. Diabetes was the best known risk factor (89%) followed by hypertension (80%), atrial fibrillation (78%), previous stroke (77%), and heart failure and/or ischemic heart disease (66%).
CONCLUSIONS: We found that acute stroke patients are best informed of their diabetes and worst informed of their ischemic heart disease and/or heart failure. There is, however, room for amelioration in the awareness of all of the studied risk factors. More attention should be addressed to explaining the risks and treatment options to patients at risk of stroke and the general population."
26654693,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26654693/,"BACKGROUND: Vascular surgery became a new independent surgical specialty in the United Kingdom (UK) in 2013. In this matter for debate we discuss the question, is there a ""shortage of vascular surgeons in the United Kingdom?""
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used data derived from the ""Vascular Surgery United Kingdom Workforce Survey 2014"", NHS Employers Electronic Staff Records (ESR), and the National Vascular Registry (NVR) surgeon-level public report to estimate current and predict future workforce requirements.
RESULTS: We estimate there are approximately 458 Consultant Vascular Surgeons for the current UK population of 63 million, or 1 per 137,000 population. In several UK Regions there are a large number of relatively small teams (3 or less) of vascular surgeons working in separate NHS Trusts in close geographical proximity. In developed countries, both the number and complexity of vascular surgery procedures (open and endovascular) per capita population is increasing, and concerns have been raised that demand cannot be met without a significant expansion in numbers of vascular surgeons. Additional workforce demand arises from the impact of population growth and changes in surgical work-patterns with respect to gender, working-life-balance and 7-day services.
CONCLUSIONS: We predict a future shortage of Consultant Vascular Surgeons in the UK and recommend an increase in training numbers and an expansion in the UK Consultant Vascular Surgeon workforce to accommodate population growth, facilitate changes in work-patterns and to create safe sustainable services."
26654760,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26654760/,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the associations between decreased pulse oximetry values (SpO2) and clinical, laboratory, and demographic variables in general practice patients diagnosed with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including those with both COPD and asthma in combination.
DESIGN/SETTING: A cross-sectional study in seven Norwegian general practices of patients aged 40 years or over who were diagnosed by their general practitioner (GP) with asthma and/or COPD. The patients were examined during a stable phase of their disease. Patients diagnosed with COPD (including those with combined COPD/asthma) and those diagnosed with asthma only were analysed separately.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Decreased SpO2 values (≤ 95% and ≤ 92%).
RESULTS: Of 372 patients included (mean age 61.5 years, 62% women), 82 (22.0%) had SpO2 ≤ 95%, of which 11 had SpO2 ≤ 92%. In both asthma and COPD patients, SpO2 ≤ 95% was significantly associated with reduced lung function (spirometry), a diagnosis of coronary heart disease and older age (≥ 65 years). In the COPD group, haemoglobin above normal was associated with SpO2 ≤ 95%. These associations were confirmed by multivariable logistic regression, where FEV1% predicted < 50 was the strongest predictor of SpO2 ≤ 95% (odds ratio 6.8, 95% confidence interval 2.8-16.4).
CONCLUSION: Pulse oximetry represents a useful diagnostic adjunct for assessing the severity of obstructive pulmonary disease. Decreased pulse oximetry values in stable-phase patients with asthma and/or COPD should prompt the GP to consider revising the diagnosis and treatment and to look for co-morbidities. Key Points Despite its common use in general practice, the diagnostic benefits of pulse oximetry remain to be established. Decreased pulse oximetry values are associated with both reduced lung function (spirometry) and with a diagnosis of coronary heart disease. Decreased pulse oximetry values may reflect suboptimal treatment and/or undiagnosed comorbidity. Pulse oximetry may therefore be a useful measure in the follow-up of asthma and COPD patients in general practice."
26654834,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26654834/,"INTRODUCTION: Oesophageal pH-monitoring allows the quantification of gastric reflux episodes in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The accuracy of the test depends on correct positioning of the pH sensor 5 cm above the lower oesophageal sphincter (LES). The most precise manner to locate the LES is through prior determination by oesophageal manometry. However, because this technique is uncomfortable, mathematical formulas tend to be used in children.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the applicability of paediatric formulas to estimate oesophageal length in adults and their effect on diagnostic accuracy.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective study was carried out in adult patients, in whom the distance between the nasal orifice and the LES was determined by manometry and was compared with the estimated height-related distance calculated by four paediatric formulas (numbered 1 to 4). We also evaluated the relationship between the position of the probe and the percentage of reflux detected in our series of impedance measurements.
RESULTS: Formula 1 (9.31 + height in cm × 0.197) was the most accurate (comparison of means -0.38 with 95%CI -0.70/-0.06, P = .019). With this formula, none of the patients had estimation errors of ± 6 cm. With formulas 2, 3 and 4, the percentage of error was 4.4%, 1.5% and 32.0%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Oesophageal length estimation in adults by using formula 1 is acceptable and can be used in adult patients who refuse to undergo prior manometry."
26654897,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26654897/,"BACKGROUND: Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the gold standard for management of acute cholecystitis (AC). Nevertheless, the definition used for early phase remained unclear. We aimed to compare the clinical outcome and cost of immediate (patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy within 24 h following symptom onset) versus early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (patients managed 25-72 h following symptom onset) for acute cholecystitis.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed. The outcomes of 143 patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy within 24 h (ICG) were compared to 350 patients managed 25-72 h following symptom onset (ECG) for acute cholecystitis.
RESULTS: There were significantly more diabetic patients in the early laparoscopic group (ECG). All other characteristics were comparable (demographic, clinical, biologic and ultrasonographic characteristics) between the two groups. The rate of conversion to open surgery was significantly higher in the ECG. Overall postoperative morbidity and specific morbidity did not differ significantly between the groups. Total hospital stay was longer in the ECG. Direct medical costs were higher in the ECG.
CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy, for acute cholecystitis, during the first 24 h of onset of symptoms, significantly reduced conversion to open surgery and total hospital stay without increasing postoperative complications."
26654945,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26654945/,"CONTEXT: Hospices that enroll patients receiving expensive palliative therapies may serve more African Americans because of their greater preferences for aggressive end-of-life care.
OBJECTIVES: Examine the association between hospices' admission practices and enrollment of African Americans and whites.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 61 North and South Carolina hospices. We developed a hospice admission practices scale; higher scores indicate less restrictive practices, that is, greater frequency with which hospices admitted those receiving chemotherapy, inotropes, and so forth. In separate multivariate analyses for each racial group, we examined the relationship between the proportion of decedents (age ≥ 65) served by a hospice in their service area (2008 Medicare Data) and admission practices while controlling for health care resources (e.g., hospital beds) and market concentration in the area, ownership, and budget.
RESULTS: Nonprofit hospices and those with larger budgets reported less restrictive admission practices. In bivariate analyses, hospices with less restrictive admission practices served a larger proportion of patients in both racial groups (P < 0.001). However, in the multivariate models, nonprofit ownership and larger budgets but not admission practices predicted the outcome.
CONCLUSION: Hospices with larger budgets served a greater proportion of African Americans and whites in their service area. Although larger hospices reported less restrictive admission practices, they also may have provided other services that may be important to patients regardless of race, such as more in-home support or assistance with nonmedical expenses, and participated in more outreach activities increasing their visibility and referral base. Future research should explore factors that influence decisions about hospice enrollment among racially diverse older adults."
26655019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26655019/,"AIMS: Among diabetes mellitus (DM) patients with poor glycemic control enrolled into a self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) program in Kenya, to assess the level of SMBG adherence, its associated factors and its relation to glycemic control (defined as HbA1c <7% and/or 2% absolute reduction relative to baseline).
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we used routinely collected data of patients enrolled during 2012-2013. We assessed adherence to SMBG by dividing the number of glucose tests performed by the number recommended. A level of ≥ 80% was considered 'good adherence'. Glycemic control was considered as absolute change from baseline of 2%.
RESULTS: Of 164 patients (59% female; 76% rural), the proportions with good SMBG adherence were 34%, 17%, 15% and 10% during 0-6, 7-12, 13-18 and 19-24 months into the HGM program respectively. In multivariate analysis, male gender, urban place of residence and payment for glucostrips were associated with poor adherence during 0-12 months. The mean reduction in HbA1c compared to baseline was 1.2%, 1.1%, 0.8% and 0.7% at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months, respectively. We did not find any association between SMBG adherence and glycemic control.
CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to SMBG was sub-optimal, especially among those who had to pay for glucostrips. Patient education and provision of free glucostrips are recommended to improve adherence and glycemic control."
26655173,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26655173/,"OBJECTIVES: The present study evaluated the long-term dentine bonding effectiveness of five universal adhesives in etch-and-rinse or self-etch mode after 12 months of water-ageing.
METHODS: The adhesives evaluated included All-Bond Universal, Clearfil Universal Bond, Futurabond U Prime&Bond Elect and Scotchbond Universal. Microtensile bond strength and transmission electron microscopy of the resin-dentine interfaces created in human coronal dentine were examined after 24h or 12 months.
RESULTS: Microtensile bond strength were significantly affected by bonding strategy (etch-and-rinse vs self-etch) and ageing (24h vs 12 months). All subgroups showed significantly decreased bond strength after ageing except for Prime&Bond Elect and Scotchbond Universal used in self-etch mode. All five adhesives employed in etch-and-rinse mode exhibited ultrastructural features characteristic of collagen degradation and resin hydrolysis. A previously-unobserved inside-out collagen degradation pattern was identified in hybrid layers created by 10-MDP containing adhesives (All-Bond Universal, Scotchbond Universal and Clearfil Universal Bond) in the etch-and-rinse mode, producing partially degraded collagen fibrils with intact periphery and a hollow core. In the self-etch mode, all adhesives except for Prime&Bond Elect exhibited degradation of the collagen fibrils along the thin hybrid layers. The three 10-MDP containing universal adhesives did not protect surface collagen fibrils from degradation when bonding was performed in the self-etch mode.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the adjunctive conclusion that bonds created by universal adhesives in the self-etch bonding mode are more resistant to decline in bond strength when compared with those bonds created using the etch-and-rinse mode, bonds created by universal adhesives are generally incapable of defying ageing."
26655493,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26655493/,"BACKGROUND: Although opioids in general and remifentanil in particular have been shown to induce hyperalgesia, data regarding fentanyl are scarce. Thus, the authors investigated the effect of fentanyl dosing on pain perception and central sensitization in healthy volunteers using established pain models.
METHODS: Twenty-one healthy, male volunteers were included in this randomized, double-blind, crossover study and received either intravenous low-dose (1 μg/kg) or high-dose (10 μg/kg) fentanyl. Pain intensities and hyperalgesia were assessed by intracutaneous electrical stimulation, and cold pressor pain was used as an additional measure of acute pain. The primary outcome was hyperalgesia from 4.5 to 6.5 h after fentanyl administration.
RESULTS: A higher dose of fentanyl led to significantly decreased pain scores as measured by the numeric rating scale (0.83 units lower [95% CI, 0.63 to 1.02]; P < 0.001) but increased areas of hyperalgesia (+30.5% [95% CI, 16.6 to 44.4%]; P < 0.001) from 4.5 to 6.5 h after fentanyl administration. Allodynia did not differ between groups (+4.0% [95% CI, -15.4 to 23.5%]; P = 0.682).The high dose also led to both increased cold pressor pain threshold (+43.0% [95% CI, 29.7 to 56.3%]; P < 0.001) and tolerance (+32.5% [95% CI, 21.7 to 43.4%]; P < 0.001) at 4.5 to 6.5h. In the high-dose group, 19 volunteers (90%) required reminders to breathe, 8 (38%) required supplemental oxygen, and 12 (57%) experienced nausea.
CONCLUSIONS: A higher dose of fentanyl increased hyperalgesia from 4.5 to 6.5 h in healthy volunteers while simultaneously decreasing pain scores."
26655543,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26655543/,"BACKGROUND: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation displays low survival rate after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) could be suggested as a rescue therapeutic option in refractory OHCA. The aim of this report is to analyze our experience of ECLS implantation for refractory OHCA.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational analysis of our prospectively collected database. Patients were divided into a shockable rhythm (SH-R) and a non-shockable rhythm (NSH-R) group according to cardiac rhythm at ECLS implantation. The primary endpoint was survival to hospital discharge with good neurological recovery.
RESULTS: From January 2010 to December 2014 we used ECLS in 68 patients (SH-R, n=19, 27.9% vs. NSH-R, n=49, 72.1%) for refractory OHCA. The clinical profile before ECLS implantation was comparable between the groups. Eight (11.7%) patients were successfully weaned from ECLS (SH-R=31.5% vs. NSH-R=4.0%, p=0.01) after a mean period of support of 2.1 days (SH-R=4.1 days vs. NSH-R=1.4 days, p=0.01). Six (8.8%) patients survived to discharge (SH-R=31.5% vs. NSH-R=0%, p=0.00). In the SH-R group 50% of the survivors were discharged without neurological complications.
CONCLUSIONS: ECLS for refractory OHCA should be limited in consideration of its poor, especially neurological, outcome. Non-shockable rhythms could be considered as a formal contraindication allowing a concentration of our efforts on the shockable rhythms, where the chances of success are substantial."

METHODS: RT and regular blade (RB) cutter probes connected to the same vitrectomy console used a peristaltic pump. The authors measured instantaneous flow through aspiration tubing proximal to the handpiece, fluid velocity, and acceleration at the port by means of particle image velocimetry.
RESULTS: Average flow at aspiration tubing of RT and RB did not vary significantly. Regular blade probes produced higher instantaneous flow fluctuation than RT at any considered cut rate (RB 1,600 6.4 ± 5.3 mL/minute; RB 3,000 11.8 ± 6.3 mL/minute; RT 1,600 0.9 ± 0.7 mL/minute, and RT 3,000 1.8 ± 0.8 mL/minute, respectively.

Fluid acceleration at the cutter port was higher when the RB was used (RB 1,600 26.85 ± 30.18 mm/second; RB 3,000 33.76 ± 34.09 mm/second; RT 1,600 24.01 ± 21.94 mm/second; and RT 3,000 16.62 ± 17.87 mm/second. P < 0.001 in all cases).
CONCLUSION: RT blade design causes less instantaneous flow fluctuation within the aspiration tubing, and also lower fluid velocity and lower acceleration at the cutter port. Fluidics suggests a safer cutting action and a reduced risk of retinal incarceration."
26655852,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26655852/,"OBJECTIVE: A proof-of-concept analysis was conducted to establish whether link analysis could be applied to data from on-train recorders to detect patterns of behavior that could act as leading indicators of potential safety issues.
BACKGROUND: On-train data recorders capture data about driving behavior on thousands of routine journeys every day and offer a source of untapped data that could be used to offer insights into human behavior.
METHOD: Data from 17 journeys undertaken by six drivers on the same route over a 16-hr period were analyzed using link analysis, and four key metrics were examined: number of links, network density, diameter, and sociometric status.
RESULTS: The results established that link analysis can be usefully applied to data captured from on-vehicle recorders. The four metrics revealed key differences in normal driver behavior. These differences have promising construct validity as leading indicators.
CONCLUSION: Link analysis is one method that could be usefully applied to exploit data routinely gathered by on-vehicle data recorders. It facilitates a proactive approach to safety based on leading indicators, offers a clearer understanding of what constitutes normal driving behavior, and identifies trends at the interface of people and systems, which is currently a key area of strategic risk.
APPLICATION: These research findings have direct applications in the field of transport data monitoring. They offer a means of automatically detecting patterns in driver behavior that could act as leading indicators of problems during operation and that could be used in the proactive monitoring of driver competence, risk management, and even infrastructure design."
26655919,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26655919/,"OBJECTIVE: To compare sarcopenia and frailty for outcome prediction in surgical intensive care unit (SICU) patients.
BACKGROUND: Frailty has been associated with adverse outcomes and describes a status of muscle weakness and decreased physiological reserve leading to increased vulnerability to stressors. However, frailty assessment depends on patient cooperation. Sarcopenia can be quantified by ultrasound and the predictive value of sarcopenia at SICU admission for adverse outcome has not been defined.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective, observational study of SICU patients. Sarcopenia was diagnosed by ultrasound measurement of rectus femoris cross-sectional area. Frailty was diagnosed by the Frailty Index Questionnaire based on 50 variables. Relationship between variables and outcomes was assessed by multivariable regression analysis NCT02270502.
RESULTS: Sarcopenia and frailty were quantified in 102 patients and observed in 43.1% and 38.2%, respectively. Sarcopenia predicted adverse discharge disposition (discharge to nursing facility or in-hospital mortality, odds ratio 7.49; 95% confidence interval 1.47-38.24; P = 0.015) independent of important clinical covariates, as did frailty (odds ratio 8.01; 95% confidence interval 1.82-35.27; P = 0.006); predictive ability did not differ between sarcopenia and frailty prediction model, reflected by χ values of 21.74 versus 23.44, respectively, and a net reclassification improvement (NRI) of -0.02 (P = 0.87). Sarcopenia and frailty predicted hospital length of stay and the frailty model had a moderately better predictive accuracy for this outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: Bedside diagnosis of sarcopenia by ultrasound predicts adverse discharge disposition in SICU patients equally well as frailty. Sarcopenia assessed by ultrasound may be utilized as rapid beside modality for risk stratification of critically ill patients."
26656015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26656015/,"OBJECTIVE: The abdominal drawing-in manoeuvre (ADIM) is a common clinical tool for manually assessing whether a preferential activation of the deep abdominal muscles in patients with low back pain (LBP) is 'correct' or not. The validity and reliability of manual assessment of the ADIM are, however, as yet unknown. This study evaluated the concurrent and discriminative validity and reliability of the manually assessed ADIM.
DESIGN: Single-blinded cross-sectional study.
SETTINGS: General population in Stockholm County, Sweden.
PARTICIPANTS: The study sample comprised 38 participants seeking care for LBP, and 15 healthy subjects.
MEASURES: The manual ADIM was assessed as correct or not following a standard procedure. Ultrasound imaging (USI) was used as the concurrent reference (gold standard) for the manually assessed ADIM by calculating a ratio of the change in muscle thickness between the resting and the contracted states: the correlation between manual test and USI was calculated. Discriminative validity was analysed by calculating sensitivity and specificity. A sample of 24 participants was analysed with κ coefficients for interobserver reliability between two raters.
RESULTS: The concurrent validity between the manual ADIM and the ADIM-USI ratios showed poor correlations (r=0.13-0.40). The discriminative validity of the manually assessed ADIM to predict LBP showed a sensitivity/specificity of 0.30/0.73, while the ADIM-USI ratio to predict LBP showed 0.19/0.87. The interobserver reliability for the manually assessed ADIM revealed substantial agreement: K=0.71, CI (95%) 0.41 to 1.00.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the interobserver reliability of the manually assessed ADIM was high, the concurrent and discriminative validity were both low for examining the preferential activity of the deep abdominal muscles. Neither the manually assessed ADIM nor the ultrasound testing discriminated between participants with LBP and healthy subjects regarding preferential activity of the transversus muscle as this ability/inability was also present in healthy subjects."
26656036,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26656036/,"STUDY DESIGN: Single-center retrospective study of prospectively collected data, nested within the Eurospine Spine Tango data acquisition system.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the patient-rated outcome and complication rates associated with lumbar fusion procedures in three different age groups.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: There is a general reluctance to consider spinal fusion procedures in elderly patients due to the increased likelihood of complications.
METHODS: Before and at 3, 12, and 24 months after surgery, patients completed the multidimensional Core Outcome Measures Index. At the 3-, 12-, and 24-month follow-ups, they also rated the Global Treatment Outcome and their satisfaction with care. Patients were divided into three age groups: younger (≥50 years <65 years; n = 317), older (≥65 years <80 years; n = 350), and geriatric (≥80 years; n = 40).
RESULTS: A total of 707 consecutive patients were included. The preoperative comorbidity status differed significantly (P < 0.0001) between the age groups, with the highest scores in the geriatric group. Medical complications during surgery were lower in the younger age group (7%) than in the older (13.4%; P = 0.006) and geriatric groups (17.5%; P = 0.007); surgical complications tended to be higher in the elderly group (younger, 6.3%; older, 6.0%; geriatric, 15.0%; P = 0.09). There were no significant group differences (P > 0.05) for the scores on any of the Core Outcome Measures Index domains, Global Treatment Outcome, or patient-rated satisfaction at either 3-, 12-, and 24-months of follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Despite greater comorbidity and complication rates in geriatric patients, the patient-rated outcome was as good in the elderly as it was in younger age groups up to 2 years after surgery. These data indicate that geriatric age needs careful consideration of associated risks but is not per se a contraindication for fusion for lumbar degenerative disease.

26656047,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26656047/,"STUDY DESIGN: In vivo analysis in swine model.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy of triggered EMG (t-EMG) and its reliability in lateral lumbar interbody fusions surgery. We also aim to document changes in psoas muscle produced during the approach.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Lateral lumbar interbody fusions is preferred over direct anterior approach because of lower complications, blood loss, and shorter recovery time. Threshold-EMGs are utilized for real-time feedback about nerve location; however, neurological deficits are widely reported, and are unique to this approach. Multiple factors have been hypothesized including neuropraxia from retractors and compression from psoas hematoma/edema. The variable reports of neurological complication even with t-EMGs indicate the need to study them further.
METHODS: Eight swines underwent left-sided retroperitoneal approach. The nerve on the surface of the psoas was identified and threshold-EMGs were obtained utilizing a ball-tip, and needle probe. First EMG and threshold responses required to elicit 20-μV responses were recorded for 2 mm incremental distances up to 10 mm. In the second part, a K-wire was inserted into the mid-lumbar disc space, and a tubular retractor docked and dilated adequately. Postmortem CT scans were carried out to evaluate changes in psoas muscle.
RESULTS: A t-EMG stimulus threshold of <5 mA indicates a higher probability that the probe is close to or on the nerve, but this was not proportional to the distance suggesting limitations for nerve mapping. Negative predictive value of t-EMGs is 76.5% with the ball-tipped probe and 80% with the needle probe for t-EMG ≥10 mA and indicates that even with higher thresholds, the nerve may be much closer than anticipated. Postoperative hematoma was not seen on CT scans.
CONCLUSION: Threshold measurements are unreliable in estimating distance from the nerve in an individual subject and higher values do not always correspond to a 'safe zone.""

26656140,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26656140/,"OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine whether a model that included self-reported socioeconomic, health status, and psychosocial characteristics obtained from patients recently discharged from hospitalizations for heart failure substantially improved 30-day readmission risk prediction compared with a model that incorporated only clinical and demographic factors.
BACKGROUND: Existing readmission risk models have poor discrimination and it is unknown whether they would be markedly improved by the inclusion of patient-reported information.
METHODS: As part of the Tele-HF (Telemonitoring to Improve Heart Failure Outcomes) trial, we conducted medical record abstraction and telephone interviews in a sample of 1,004 patients recently hospitalized for heart failure to obtain clinical, functional, and psychosocial information within 2 weeks of discharge. Candidate risk factors included 110 variables divided into 2 groups: demographic and clinical variables generally available from the medical record; and socioeconomic, health status, adherence, and psychosocial variables from patient interview.
RESULTS: The 30-day readmission rate was 17.1%. Using the 3-level risk score derived from the restricted medical record variables, patients with a score of 0 (no risk factors) had a readmission rate of 10.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.2% to 14.2%), and patients with a score of 2 (all risk factors) had a readmission rate of 32.1% (95% CI: 22.4% to 43.2%), a C-statistic of 0.62. Using the 5-level risk score derived from all variables, patients with a score of 0 (no risk factors) had a readmission rate of 9.6% (95% CI: 6.1% to 14.2%), and patients with a score of 4 (all risk factors) had a readmission rate of 55.0% (95% CI: 31.5% to 76.9%), a C-statistic of 0.65.
CONCLUSIONS: Self-reported socioeconomic, health status, adherence, and psychosocial variables are not dominant factors in predicting readmission risk for patients with heart failure. Patient-reported information improved model discrimination and extended the predicted ranges of readmission rates, but the model performance remained poor.

The aim of this prospective pilot study was to explore symptoms experienced by women with PVI, and determine its impact on quality of life and NHS costs.
STUDY DESIGN: Case-control study at a UK University teaching hospital conducted over an eight-month period. Cases were 40 premenopausal women aged 18-49 years with PVI and varicose veins (VV). There were two age-matched controls groups: (i) 40 healthy women with no PVI but with VV, and (ii) 40 healthy women with no PVI and no VV. Subjects were asked to complete a structured questionnaire on disease specific outcomes, health status and use of healthcare resources.
RESULTS: Mean age (range) was 39.8 (24-47) years for cases, 39.1 (24-49) for VV controls and 38 (25-49) for healthy controls. Pelvic pain was reported by 38 of 40 (95%) PVI cases, compared with 25 of 40 (62%) VV controls, and 26 of 40 (65%) healthy controls (p=0.001). The median (range) EQ-5D utility score for PVI cases was 0.80 (0.29-1.0) compared with 0.80 (0.09-1.0) for VV controls and 1.0 (0.62-1.0) for healthy controls (p=0.002). Of the 40 PVI cases, 35 (88%) visited a consultant in the previous 12 months compared with 12 of 40 (30%) VV controls, and 14 of 40 (35%) healthy controls (p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Women with PVI report a greater frequency of pelvic pain with reduced health status and increased use of healthcare resources compared with matched controls."
26656776,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26656776/,"PURPOSE: Knowing that motor skills will not develop to their full potential without opportunities to practice in environments that are stimulating and supportive, we evaluated the effect of a physical activity (PA)-based intervention targeting childcare providers on fundamental movement skills (FMS) in preschoolers attending childcare centers.
METHODS: In this two-arm cluster-randomized controlled trial, six licensed childcare centers in Ottawa, Canada, were randomly allocated into one of two groups (three controls, n = 43; three interventions, n = 40). Participants were between the ages of 3 and 5 yr. Childcare providers in the experimental condition received two 3-h workshops and a training manual at program initiation aimed at increasing PA through active play and several in-center ""booster"" sessions throughout the 6-month intervention. Control childcare centers implemented their standard curriculum. FMS were measured at baseline and 6 months using the Test of Gross Motor Development-2.
RESULTS: Groups did not differ on sociodemographic variables. Compared with control, children in the intervention group demonstrated significantly greater improvement in their standardized gross motor quotient (score, 5.70; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.74-10.67; P = 0.025 and gross motor quotient percentile, 13.33; 95% CI, 2.17-24.49; P = 0.020). Over the 6-month study period, the intervention group showed a significantly greater increase in locomotor skills score (1.20; 95% CI, 0.18-2.22; P = 0.022) than the control group. There was a significant decrease in the object control scores in the control group over the study period.
CONCLUSIONS: A childcare provider-led PA-based intervention increased the FMS in preschoolers, driven by the change in locomotor skills. The childcare environment may represent a viable public health approach for promoting motor skill development to support future engagement in PA."

RESULTS: A total of 98.8% reported using male condoms in the past month, and 64.6% reported using female-controlled nonbarrier modern contraception. In multivariate analysis, female-controlled nonbarrier modern contraceptive use was not associated with decreased condom use with clients or nonpaying partners.
CONCLUSION: Consistency of condom use is not compromised when FSWs use available female-controlled nonbarrier modern contraception.

26657162,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26657162/,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of intranasal procedures carried out simultaneously with bimaxillary orthognathic surgery.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors executed a retrospective cohort study derived from patients treated by a single surgeon at 1 institution from 2004 through 2013 with a minimum follow-up of 1 year (range, 1 to 10 yr). An index study group consisting of a consecutive series of patients with symptomatic chronic obstructive nasal breathing (CONB) and a bimaxillary developmental dentofacial deformity (DFD) also involving the chin were identified. They underwent a minimum of: Le Fort I osteotomy, bilateral sagittal ramus osteotomies, septoplasty, inferior turbinate reduction (ITR), and osseous genioplasty. Study variables included age at operation, gender, pattern of presenting DFD, presence of obstructive sleep apnea, segmentation of the maxilla, and airway management. The primary outcome variable studied was residual CONB.
RESULTS: During the study period, 262 patients met the inclusion criteria. Their age at operation averaged 25 years (range, 13 to 63 yr) and 134 were female (51%). The major patterns of presenting DFD included long face (29%) and maxillary deficiency (25%). No patients required nasal packing, reintubation, tracheostomy, or blood transfusion. In 6 of the 262 patients (2%), the intranasal procedures did not resolve nasal breathing difficulties. In these patients, procedures recommended included synechiae release (n = 3), revision septoplasty (n = 3), and further ITR (n = 4). An association between age at time of surgery and non-segmental Le Fort I osteotomy with the occurrence of residual nasal obstruction was confirmed.
CONCLUSIONS: When completing septoplasty and ITR through a Le Fort I, airway management need not be altered from standard protocol. The management of CONB in conjunction with orthognathic surgery is highly effective, with few complications. Non-segmental Le Fort I in patients at least 40 years of age is more likely to be associated with residual CONB, but the incidence remains low."
26657277,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26657277/,"OBJECTIVE: There has been no clear evidence supporting similar chemo-responses for upper and lower urothelial carcinomas.
METHODS: We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study to analyze urothelial carcinoma patients who underwent systemic chemotherapy at 17 centers from 2004 to 2010. A total of 298 patients with either urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (N = 151) or upper tract urothelial carcinoma (N = 147) were included. Differences in tumor location (urothelial carcinoma of the bladder vs. upper tract urothelial carcinoma) were evaluated in relation to the patient backgrounds and clinical responses to systemic chemotherapy.
RESULTS: Overall 216 patients were treated with cisplatin-based chemo-regimens (gemcitabine and cisplatin in 92, or methotrexate, vinblastine, adriamycin and cisplatin/methotrexate, epirubicin and cisplatin in 124). Among 186 initially metastatic patients, the incidences of lung metastasis and liver metastasis were 39.2 and 34.1%, respectively, in upper tract urothelial carcinoma patients, and were significantly higher than those with urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (22.4% for lung; 8.4% for liver metastasis). Among 112 post-surgical recurrent/metastatic patients, age was significantly higher and estimated glomerular filtration rate at baseline was significantly lower in upper tract urothelial carcinoma patients than those with urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. No significant differences were observed in overall clinical response rates for systemic chemotherapy between urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (45.8%) and upper tract urothelial carcinoma (38%) in initially metastatic patients or between urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (43.2%) and upper tract urothelial carcinoma (44.1%) in post-surgical recurrent/metastatic patients. Tumor location was not independently associated with cancer-specific survival in either initially metastatic or post-surgical recurrent/metastatic urothelial carcinoma patients.
CONCLUSIONS: No significant difference was observed in response rates of urothelial carcinoma of the bladder and upper tract urothelial carcinoma to systemic chemotherapy, suggesting that a similar chemo-regimen can be applied to metastatic urothelial carcinoma patients regardless of tumor location (upper vs. lower)."
26657822,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26657822/,"OBJECTIVE: Examine whether the acute kidney injury (AKI) commonly observed among ultramarathon participants places the individual at risk for subsequent AKI of worse magnitude.
DESIGN: Observational.
SETTING: Western States Endurance Run.
PARTICIPANTS: Race finishers with postrace blood studies.
INDEPENDENT VARIABLE: Acute kidney injury after 1 race.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Extent of AKI in subsequent race.
RESULTS: Among 627 finishes in which serum creatinine values were known, 36.2% met ""risk"" or ""injury"" criterion with this group characterized by having faster finish times, greater body weight loss during the race, and higher postrace serum creatine kinase and urea nitrogen concentrations when compared with those not meeting the criteria. We identified 38 runners who had undergone postrace blood analyses at multiple races among which 16 (42.1%) met the risk or injury criterion at the first race. Of those 16 runners, 12 (75%) met the criteria at a subsequent race, an incidence that was higher (P = 0.0026) than the overall 36.2% incidence. For most (56.2%) of the 16 runners meeting the criteria at the first race, the subsequent race caused less increase in serum creatinine concentration and decrement in estimated glomerular filtration rate than the first race.
CONCLUSIONS: Mild AKI is common in 161-km ultramarathons, but there was no evidence that previous AKI caused greater renal dysfunction from a subsequent exercise stimulus of similar magnitude. This offers some reassurance to runners and their physicians that mild to moderate AKI in the setting of an ultramarathon is not cumulative or without complete recovery of kidney function when stressed."

The poorer understanding and lower levels of self-determination we found suggest that future research should develop and evaluate interventions to increase understanding and self-determination."
26658755,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26658755/,"INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: The aim of the study was to correlate histological and biomechanical characteristics of the vaginal wall in women with pelvic organ prolapse (POP).
METHODS: Tissue samples were collected from the anterior [point Ba; POP Questionnaire (POP-Q)] and/or posterior (point Bp; POP-Q) vaginal wall of 15 women who underwent vaginal surgery for POP. Both histological and biomechanical assessments were performed from the same tissue samples in 14 of 15 patients. For histological assessment, the density of collagen and elastin fibers was determined by combining high-resolution virtual imaging and computer-assisted digital image analysis. For biomechanical testing, uniaxial tension tests were performed to evaluate vaginal tissue stiffness at low (C0) and high (C1) deformation rates.
RESULTS: Biomechanical testing highlights the hyperelastic behavior of the vaginal wall. At low strains (C0), vaginal tissue appeared stiffer when elastin density was low. We found a statistically significant inverse relationship between C0 and the elastin/collagen ratio (p = 0.048) in the lamina propria. However, at large strain levels (C1), no clear relationship was observed between elastin density or elastin/collagen ratio and stiffness, likely reflecting the large dispersion of the mechanical behavior of the tissue samples.
CONCLUSION: Histological and biomechanical properties of the vaginal wall vary from patient to patient. This study suggests that elastin density deserves consideration as a relevant factor of vaginal stiffness in women with POP."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study population included two groups: 20 feet of 10 asymptomatic volunteers who underwent prospective dynamic ultrasound and 55 ankles found through retrospective review of routine ankle MRI examinations. The location of the PL tendon at the cuboid tuberosity and cuboid tunnel was designated as completely within the tunnel, indeterminate, or subluxed with respect to ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion.
RESULTS: On dynamic ultrasound, the PL tendon was perched plantar to the cuboid tuberosity in dorsiflexion, and glided to enter the cuboid tunnel distal to the tuberosity in plantarflexion in all 20 feet. On the MRI evaluation, there was a statistically significant difference (p = 0.0006) in the location of the PL tendon between the ankles scanned in dorsiflexion and plantarflexion.
CONCLUSION: Based on our findings on ultrasound and MRI, the PL tendon can glide in and out of the cuboid tunnel along the cuboid tuberosity depending on ankle position. Thus, ""subluxation"" of the tendon as it curves to enter the cuboid tunnel, which to the best of our knowledge has not yet been described, should be recognized as a normal, position-dependent phenomenon and not be reported as pathology."

METHODS: 623 patients (103 Roma) were included. We obtained data from medical records and patients interviews. A Cox regression model adjusted for age, gender and education was used to analyze the effect of Roma ethnicity on mortality, as well as potential mediation by SRH.
RESULTS: Roma ethnicity and poor SRH were predictors of increased mortality in patients with CAD, with hazard rates (95 % confidence intervals) 2.34 (1.24; 4.42) and 1.81 (1.02; 3.21). Adding education decreased the size of ethnic differences in mortality. The mediating effect of SRH on the association of ethnicity with mortality was not statistically significant; neither modified ethnicity the effect of SRH.
CONCLUSIONS: Poor SRH does not mediate the higher mortality among Roma patients after CAG even though it indicates an increased risk of mortality. Roma patients with CAD have to be referred for special cardiological care earlier."
26659834,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26659834/,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot may develop chronic right ventricular dysfunction and hepatic congestion over time. We hypothesized that bile acid metabolism is altered in repaired tetralogy of Fallot patients and therefore sought to correlate right ventricular indices with serum bile acid levels.
METHODS: Indexed right ventricular end diastolic volume, as assessed by cardiac magnetic-resonance imaging, was classified as <100ml/m2 (Group 1, n = 5), 100-150ml/m2 (Group 2, n = 18), and >150ml/m2 (Group 3, n = 6) in 29 patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot. Pulmonary regurgitation fraction and right ventricular ejection fraction were calculated. The serum bile acid profile, including 15 species, in these patients was determined by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: Serum bile acid levels increased from Group 1 to Group 3 (2.5 ± 0.7; 4.1 ± 2.5; 6.0 ± 2.8 μmol/l, respectively) with significantly increased bile acid values in Group 3 compared to Group 1 (p≤0.05). In Group 3, but not in Group 1 and 2, a significant increase in glycine-conjugated bile acids was observed. Pulmonary regurgitation fraction increased (12 ± 1; 28 ± 16; 43 ± 3%, Groups 1-3, respectively) and right ventricular ejection fraction decreased (48.4 ± 6.4; 48.5 ± 6.5; 42.1 ± 5.3%, Groups 1-3, respectively) with rising indexed right ventricular end diastolic volume.
CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results suggest that serum bile acid levels are positively correlated with indexed right ventricular end-diastolic volume in patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot; however, this needs to be confirmed in a larger patient cohort."
26659898,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26659898/,"INTRODUCTION: Despite worldwide trends toward optimizing full disclosure of information (DOI), the prevailing belief that cancer diagnosis should be concealed from patients, for their own good, has endured for a substantial period of time in Middle Eastern communities.
OBJECTIVES: This study would assess the reliability of the Arabic translated version of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-INFO 25). The study was also designed to quantify DOI to Lebanese cancer patients and determine patient satisfaction with this DOI. Moreover, we compared the differences in the level of information among groups based on clinical and biographical variables.
METHODS: A sample of patients, being treated for a variety of malignancies, was prospectively evaluated. A physician interviewed patients using the Arabic version of the EORTC QLQ-INFO 25, on the day of hospitalization for chemotherapy, before treatment was administered.
RESULTS: In total 201 patients were interviewed. The translated version of the EORTC QLQ-INFO 25 showed high reliability when assessed using Cronbach's alpha coefficients for internal consistency with values scoring higher than 0.7 for all scales and the full questionnaire. There was a considerable lack of information provided to the participants with 38.8 % being unaware of their diagnosis and more than half being uninformed about the extent of their disease. Paradoxically, 86.5 % of patients expressed their satisfaction about the amount of information they received and 89.5 % believe the information provided was helpful. Further analysis showed no significant association between gender, marital status, cancer site and stage and the amount of information received. However, age and level of education were associated with DOI such as younger and more educated patients received more information. Older patients were also found to be the most satisfied with the information they received, despite having less access to information.
CONCLUSIONS: Although a high proportion of patients were not properly informed about their diagnosis, the overwhelming majority were satisfied with the amount of information they received and believed it was useful, reflecting the complexity of Middle Eastern cultural influences on cancer patients' perspectives."

Antithrombotic use carries risks in patients with end-stage renal failure and could increase the risk of needling complications as a result of bleeding. The objectives of this study are to determine the effect of antithrombotic agents on early and late fistula failure and on the risk of interrupted start of cannulation of the fistula.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis of two prospectively maintained databases of access operations and dialysis sessions of 671 patients who had their first fistula between 2004 and 2011. Early failure was defined as failure to reach six consecutive dialysis sessions at any time with two needles on the index form of access. Fistula survival was defined as the time from when the fistula was first used to fistula abandonment.
RESULTS: Primary failure was similar between patients on antiplatelet (18.8%), anticoagulants (18.4%) or no antithrombotic medication (18.8%; p = 0.998). Antithrombotic medication did not have an effect on AVF survival (p = 0.86). Antithrombotic medication did not increase complicated cannulation rates, defined as the percentage of patients failing to achieve six uninterrupted dialysis sessions from the start (p = 0.929).
CONCLUSIONS: Antithrombotic medication had no significant effect on primary failure rate, long-term fistula survival or initial complicated cannulation rates in our study. This suggests that patients already on antithrombotic medication can continue taking them without increasing the risk of interrupted dialysis."
26660880,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26660880/,"PURPOSE: Prematurity is the most common cause of infant mortality and morbidity. To prevent this, the timing of parturition and its mechanisms should be understood. It is likely that inhibitor CD94/NKG2A positive decidual natural killer cells (uNK) provide for the continuation of pregnancy. Here, we aimed to evaluate whether CD94/NKG2A positive uNK cells are highest in elective cesarian section (C/S) (suggesting ongoing gestation), moderate in normal full-term birth, and lowest in pre-eclamptic parturition.
METHODS: Of 48 pregnant women, 21 C/S, 16 normal, and 11 pre-eclamptic deliveries were included in this study. Five placentas in each group were assigned randomly. After staining, the volumetric analysis of the placental villi and villous blood vessels was performed via the Cavalieri principle. The CD94/NKG2A positive uNK cells were counted using the physical disector method.
RESULTS: The gestation periods and birth weights of the pre-eclamptic deliveries were lower than those of the other two groups. Additionally, the villi and villous vascular volumes were lowest in the pre-eclamptic placentas. As proposed in our hypothesis, the inhibitor CD94/NKG2A positive uNK cells were the highest in the C/S, moderate in the normal, and lowest in the pre-eclamptic placentas.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that CD94/NKG2A positive uNK cells are related with the continuation of pregnancy, and that our human model could be used to search for parturition-timing machinery. We believe that CD94/NKG2A positive uNK cells are also related to the timing of birth."
26663519,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26663519/,"OBJECTIVE: Levator ani muscle avulsion is found in 15-30% of parturients and is associated with recurrence of pelvic organ prolapse (POP) following surgery, although most published evidence on recurrence relates to postoperative diagnosis. We performed a study to determine whether a diagnosis of avulsion after pelvic floor surgery can be used as a proxy for preoperative diagnosis.
METHODS: This was a retrospective study of 207 patients who were seen before and after surgery for POP between February 2007 and May 2013. All assessments included a three/four-dimensional transperineal tomographic ultrasound examination. Volume data were stored and analyzed at a later date by an operator who was blinded against all clinical data. The primary outcome measure was agreement between preoperative and postoperative diagnoses of avulsion, as evaluated by Cohen's kappa. Secondary outcome measures were the associations of pre- and postoperative diagnoses of levator avulsion with prolapse recurrence, defined as International Continence Society POP-Q Stage ≥ 2 in any compartment.
RESULTS: Mean follow-up after surgery was 1.3 (range, 0.3-5.5) years. Levator avulsion was found preoperatively in 111 (53.6%) patients and postoperatively in 109 (52.7%). The kappa value for the association between pre- and postoperative avulsion was 0.864 (95% CI, 0.796-0.933), signifying high agreement. The odds ratio of prolapse recurrence in women with a preoperative diagnosis of avulsion was 2.5 (95% CI, 1.3-4.5) and in those with a postoperative diagnosis it was 2.3 (95% CI, 1.3-4.2).
CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of levator avulsion by tomographic pelvic floor ultrasound is equally valid before and after pelvic reconstructive surgery for POP, and both diagnoses show excellent agreement. This implies that a postoperative diagnosis of avulsion can be used as a proxy for preoperative diagnosis. Hence, avulsion can be identified postoperatively and used for subgroup analysis in prospective surgical intervention trials to define high-risk patients. Copyright © 2015 ISUOG.

26663574,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26663574/,"OBJECTIVE: The antenatal diagnosis of twin anemia-polycythemia sequence (TAPS) in monochorionic-diamniotic (MCDA) twin pregnancies is based on elevated peak systolic velocity in the middle cerebral artery (MCA-PSV) in the donor twin and decreased MCA-PSV in the recipient twin. However, the association between these parameters and polycythemia has not yet been established. The aim of this study was to determine whether MCA-PSV can predict polycythemia in MCDA pregnancies.
METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study of MCDA pregnancies recruited at 14-18 weeks' gestation from a single tertiary care center between January 2011 and June 2014. Fetal MCA Doppler waveforms were recorded every 2 weeks from 18 weeks' gestation until delivery. Only those with an MCA-PSV measurement within 1 week of delivery were included in the analysis. Neonatal hematocrit level was determined in all twins from venous blood obtained within 4 h of delivery. Polycythemia was defined as a hematocrit of > 65%, and anemia as a hematocrit of < 45%. TAPS was diagnosed when an intertwin hemoglobin difference of > 8 g/dL and reticulocyte count ratio of > 1.7 were observed.
RESULTS: Of 162 MCDA pregnancies followed during the study period, 69 had an MCA-PSV measurement within 1 week of delivery and were included in the study. Twenty-five neonates were diagnosed with polycythemia and nine twin pairs met the criteria for TAPS. In a pooled analysis, MCA-PSV was negatively correlated with neonatal hematocrit (P = 0.017, r = -0.215) and was significantly higher in anemic fetuses than in normal controls (1.15 multiples of the median (MoM) vs 1.02 MoM, respectively; P = 0.001). However, MCA-PSV was similar among polycythemic and normal fetuses (0.95 MoM vs 1.02 MoM, respectively; P = 0.47). Intertwin difference in MCA-PSV (delta MCA-PSV) was positively correlated with intertwin hematocrit difference (P = 0.002, r = 0.394). Moreover, twin pregnancies with an intertwin hematocrit difference of > 24% had a significantly greater delta MCA-PSV than did those with an intertwin hematocrit difference of ≤ 24% (delta MCA-PSV, 19 vs 5 cm/s; P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: MCA-PSV is not significantly decreased in polycythemic MCDA twins. However, delta MCA-PSV is associated with a large intertwin difference in hematocrit, and its use may be better than conventional methods for the risk assessment of TAPS. Copyright © 2015 ISUOG.

26663730,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26663730/,"OBJECTIVES: Flavoxate has had a long history of use in the treatment of overactive bladder, despite the lack of documentation on its clinical efficacy and mechanism(s) of action. This study was conducted to understand how contractility characteristics of the detrusor are affected after a short period of flavoxate treatment.
METHODS: Eight-week-old mice were treated with flavoxate for 5 days and detrusor contractile responses were examined ex vivo under different pharmacological and electrical stimuli.
RESULTS: K(+) -Krebs'-induced contraction developed more slowly while 64 Hz electrical field stimulation-induced contraction developed faster in flavoxate-treated strips when compared to control. Amplitudes of maximal and steady-state contraction induced by 3 µmol/L carbachol were also larger after flavoxate treatment. Control strips showed an overall greater dependence on stimulus strength in eliciting the responses.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings provided new information of how short-term flavoxate treatment altered contractility characteristics at the bladder level, which may instill new interest in investigating the use of this drug in bladder disorders not responding well to conventional treatments."

DESIGN: Observational study.
SETTING: Historical survival data on elected and runner-up candidates in parliamentary or presidential elections in Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom, and United States, from 1722 to 2015.
PARTICIPANTS: Elected and runner-up political candidates.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Observed number of years alive after each candidate's last election, relative to what would be expected for an average person of the same age and sex as the candidate during the year of the election, based on historical French and British life tables. Observed post-election life years were compared between elected candidates and runners-up, adjusting for life expectancy at time of election. A Cox proportional hazards model (adjusted for candidate's life expectancy at the time of election) considered years until death (or years until end of study period for those not yet deceased by 9 September 2015) for elected candidates versus runners-up.
RESULTS: The sample included 540 candidates: 279 winners and 261 runners-up who never served. A total of 380 candidates were deceased by 9 September 2015. Candidates who served as a head of government lived 4.4 (95% confidence interval 2.1 to 6.6) fewer years after their last election than did candidates who never served (17.8 v 13.4 years after last election; adjusted difference 2.7 (0.6 to 4.8) years). In Cox proportional hazards analysis, which considered all candidates (alive or deceased), the mortality hazard for elected candidates relative to runners-up was 1.23 (1.00 to 1.52).
CONCLUSIONS: Election to head of government is associated with a substantial increase in mortality risk compared with candidates in national elections who never served."
26667004,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26667004/,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore if competency-based progress tests for postgraduate psychiatry are reliable, if they are able to discriminate trainees at different levels of training, and if they are able to demonstrate improvement of trainees' skills from 3 years of data.
METHODS: Psychiatry trainees in the North Western Deanery, UK, were invited to participate in the annual progress test. The progress test simulated the Clinical Assessment of Skills and Competencies (CASC) exam, the final postgraduate examination for psychiatry trainees. The sum of global scores from all stations for each candidate was used for statistical analysis. Cronbach's alpha was used to calculate the interstation reliability. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to explore if the progress test could discriminate between the three levels of trainees each year. Student's t test was used to explore if there was improvement and development of skills as a cohort progressed; ANOVA was used for the cohort with 3 years of data.
RESULTS: The progress test is more likely to be reliable (alpha ≥ 0.8) when 12 stations are used. ANOVA revealed significantly improved scores with increasing level of seniority in 2012, with a mean total score increasing from 23.1 to 31.3 (p = 0.008) and 36.9 to 46.6 in 2013 (p = 0.004). In 2014, this effect was not observed, with a mean decreasing from 42.4 to 41.3. Over time, two cohorts demonstrated improving mean scores with Student's t tests from 26.4 to 32.4 (p = 0.01) and 26.9 to 42.6 (p = 0.01). The third cohort did not demonstrate a difference over time, with mean scores 23.1, 27.6, and 25.9 over 3 years.
CONCLUSIONS: It is not conclusive if the progress test can accurately distinguish between trainee seniority or assess progress over time; possible explanations for non-significant results and further avenues of enquiry are discussed."

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using an anonymised electronic health record case register.
SETTING: South London and Maudsley National Health Service (NHS) Trust (SLaM), a large provider of inpatient and community mental healthcare in the UK.
PARTICIPANTS: 21,012 adults presenting to SLaM between 1 April 2006 and 31 March 2013 with unipolar depression.
EXPOSURE: Prior antidepressant therapy recorded in electronic health records.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Time to subsequent diagnosis of mania or bipolar disorder from date of diagnosis of unipolar depression, censored at 31 March 2014.
METHODS: Multivariable Cox regression analysis with age and gender as covariates.
RESULTS: The overall incidence rate of mania/bipolar disorder was 10.9 per 1000 person-years. The peak incidence of mania/bipolar disorder incidence was seen in patients aged between 26 and 35 years (12.3 per 1000 person-years). Prior antidepressant treatment was associated with an increased incidence of mania/bipolar disorder ranging from 13.1 to 19.1 per 1000 person-years. Multivariable analysis indicated a significant association with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (HR 1.34, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.52) and venlafaxine (1.35, 1.07 to 1.70).
CONCLUSIONS: In people with unipolar depression, antidepressant treatment is associated with an increased risk of subsequent mania/bipolar disorder. These findings highlight the importance of considering risk factors for mania when treating people with depression."
26667030,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26667030/,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of obesity and the female labor participation rate have been rapidly increasing in South Korea. To examine the relationship between these factors, we investigated the association between timing and type of work and obesity in the Korean female working population.
METHODS: Data collected by the 2008 Community Health Survey (CHS) were analyzed using a complex, stratified, multistage, probability cluster sampling method. Descriptive analysis of relevant variables was performed using the chi-square test, and work-related variables by work type were identified using multivariate logistic regression. The relationship between long working hours, night/shift work, and body-mass index in female workers and explanatory, stratifying, and dependent variables and covariates was analyzed using multiple logistic regression models.
RESULTS: A total of 42,234 CHS participants were eligible for study inclusion. Among both manual and nonmanual workers, working less than 40 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07-1.31 and aOR 1.29; 95% CI 1.09-0.52, respectively) or more than 60 (aOR 1.18, 95% CI 1.06-1.30 and aOR 1.28, 95% CI 1.04-1.57, respectively) hours per week was significantly associated with obesity after controlling for covariates. However, working type (day or night/shift) was significantly associated with obesity only in nonmanual workers (aOR 1.20, 95% CI 1.01-1.42). When we controlled working type in the model, manual workers who work more than 60 hours show higher likelihood of being obese (OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.02-1.18).
CONCLUSION: Working fewer (<40) or more than (>60) hours per week is significantly associated with obesity in the Korean female working population, regardless of the type of work. The type of work (day vs. night/shift work) was significantly associated with obesity only in only nonmanual workers."
26667152,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26667152/,"PURPOSE: Individuals following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) with concomitant meniscal pathology have a higher risk of developing knee osteoarthritis (OA) compared to those with isolated ACLR. Knee extensor weakness and altered dynamic knee joint biomechanics have been suggested to play a role in the development of knee OA following ACLR. This study investigated whether these factors differ in people following ACLR who have concomitant meniscal pathology compared to patients with isolated ACLR.
METHODS: Thirty-three patients with isolated ACLR and 34 patients with ACLR and meniscal pathology underwent strength and gait assessment 12-24 months post-operatively. Primary measures were peak isometric knee extensor torque and knee adduction moment (peak and impulse). Secondary measures included peak knee flexion moment and knee kinematics (sagittal and transverse).
RESULTS: There were no between-group differences in knee extensor strength [mean difference (95 % CI) 0.09 (-0.23 to 0.42) Nm/kg, n.s.], peak knee adduction moment [-0.02 (-0.54 to 0.49) Nm/(BW × HT) %, n.s.] or knee adduction moment impulse [0.01 (-0.15 to 0.17) Nm/(BW × HT) %, p = n.s.]. No between-group differences were found for any secondary measures.
CONCLUSIONS: No evidence was found to suggest that the higher prevalence of OA in patients with ACLR and meniscal pathology compared to patients with isolated ACLR is attributed to reduced knee muscle strength or altered knee joint biomechanics assessed 1-2 years post-surgery. Given that there is a higher incidence of knee OA in patients with concomitant meniscal pathology and ACLR, further investigation is needed so that population-specific rehabilitation protocols can be developed.

26667471,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26667471/,"INTRODUCTION: Ex vivo experiments in extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) circuits have identified octanol-water partition coefficient (logP, a marker of lipophilicity) and protein binding (PB) as key drug factors affecting pharmacokinetics (PK) during ECMO. Using ovine models, in this study we investigated whether these drug properties can be used to predict PK alterations of antimicrobial drugs during ECMO.
METHODS: Single-dose PK sampling was performed in healthy sheep (HS, n = 7), healthy sheep on ECMO (E24H, n = 7) and sheep with smoke inhalation acute lung injury on ECMO (SE24H, n = 6). The sheep received eight study antimicrobials (ceftriaxone, gentamicin, meropenem, vancomycin, doripenem, ciprofloxacin, fluconazole, caspofungin) that exhibit varying degrees of logP and PB. Plasma drug concentrations were determined using validated chromatographic techniques. PK data obtained from a non-compartmental analysis were used in a linear regression model to predict PK parameters based on logP and PB.
RESULTS: We found statistically significant differences in pH, haemodynamics, fluid balance and plasma proteins between the E24H and SE24H groups (p < 0.001). logP had a strong positive linear relationship with steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) in both the E24H and SE24H groups (p < 0.001) but not in the HS group (p = 0.9) and no relationship with clearance (CL) in all study groups. Although we observed an increase in CL for highly PB drugs in ECMO sheep, PB exhibited a weaker negative linear relationship with both CL (HS, p = 0.01; E24H, p < 0.001; SE24H, p < 0.001) and Vss (HS, p = 0.01; E24H, p = 0.004; SE24H, p = 0.05) in the final model.
CONCLUSIONS: Lipophilic antimicrobials are likely to have an increased Vss and decreased CL during ECMO. Protein-bound antimicrobial agents are likely to have reductions both in CL and Vss during ECMO. The strong relationship between lipophilicity and Vss seen in both the E24H and SE24H groups indicates circuit sequestration of lipophilic drugs. These findings highlight the importance of drug factors in predicting antimicrobial drug PK during ECMO and should be a consideration when performing and interpreting population PK studies."

METHODS: HA was measured by a particle-enhanced turbidimetric immunoassay (PETIA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in a 40-sample dilution series and 39 intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Agreement was assessed with Bland-Altman's method.
RESULTS: In the ICU patients, the median HA concentration was 159.0 ng/ml (interquartile range (IQR) 117.5-362.5 ng/ml) with ELISA and 157.5 ng/ml (IQR 92.5-359.6 ng/ml) with PETIA. The mean difference was 12.88 ng/ml (95% CI, -4.3 to 30.1 ng/ml, P = 0.14) and the 95% limits of agreement were -91.17 to 116.9 ng/ml. In the dilution series, the mean difference was -59.26 ng/ml (95% CI, -74.68 to 43.84 ng/ml, P < 0.0001) and the 95% limits of agreement were 35.23 to -153.8 ng/ml.
CONCLUSION: We found random variation between the PETIA and ELISA test that could affect performance in a clinical context, but only to a lesser extent in a research context. The new clinical biochemistry assay for HA determination will allow for large studies of the clinical utility of HA."

METHODS: Data from patients admitted with obstructing colon cancer between 2000 and 2012 were analyzed retrospectively. Patients underwent either SEMS placement as a bridge to surgery (stent group, n = 67) or emergency surgery (surgery group, n = 35). Surgical and oncologic outcomes of the groups were compared.
RESULTS: Placement of SEMS was technically successful in 98.5% and clinically successful in 89.6% of cases. There were eight (11.9%) stent-related complications, including three migrations (4.5%), four occlusions (6.0%), and one perforation (1.5%). The stent group had a higher laparoscopic resection rate (67.2 vs. 31.4%, p = 0.001) with a lower conversion rate (4.3 vs. 35.3%, p = 0.003). The wound infection rate was significantly higher in the surgery group (37.1 vs. 11.9%, p = 0.003) with no differences in the rate of other complications. The rates of local recurrence and distant metastasis, recurrence-free, and overall survival were not significantly different between the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Stenting and elective surgery was associated with a higher laparoscopy rate, a lower conversion rate, and a lower wound infection rate compared to emergency surgery but did not affect recurrence or survival."
26668349,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26668349/,"PURPOSE: Patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who are in morphologic complete remission are typically considered separately from patients with active disease (ie, ≥ 5% marrow blasts by morphology) in treatment algorithms for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), which implies distinct outcomes for these two groups. It is well recognized that the presence of minimal residual disease (MRD) at the time of transplantation is associated with adverse post-HCT outcome for those patients in morphologic remission. This effect of pre-HCT MRD prompted us to compare outcomes in consecutive patients in MRD-positive remission with patients with active AML who underwent myeloablative allogeneic HCT at our institution.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively studied 359 consecutive adults with AML who underwent myeloablative allogeneic HCT from a peripheral blood or bone marrow donor between 2006 and 2014. Pre-HCT disease staging included 10-color multiparametric flow cytometry on bone marrow aspirates in all patients. Any level of residual disease was considered to be MRD positive.
RESULTS: Three-year relapse estimates were 67% in 76 patients in MRD-positive morphologic remission and 65% in 48 patients with active AML compared with 22% in 235 patients in MRD-negative remission. Three-year overall survival estimates were 26%, 23%, and 73% in these three groups, respectively. After multivariable adjustment, MRD-negative remission status remained statistically significantly associated with longer overall and progression-free survival as well as lower risk of relapse compared with MRD-positive morphologic remission status or having active disease, with similar outcomes between the latter two groups.
CONCLUSION: The similarities in outcomes between patients in MRD-positive morphologic remission and those with active disease at the time of HCT support the use of treatment algorithms that use MRD- rather than morphology-based disease assessments."
26668415,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26668415/,"OBJECTIVE: Diabetes is highly prevalent in individuals with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Current NICE guidelines recommend diabetes screening of hyperglycaemic patients using a fasting plasma glucose after 4 days from admission. In 2012 the World Health Organisation (WHO) approved the use of HbA1c in the diagnosis and targeted screening for type 2 diabetes. We introduced a service improvement project using HbA1c for diabetes screening in patients with no previous diagnosis of diabetes admitted with ACS regardless of glycaemic state.
METHOD: An initial retrospective audit utilised 21 months of data from the MINAP database to identify patients meeting current NICE criteria for diabetes screening. A prospective service improvement project was undertaken over a 4 month period using HbA1c as a universal screening test to categorise ACS patients based on WHO criteria.
RESULTS: The retrospective audit identified 93 of 420 (22%) patients with pre-existing diabetes and 8 of the remaining 327 (2.4%) were hyperglycaemic, thus meeting NICE criteria for diabetes screening. In the service improvement project 2/49 patients (4%) met NICE criteria for diabetes screening. Twenty six of these 49 patients had a HbA1c test on admission and 17/26 (65.4%) were classified as probable diabetes or high risk.
CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of ACS patients have diabetes, which may be undetected by current NICE criteria. Universal HbA1c testing offers utility as a simple and effective screening test for diabetes in the ACS population."
26669760,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26669760/,"BACKGROUND: Tracheostomy is recommended for patients receiving mechanical ventilation (MV) for 14 days or more in the intensive care unit (ICU). Nevertheless, many patients undergoing prolonged MV remain intubated via the translaryngeal route. The aim of this study was to examine the influence of tracheostomy and persistent translaryngeal intubation on short-term outcomes in patients mechanically ventilated for ≥14 days.
METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted using the admissions database of a 75-bed ICU from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2012. Patients who required prolonged MV without tracheostomy at the time of initiation of a ventilator were included. The outcomes were successful weaning, and ICU and in-hospital death. Cox models were constructed to calculate the influence of tracheostomy on the outcome measures while adjusting for other potentially confounding factors.
RESULTS: Of the 508 patients requiring prolonged MV, 164 were tracheostomized after a median 18 days of MV. Patients in whom translaryngeal intubation was maintained had significantly higher ICU (42.7% versus 17.1%, p <0.001) and in-hospital (54.1% versus 22.0%, p <0.001) mortality rates, and a significantly lower successful weaning rate (40.4% versus 68.9%, p <0.001). The results were consistent after matching for the propensity score of performing tracheostomy. Furthermore, a time-dependent covariate Cox model showed that a tracheostomy was independently associated with lower in-hospital mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.26; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.18-0.39) and higher successful weaning rate (aHR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.56-2.68).
CONCLUSIONS: Tracheostomy is associated with lower in-hospital mortality and higher successful weaning rates in ICU patients receiving prolonged MV. However, the cost-effectiveness and long-term outcomes of tracheostomy for this cohort require further study."

METHODS: Data from a German noninterventional study of patients with PsA starting treatment with ADA were analyzed retrospectively for effects of concomitant MTX on key outcomes, including Disease Activity Score-28 joints, tender and swollen joint counts, skin assessments, and safety. Patients were categorized into those with symptoms of axial involvement and those with no symptoms of axial involvement as judged by the examining clinician.
RESULTS: A total of 1455 patients met the study criteria, 296 with axial involvement (ADA monotherapy = 165; plus MTX = 131) and 1159 with no axial involvement (ADA monotherapy = 658; plus MTX = 501). ADA, alone or combined with MTX, resulted in strong and comparable reductions in disease activity measures in patients with and those without axial disease over 24 months of therapy. In multiple regression analyses, concomitant MTX did not affect joint or skin outcomes in either the group with axial manifestations or the group without axial disease. Neither adverse event rates nor withdrawal rates were significantly influenced by concomitant MTX.
CONCLUSION: ADA is an effective treatment option for patients with PsA with or without axial involvement. Compared with ADA monotherapy, the use of concomitant MTX with ADA does not improve articular or skin outcomes in patients with PsA regardless of axial symptoms.

METHODS: Twenty-three CD1 mice underwent severe TBI by controlled cortical impact and were randomized to one of four groups receiving either monoclonal antibody against HMGB1 (MAb) or isotype (Iso) and either ENX (1 mg/kg) or normal saline (NS): NS + Iso (n = 5), NS + MAb (n = 6), ENX + Iso (n = 6), ENX + MAb (n = 6). ENX or NS was administered 2, 8, 14, 23 and 32 hours after TBI. MAb or Iso (25 μg) was administered 2 hours after TBI. At 48 hours, cerebral intravital microscopy served to visualize live LEU interacting with endothelium and microvascular fluorescein isothiocyanate-albumin leakage. The Neurological Severity Score (NSS) graded neurologic recovery; wet-to-dry ratios determined cerebral/lung edema. Analysis of variance with Bonferroni correction was used for statistical analyses.
RESULTS: ENX and MAb similarly reduced in vivo pial LEU rolling without demonstrating additive effect. In vivo albumin leakage was greatest in vehicle-treated animals but decreased by 25% with either MAb or ENX but by 50% when both were combined. Controlled cortical impact-induced cerebral wet-to-dry ratios were reduced by MAb or ENX without additive effect. Postinjury lung water was reduced by ENX but not by MAb. Neurologic recovery at 24 hours and 48 hours was similarly improved with ENX, MAb, or both treatments combined.
CONCLUSION: Mirroring ENX, HMGB1 signaling blockade reduces LEU recruitment, cerebrovascular permeability, and cerebral edema following TBI. ENX further reduced lung edema indicating a multifaceted effect beyond HMGB1 blockade. Further study is needed to determine how ENX may play a role in blunting HMGB1 signaling in brain injury patients."
26670358,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26670358/,"OBJECTIVES: Sickness absence in workplaces may reflect working conditions. It may also reflect a ""healthy hire effect,"" i.e., that workplaces recruit individuals with experience of sickness absence differently. The purpose of the study was to determine if a history of sickness absence among recruits is associated with the average level of sickness absence in workplaces.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a register-based follow-up study, Swedish workplaces with at least 5 employees in 2006 were selected (approximately 127 000 workplaces with 3.9 million employees). The workplaces were categorized according to the average workplace sickness absence in 2006 and the recruits were categorized according to the individual sickness absence in 2005. The workplaces with a high average level of sickness absence were more likely than those with a low level to hire employees with high sickness absence in the year preceding employment: men - odds ratio (OR) = 7.2, 95% confidence interval (CI): 6.6-7.8, women - OR = 7.5, 95% CI: 6.9-8.1.
RESULTS: The results show that there is a greater likelihood of employing individuals with high levels of sickness absence in the workplaces with many days of the average sickness absence than in the workplaces with few days of the average sickness absence.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that sickness absence in workplaces may reflect a healthy hire effect."

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, observational cohort study.
SETTING: Fourteen ICUs from 10 French university teaching and nonacademic hospitals.
PATIENTS: Consecutive adult patients with septic shock admitted between November 2009 and September 2011 were eligible.
INTERVENTION: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of the 1,495 eligible patients, 1,486 (99.4%) were included. Simplified Acute Physiology Score II score of greater than or equal to 56, immunosuppression, age of more than 65 years, cirrhosis, bacteremia (p ≤ 0.001 for each), and urinary sepsis (p = 0.005) were globally associated with an increased risk of thrombocytopenia within the first 24 hours following the onset of septic shock. Survival at day 28 estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method was lower in patients with thrombocytopenia and decreased with thrombocytopenia severity. By multivariate Cox regression, a platelet count of less than or equal to 100,000/mm3 was independently associated with a significantly increased risk of death within the 28 days following septic shock onset. The risk of death increased with the severity of thrombocytopenia (hazard ratio, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.31-2.08 for a platelet count below 50,000/mm3 vs > 150,000/mm3; p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to investigate thrombocytopenia within the first 24 hours of septic shock onset as a prognostic marker of survival at day 28 in a large cohort of ICU patients. Measuring platelet count is inexpensive and easily feasible for the physician in routine practice, and thus, it could represent an easy ""alert system"" among patients in septic shock."

METHODS: We demonstrate the different techniques and practical application of the repair and evaluate the benefits and limitations.
RESULTS: The Mercedes flap and its modifications are an excellent method for repairing various defects in problem locations after tumour surgery of the skin.
CONCLUSION: The Mercedes flap and its modifications prove to be a good alternative to other closure types, especially in problem regions such as the shoulder, malleolar region, heel, etc. The procedure is fast and simple, with few side-effects, and proves to be a 'workhorse' flap for the dermatological surgeon."
26670719,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26670719/,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe how pharmacists utilise and perceive delegation in the community setting.
METHOD: Non-participant observations and semi-structured interviews with a convenience sample of community pharmacists working in Kent between July and October 2011. Content analysis was undertaken to determine key themes and the point of theme saturation informed sample size. Findings from observations were also compared against those from interviews.
KEY FINDINGS: Observations and interviews were undertaken with 11 pharmacists. Observations showed that delegation occurred in four different forms: assumed, active, partial and reverse. It was also employed to varying extents within the different pharmacies. Interviews revealed mixed views on delegation. Some pharmacists presented positive attitudes towards delegation while others were concerned about maintaining accountability for delegated tasks, particularly in terms of accuracy checking of dispensed medication. Other pharmacists noted the ability to delegate was not a skill they found inherently easy. Comparison of observation and interview data highlighted discrepancies between tasks pharmacists perceived they delegated and what they actually delegated.
CONCLUSIONS: Effective delegation can potentially promote better management of workload to provide pharmacists with additional time to spend on cognitive pharmaceutical services. To do this, pharmacists' reluctance to delegate must be addressed. Lack of insight into own practice might be helped by self-reflection and feedback from staff. Also, a greater understanding of legal accountability in the context of delegation needs to be achieved. Finally, delegation is not just dependent on pharmacists, but also on support staff; ensuring staff are empowered and equipped to take on delegated roles is essential."
26670910,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26670910/,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Early seizures (ESs) in patients with nontraumatic spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) are a frequent complication. The aims of this study were to determine the frequency of ESs in patients with sICH and to investigate the association of ESs with outcomes in a monocenter study.
METHODS: During a 5-year period (2009-2013), 484 consecutive patients (mean age 72.3 ± 12.6; female sex 51%) with sICH who were admitted to the Department of Neurology at the University of Lübeck, Germany were enrolled and prospectively evaluated.
RESULTS: A total of 52 patients (10.7%; 95% CI 8-14) experienced ESs during a mean hospitalization of 12 days. Patients with ESs were less affected on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale at admission than those without ESs (7 vs. 10; p = 0.02). With the exception of the localization of hemorrhage (p = 0.008), differences in the baseline characteristics between patients with ESs and those without ESs were not found. The logistic regression analysis revealed an increased ES rate in patients with cortical hemispheric sICH (OR 3.5; 95% CI 1.8-6.7; p < 0.001). During hospitalization, 109 patients (23%) died and the in-hospital mortality was lower in patients with ESs than those without (9.6 vs. 24.0%, respectively; p = 0.02). An association between ESs and good functional outcome on the modified Rankin Scale ≤ 2 was not found (p = 0.3).
CONCLUSION: ESs appear to be correlated with hemorrhage localization and associated with survival of the sICH."
26671226,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26671226/,"BACKGROUND: Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) are often used to make judgements about the relative cost-effectiveness of competing interventions and require an understanding of the relationship between health and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) when measured in utility terms. There is a dearth of information in the literature concerning how childhood overweight is associated with quality of life when this is measured using utilities. This study explores how weight is associated with utility-based HRQOL in 5-6 year olds and examines the psychometric properties of a newly developed pediatric utility measure - the CHU9D instrument.
METHODS: Weight and HRQOL were examined using data collected from 1334 children recruited within a UK randomised controlled trial (WAVES) (ISRCTN97000586). Utility-based HRQOL was measured using the CHU9D, and general HRQOL measured using the PedsQL instrument. The association between weight and HRQOL was examined through a series of descriptive and multivariate analysis. The construct validity of the CHU9D was further assessed in relation to weight status, in direct comparison to the PedsQL instrument.
RESULTS: The HRQOL of children who were either overweight or obese was not statistically different from children who were healthy or underweight. This result was the same for when HRQOL was measured in utility terms using the CHU9D instrument, and in general terms using the PedsQL instrument. Furthermore, the results support the construct validity of the newly developed CHU9D as the PedsQL total HRQOL scores corresponded well with the individual CHU9D dimensions.
CONCLUSION: At age 5-6 years, the inverse association between overweight and HRQOL is not being captured by either the utility-based CHU9D instrument nor the PedsQL instrument. This result has implications for how the cost-effectiveness of childhood obesity interventions is measured in children aged 5-6 years.

26671424,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26671424/,"BACKGROUND: Differences in cognitive development have been observed across a variety of ethnic minority groups but relatively little is known about the persistence of these developmental inequalities over time or generations.
METHODS: A repeat cross-sectional analysis assessed cognitive ability scores of children aged 3, 5 and 7 years from the longitudinal UK Millennium Cohort Study (white UK born n=7630; Indian n=248; Pakistani n=328; Bangladeshi n=87; black Caribbean n=172; and black African n=136). Linear regression estimated ethnic differences in age normed scores at each time point. Multivariable logistic regression estimated within-group generational differences in test scores at each age adjusting stepwise for sociodemographic factors, maternal health behaviours, indicators of the home learning environment and parenting styles.
RESULTS: The majority of ethnic minority groups scored lower than the white UK born reference group at 3 years with these differences narrowing incrementally at ages 5 and 7 years. However, the black Caribbean group scored significantly lower than the white UK born reference group throughout early childhood. At 3 years, Pakistani, black Caribbean and black African children with UK born mothers had significantly higher test scores than those with foreign born mothers after baseline adjustment for maternal age and child gender. Controlling for social, behavioural and parenting factors attenuated this generational advantage. By 7 years there were no significant generational differences in baseline models.
CONCLUSIONS: Ethnic differences in cognitive development diminish throughout childhood for the majority of groups. Cumulative exposure to the UK environment may be associated with higher cognitive development scores."
26671629,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26671629/,"OBJECTIVE: To assess whether mentored simulation-based-training can improve the procedural skills of beginners in coronary interventional procedures.
BACKGROUND: Simulation based-catheter training is a valuable tool to practice interventional procedures. Whether this type of training enhances the procedural skills of fellows learning percutaneous coronary interventions has never been studied.
METHODS: Eighteen cardiology fellows were randomized either into the simulation-based training (n = 9) or the control group (n = 9). The simulation group received 7.5 hours of virtual reality (VR) simulation training, whereas the control group attended 4.5 hours of lectures. Each participant had to perform a simple (pre-evaluation) and a more complex (post-evaluation) catheter intervention on a pulsatile coronary flow model in a catheterization laboratory. All procedures were videotaped, analyzed, and rated by 3 expert interventionalists, who were blinded to the randomization. To assess the individual performance level, a ""skills score"" was determined, comprising 14 performance characteristics (5-level Likert scale, maximum score of 70 points).
RESULTS: The ""skills score"" increased by 5.8 ± 6.1 points in the VR simulation group and decreased by 6.7 ± 8.4 in the control group (P = 0.003) from the simple stenosis at pre- to the more complex lesion at post-evaluation demonstrating the effectiveness of simulation-based training.
CONCLUSION: This pilot study suggests that curriculum-based mentored VR simulation training improves the performance level of cardiology fellows in coronary interventions. Further investigation to evaluate the effect on clinical outcomes is warranted."
26671737,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26671737/,"BACKGROUND: Cadherin-17 (intestinal peptide-associated transporter) and SATB2 (SATB homeobox 2) immunoexpression has recently been described in surgical pathology to have value in establishing the colorectal origin of metastatic adenocarcinoma. However, to the authors' knowledge, the role of these markers in metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma (MCA) in cytology has not been addressed to date. In the current study, the authors evaluated the contribution of cadherin-17 and SATB2 to the diagnosis of MCA in cytology specimens and compared these two novel markers with the standard gastrointestinal immunohistochemistry panel in an attempt to identify the optimal panel.
METHODS: A total of 43 MCA cytology cases and 68 metastatic noncolorectal adenocarcinoma (non-MCA) cytology controls were stained for SATB2; cadherin-17; and the standard panel of cytokeratin (CK) 7, CK20, and Caudal-Type Homeobox Transcription Factor 2 (CDX2). Staining intensity and percentage of positive cells were recorded. Sensitivity and specificity values for immunostains individually and in combination were computed and compared.
RESULTS: Despite specificities of 83.8% and 91.2%, respectively, for cadherin-17 and SATB2, when critically examining the new immunostains together with the standard panel, there was no significant difference noted with regard to prediction of MCA (vs non-MCA) compared with the standard panel alone (P < .6).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study reinforce that the standard gastrointestinal immunohistochemistry panel remains the gold standard for distinguishing MCA from non-MCA in cytology."

PARTICIPANTS: A total of 275 patients with stable COPD and aged 40-85 years were enrolled. Diagnosis of hypercapnia was confirmed by blood gas analysis. Patients with near-terminal illness or comorbidities that affect PaCO2 (obstructive sleep apnoea, obesity-related hypoventilation, or neuromuscular disease) were excluded. The outcome of 98 patients with normocapnia and 177 with chronic hypercapnia was analysed.

26672104,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26672104/,"BACKGROUND: Capsular contracture remains a common and dreaded complication of breast augmentation. The etiology of capsular contracture is believed to be multi-factorial, and its causes may include biofilm formation due to implant/pocket contamination with skin flora. It has been shown that insertion funnel use reduces skin contact and potential contamination by 27-fold in a cadaver model. After incorporating the funnel into our surgical protocols, we anecdotally believed we were experiencing fewer capsular contractures in our augmentation practices.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that capsular contracture related reoperation rates decreased after insertion funnel adoption using data from multiple practices.
METHODS: At seven participating centers, we retrospectively reviewed the surgical records from March 2006 to December 2012 for female patients who had undergone primary breast augmentation with silicone gel implants. Group 1 consisted of consecutive augmentations done without the insertion funnel, and Group 2 consisted of consecutive augmentations done with the insertion funnel. The primary outcome variable was development of grade III or IV capsular contracture that led to reoperation within 12 months.
RESULTS: A total of 1177 breast augmentations met inclusion criteria for Group 1 and 1620 breast augmentations for Group 2. The rate of reoperation due to capsular contracture was higher without use of the insertion funnel (1.49%), compared to Group 2 with funnel use (0.68%), a 54% reduction (P = 0.004).
CONCLUSIONS: The insertion funnel group experienced a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of reoperations performed due to capsular contracture within 12 months of primary breast augmentation."
26672701,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26672701/,"INTRODUCTION: Orthodontic patients can experience pain and discomfort on the oral mucosa from trauma caused by friction with the brackets and the wires. In this split-mouth design, single-blind randomized controlled trial, we aimed to investigate whether brackets with a self-snapping customized plastic shield would induce less mucosa alteration and discomfort than those without the shield.
METHODS: The overall sample comprised 42 patients (22 female, 20 male) from a government-funded orthodontic practice, with a mean age of 16.7 years. Eligibility criteria included, among others, no history of mouth ulcers or systemic diseases. Customized shields for the maxillary and mandibular brackets were fabricated and inserted on one side of the mouth. The null hypothesis was that bracket shielding would have no advantage. The primary outcomes were mucosal and discomfort assessments. As the secondary outcome, the numbers of spontaneous detachments of the shields were reported. Treatment allocation was mainly implemented using a random number table for selection of the intervention side. Only the raters in charge of assessing the oral mucosa were blinded to the side of the mouth where the shields had been placed. The mucosa was assessed by 3 calibrated raters at the following time points: immediately before bracket placement (baseline assessment, T0), 3 days after delivering the shields (direct assessment of intervention, T1), and 4 days after removal of the shields (indirect assessment of intervention, T2). The raters used a newly devised yardstick in which the higher the score, the more severe the alteration. Discomfort was assessed at T1 and T2 using a visual analog scale. The Mann-Whitney U test was performed at the 5% level of significance.
RESULTS: Of 60 patients, 42 were eligible, and 35 were randomly selected to have one side of the mouth receive the intervention. Two patients discontinued the intervention at T1, and 5 stopped at T2. Seven additional patients were recruited and completed all time points. Thus, 42 patients participated at T0, 40 at T1, and 35 at T2. Thirty-five patients participated at all time points. At T1, no statistically significant difference in terms of mucosa alteration was observed between the 2 sides (median of all differences [MD], 0.0; 95% CI, 0.0-1.0; P = 0.11). The same occurred at T2 (MD, 0.0; 95% CI, 0.0-0.0; P = 1.00). The comfort level was statistically higher at T1 on the shielded side (MD, 14.0; 95% CI, 1.0-36.0; P = 0.04), whereas no difference was observed at T2 (MD, 0.0; 95% CI, 0.0-1.0, P = 0.81). No serious harm was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: The customized bracket shields were effective in reducing discomfort during the first 3 days of orthodontic treatment despite no significant difference in terms of visible mucosa alteration.
REGISTRATION: This trial was not registered.
PROTOCOL: The protocol was not published before trial commencement.
FUNDING: Expenses for the fabrication of the shields were covered by the main author (L.P.B.P.). Orthodontic materials were from the Center for Dental Specialties in Cajazeiras, Brazil."

METHODS: Out of 86 patients meeting the inclusion criteria for alcohol dependence with suspicion of comorbid anxiety and/or depressive disorder, 57 completed a 3-week stabilization period (abstinence or significantly reduced consumption). Of these patients, 37 (65%) met a formal diagnostic assessment of an anxiety and/or depressive disorder and were randomized to either (a) integrated intervention (cognitive behavioural therapy) for alcohol, anxiety and/or depression, or (b) usual counselling care for alcohol problems.
RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analyses revealed a beneficial treatment effect of integrated treatment relative to usual counselling care for the number of days to relapse (χ(2) = 6.42, P < 0.05) and lapse (χ(2) = 10.73, P < 0.01). In addition, there was a significant interaction effect of treatment and time for percentage days of abstinence (P < 0.05). For heavy drinking days, the treatment effect was mediated by changes in DASS anxiety (P < 0.05). There were no significant treatment interaction effects for DASS depression or anxiety symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: These results provide support for integrated care in improving drinking outcomes for patients with alcohol dependence and comorbid depression/anxiety disorder.

26673176,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26673176/,"BACKGROUND: Health policies are important instruments for improving population health. However, experience suggests that policies designed for the whole population do not always benefit the most vulnerable. Participation of vulnerable groups in the policy-making process provides an opportunity for them to influence decisions related to their health, and also to exercise their rights. This paper presents the findings from a study that explored how vulnerable groups and principles of human rights are incorporated into national sexual and reproductive health (SRH) policies of 4 selected countries (Spain, Scotland, Republic of Moldova, and Ukraine). It also aimed at discussing the involvement of vulnerable groups in SRH policy development from the perspective of policy-makers.
METHODS: Literature review, health policy analysis and 5 semi-structured interviews with policy-makers were carried out in this study. Content analysis of SRH policies was performed using the EquiFrame analytical framework.
RESULTS: The study revealed that vulnerable groups and core principles of human rights are differently addressed in SRH policies within 4 studied countries. The opinions of policy-makers on the importance of mentioning vulnerable groups in policy documents and the way they ought to be mentioned varied, but they agreed that a clear definition of vulnerability, practical examples, and evidences on health status of these groups have to be included. In addition, different approaches to vulnerable group's involvement in policy development were identified during the interviews and the range of obstacles to this process was discussed by respondents.
CONCLUSION: Incorporation of vulnerable groups in the SRH policies and their involvement in policy development were found to be important in addressing SRH of these groups and providing an opportunity for them to advocate for equal access to healthcare and exercise their rights. Future research on this topic should include representatives of vulnerable communities which could help to build a dialogue and present the problem from multiple perspectives."
26673844,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26673844/,"OBJECTIVES: Mortality for pediatric patients who require intensive care posthematopoietic stem cell transplant still remains high. Previously at our institution, survival rates were 44% for patients who required mechanical ventilation posthematopoietic stem cell transplant. We conducted a review of patients to identify whether there has been any improvement in survival over the past 12 years and to identify any risk factors that contribute to mortality.
DESIGN: Retrospective chart review.
SETTING: PICU and hematopoietic stem cell transplant unit of a single tertiary children's hospital.
PATIENTS: Children less than 18 years old undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant who required admission to the ICU between January 2000 and December 2011.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: There were 350 separate admissions to the ICU for 206 patients posthematopoietic stem cell transplant. Median Age was 9.3 years (range, 1-17 yr). Median time from hematopoietic stem cell transplant to admission was 35 days (interquartile range, 13-152 d), and 59% of patients were male. Survival to ICU discharge for all admissions was 75%, which equated to 57% of all patients. Of the admissions that required invasive mechanical ventilation, 48% survived to ICU discharge, with a survival to ICU discharge of 36% if there was more than one admission requiring mechanical ventilation. Survival to ICU discharge was 33% if renal replacement therapy was required. Mechanical ventilation, inotrope/vasopressor use, and number of organ dysfunction within an admission were predictors of mortality. Having an underlying malignant condition or an autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant was associated with a more favorable outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest single-center series for pediatric patients who require intensive care posthematopoietic stem cell transplant and demonstrates that this group of patients still faces high mortality. There has been an improvement in survival for those patients who require renal replacement therapy and also for patients who require mechanical ventilation more than once; however, the need for mechanical ventilation still remains a significant predictor of mortality."
26673849,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26673849/,"AIM: To assess the diagnostic concordance between endoscopic and histological atrophy in the United Kingdom and Japan.
METHODS: Using published data, a total of 252 patients, 126 in the United Kingdom and 126 in Japan, aged 20 to 80 years, were evaluated. The extent of endoscopic atrophy was classified into five subgroups according to a modified Kimura-Takemoto classification system and was compared with histological findings of atrophy at five biopsy sites according to the updated Sydney system.
RESULTS: The strength of agreement of the extent of atrophy between histology and visual endoscopic inspection showed good reproducibility, with a weighted kappa value of 0.76 (P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that three factors were associated with decreased concordance: Japanese ethnicity [odds ratio (OR) 0.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11-0.43], older age (OR = 0.32, 95%CI: 0.16-0.66) and endoscopic atrophy (OR = 0.10, 95%CI: 0.03-0.36). The strength of agreement between endoscopic and histological atrophy, assessed by cancer risk-oriented grading, was reproducible, with a kappa value of 0.81 (95%CI: 0.75-0.87). Only nine patients (3.6%) were endoscopically underdiagnosed with antral predominant rather than extensive atrophy and were considered false negatives.
CONCLUSION: Endoscopic grading can predict histological atrophy with few false negatives, indicating that precancerous conditions can be identified during screening endoscopy, particularly in patients in western countries."

The water for the tests was collected from a sterile cup-filling tap (municipal water) and from an air/water syringe (demineralized water). The bacteria were cultured according to the Polish Standards - PN-EN ISO 6222, PN-EN ISO 9308-1, and PN-EN ISO 16266.
RESULTS: In the tested samples of water numerous psychrophilic bacteria (max 29 100 CFU/ml) and mesophilic bacteria (max 24 700 CFU/ml), including single coliforms, were found.
CONCLUSIONS: The results show that water delivered to a dental unit should be periodically tested bacteriologically and in terms of physical and chemical properties. Water systems of dental units should also be periodically disinfected to eliminate bacteria and biofilm."
26674982,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26674982/,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Combination therapy with peginterferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) has been recommended as a standard therapy for patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV). Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) against RBV-associated hemolytic anemia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred and forty HCV patients included in the study were randomized to either the EPA group (n=120) or non-EPA group (n=120), and they received combination therapy with or without EPA. We compare changes in hemoglobin levels with RBV dose reduction rate in each group as well as treatment response.
RESULTS: Of 120 patients randomized to receive combination therapy with EPA, 15/86 (17.5%) patients required RBV dose reduction, whereas 71/86 (82.5%) patients did not require RBV dose reduction; in the non-EPA group, 22/80 (27.5%) patients required RBV dose reduction and 58/80 (72.5%) patients did not require RBV dose reduction. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the rates of virologic response.
CONCLUSION: EPA can decrease the rate of RBV dose reduction and RBV-induced hemolysis during the course of combination treatment. Further trials are required to investigate the role of EPA in the current regimens of HCV treatment that include ribavirin."
26675095,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26675095/,"BACKGROUND: Liver transplantation may be associated with severe bleeding that requires intensive fluid management. Aggressive fluid administration could result in hemodilution, triggering dilutional coagulopathy that intensifies bleeding. Colloids are plasma expanders used in daily practice. Fibrinogen, malfunctioning in liver cirrhosis, is the earliest decreasing clotting factor while bleeding. Fibrinogen supplementation is recommended as the first-choice therapy in such cases. Therefore, the influence of hemodilution on fibrin clot formation among patients with liver cirrhosis was analyzed, followed by the assessment of fibrinogen supplementation in clot restitution.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Blood collected from 22 patients with post-inflammatory liver cirrhosis was diluted up to 30% and 60% with crystalloid (0.9% NaCl) or colloid (6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4), followed by fibrinogen supplementation corresponding to an overall dose of 4 g. The influence of hemodilution on plasma fibrinogen concentration and on thromboelastometry FIBTEM test was analyzed, as well as the influence of fibrinogen supplementation.
RESULTS: Hemodilution lowers fibrinogen concentration and decreases fibrin clot formation. The higher the grade of dilution, the more profound the disturbances observed; 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 cause more intense effect on fibrin clot formation than 0.9% NaCl. Fibrinogen supplementation improves fibrin clot formation as assessed in FIBTEM.
CONCLUSIONS: Fibrinogen supplementation among patients with liver cirrhosis might improve fibrin clot formation during hemodilution. Fibrinogen supplementation might by considered as a possible treatment of coagulopathy during liver transplantation, but further clinical studies need to be performed."
26675774,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26675774/,"BACKGROUND: An understanding of whether homocysteine is a cause or a marker of increased blood pressure is relevant because blood homocysteine can be effectively lowered by safe and inexpensive interventions (e.g., vitamin B-6, B-9, and B-12 supplementation).
OBJECTIVE: The aim was to assess the causal influence of homocysteine on systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP, respectively) in adults with the use of Mendelian randomization (MR).
DESIGN: Data from the 1982 Pelotas Birth Cohort (Brazil) were used. A total of 4297 subjects were evaluated in 2004-2005 (mean age: 22.8 y). The association of homocysteine concentration with SBP and DBP was assessed by conventional ordinary least-squares (OLS) linear regression and 2-stage least-squares (2SLS) regression (MR analysis). The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T (rs1801133) was used as proxy for homocysteine concentration. We also applied MR to data from the International Consortium for Blood Pressure (ICBP) genomewide association studies (>69,000 participants) using rs1801133 and additional homocysteine-associated SNPs as instruments.
RESULTS: In OLS regression, a 1-SD unit increase in log homocysteine concentration was associated with an increase of 0.9 (95% CI: 0.4, 1.4) mm Hg in SBP and of 1.0 (95% CI: 0.6, 1.4) mm Hg in DBP. In 2SLS regression, for the same increase in homocysteine, the coefficients were -1.8 mm Hg for SBP (95% CI: -3.9, 0.4 mm Hg; P = 0.01) and 0.1 mm Hg for DBP (95% CI: -1.5, 1.7 mm Hg; P = 0.24). In the MR analysis of ICBP data, homocysteine concentration was not associated with SBP (β = 0.6 mm Hg for each 1-SD unit increase in log homocysteine; 95% CI: -0.8, 1.9 mm Hg) but was positively associated with DBP (β = 1.1 mm Hg; 95% CI: 0.2, 1.9 mm Hg). The association of genetically increased homocysteine with DBP was not consistent across different SNPs.
CONCLUSION: Overall, the present findings do not corroborate the hypothesis that homocysteine has a causal role in blood pressure, especially in SBP."
26675940,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26675940/,"BACKGROUND: Enhanced recovery pathways have become standard practice after elective colorectal surgery to improve postoperative care while reducing length of stay in hospital. However, there is concern that early discharge may result in increased rates of adverse events including readmission. This study aims to determine whether it is safe to discharge patients on postoperative day 1 or 2 if they have undergone an elective colorectal operation for cancer.
METHODS: The 2012 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program dataset was used. The study included patients who underwent elective colorectal cancer surgery and were discharged on postoperative day (POD) 1 or 2 (expedited early discharge) versus POD 3 or 4 (standard early discharge). Patients who had metastases, concurrent procedures including ostomy creation, or died during admission were excluded. Primary outcomes were 30-day adverse events (serious complications, mortality and reoperations) and readmission rates, which were analyzed using multivariable regression.
RESULTS: A total of 305 and 2277 patients were identified in the expedited and standard early discharge groups, respectively. There were 6 (1.97 %) adverse events and 16 (5.56 %) readmissions in the expedited group, compared to 59 (2.59 %) and 135 (6.24 %) in the standard group. No statistical difference was found between the cohorts with respect to 30-day adverse events (OR 0.93, p = 0.87, 95 % CI [0.41-2.12]) or readmission rate (OR 1.03, p = 0.90, 95 % CI [0.61-1.76]).
CONCLUSION: Patients discharged by POD 2 after elective oncologic colon resections did not have significantly more adverse events or readmissions compared to patients discharged later. Select patients may be safely discharged earlier."
26676492,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26676492/,"INTRODUCTION: Insects of the subfamily Triatominae are vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi , the Chagas disease parasite, and their flying behavior has epidemiological importance. The flying capacity is strikingly different across and within Triatominae species, as well as between sexes or individuals. Many Triatoma infestans individuals have wings but no flying muscles. In other Triatominae species, no clear relationships were found between wing length and flying behavior. If wing presence or size is not reflective of the flying behavior, which other parts of the body could be considered as reliable markers of this important function?
METHODS: The genus Mepraia has exceptional characteristics with invariably wingless females and wingless or winged males. We calculated the porous surface exposed to odorant molecules to estimate the olfactory capacity of Mepraia spinolai . The head shape and thorax size were estimated using the geometric morphometric approach and traditional morphometric techniques, respectively.
RESULTS: Alary polymorphism in M. spinolai was significantly associated with consistent modification of the thorax size, head shape, and notable change in the estimated olfactory capacity. The macropterous individuals had a larger olfactory surface and thorax size and significantly different head shape compared to those of the micropterous individuals.
CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that these structural changes could be associated with the flying potential of Triatominae. Thus, morphological attributes not found on wings could help determine the likely flying potential of the bugs."
26676502,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26676502/,"INTRODUCTION: The human T-lymphotropic virus-1 (HTLV-1) is associated with chronic inflammatory diseases such as HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), a chronic inflammatory disease. Disturbances in lipid metabolism are involved in inflammatory and demyelinating diseases.
METHODS: Plasma levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, and fractions of HTLV-1-infected individuals of both sexes with different clinical progressions were determined.
RESULTS: Elevated levels of triglyceride and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) were exclusively detected in HTLV-1-infected women from asymptomatic and HAM/TSP groups compared with uninfected individuals (p = 0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated triglyceride and VLDL levels in HTLV-1-infected women may be related to the predominance of HAM/TSP in women."
26676720,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26676720/,"PURPOSE: To compare the diagnostic accuracy of whole-body PET/CT and integrated PET/MR in relation to the total scan time durations.
METHODS: One hundred and twenty-three (123) patients (40 males and 83 females; mean age 59.6 years; range 20-83 years) with confirmed primary cancer and clinical suspicion of metastatic disease underwent whole-body 18F-FDG-PET/CT and 18F-FDG-PET/MR. Data acquisition was done after intravenous administration of 110-301 MBq radioactivity of 18F-FDG, and PET/MR data were acquired after the PET/CT data acquisition. The mean uptake times for PET/CT and PET/MR acquisition were 68.0 ± 8.0 and 98.0 ± 14 min, respectively. Total scan time was 20.0 and 25.0 min for whole-body PET/CT and PET/MR imaging.
RESULTS: The reconstructed PET/CT and PET/MR data detected 333/355 (93.8 %) common lesions in 111/123 (90.2 %) patients. PET/CT and PET/MR alone detected 348/355 and 340/355 lesions, respectively. No significant (p = 0.08) difference was observed for the overall detection efficiency between the two techniques. On the other hand, a significant difference was observed between the two techniques for the detection of lung (p = 0.003) and cerebrospinal (p = 0.007) lesions. The 15 lesions identified by PET/CT only included 8 lung, 3 lymph nodes, 2 bone, and 1 each of peritoneal and adrenal gland lesions. On the other hand, 7 (6 brain metastatic lesions and 1 bone lesion) were identified by PET/MR only.
CONCLUSION: Integrated PET/MR is a feasible whole-body imaging modality and may score better than PET/CT for the detection of brain metastases. To further prove diagnostic utility, this technique requires further clinical validation."

METHODS: Analyses were performed with longitudinal administrative data. We included persons aged 18-59 years, who started their retraining between January and June 2005. One- and 2-year program participants were matched by propensity scores.
RESULTS: The matched groups were balanced regarding all baseline scores (one-year program: n=514; 2-year program: n=514). 4 and 5 years after start of the vocational retraining program, annual income, the duration of welfare benefits and the risk of a disability pension were comparable in both groups. However, the accumulative income between 2005 and 2009 was 9 294 Euro higher (95% CI: 3 656-14 932 Euro) in one-year retraining participants. Moreover, participants of one-year programs received less welfare benefits.
CONCLUSION: The development of a vocational rehabilitation strategy needs to consider the accumulative advantage of one-year programs."
26678002,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26678002/,"OBJECTIVES: The diagnosis of primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) rests on a converging set of clinical and laboratory findings. Salivary-gland ultrasonography (SGUS) was recently shown to assist in the diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of pSS. Our objective here was to measure salivary-gland elasticity using Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) ultrasonography in patients with pSS and to compare the results to those obtained in healthy controls.
METHODS: SGUS with ARFI elastometry was performed in 10 patients with pSS and 15 healthy controls. Ten impulses per gland were used for both submandibular and both parotid glands of each participant. Mean shear wave velocity (SWV) in m/s was compared between the patients and controls using the Mann-Whitney U test.
RESULTS: For the parotid glands, mean SWV was significantly higher in the pSS group than in the control group (2.335±0.315 vs 1.785±0.384, respectively; P=0.001). Mean SWV values for the submandibular glands were not significantly different between the patients and controls (1.812±0.308 vs 1.766±0.187, respectively; P=0.892).
CONCLUSION: ARFI elastometry may contribute to the diagnosis of pSS, as this noninvasive, fast, and inexpensive investigation can demonstrate abnormal architectural changes in the parotid glands."
26678404,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26678404/,"PURPOSE: This study evaluated the role of surgical debulking in improving pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP)-related symptoms if complete cytoreductive surgery (CCRS) of huge PMP is unachievable.
METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of a prospective database of all patients in our tertiary care center treated for PMP between 1992 and 2014. All cases of surgical debulking in patients scheduled for CCRS that proved unachievable during the operation were selected for the present study.
RESULTS: Among the 338 patients operated on for PMP, 39 (11.5 %) had undergone surgical debulking because CCRS was unachievable. All of these patients were symptomatic before surgery, and the median PCI was 32 (5-39). More than 80 % of the disease burden was resected in 23 patients (59 %). Mortality and major morbidity rates were 2.5 and 23 %, respectively. After debulking surgery, symptoms gradually subsided over a median time of 23 months and 50 % of the patients no longer experienced PMP-related symptoms after a median follow-up of 24.5 months. After a median follow-up of 46.4 months (range 3-120), median overall (OS) and progression-free (PFS) survival times were 55.5 and 20 months, respectively. Five-year OS and PFS rates were 46 and 11 %, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Aggressive debulking surgery in case of unachievable CCRS for huge PMP can offer prolonged relief of PMP-related symptoms and long-term survival, in experienced centers that are able to be sufficiently aggressive to resect the major part of the disease, and conservative enough to achieve low mortality and good quality of life."
26678643,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26678643/,"BACKGROUND: Payers and policy makers rely on studies of trends in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) hospitalizations and spending that count only hospitalizations where the AMI is the principal discharge diagnosis. Hospitalizations with AMI coded as a secondary diagnosis are ignored. The effects of excluding these hospitalizations on estimates of trends are unknown.
METHODS: Observational study of all AMI hospitalizations in Fee-for-Service Medicare beneficiaries 65 years and older, from 2002 through 2011.
RESULTS: We studied 3,663,137 hospitalizations with any AMI discharge diagnosis over 288,873,509 beneficiary-years. Of these, 66% had AMI coded as principal (versus secondary). From 2002 to 2011, AMI hospitalization rates declined 24.5% (from 1,485 per 100,000 beneficiary-years in 2002 to 1,122 in 2011). Meanwhile, the proportion of these hospitalizations with a secondary AMI diagnosis increased from 28% to 40%; by 2011 these secondary AMI hospitalizations accounted for 43% of all expenditures for hospitalizations with AMI, or $2.8 billion. Major changes in comorbidities, principal diagnoses and mean costs for hospitalizations with a non-principal AMI diagnosis occurred in the 2006-2008 timeframe.
CONCLUSIONS: Current estimates of the burden of AMI ignore an increasingly large proportion of overall AMI hospitalizations and spending. Changes in the characteristics of hospitalizations that coincided with major payment and policy changes suggest that non-clinical factors affect AMI coding. Failing to consider all AMIs could inflate estimates of population health improvements, overestimate the value of AMI prevention and treatment and underestimate current and future AMI burden and expenditures."
26678980,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26678980/,"BACKGROUND: The American Society of Clinical Oncology and the Oncology Nursing Society have issued guidelines stating that the vital signs of patients should be routinely checked on days that intravenous chemotherapy is administered. This study sought evidence to justify this approach.
METHODS: This trial focused on consecutive patients with cancer from 2 institutions and evaluated outcomes during the first cycle of gemcitabine-based chemotherapy. The primary end point of the study was a visit to the ED, hospitalization, or death during the first cycle of chemotherapy.
RESULTS: Medical records from 1,158 patients were reviewed, and vital signs were checked in 589 patients on day 1 and in 486 on day 8. A total of 148 patients (12.8%) were evaluated in the emergency department (ED), 145 (12.5%) were hospitalized, and 11 (0.9%) died during their first cycle of chemotherapy. In multivariate analyses, which were adjusted for age, sex, cancer type, role of chemotherapy, number of chemotherapy drugs administered on day 1, and institution, checking vital signs on day 1 was associated with neither higher rates of ED visits nor with increased hospitalization; however, checking vital signs on day 8 was associated with higher rates of ED visits (odds ratio [OR]: 3.71; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.18-6.22; P < .0001) and higher rates of hospitalizations (OR: 3.98; 95% CI: 2.34-6.73; P < .0001).
CONCLUSION: This study suggests a need for additional, evidence-based data to support the routine checking of vital signs prior to administering cancer chemotherapy."
26679136,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26679136/,"AIM: To conduct an exploratory investigation of public dental service (PDS) practitioners' planned sedation modality using a structural equation modelling approach, in order to identify the explanatory value of using the Index of Sedation Need (IOSN), or its component parts, to predict sedation modality in patients referred with dental anxiety.
METHODS: A convenience sample of patients referred to the PDS for dental anxiety management was invited to take part. The IOSN was completed for each patient (patient dental anxiety, medical and behavioural indicators and dental treatment complexity) as well as the American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification System and the Case Mix Tool. The practitioners completed details of their planned sedation modality and identified normative dental treatment need. The data were entered onto an SPSS v21 database and subjected to frequency distributions, t-tests, correlation analysis and exploratory partial structural equation modelling (SEM).
RESULTS: Ninety-five percent of patients were ranked as MDAS 3 or 4, indicating high dental anxiety; 69% had a medical condition, which might impact on dental treatment and 82% had a dental treatment need, which was classified as intermediate/complex according to the IOSN. Eighty-eight percent of the patients in accordance with the IOSN required sedation: 62% of patients were assessed as requiring intravenous sedation. The IOSN discriminated between patients who were assessed as requiring more complex sedation modalities and had a greater normative treatment need. The SEM showed that the patient dental anxiety (P <0.02) and dental treatment complexity (P <0.02) predicted planned sedation modality. Functional morbidity was less strong, as a predictor, and was significant at the ten percent level.
CONCLUSIONS: The IOSN is a useful and valid assessment of sedation need and predicted sedation modality for patients referred with high dental anxiety states and secondly, that component parts of the IOSN add explanatory value in practitioners' choice of planned sedation modality."

AIM: To compare the outcome of patients with EUF, after surgical treatment, with those with non-penetrating and non-stenosing, penetrating, and stenosing phenotypes (B1, B2, and B3 phenotypes).
METHODS: Case-control study of 21 CD patients with EUF submitted to surgical treatment. Each patient with EUF was compared with six patients, two of each group: B1, B2, and B3 phenotypes. They were randomly selected from inflammatory bowel disease database and had the same extent of disease, smoking status, perianal disease, and age at diagnosis.
RESULTS: One hundred and forty-seven patients were included (n = 21 EUF; n = 42 of each group B1, B2, and B3). Comparing B3 group with EUF, the former was more steroid-dependent and resistant (54.8% versus 19.0%, p = 0.037) and needed anti-TNF therapy more frequently (59.5% versus 23.8%, p = 0.004). Moreover, B3 patients had a poorer response to anti-TNF therapy without remission free of steroid therapy in comparison with EUF patients (45.2% versus 95.2%, p < 0.001). EUF patients did not differ from B2 group regarding anti-TNF therapy (p = 0.956) and steroid-dependence or resistance (p = 0.141). Surgery rate after index surgery was inferior in EUF in comparison with B2 and B3 groups. Hospital admission rate of patients with EUF was also lower than the B3 group.
CONCLUSION: Early surgery seems to be a good choice for patients with EUF as their response to surgery appears not to differ from B2 patients and had a better prognosis than phenotype B3 patients."

No horizontal line has yet been determined as an ideal position for pediatric sizes because of the variability in length of the oropharyngeal-laryngeal arch in children. We investigated whether there is a correlation between insertion length and patient body weight or height for the pediatric I-gel sizes from 1.5 to 2.5.
METHODS: With parental informed consent, we planned to maintain the airway of 130 children aged from 7 months to 13 years by using the I-gel device under general anesthesia. The following two parameters were evaluated: (1) distance between the teeth and the connector wing; (2) insertion length (distance from the distal end of the gastric tube to the teeth). Size selection was determined on the basis of patients' body weight. We identified the relationship between each parameter and height or weight.
RESULTS: Average insertion length became gradually longer with increasing height and weight. Spearman's R between insertion length and height or weight was 0.8. There was more correlation with height than with weight in pediatric size 2.5.
CONCLUSION: Results suggested that it is possible to draw an ideal line on the I-gel with sizes 1.5 and 2 only."
26679715,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26679715/,"UNLABELLED: The treatment of newborns with esophageal atresia (EA) and tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) is associated with a great logistic effort. The aim of the presented study was to analyse the possibility to influence the time of surgery.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: Data from 30 neonates with EA and TEF regarding the date and mode of birth, biometric data and preoperative acid-base and blood gas values were collected retrospectively. The newborns were divided into two subgroups: birth between Monday and Thursday (""week""), and birth from Friday to Sunday (""weekend"").
RESULTS: We observed a seasonal peak of births in November/December. The rate of prenatal ultrasound detection of polyhydramnions was 40%. In 14 of 16 cases with Caesarean section, maternal or foetal problems predicted the date and mode of delivery. In both groups, most newborns had an unimpaired postnatal adaptation. There were no significant differences regarding biometry. Delivery at the weekend was associated with later surgical repair (second vs. first day of life). Repeated estimations of acid-base and blood gas parameters over a median time span of 13 hours revealed a stable situation with a trend to normalisation.
DISCUSSION: The time of birth is multifactorial and, in most cases, can neither be predicted nor influenced. Stable respiratory and metabolic parameters in the majority of patients allow a surgical intervention within a limited time frame during the first days of life.
CONCLUSION: As it is hardly possible to plan the surgical procedure, an experienced team as well as neonatal intensive care facilities and operation room access must be available throughout the week."
26679934,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26679934/,"BACKGROUND: Secondhand Smoking (SHS) has been suggested as a major health problem in the world and is known to cause various negative health effects that have in turn caused the deaths of almost 600,000 people per year. Evidence has suggested that SHS may have an effect on health problems and such findings have influenced the implementation of smoking-free areas. However, few studies have investigated the effects of SHS on stress which is considered major risk factor for mental health. Thus, the purpose of our study was to investigate the association between exposure to SHS and stress.
METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study using data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2007-2012). In our study, a total of 33,728 participants were included to evaluate the association between SHS exposure and stress based on smoking status. Association between SHS exposure and stress was examined using logistic regression models.
RESULTS: A total of 12,441 participants (42.9 %) were exposed to SHS in the workplace or at home. In our study, exposure to SHS was significantly associated with higher stress compared to non-exposure, regardless of smoking status (smoker odds ratio [OR]: 1.22; ex-smoker OR: 1.25; never-smoker OR: 1.42). Our results showed that the effect of SHS on stress was greater when exposure took place both at home and in the workplace in smokers and never-smokers.
CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to SHS in the workplace and at home is considered to be a risk factor for high stress in both smokers and never-smoker. Therefore, strict regulations banning smoke which can smoking ban reduce SHS exposure are recommended in order to improve the populations' health."
26680040,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26680040/,"BACKGROUND: The objective of the present study was to analyze the knowledge and acceptance of the brain death (BD) concept among nursing students.
METHODS: The study was undertaken in the academic year of 2011 to 2012 in nursing students from the University of the South of Poland. The sample was carried out in compulsory sessions, in the 5 years of the nursing degree study, with a completion rate of 80%. The questionnaire was validated (PCID-DTO Ríos), self-administered, and completed anonymously.
RESULTS: The completion rate was 93% (492 of 530). Of the students surveyed, 75% (n = 369) knew the concept of BD and considered it to mean a person's death. Of the rest, 19% (n = 93) did not know it, and the remaining 6% (n = 30) believed that it did not mean that a person was dead. The following variables were significantly related with the correct knowledge of the BD concept: 1) age (22 ± 2 years; P ≤ .001); 2) academic year (P ≤ .001); 3) discussion with friends about organ donation and transplantation (ODT) (P = .035); 4) partner's favorable attitude toward donation and transplantation (P = .009); and 5) being Catholic (P = .031). In the multivariate analysis, the following variables persisted as independent variables related to the BD concept: a) age [OR = 1.468 (1.247-1.697); P ≤ .001] and b) partner's opinion of ODT [OR = 2.248 (1.255-4.025); P = .006].

26680076,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26680076/,"BACKGROUND: Fetuin A is a protein expressed in the liver and it is an important inhibitor of ectopic calcification. High levels of fetuin A correlate with insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, and regional adiposity in the general population. The association between hepatic steatosis and fetuin A level in renal transplant recipients (RTRs) remains unclear.
AIM: The aim of this study was to explore the relationships between fetuin A, hepatic steatosis, and regional adiposity in RTRs.
METHODS: Data from 44 patients with normal renal functions were included, all subjected to history taking for clinical data, assessment of central obesity and regional adiposity, assessment of hepatic steatosis using abdominal ultrasound (US), and measurements of serum fetuin A concentration using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits.
RESULTS: Our study included 20 females (45.4%) and 24 males (54.6%) with mean age of 41.26 ± 11.2 years. Twenty-four subjects had hepatic steatosis. Fetuin A level in RTRs with hepatic steatosis with a mean of 1642.92 ± 358.91 is significantly higher (P < .001) than those without hepatic steatosis with a mean of 711.74 ± 57.85. Serum fetuin A level was positively correlated with regional adiposity (P = .021) and hepatic steatosis grade (P = .017). Fetuin A level increased with increased duration after renal transplantation (P < .001). The best cutoff value for detecting entrance into phase 3 or 4 steatosis is fetuin of 1862 with sensitivity of 88.9% and specificity of 87.7%.
CONCLUSIONS: Fetuin A is positively correlated with hepatic steatosis and regional adiposity in RTRs. Fetuin increases with increased duration after renal transplantation. Accordingly it may be used as a marker for hepatic steatosis and regional adiposity in these patients."
26680402,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26680402/,"PURPOSE: Accurate alignment and balanced flexion and extension gaps are critical elements in achieving a successful outcome following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The ability to make accurate and precise bone cuts is essential in the creation of balanced gaps. We sought to determine if one type of modern-day standard surgical instrument using an intramedullary rod and posterior referencing produces accurate and precise distal and posterior femoral bone resections.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-five consecutive patients undergoing TKA were divided into three groups, with 25 patients in each group receiving one of three implant designs: 25 Stryker Triathlon® CR (Stryker, Mahwah, NJ), 25 Zimmer NexGen® Flex CR (Zimmer, Warsaw, IN), and 25 StelKast Proven Gen-FlexTM CR (StelKast, Pittsburgh, PA). Flexion-extension gap matching was determined using only the medial flexion and extension gaps. Accuracy was determined by comparing actual resection thickness to desired resection thickness. ""Optimal"" accuracy was considered to be within 1.0mm of desired, and ""near-optimal"" accuracy was considered to be within 2.0mm of the desired resection thickness. Precision was determined by the variability of resection thicknesses within each system.
RESULTS: Data demonstrated a lack of accuracy and precision across all three tested systems, with each system resulting in certain unique tendencies. Only one out of 75 cases resulted in optimal resection accuracy with all three cuts (Zimmer). When lowering the threshold to include both optimal and near-optimal (within 2 mm of error) with all three cuts, only one third of Stryker and Zimmer cases and two thirds of StelKast cases achieved this threshold, representing 44% of cases (33/75).
CONCLUSIONS: Improvements in instrumentation to increase accuracy and precision may be warranted. Errors in fixation may be due to the instrumentation itself, and altering instrumentation to include less modularity, provide more stable fixation, and more reliably seal the implant on the femur may be of benefit."
26681187,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26681187/,"BACKGROUND: Sleep-disordered breathing is common in heart failure (HF), and prolonged circulation time and diminished pulmonary volume are considered the main possible causes of sleep apnea in these patients. However, the impact and interrelation between sleep apnea and HF development are unclear. We report the case of a patient with complete elimination of non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep-associated mixed apnea in HF after heart transplantation.
CASE REPORT: After unsuccessful 12-month conventional treatment with abrupt exacerbation of biventricular HF IV class (according to New York Heart Association Functional Classification), a 26-year-old man was admitted to the hospital. Based on a comprehensive examination including endomyocardial biopsy, dilated cardiomyopathy was diagnosed. Heart transplantation was considered the only possible treatment strategy. Polysomnography showed severe NREM sleep-associated mixed sleep apnea [apnea-hypopnea index 43/h, in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep 3.7/h, in NREM sleep 56.4/h, mean SatO2 93.9%], and periodic breathing. One-month post-transplantation polysomnography did not show sleep-disordered breathing (apnea-hypopnea index 1.0/h; in REM sleep - 2.8/h, in NREM sleep 0.5/h, mean SatO2 97.5%). The patient was discharged from the hospital in improved condition.
CONCLUSIONS: NREM sleep-associated mixed apnea occurring in severe systolic HF due to dilated cardiomyopathy might be reversible in case of successful HF treatment. We suggest that mixed sleep apnea strongly associated with NREM sleep occurs in HF, when the brain centers regulating ventilation are intact, and successful HF compensation might be highly effective regarding sleep-breathing disorders without non-invasive ventilation. This is important to know, especially with regard to the recently published data of potentially unfavorable effects of adaptive servoventilation in systolic HF, and the lack of other treatment options."
26681193,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26681193/,"BACKGROUND: Uroepithelial molecules like uroplakins are involved both in the development of urinary tract and in colonization, attachment and invasion of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). Uroplakin disorders are also associated with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). We hypothesized that urine contents, as well as urinary flow, may be altered in VUR, and aimed to determine whether in vitro UPEC growth is increased in urine from the refluxing systems.
METHODS: Children evaluated by voiding cystourethrography for UTI were enrolled. Groups 1 and 2 included children with and without VUR, respectively. Sterile urine samples were obtained from all patients, and 2 × 10(2) cfu/mL UPEC suspension was inoculated into these samples. After incubation for 24 h, colony counts were assessed. Both groups were compared for UPEC growth and colony counts.
RESULTS: Forty-two urine samples were included (21 in each group). UPEC was cultured in 9 (43 %) and 3 (14 %) samples in Groups 1 and 2, respectively (p = 0.040, OR 4.5). Colony counts were similar in both groups (log x; 2.36 ± 0.25 vs. 2.37 ± 0.12, p = 0.923).
CONCLUSION: Inoculation of 2 × 10(2) cfu UPEC resulted in growth in almost half of the urine samples from refluxing systems, while UPEC growth was inhibited in most urine samples from non-refluxing systems suggesting that urine contents in refluxing units change in such a way that UPEC growth is facilitated."

The present study investigated the relationships among vitamin D, depressive symptoms, and suicidal ideation in a large representative of the general population of Korea.
METHOD: The data from the fifth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys conducted by the Division of Chronic Disease Surveillance, Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, from 2010 to 2012 were investigated. A total of 15,695 subjects aged 20 and older were included in analysis. Depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation were evaluated based on self-report information. The serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay. The associations among vitamin D, depressive symptoms, and suicidal ideation were explored using multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusting for various confounding variables including sociodemographic and health-related variables.
RESULTS: Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were not significantly different depending on the depressive symptoms (participant with depressive symptom, n = 2085, 17.10 ng/ml; without depressive symptom, n = 13,610, 17.36 ng/ml; p = 0.142) and suicidal ideation (participant with suicidal ideation, n = 2319, 17.31 ng/ml; without suicidal ideation, n = 13,374, 17.33 ng/ml; p = 0.926). After adjustment for sociodemographic and health-related factors, this lack of relationship was held consistent in the multivariate logistic regression.
CONCLUSIONS: Significant associations were not observed among vitamin D, depressive symptoms, and suicidal ideation in Korean adults. Further studies are warranted to gain a better understanding of the association among vitamin D, depressive symptoms, and suicidal ideation."
26681546,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26681546/,"BACKGROUND: Galectin-3 staining of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) samples is very useful for diagnosis of thyroid malignancy. As reported in several studies, galectin-3 is associated with prognostic factor in papillary thyroid carcinoma, but its expression and prognostic role has not been evaluated in papillary microcarcinoma (PTMC). This study was performed to investigate the prevalence of galectin-3 in preoperative ultrasonography (US)-guided FNA cytology and to evaluate the association between galectin-3 expression and prognostic factors of PTMC.
METHODS: Between January 2011 and December 2012, 440 conventional PTMCs which had undergone US-guided FNA with galectin-3 analysis and underwent subsequent surgery were enrolled. Preoperative US features and clinicopathologic results including extrathyroidal extension and lymph node metastasis were compared between galectin-3 positive and galectin-3 negative PTMC.
RESULTS: Of the 440 PTMCs, 201 (45.7%) PTMCs had galectin-3 positivity in preoperative FNA samples. There was no significant difference in US features between galectin-3 positive and negative PTMC. Galectin-3 expression had no significant association with prognostic factors such as extrathyroidal extension (44.8% vs. 44.8%, P = 0.999) and lymph node metastasis (25.9% vs. 26.8%, P = 0.914) in conventional PTMC.
CONCLUSION: Preoperative galectin-3 analysis using FNA cytology may be not advisable in patients with conventional PTMC."
26681679,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26681679/,"BACKGROUND: Data are lacking on the relationship between hope and other variables in non-advanced cancer patients. The study explored the relationship between hope, symptoms, needs, and spirituality/religiosity in patients treated in a supportive care unit (SCU).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: From September 2013 to March 2014, the consecutive patients who accepted to complete: (i) Needs Evaluation Questionnaire (NEQ), (ii) the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS), (iii) Hope Herth Index (HHI), and (iv) the System of Belief Inventory (SBI) were enrolled. Moreover, clinical/demographic data were collected and the findings were analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 276 patients who completed the HHI questionnaire (participation rate 276/300 = 92%) were included; 131 reported HHI total score >37 (median value). The majority of patients had a Karnofsky performance status >80; 71% were on cancer therapies, and only 29 patients had metastases or relapse. Patients with higher HHI scores were less educated (P = 0.012), reported lower ESAS total score (15.4 versus 22.6, P < 0.001), and had less often been referred to a psychologist previously to the study (P = 0.002); patients with a higher HHI score also reported higher spirituality (P < 0.001). Some NEQ items resulted significantly associated with HHI score after adjustment for other variables: the need to have sincere clinicians (β = -2.7), better dialogue (β = -2.1), and more reassurance from the clinicians (β = -2.5); better attention (β = -4.4) and respect for intimacy (β = -3.3) from nurses; to speak with people who have the same illness experience (β = -2.5), to be more reassured by relatives (β = -3.3) and to feel less abandoned (β = -4.3). Higher SBI scores were independently associated with higher HHI scores (β = 1.7 for 10 points increase).
CONCLUSIONS: In cancer patients, hope can be encouraged by clinicians through dialogue, sincerity, and reassurance, as well as assessing and considering the patients' needs (above all the psycho-emotional), symptoms, psychological frailty, and their spiritual/religious resources."
26682683,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26682683/,"BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment in hemodialysis patients is common, but the underlying pathogenesis remains unclear. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia in the general elderly population. Histopathological hallmarks are, among others, senile plaques, which consist of amyloid-β (Aβ).
OBJECTIVE: To measure plasma levels of Aβ42 and Aβ40 during hemodialysis and to examine potential associations with cognitive performance in cognitively impaired hemodialysis patients.
METHODS: Plasma samples of 26 hemodialysis patients were collected shortly before, after 50% of dialysis time, and at the end of a dialysis session. Aβ42 and Aβ40 levels were measured by a high-sensitivity ELISA for human amyloid-β. Cognition was tested under standardized conditions using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) as proposed previously.
RESULTS: Clearance rates of both peptides during one dialysis session were 22% and 35% for Aβ42 and Aβ40, respectively. Aβ42 but not Aβ40 baseline levels were significantly associated with MoCA test results (r = 0.654, p = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: In cognitively impaired hemodialysis patients plasma Aβ42 levels were associated with cognitive performance and both Aβ42 and Aβ40 plasma levels could be effectively reduced by dialysis. By inducing peripheral Aβ sink, hemodialysis may be considered as an anti-amyloid treatment strategy."

METHODS: Between January 2012 and October 2013, 20 pyeloplasties were performed: 12 with SMARTp and 8 with SLp techniques. A 5-mm homemade balloon trocar was used to create the retroperitoneal space. In SMARTp, 3- and 5-mm trocars were used and in SLp, 5- and 10-mm trocars were used. All patients underwent a ureteral (Double-J) stent placement preoperatively. The study included a total of 72 trocar-site scars: 3 mm (24 scars), 5 mm (24 scars), and 10 mm (24 scars). Cosmetic outcome was assessed at the 3rd, 12th, and 24th month of surgeries by the Observer Scar Assessment Scale (OSAS).
RESULTS: Mean age was 34.7±10.5 (19-52) years, and mean follow up was 18.7±9.2 months. Fifteen patients (75%) underwent Y-V plasty, and 5 (25%) underwent Anderson-Hynes pyeloplasty. Mean operative time was 125.4±28.7 minutes. There was only minimal blood loss, no need for conversion to standard laparoscopic or open pyeloplasty, no intraoperative complications, and only two postoperative complications were recorded: retroperitoneal hemorrhage and wound infection and both were treated conservatively. There were significant differences between objective questions of ""vascularization"" in a 3-mm trocar and ""thickness"" in a 10-mm trocar. Twenty-four months after surgery, the cosmetic data assessed by OSAS showed statistically significant differenecs in favor of the 3-mm trocar sites versus the 10-mm trocar sites (OSAS: 13.8±3.9 vs 24.6±1.7; p=0.006) with no statistically significant difference between 3- and 5-mm port sites.
CONCLUSIONS: The SMARTp is proved to be an efficacious and tolerable procedure with better cosmetic results and can be used for the treatment of ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) in suitable patients. We believe that this technique is likely to become an established procedure."
25230256,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25230256/,"OBJECTIVE: This study examined whether the occurrence of late neck metastasis in early tongue squamous cell carcinoma can be predicted by evaluating HMGB1 (high mobility group box 1) expression in the primary lesion.
METHODS: A case-control study was conducted. The cases comprised 10 patients with late neck metastasis. The controls consisted of 16 patients without recurrence. All were examined immunohistochemically for HMGB1 protein expression. The odds ratio for late neck metastasis in relation to HMGB1 was estimated.
RESULTS: RESULTS for HMGB1 were dichotomised into positive staining scores (score, 5-7) and negative scores (0-4). Six cases (60 per cent) and four controls (25 per cent) were HMGB1-positive. Although no significant result was seen, compared with HMGB1-negative patients the odds ratio for late neck metastasis in HMGB1-positive patients was 3.8 (95 per cent confidence interval, 0.6-26.5) after adjusting for other factors.
CONCLUSION: In the present study, immunohistochemical study of HMGB1 in early tongue squamous cell carcinoma did not appear to be very useful for predicting occult neck metastasis. Further study is necessary to clarify the relationship between HMGB1 expression and late neck metastasis in early tongue squamous cell carcinoma."

There is common occurrence of pain due to incorrect posture in dental professionals. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies may cast a new light on preventing and intercepting musculoskeletal disorders (MSD). An epidemiological study was conducted in an effort to contribute to the prevention of musculoskeletal disorders in dentistry. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of MSD at dentists using CAM as a treatment and preventive modality for MSD and to compare job/career satisfaction between dentists who use CAM and conventional therapy (CT).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Dentists registered in Uttrakhand state, India, under the Dental Council of India and registered members of the Indian Dental Association, Uttrakhand branch (N = 1496) were surveyed. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS 17.
RESULTS: A response rate of 84% (N = 1257) was obtained, revealing that 90% (N = 1131) had the problem of MSD. Seventy three percentage (N = 826) of dentists with MSD reported the use of CAM and CT. Complementary and alternative medicine users reported greater overall health (72.7% vs. 51%, p < 0.001), job satisfaction (61.2% vs. 35%, p < 0.001) and work efficiency compared to CT users.
CONCLUSION: Complementary and alternative medicine therapies may improve quality of life, reduce work interruption and enhance job satisfaction for dentists who suffers from MSD. Through the course of their studies, dentists should be equipped with knowledge on ergonomics and CAM therapies, such as yoga and others, to help them prevent musculoskeletal disorders more effectively."
25230856,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25230856/,"INTRODUCTION: It is unknown whether monitors that include atrial fibrillation recognition software (AF-RS) increase the rate of early atrial fibrillation (AF) detection in acute stroke. We aimed to evaluate the AF detection rate of an AF-RS monitor and compare it with standard monitoring.
METHODS: This was a retrospective, single-centre observational study conducted on consecutive patients with acute transient ischaemic attack or brain infarction attended in a stroke unit (SU) with six beds. Five beds had a standard monitor with a three-lead electrocardiogram (ECG)-tracing monitor that did not automatically detect AF, and one bed had a 12-lead ECG monitor with integrated AF-RS. All patients were monitored for at least 24 h and underwent a daily ECG during their stay in the SU. In case of unknown stroke aetiology, the patients underwent 24 h Holter monitoring.
RESULTS: A total of 76 patients were included: 59 patients in the standard monitor group and 17 patients in the AF-RS monitor group. The mean age was 72.11 (±13.09) years, and 59.2% were men. A total of 20 new cases of AF were identified. The AF-RS monitor showed a higher rate of AF detection than the standard devices (57.1% vs 7.7%, p=0.031). The AF-RS monitor showed sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive values of 57.1%, 100%, 100% and 76.9%, respectively. For the standard monitors, these values were 7.7%, 100%, 100% and 79.3%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The monitor with AF-RS demonstrated a higher detection rate for AF than standard ECG monitoring in acute stroke patients in a SU."
25230900,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25230900/,"PURPOSE: Significant prolongation of overall survival (OS) has been reached in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) treatment within the last 5-10 years. Our study was conducted in order to evaluate and compare OS of different standard of care treatment options in a university-based outpatient clinic.
METHODS: One hundred and three mCRC patients were identified by retrospective analysis and treated according to available guidelines. OS was analyzed according to the different combinations of first- and second-line treatments.
RESULTS: mCRC patients revealed an mOS of 34.4 months. Patients receiving anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) blockade in at least one treatment line showed a significantly longer survival time (p = 0.0056) versus patients without any bevacizumab. No OS differences were detected comparing the different first- and second-line chemotherapy (CTX) strategies in the unselected population. However, wild-type (wt) Kras patients treated with anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy plus CTX in first-line therapy showed significantly longer OS compared to those receiving only additional VEGF inhibition or no targeted therapy (p = 0.0056; mOS 46.8 vs. 20.4 months, respectively). wt Kras patients profited in trend (p = 0.076) from CTX combinations of first-line anti-EGFR followed by second-line anti-VEGF compared to first-line anti-VEGF followed by second-line anti-EGFR (mOS 46.8 vs. 19.2 months, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate successful allocation of the current mCRC treatment according to the Kras status. Differences in OS of wt Kras patients indicated the further need for randomized trials to define the potential benefit of sequential therapy with EGFR inhibition in first-line therapy followed by VEGFR inhibition vice versa."
25231371,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25231371/,"BACKGROUND: When comparing the health of two populations, it is not enough to compare the prevalence of chronic diseases. The objective of this study is therefore to propose a metric of health based on domains of functioning to determine whether the English are healthier than the Americans.
METHODS: We analysed representative samples aged 50 to 80 years from the 2008 wave of the Health and Retirement Study (N=10 349) for the US data, and wave 4 of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (N=9405) for English counterpart data. We first calculated the age-standardized disease prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, all heart diseases, stroke, lung disease, cancer and obesity. Second, we developed a metric of health using Rasch analyses and the questions and measured tests common to both surveys addressing domains of human functioning. Finally, we used a linear additive model to test whether the differences in health were due to being English or American.
RESULTS: The English have better health than the Americans when population health is assessed only by prevalence of selected chronic health conditions. The English health advantage disappears almost completely, however, when health is assessed with a metric that integrates information about functioning domains.
CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to construct a metric of health, based on data directly collected from individuals, in which health is operationalized as domains of functioning."

METHODS: This prospective study was performed between February 2011 and February-2012, at a tertiary referral hospital. Singleton pregnancies with high risk for aneuploidy in combined screening test and normal nuchal translucency (NT) measurements were included in the study group. Measurements of DV Pulsatility Index of Veins (PIV) and HA Pulsatility Index (PI) were compared between the study group and controls.
RESULTS: Within the study period, 104 women with singleton pregnancies were evaluated for DV and HA measurements and among these, 64 women met the inclusion criteria. A control group that comprised 40 women with similar gestational age, normal NT measurements and low-risk in first trimester combined tests was generated. DV-PIV measurements were significantly higher (p = 0.03), whereas HA-PI measurements were similar (p > 0.05) in women who had high-risk for aneuploidy in first trimester combined test.
CONCLUSION: We concluded that the addition of DV-PIV and HA-PI measurements to the first trimester combined screening might increase the accuracy for Down syndrome detection."
25233157,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25233157/,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine whether the SPRINT definition of a ""critical-sized defect"" (fracture gap at least 1 cm in length and involving over 50% of the cortical diameter) was accurate, to discern which factors predict reoperation in patients with these defects, and to compare the patient-based outcomes of these patients with patients without a critical defect.
DESIGN: Therapeutic Cohort Study.
SETTING: Level 1 and level 2 trauma centers.
PATIENTS: Thirty-seven patients in the SPRINT trial with a critical-sized defect participated. We evaluated these patients for planned and unplanned secondary intervention to gain union. Additionally, we evaluated which other factors predicted the need for reoperation. Finally, the 37 patients with a critical defect were compared with the larger cohort of patients without a defect with respect to demographics, mechanism of injury, fracture characteristics, and patient-based outcome.
INTERVENTION: Revision surgery for tibial nonunion.
RESULTS: Of the 37 patients with a large fracture gap, 7 patients had a planned secondary procedure. Of the remaining 30 patients in whom the attending surgeon adopted a ""watch and wait"" strategy, 14 patients (47%) never required additional surgery to gain union. Additional surgery to gain union was less likely in patients treated with a reamed nail (P = 0.04) and in female patients (P = 0.04). Patients with a critical-sized defect were more likely to have a high-energy mechanism of injury (P = 0.001), AO-OTA fracture type 42 B or C (P < 0.001), and location involving the middle third of the tibia (P = 0.02). The 12-month SF-36 physical component summary score in patients with a critical-sized defect was 38.2 ± 10.5 (mean ± SD) compared with 43.3 ± 10.7 in those without a critical defect (P = 0.02, difference = 5.2, 95% confidence interval = 0.8-9.6).
CONCLUSIONS: Tibial diaphyseal defects of >1 cm and >50% cortical circumference healed without additional surgery in 47% of cases. This definition of a critical-sized defect is not ""critical."" However, as compared with the overall cohort of tibial fractures, patients with these bone defects had a higher rate of reoperation and worse patient-based outcomes. Further investigation is required to determine which factors predict union in this challenging fracture to avoid unnecessary secondary surgery.

25233161,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25233161/,"OBJECTIVES: Among orthopaedic trauma patients, little is known regarding the relationship between patient satisfaction and patient levels of depression and ""activation"" (level of involvement of patient in his or her own care). Our hypothesis was that satisfaction is correlated to levels of depression and activation.
DESIGN: Patient questionnaires.
SETTING: Level 1 trauma center.
PATIENTS: One hundred twenty-four patients with at least one fracture.
INTERVENTION: Patients were evaluated at orthopaedic trauma clinics 6 weeks or longer after injury.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ), Patient Activation Measure, and Patient Health Questionnaire, a screening and evaluation tool for the presence and severity of depression. Spearman correlation coefficients assessed the relationship between activation level and depression severity with PSQ domains. Bivariate and multivariate linear regression models determined independent effects of depression and activation on general satisfaction.
RESULTS: Patient satisfaction was moderate to high in general (mean score, 4.17). Spearman correlation coefficients were high for patient activation and all PSQ domains (generally >0.3, P < 0.05). Correlation coefficients were weaker for depression and PSQ domains (rho range, 0.16-0.33). Final multivariate linear regression model indicated improvement in general satisfaction of 0.14 with increasing patient activation. A decrease in general satisfaction of -0.03 was noted with increasing Patient Health Questionnaire depression score.
CONCLUSIONS: Patient satisfaction is strongly correlated with patient activation but less correlated with the presence of depression. Patient satisfaction after orthopaedic trauma might be improved by encouraging and coaching patients on how to be more involved in their own health care.

DESIGN: Prospective diagnostic follow-up study.
SETTING: Department of Orthopaedics, Level II trauma center.
PATIENTS: Forty-eight acute closed tibial mid diaphysis fracture (OTA 42-A and B) treated by closed reduction and internal fixation with a reamed statically locked tibial interlocking nail between October 2011 and October 2012.
INTERVENTION: Evaluation of fracture healing using both US and XR at 2 week intervals.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Ultrasonographic criterion for fracture healing was set as progressive appearance of periosteal callus along with progressive decrease in visibility of nail. Radiographic criterion for fracture union was set as the appearance of bridging callus across all 4 cortices.
RESULTS: Thirty-eight of 48 fractures achieved union, 6 developed a delayed union, whereas 4 went onto nonunion. It was observed that using the above-stated criteria, fracture union was diagnosed at an average of 2 weeks earlier with US as compared with XR. Four of the 6 delayed unions and all nonunions declared themselves much earlier on US versus XR.
CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasonography can provide valuable early information about union and predict delayed and nonunions at an earlier time interval than standard plain radiographs.

25233192,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25233192/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the influence of physiological status and diagnosis at the time of death on end-of-life care.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective descriptive study in a regional referral level IV neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of infants who died from 1 January 1999 to 31 December 2008. Infants were categorized based on diagnosis (very preterm, congenital anomalies or other) and level of stability. Primary outcome was level of clinical service provided at end of life (care withheld, care withdrawn or full resuscitation).
RESULT: From 1999 to 2008, there were 414 deaths in the NICU. Congenital anomaly was the leading diagnosis at the time of death, representing 45% of all deaths. Comparing mode of death, very preterm newborns were more likely than infants with congenital anomalies to have received cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) at the time of death (26% vs 13%, P < 0.01) and were significantly more unstable (75% vs 52%, P < 0.01). Infants aged 22 to 24 weeks were mostly unstable and significantly more likely to receive CPR than infants with any other diagnosis.
CONCLUSION: Over the 10-year period, very preterm infants were more likely to be physiologically unstable and to receive CPR at the time of death than infants with any other diagnosis. This finding was especially true for infants at the edge of viability (22 to 24 weeks). These differences in end-of-life care suggest that the quality of life and medical futility may be viewed differently for the least mature infants."
25233193,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25233193/,"OBJECTIVE: This study examined whether adopting a standardized prenatal substance use protocol (protocol) in a hospital labor and delivery unit reduced racial disparities in reporting to child protective services (CPS) related to maternal drug use during pregnancy.
STUDY DESIGN: This study used an interrupted time series design with a non-equivalent control. One hospital adopted a protocol and another hospital group serving a similar geographic population did not change protocols. Data on CPS reporting disparities from these hospitals over 3.5 years were analyzed using segmented regression.
RESULT: In the hospital that adopted the protocol, almost five times more black than white newborns were reported during the study period. Adopting the protocol was not associated with reduced disparities.
CONCLUSION: Adopting a protocol cannot be assumed to reduce CPS reporting disparities. Efforts to encourage hospitals to adopt protocols as a strategy to reduce disparities may be misguided. Other strategies to reduce disparities are needed."

OBJECTIVE: The objective was to determine, in a population-based prospective cohort study, whether there is any relation between levels of total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and triglycerides and the probability of experiencing subsequent chronic (LBP), both among individuals with and without LBP at baseline.
METHODS: Information was collected in the community-based HUNT 2 (1995-1997) and HUNT 3 (2006-2008) surveys of an entire Norwegian county. Participants were 10,151 women and 8731 men aged 30-69 years, not affected by chronic LBP at baseline, and 3902 women and 2666 men with LBP at baseline. Eleven years later the participants indicated whether they currently suffered from chronic LBP.
RESULTS: Among women without LBP at baseline, HDL cholesterol levels were inversely associated and triglyceride levels positively associated with the risk of chronic LBP at end of follow-up in analyses adjusted for age only. Adjustment for the baseline factors education, work status, physical activity, smoking, blood pressure and in particular BMI largely removed these associations (RR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.85-1.07 per mmol/l of HDL cholesterol; RR: 1.16, 95% CI: 0.94-1.42 per unit of lg(triglycerides)). Total cholesterol levels showed no associations. In women with LBP at baseline and men without LBP at baseline weaker relationships were observed. In men with LBP at baseline, an inverse association with HDL cholesterol remained after complete adjustment (RR: 0.83, 95% CI: 0.72-0.95 per mmol/l).
CONCLUSION: Crude associations between lipid levels and risk of subsequent LBP in individuals without current LBP are mainly caused by confounding with body mass. However, an association with low HDL levels may still remain in men who are already affected and possibly experience a higher pain intensity."
25233494,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25233494/,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the factors associated with coronary stent restenosis and if there is an association between plasma asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) levels and stent restenosis.
METHODS: Ninety-one patients, who had a history of coronary bare metal stent implantation due to any cause in the last one year period, were admitted to this observational cross-sectional study. Coronary angiography was performed to all patients and quantitative angiography was used to determine the presence of stent restenosis. Laboratory parameters and angiographic features that contribute to stent restenosis were evaluated. Plasma ADMA levels were measured by using high performance liquid chromatography. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the independent factors of stent restenosis.
RESULTS: Angiographic restenosis was found in 35 patients (38.5%). Stent diameter (p=0.038) and left ventricular ejection fraction (p=0.023) were lower and stent implantation history due to acute coronary syndrome (p=0.029), plasma ADMA level (5.0±1.8x10-4 mmol/L vs. 3.9±1.0x10-4 mmol/L, p=0.001), C-reactive protein concentration (p=0.016), white blood cell count (p=0.044) and stent length (p=0.005) were higher in patients with restenosis. Plasma ADMA level (β=0.536; OR: 1.710; CI: 1.022-2.861; p=0.041), C-reactive protein concentration (β=0.062; OR: 1.064; CI: 1.003-1.129; p=0.041), stent diameter (β=-3.047; OR: 0.048; CI: 0.007-0.313; p=0.002) and length (β=0.165; OR: 1.179; CI: 1.036-1.343; p=0.013) were found to be the independent predictors of stent restenosis in logistic regression analysis.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that plasma ADMA levels may be used as a novel marker for stent restenosis beyond the classic stent restenosis markers."
25233955,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25233955/,"BACKGROUND: The traditional view of general practice holds that only general practitioners (GPs) in full-time clinical practice can provide quality patient care. Nevertheless, increasing numbers of GPs are choosing to work sessionally, that is, ostensibly ""part-time"". There are concerns about the health workforce's ability to meet demand and also fears that patient care may be compromised. We sought answers to a) what activities do GPs undertake when not consulting patients, b) why do they choose to work sessionally, and c) does sessional general practice reflect a lack of commitment to patients and the profession?
METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with GPs who worked sessionally, (i.e. six or fewer sessions a week in clinical general practice, where a session comprises four consecutive hours of patient care). These data were analysed qualitatively and saturation was reached.
RESULTS: The majority of participants were in full-time paid employment, while part-time in clinical general practice. They reported that consultations increasingly required the management of patients with complex, chronic conditions who also required psychological management. Coupled with unrealistic patient expectations, these factors led GPs to be concerned about maintaining the quality patient care they considered professionally desirable. Many diversified their work activities to ensure that they retained their professional standards.
CONCLUSION: ""Part-time"" general practice is a misnomer that masks the contribution these GPs make as part of the health workforce. Sessional practice more accurately describes the nature of our participants' clinical work. Their choice of sessional work is a professional response to the increasing demands within the consultation. It enables GPs to maintain their commitment to quality patient care and their profession, while attenuating the challenges of demanding consultations. Sessional general practitioners demonstrate strong commitment to their patients and the profession."
25234099,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25234099/,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether patients with a history of placental abruption have an increased risk for subsequent maternal long-term morbidity.
STUDY DESIGN: A population-based study compared the incidence of long-term renal morbidity in cohort of women with and without a history of placental abruption. Deliveries occurred during a 25-year period, with a mean follow-up duration of 11.2 years. Renal morbidity included kidney transplantation, chronic renal failure, hypertensive renal disease, etc.
RESULTS: During the study period 99 354 deliveries met the inclusion criteria; 1.8% (n = 1807) occurred in patients with a diagnosis of placental abruption. Patients with placental abruption did not have higher cumulative incidence of renal related hospitalizations, using Kaplan-Meier survival curve. During the follow-up period patients with a history of placental abruption did not have higher rate of renal morbidity (0.2% versus 0.1%; OR 1.8; 95% CI 0.6-4.8; p = 0.261). When performing a Cox proportional hazards model, adjusted for confounders such as parity and diabetes mellitus, a history of placental abruption was not associated with renal related hospitalizations (adjusted HR, 1.6; 95% CI, 0.6-4.2; p = 0.381).
CONCLUSION: Placental abruption, even though considered a part of the ""placental syndrome"" with possible vascular etiology, is not a risk factor for long-term maternal renal complications."

DESIGN: A single-operator, two-centre prospective, non-inferiority randomized controlled clinical trial.
SETTING: The Orthodontic departments at the Leeds Dental Institute and St Luke's Hospital, Bradford, UK.
ETHICAL APPROVAL: Ethical approval was granted by Leeds (East) Research Ethics Committee on 18th of December 2009 (Reference 09/H1306/102).
PROTOCOL: The protocol was not published prior to trial commencement.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Ninety-two patients requiring orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances were randomly allocated to the control (bonded with primer) or test groups (bonded without primer). Patients were randomly allocated to either the control or experimental group. This was performed by preparing opaque numbered sealed envelopes in advance using a random numbers table generated by a computer by an independent third party . Once the envelopes were opened, blinding of the operator and the patient was no longer possible due to the nature of the intervention. Patients were approached for inclusion in the trial if they qualified for NHS orthodontic treatment requiring fixed appliances and had no previous orthodontic treatment.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of bracket failures, time to bond-up appliances, and the adhesive remnant index (ARI) when bracket failure occurred, over a 12-month period
RESULTS: Failure rate with primer was 11.1 per cent and without primer was 15.8 per cent. Bonding without primer was shown statistically to be non-inferior to bonding with primer odds ratio 0.95-2.25 (P = 0.08). Mean difference in bond-up time per bracket was 0.068 minutes (4 seconds), which was not statistically significant (P = 0.402). There was a statistically significant difference in the Adhesive Remnant Index - ARI 0 with primer 49.4 per cent, no primer 76.5 per cent, (P < 0.0001).
LIMITATIONS: As the study was only performed by one operator, the results can therefore only be truly be applied to their practice. Also this study was powered to ascertain if there was no difference between the 2 groups up to 5%, however orthodontists may consider a change in the bracket failure rate of 2% to be clinically significant.
CONCLUSION: When bonding with APC™II Victory Series™ brackets without primer was shown statistically to be non-inferior to bonding with primer (P =0.08). There was no significant difference in bond-up times. Bond failure was more likely to happen at the composite-enamel interface when bonded without a primer.

25234504,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25234504/,"BACKGROUND: Due to demographic changes and improved diagnostic and therapeutic options surgery in the elderly is an essential field of discussion in medicine. Working groups are becoming increasingly more concerned with the question whether old age is a risk factor for complex surgical procedures.
OBJECTIVE: This study was carried out to help assess and evaluate the risk of pancreatic resection in the elderly.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database of pancreatic resections, data from a 4-year period were evaluated and analyzed. A division into two age groups was defined according to the literature with the age of 75 years being the dividing line.
RESULTS: During the 4 years of the study 209 pancreatic resections were performed in 146 patients under the age of 75 years and 63 patients over the age of 75 years. A pancreatic head resection was performed in 133 patients, distal pancreatectomy in 57, pancreatectomy in 16 and segmental resection in 3 patients. The overall mortality rate was 2.4 %, only patients over the age of 75 years were affected and was not directly related to surgery in any of the cases. The risk of patients dying perioperatively was significantly increased over the age of 75 years as was the comorbidity rate. Regarding surgically related complications there were no differences between the two groups.
CONCLUSION: Pancreatic resection in elderly patients > 75 years is justified because of the very low surgical morbidity and mortality which can now be achieved in experienced centers if comorbidities of patients are taken into account in the decision-making process. The age per se does not constitute a contraindication."
25234525,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25234525/,"PURPOSE: A healthy gingival condition after endodontic surgery may depend on adequate soft tissue management. The aim of this study was to compare 2 incision techniques, papilla base incision (PBI) and intrasulcular flap (IS), which are currently used in endodontic surgery.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present nonrandomized controlled clinical trial, patients requiring endodontic surgery on a single tooth were enrolled. PBI was used in 1 group and IS was used in the other group. The primary outcomes were changes in periodontal probing depth, gingival recession, and height of the interproximal mesial and distal papillae. Outcome variables were assessed preoperatively and 6 months after surgery. Between-group differences were evaluated through appropriate statistical analysis, with significance set at a P value equal to .05.
RESULTS: Each group was composed of 12 patients and the 2 groups were comparable at baseline. Two weeks after surgery, papilla height decreased significantly in the IS group (2.05 and 1.80 mm at the mesial and distal aspects, respectively), whereas no significant decrease in papilla height was observed in the PBI group (0.10 and 0.20 mm). No statistically significant difference between groups was observed after 6 months. No significant difference between groups was found for gingival recession or probing depth at any follow-up time.
CONCLUSIONS: Better soft tissue preservation in the early postoperative period was achieved using the PBI approach compared with the IS approach. The PBI can be recommended for endodontic surgical procedures involving esthetic regions."

Current assessment approaches rely on clinical impression and behavioral rating scales completed by proxy report. Given the growing health relevance of the salivary metabolome, we undertook a translational-oriented feasibility study using proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and neuropeptide/cytokine/hormone detection to compare a set of salivary biomarkers relevant to nociception.
DESIGN: Within-group observational design.
SETTING: Tertiary pediatric rehabilitation hospital.
SUBJECTS: Ten nonverbal pediatric patients with cerebral palsy with and without pain.
METHODS: Unstimulated (passively collected) saliva was collected using oral swabs followed by perchloric acid extraction and analyzed on a Bruker Avance 700 MHz NMR spectrometer. We also measured salivary levels of several cytokines, chemokines, hormones, and neuropeptides.
RESULTS: Partial least squares discriminant analysis showed separation of those children with/without pain for a number of different biomarkers. The majority of the salivary metabolite, neuropeptide, cytokine, and hormone levels were higher in children with pain vs no pain.
CONCLUSIONS: The ease of collection and noninvasive manner in which the samples were collected and analyzed support the possibility of the regular predictive use of this novel biomarker-monitoring method in clinical practice."
25234592,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25234592/,"AIMS: The utility of routine histological examination of clinically primary spontaneous pneumothorax (SPTX) specimens has been questioned. In this retrospective study, we aimed to assess the clinical significance of unexpected SPTX histopathological findings, to determine whether such findings justify routine histological examination of SPTX specimens.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Records and slides from all SPTX resections at our institution from 2002-2012 were reviewed. Clinically significant unexpected histological findings were identified in 8.3% of 72 patients, including: one patient with lung cancer, one with endometriosis, one with Birt-Hogg-Dubé (BHD) syndrome, and three with 'bong lung'. Detection of BHD syndrome has the potential to avert advanced renal carcinoma by identifying individuals who should undergo periodic abdominal CT screening. The cost of treating a case of advanced renal carcinoma far exceeds that of histologically examining all SPTX specimens received in a 10-year period at our institution.
CONCLUSIONS: Gross examination alone is an inadequate evaluation of SPTX specimens. This is the first study to demonstrate that routine histological examination of SPTX specimens is justified, in that it discloses unexpected findings that are clinically significant and impact on patient management."
25234748,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25234748/,"BACKGROUND: The extent of lymph node dissection during surgery in elderly non-small-cell lung cancer patients remains controversial. We evaluated a cohort of elderly patients with clinical N0 disease who underwent lobectomy to determine if radical mediastinal lymphadenectomy (RML) is justified for the special group.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A single-center database of patients over 70 y old from 2001-2011 was used to conduct a matched-pair analysis. The patients undergoing RML were matched 1:1 with those not (non-radical mediastinal lymphadenectomy group) by age, gender, American Society of Anesthesia score, histology, and clinical T status to assess their postoperative and long-term outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 136 patients could be matched (68 RML and 68 non-radical mediastinal lymphadenectomy). No statistical difference was observed in postoperative mortality and overall morbidity rate between the matched groups (0 versus 1, P > 0.99 and 43 versus 35, P = 0.17). Patients undergoing RML experienced more major morbidities, but no significant difference was achieved (15 versus 7, P = 0.06). No significantly more N-positive diseases were discovered in RML group (N1 and N2 involvement disease: 16 versus 16, P > 0.99 and 10 versus 4, P = 0.09, respectively). RML was associated with a significantly longer cancer-related and disease-free survival (P = 0.02 and P = 0.02). Whereas for clinical IA diseases, significant differences were observed neither in cancer-related nor in disease-free survival (P = 0.67 and P = 0.61).
CONCLUSIONS: The performance of RML seemed to result in a tendency of higher major morbidity rate in elderly patients, but to contribute a favorable impact on long-term survival. However, for clinical IA patients the survival benefits were not obtained."
25236343,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25236343/,"PURPOSE: This work investigated the influence of a model protein, bovine serum albumin (BSA), on the properties of a thermogelling formulation intended for administration inside body compartments where there is high albumin content, as in the case of inflamed joints; it also explored the relation between the variation of these properties and release performance of methotrexate (MTX), a drug used to treat forms of arthritis and rheumatic conditions.
METHODS: The influence of BSA on the micellisation and gelation behaviour of Poloxamer 407, chosen as a model copolymer, was studied by differential scanning calorimetry (microDSC), dynamic light scattering (DLS), fluorescence spectroscopy and rheology studies. A release study of MTX loaded inside the hydrogel in presence and in absence of BSA was performed.
RESULTS: DLS and microDSC data revealed that the micellisation process was not affected by the protein, as demonstrated by unaltered micellar size and thermodynamic parameters. While the presence of BSA in the copolymer system reduced gel consistency, the hydrogel release performance was only slightly affected.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that the kinetics of MTX release mainly depended on the presence of the thermogelling copolymer, although other mechanisms related to BSA could be involved. Finally, the study assessed the feasibility of using a thermogelling hydrogel for in situ drug administration in areas with the presence of high protein concentrations."
25236666,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25236666/,"BACKGROUND: Interleukin 27 (IL-27) has pleiotropic properties that can either limit or enhance immune responses. Recent studies revealed that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the IL-27 promoter region modulate the development of infectious diseases and individual's susceptibility to therapeutic response. Little is known about the relationship between IL-27 single nucleotide polymorphisms and therapy response in patients infected by hepatitis C virus (HCV). In this study we have investigated the potential role of SNPs in the promoter region of IL27 p28 gene (alleles rs153109) on the outcome of HCV infected patients.
METHODS: rs153109, corresponding to position c.-964A>G of the IL-27 locus, was amplified from genomic DNA extracted from 15 patients with chronic hepatitis C stratified by sustained viral response (SVR), relapser and non-responder, after treatment with peginterferon-α (PegIFN- α) combined with ribavirin (RBV). Amplification products were studied by direct sequencing.
RESULTS: This method has been applied in a preliminary study on patients with chronic hepatitis C to provide information for a standardized assay useful to genotyping of rs153109 SNPs of IL-27p28. The genotype distribution of the c.-964 A>G polymorphism was more present in patients who did not achieve a SVR. By contrast, the genotype G/G was absent in non-responder and relapser patients. Moreover, the analysis of allelic distribution of rs153109 highlighted a predominance of allele A in all genotypes in spite of allele G.
CONCLUSIONS: Our work provides preliminary information for a standardized method potentially useful for genotyping rs153109, and suggests its utility as a candidate approach to evaluate IL-27 p28 polymorphisms as additional clinical predictors of response to therapies in HCV infected patients."
25236991,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25236991/,"OBJECTIVES: This study was performed to assess the economic effect of interventions affecting transitions between dementia care settings in Germany.
METHODS: A Markov-model that models the course of dementia with respect to typical care setting transitions was derived. Model data and parameters were retrieved by literature reviews. A deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted to account for parameter uncertainty.
RESULTS: In the base case, the expected present value of remaining lifetime costs is €25,326 for each cohort member. As a function of effectiveness, pharmaceutical interventions may reduce the costs by 2% to 13% and psychosocial interventions come with savings of 1% to 10%. A structural intervention-promoting group living as a substitute for nursing home care increases costs by 2% to 8%. Sensitivity analyses indicate high variance and variability of results, as well as valuation of informal care being a crucial parameter.
CONCLUSIONS: There are economic benefits of delayed transitions to institutional settings, especially from the viewpoint of statutory care insurances, but these do unlikely exceed intervention costs. Thus, further intervention effects should be considered. Ultimately, concentrating research on preventive and protective factors of dementia could lead to an efficient intervention from every perspective."
25237000,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25237000/,"BACKGROUND: Among policy alternatives considered to reduce health care costs and improve outcomes, value-based insurance design (VBID) has emerged as a promising option. Most applications of VBID, however, have not used higher cost sharing to discourage specific services. In April 2011, the state of Oregon introduced a policy for public employees that required additional cost sharing for high-cost procedures such as total knee arthroplasty (TKA).
OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to estimate the societal impact of higher co-pays for TKA using Oregon as a case study and building on recent work demonstrating the effects of knee osteoarthritis and surgical treatment on employment and disability outcomes.
METHODS: We used a Markov model to estimate the societal impact in terms of quality of life, direct costs, and indirect costs of higher co-pays for TKA using Oregon as a case study.
RESULTS: We found that TKA for a working population can generate societal benefits that offset the direct medical costs of the procedure. Delay in receiving surgical care, because of higher co-payment or other reasons, reduced the societal savings from TKA.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that payers moving toward value-based cost sharing should consider consequences beyond direct medical expenses."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between June 1999 and September 2010, subureteral dextranomer was applied at our clinic to 149 patients (214 refluxing ureters) with grades II, III, and IV VUR. Group 1 consisted of 54 patients (80 ureters), and group 2 consisted of 95 patients (134 ureters). The standard subureteric transurethral injection (STING) procedure was applied to group 1, and the modified STING procedure was applied to group 2. A second and if needed a third injection was applied to unsuccessfully treated patients. The mean follow-up period was 2 years. Patients were evaluated by cystography and ultrasonography in the third month of follow-up.
RESULTS: VUR was resolved completely after a single injection in 54/80 ureters (67.5%) in group 1 and in 94/134 ureters (70.1%) in group 2. Overall successes after a second or a third injection were 61/80 (76.2%) and 111/134 (82.8%), respectively. There was a statistically significant difference between the groups only for grade IV reflux following multiple injections (p<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic treatment of VUR is a recommended treatment because it is minimally invasive, efficient, and repeatable. Our study confirmed that a modified STING procedure can be an alternative treatment to the standard technique."
25238026,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25238026/,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about lay understanding and decision making in response to colic. Horse-owners/carers are key to identifying colic and initiating veterinary intervention. Understanding how owners think and act in relation to colic could assist veterinary surgeons in tailoring information about colic with the aim of improving colic outcomes.
METHODS: A mixed methods approach was employed including qualitative in-depth interviews and a cross-sectional questionnaire. Qualitative data were analysed using Grounded theory to conceptualise processes involved in horse-owner management of colic. Following this, a cross-sectional survey was designed to test these concepts. Cluster analysis explored the role of the human-horse relationship upon colic management strategies.
RESULTS: Fifteen horse-owners with a range of colic experience participated in the interviews. A theoretical conceptual model was developed and described how horse-owners' recognised, assessed and responded to colic. Three main management strategies were used including 'wait and see', 'lay treatments' and 'seek veterinary assistance'. Actions in response to colic were moderated by owners' experience of colic and interpretation of the severity of colic signs. A postal questionnaire gathered data from 673 horse-owners from the North-West of the UK. The majority (605, 89.9%) of respondents were female. Cluster analysis revealed 5 meaningful groups of horse-owners based upon assessment of questionnaire items on the human-horse relationship. These groups included 2 professional and 3 amateur owner typologies. There were differences in the responses to some questionnaire items among the identified groups.
CONCLUSIONS: This study describes lay understanding and management of colic among a population of horse-owners from the North-West of the UK. The information may serve as a basis upon which to tailor existing programmes designed to educate owners about colic management strategies, and may inform veterinarians' interactions with horse-owners."
25238050,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25238050/,"OBJECTIVES: To determine whether the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Physician Fee Schedule confers higher value for physician work in procedure and test codes than in Evaluation and Management (E/M) codes.
BACKGROUND: Medicare Payment Advisory Commission previously demonstrated that time for medical services is the dominant element in valuing physician work in the CMS Physician Fee Schedule. In contrast, a more recent analysis suggests that more relative value units (RVUs) per unit time are issued for work in procedure codes than in E/M codes. Both prior analyses had important limitations for evaluating a possible systematic differential valuation of medical services.
METHODS: Data regarding RVUs, physician work times (minutes), and claims were obtained for all active level I Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes from 2011 CMS files. Linear regression was used to assess the associations of work time components and CPT category with work RVUs, including a model that weighted codes by the number of claims.
RESULTS: Included in the analysis were 6522 CPT codes (87 E/M codes, 6435 procedure/test codes). Compared with E/M codes, procedure/test codes did not have a significant difference in work RVUs adjusting for time (-0.631; 95% confidence interval, -1.427 to 0.166). The analysis also did not indicate a work RVU advantage specifically for Surgical CPT codes compared with E/M adjusting for time (-0.760; 95% confidence interval, -1.560 to 0.040). This pattern was not altered after weighting codes by the number of claims, indicating that an increase in RVUs per minute was not concentrated in a small number of highly utilized procedure codes.
CONCLUSIONS: We did not find evidence of a systematic higher valuation of physician work in procedure/test codes than in E/M codes in the CMS RVU system."
25238425,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25238425/,"OBJECTIVE: Perioperative myocardial ischemia (PMI) is a relatively rare but potentially fatal complication after coronary artery bypass grafting and is due to graft-related problems in a significant proportion of cases. The usual indicators of MI in the postoperative setting are unreliable and therefore have uncertain diagnostic value. Angiography, the criterion standard for preoperative angina, remains underused for evaluation of PMI. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of angiography in the management of PMI.
METHODS: Between January 2011 and September 2012, a total of 2312 isolated primary consecutive coronary artery bypass graft surgeries were performed, of which 2057 (89%) were carried out on the beating heart. Twenty-six (1.12%) of these patients needed perioperative angiography. The patients needing angiography were selected on the basis of a number of clinical, biochemical, and other diagnostic parameters
RESULTS: Twenty-six patients with PMI required angiography, of which 18 (69 %) were found to have graft-related issues. The mean (SD) time between operation and angiography was 24.58 (6.71) hours. Of the 18 patients, 17 (94.44%) required surgical intervention and 1 patient was treated with angioplasty. There were 2 deaths (11.1%) in the group undergoing intervention. Angiographic findings included occluded vein graft (n = 7), narrowing of the left internal mammary artery (n = 3), and kinking or stretching of grafts (n = 8).
CONCLUSIONS: Angiography is useful in diagnosing graft-related problems in the perioperative period. In presence of signs of graft compromise, we suggest that having a low threshold for angiographic graft evaluation may be beneficial in a carefully selected subset of patients after coronary artery bypass."

METHODS: An electronic search using the databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, updated to September 30, 2013, was performed.
RESULTS: A total of seven cohort studies (24,388 persons/year) show unequivocally that magnesium intake is associated with decreased risk of developing type 2 diabetes; two studies (13,076 persons/year) indicate that low magnesium intake is not associated with the risk of diabetes; one study (8,735 persons/year) shows that hypomagnesemia is associated with the development of impaired glucose metabolism. A total of 11 randomized controlled trials were identified; five show the effectiveness of oral magnesium salts in reducing glycemia in high-risk subjects and six studies carried out in patients with type 2 diabetes show inconsistent results.
CONCLUSIONS: Magnesium intake in the customary diet of subjects of the general population and the high-risk groups and/or oral magnesium supplementation is recommended for the prevention of diabetes. The efficacy of oral magnesium supplementation in the reduction of glucose levels in type 2 diabetic patients is inconsistent."

SETTING: Parents of 400 SIDS infants and 1386 controls provided information from five English health regions between 1993-6 (population: 17.7 million) and one of these regions between 2003-6 (population:4.9 million).
RESULTS: Over a third of SIDS infants (36%) were found co-sleeping with an adult at the time of death compared to 15% of control infants after the reference sleep (multivariate OR = 3.9 [95% CI: 2.7-5.6]). The multivariable risk associated with co-sleeping on a sofa (OR = 18.3 [95% CI: 7.1-47.4]) or next to a parent who drank more than two units of alcohol (OR = 18.3 [95% CI: 7.7-43.5]) was very high and significant for infants of all ages. The risk associated with co-sleeping next to someone who smoked was significant for infants under 3 months old (OR = 8.9 [95% CI: 5.3-15.1]) but not for older infants (OR = 1.4 [95% CI: 0.7-2.8]). The multivariable risk associated with bed-sharing in the absence of these hazards was not significant overall (OR = 1.1 [95% CI: 0.6-2.0]), for infants less than 3 months old (OR = 1.6 [95% CI: 0.96-2.7]), and was in the direction of protection for older infants (OR = 0.1 [95% CI: 0.01-0.5]). Dummy use was associated with a lower risk of SIDS only among co-sleepers and prone sleeping was a higher risk only among infants sleeping alone.
CONCLUSION: These findings support a public health strategy that underlines specific hazardous co-sleeping environments parents should avoid. Sofa-sharing is not a safe alternative to bed-sharing and bed-sharing should be avoided if parents consume alcohol, smoke or take drugs or if the infant is pre-term."
25238804,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25238804/,"BACKGROUND: The success of THA largely depends on correct placement of the individual components. Traditionally, these have been placed freehand using anatomic landmarks, but studies have shown poor accuracy with this method.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: Specifically, we asked (1) does using fluoroscopy lead to more accurate and greater likelihood of cup placement with the Lewinnek safe zone than does freehand cup placement; (2) is there a learning curve associated with the use of fluoroscopy for cup placement; (3) does the use of fluoroscopy increase operative time; and (4) is there a difference in leg length discrepancy between freehand and fluoroscopic techniques?
METHODS: This series consisted of 109 consecutive patients undergoing primary THA, conversion of a previous hip surgery to THA, and revision THA during a 24-month period. No patients were excluded from analysis during this time. The first 52 patients had cups placed freehand, and then the next 57 patients had acetabular components placed using fluoroscopy; the analysis began with the first patient treated using fluoroscopy, to include our initial experience with the technique. The abduction, version, and limb length discrepancy were measured on 6-week postoperative pelvic radiographs obtained with the patient in the supine position. Operative time, sex, age, BMI, diagnosis, operative side, and femoral head size were recorded as possible confounders.
RESULTS: Cups inserted freehand were placed in the ideal range of abduction (30°-45°) and anteversion (5°-25°) 44% of the time. With fluoroscopy, placement in the Lewinnek safe zone for both measures significantly increased to 65%. The odds of placing the cup in the Lewinnek safe zone for abduction and version were 2.3 times greater with the use of fluoroscopy (95% CI, 1.2-5.0; p = 0.03). Patients undergoing primary THAs (32 freehand, 35 C-arm) had cup placement in the safe zone for abduction and version 44% of the time freehand and 57% of the time with fluoroscopy, which failed to reach statistical significance. There was no difference in operative time, patient age, sex, operative side, diagnosis, limb length discrepancy, or femoral head size between the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of fluoroscopy to directly observe pelvic position and acetabular component placement increased the success of placement in the Lewinnek safe zone in this cohort of patients having complex and primary THAs. This is a simple, low-cost, and quick method for increasing successful acetabular component alignment. The study population included a large proportion of patients having complex THAs, and further validation of this technique in patients undergoing straightforward, primary THAs needs to be done to understand if similar gains in accuracy for component placement can be expected in that group.

OBJECTIVES: To examine the relationship between nutritional status and health-related quality of life in a group of free-living nonagenarians. Differences with octogenarians were also studied.
METHODS: Within Villanueva Older Health Study, 20 non-institutionalised people (92.5 ± 3.5 years; 80% women) make the nonagenarian subsample. Nutritional risk was assessed by Mininutritional Assessment questionnaire, dietary intake by a 24-hour dietary recall and health-related quality of life by EuroQoL-5D questionnaire. SPSS was used for statistical analysis.
RESULTS: 40% nonagenarians were at risk of malnutrition. Dietary assessment showed magnesium, zinc, potassium, folic acid, vitamin D and vitamin E deficiencies. Problems in mobility were more frequently reported (80%). EQ-5Dindex was associated with MNA(p<0.05). Self-care dimension was associated with calcium and niacin(p<0.05), retinol and cholesterol(p<0.01) intake. Usual activities dimension was associated with niacin(p<0.01) and cholesterol(p<0.05) intake. Pain/discomfort dimension was associated with protein(p<0.01), energy, selenium and niacin(p<0.05) intake. Anxiety/depression was associated with protein(p<0.01) and selenium(p<0.05) intake.
CONCLUSIONS: Risk of malnutrition is a factor associated to health-related quality of life. Results suggest that energy and some nutrient intakes could be possibly associated to health-related quality of life but further research on this influence is required."

However, in vivo structural and functional changes remain less explored.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study is to explore EEG-NFT induced in vivo changes in traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients.
METHOD: Two patients with mean age of 15 years with moderate head injury who had more than seven post concussion symptoms and poor cognitive performances (<5 percentile) were subjected to 20 sessions of EEG-NFT. The neuropsychological test scores, post concussion symptoms and MRI scan of the brain were recorded pre-post to EEG-NFT.
RESULTS: During EEG-NFT the cognitive scores and concussion symptoms improved significantly (p < 0.05). The EEG-NFT has shown significant increase in cortical grey matter (GM) volumes (p < 0.0001) and fractional anisotropy (FA) of cortical white matter (WM) tracts (p < 0.0001, voxel max 60 and above). There was a significant decrease in global, local efficiency, cost and clustering coefficient of functional connectivity (Wilcoxon Sign Rank Test p < 0.05). Interestingly there was a significant increase in thalamo-cortical connection (increase FA value) after EEG-NFT.
CONCLUSION: The EEG-NFT therapy has shown significant changes in structural and functional connectivity among young moderately injured TBI patients."
25239127,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25239127/,"BACKGROUND: Early visual impairments probably partially caused by impaired interactions between magnocellular (M) and parvocellular (P) pathways (M priming deficit), and disturbances of basic self-awareness or self-disorders (SDs) are core features of schizophrenia. The relationships between these features have not yet been studied. We hypothesized that the M priming was impaired in first-episode patients and that this deficit was associated with visual aspects of SDs.
AIM: To investigate early visual processing in a sample of first-episode schizophrenia patients and to explore the relationships between M and P functioning and visual aspects of SDs addressed by the Examination of Anomalous Self-Experience (EASE) interview.
METHOD: Nine stimulating conditions were used to investigate M and P pathways and their interaction in a pattern reversal visually evoked potential (VEP) paradigm. N80 at mixed M- and P-conditions was used to investigate magnocellular priming. Generators were analyzed using source localization (Brain Electrical Source Analysis software: BESA). VEPs of nineteen first-episode schizophrenia patients were compared to those of twenty matched healthy controls by a bootstrap resample procedure. Visual aspects of SDs were analyzed through a factor analysis to separate symptom clusters of derealization phenomena. Thereafter, the associations between the main factors and the N80 component were explored using linear mixed models.
RESULTS: Factor analyses separated two EASE factors (""distance to the world"", and ""intrusive world""). The N80 component was represented by a single dipole located in the occipital visual cortex. The bootstrap analysis yielded significant amplitude reductions and prolonged latencies in first-episode patients relative to controls in response to mixed M-P conditions, and normal amplitudes and latencies in response to isolated P- and M-biased stimulation. Exploratory analyses showed significant negative correlations between the N80 amplitude values at mixed M-P conditions and the EASE factor ""distance to the world"", i.e. relatively higher amplitudes in the patient group were associated with higher subjective perceived derealization (""distance to the world"").
CONCLUSIONS: The early VEP component N80 evoked by mixed M-P conditions is assumed to be a correlate of M priming, and showed reduced amplitudes and longer latencies in first-episode patients. It probably reflects a hypoactivation of the M-pathway. The negative association between visual SDs (derealization phenomena characterized by visual experiences of being more distant to the world), and the M priming deficit was counterintuitive. It might indicate a dysregulated activity of the M-pathway in patients with SDs. Further research is needed to better understand this preliminary finding."
25239241,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25239241/,"BACKGROUND: The crucial role of physicians in tobacco control (TC) is widely recognized. In 2008, Portugal implemented a non-comprehensive smoke-free policy (SFP). In 2009, a conference-survey was carried out to explore Portuguese physicians' engagement in tobacco control, by evaluating the following: 1) attendance at TC training and awareness of training needs; 2) participation in TC activities; 3) attitudes and beliefs regarding SFPs.
METHODS: Questionnaire-based cross-sectional study conducted during two major national medical conferences targeting GPs, hospitalists, and students/recent graduates. Descriptive analysis and logistic regression were performed.
RESULTS: Response rate was 63.7% (605/950). Of the 605 participants, 58.3% were GPs, 32.4% hospitalists, 9.3% others; 62.6% were female; mean age was 39.0 ± 12.9 years. Smoking prevalence was 29.2% (95% CI: 23.3-35.1) in males; 15.8% (95% CI: 12.1-19.5) in females, p < 0.001. While the overwhelming majority of physicians strongly agreed that second-hand smoke (SHS) endangers health, awareness of SFP benefits and TC law was limited, p < 0.001. A significant minority (35.5%) believed that SHS can be eliminated by ventilation systems. Most physicians lacked training; only a minority (9.0%) participated regularly in TC. Training was the most consistent predictor of participation in TC. General agreement with SFP was high; but significantly lower for indoor leisure settings, outdoors bans in healthcare/schools settings and smoking restrictions in the home/car, p < 0.001. Smoking behaviour strongly predicted support for smoking restrictions in restaurants and bars/discos, healthcare outdoors and private settings.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that Portuguese physicians are not aware of their role in tobacco control. Poor engagement of physicians in TC may contribute to the current lack of comprehensive policies in Portugal and Europe and undermine social norm change. Medical and professional continuing education on tobacco control should be made top priorities."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between July 2010 and August 2013, 16 patients (11 men and 5 women; mean age, 51 years) with a solitary posterior or parapelvic renal cyst and ipsilateral calculi underwent percutaneous intrarenal cyst marsupialization and simultaneous nephrolithotomy in our center. Mean cyst size was 6.3 cm (range, 4.2-11.8 cm). Mean stone surface area was 5.8 cm(2) (range, 1.8-12.1 cm(2)). By preoperative computed tomography planning and interoperative ultrasound guidance, the optimal puncture route was selected carefully to marsupialize the cyst and approach the target calyx. The cyst was marsupialized into the collecting system at the dilation process. Subsequently, percutaneous nephrolithotomy was performed in a standard fashion.
RESULTS: The mean operative time was 68 minutes (range, 47-93 minutes), and the mean hospital stay was 4 days (range, 3-7 days). A nephrostomy tube and a double-J stent were placed for a prolonged period to ensure the channel remained opened. Nearly complete cyst regression and calculi clearance confirmed by postoperative imaging was achieved in all patients. No intraoperative or postoperative complications in Clavien grading score ≥ 2 were noted during a mean follow-up of 21 months (range, 8-25 months).
CONCLUSION: In selected patients with a posterior or parapelvic renal cyst and ipsilateral calculi, the percutaneous technique is a safe and effective option through intermediate follow-up."
25239283,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25239283/,"OBJECTIVE: To study physical behavior in detail in fatigued persons with multiple sclerosis (MS).
DESIGN: Case-control explorative study.
SETTING: Outpatient rehabilitation department and participants' daily environment.
PARTICIPANTS: Fatigued persons with MS (n=23) were selected from a randomized controlled trial. Cases were matched by age and sex to healthy, nonfatigued controls (n=23). Eligible persons with MS were severely fatigued (Checklist Individual Strength fatigue domain mean score, 43.2±6.6) and ambulatory (Expanded Disability Status Scale mean score, 2.5±1.5).
INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Measurements were performed using an accelerometer over 7 days. Outcomes included the following: amount of physical activity expressed in counts per day, counts per minute (CPM), and counts per day period (morning, afternoon, evening); duration of activity intensity categories (sedentary, light physical activity, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity [MVPA]); and distribution of MVPA and sedentary periods over the day.
RESULTS: Persons with MS had fewer counts per day (mean difference, -156×10(3); 95% confidence interval [CI], -273×10(3) to -39×10(3); P=.010), had fewer CPM (mean difference, -135; 95% CI, -256 to -14; P=.030), and were less physically active in the morning (mean difference, -200; 95% CI, -389 to -11; P=.039) and evening (mean difference, -175; 95% CI, -336 to -14; P=.034) than controls. Persons with MS spent a higher percentage of their time sedentary (mean difference, 5.6; 95% CI, .1-11.1; P=.045) and spent less time at the higher MVPA intensity (mean difference, -2.4; 95% CI, -4.7 to -0.09; P=.042). They had fewer MVPA periods (mean difference, 29; 95% CI, -56.2 to -2.6; P=.032) and a different distribution of sedentary (mean difference, .033; 95% CI, .002 to .064; P=.039) and MVPA periods (mean difference, -.08; 95% CI, -.15 to -.01; P=.023).
CONCLUSIONS: Detailed analyses of physical behavior showed that ambulatory fatigued persons with MS do differ from healthy controls not only in physical activity level, but also in other physical behavior dimensions (eg, day patterns, intensity, distribution)."

This comparative study assessed the effect of training before the age of 6 years compared with a group of age-matched untrained children.
SETTING: Some schoolteachers were trained by emergency medical teams to perform basic first aid.
PARTICIPANTS: Eighteen classes comprising 315 pupils were randomly selected: nine classes of trained pupils (cohort C1) and nine classes of untrained pupils (cohort C2).
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The test involved observing and describing three pictures and using the phone to call the medical emergency centre. Assessment of each child was based on nine criteria, and was performed by the teacher 2 months after completion of first aid training.
RESULTS: This study concerned 285 pupils: 140 trained and 145 untrained. The majority of trained pupils gave the expected answers for all criteria and reacted appropriately by assessing the situation and alerting emergency services (55.7-89.3% according to the questions). Comparison of the two groups revealed a significantly greater ability of trained pupils to describe an emergency situation (p<0.005) and raise the alert (p<0.0001).

25239335,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25239335/,"BACKGROUND: Hemorrhagic shock leads to a complex cascade of metabolic and hormonal processes that may result in hypoperfusion, end organ damage, and death even when blood pressure is restored. Studies have shown that morbidity and mortality could be attributable to a diminished availability of endothelial-derived nitric oxide (eNO). It is unclear whether adequate levels of citrulline (CIT) and arginine (ARG)--the precursors of eNO synthesis--are available to sustain the eNO needed to maintain adequate perfusion in severe shock. An indirect measure of eNO is the ratio between the levels of ARG and its inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine (ARG/ADMA). The purpose of the study was to identify the temporal impact of the ARG/ADMA ratio, ARG, CIT, and ADMA in response to hemorrhage and crystalloid fluid resuscitation by the use of a porcine model of severe hemorrhagic shock.
METHODS: Hemorrhagic shock was induced in Yorkshire cross pigs by mimicking a bleeding pattern of rapid uncontrolled hemorrhage to achieve a shed volume of 30 mL/kg, a 50% decrease in mean arterial pressure, and an oxygen debt of >60 mL/kg. Normal saline, up to 2 times the shed blood volume, was started 1 hour after the start of hemorrhage with the goal of restoring mean arterial pressure to >50 mm Hg. Hemodynamics, blood gas measurements, and plasma samples were obtained at baseline, 1 hour after the start of hemorrhage, and 1 hour after resuscitation. Amino acids were measured by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: During hemorrhage, a distinct subset of pigs was better able to tolerate ischemia than the rest. These pigs required less resuscitation, had evidence of better organ perfusion, and exhibited less of an increase in interleukin-6 (IL-6) after resuscitation. Compared with their less-tolerant counterparts, this group had a greater increase in CIT above baseline (analysis of variance, P < .05) with hemorrhage. ARG levels were similar and remained stable with hemorrhage, which indicated the similar availability of substrate for eNO synthesis but differences in the quantity produced in response to the blood volume loss. With crystalloid fluid resuscitation, ARG levels and ARG/ADMA decreased (analysis of variance, P < .05), whereas CIT remained increased in the group less able to tolerate hemorrhage. ARG/ADMA decreased proportional to greater oxygen debt during hemorrhage and greater IL-6 levels with fluid resuscitation.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that a sufficient decrease in MAP during hemorrhagic shock is associated with a subsequent increase in IL-6, persisting impairment of end organ perfusion, and evidence of ongoing eNO deficit and an increase in ADMA despite resuscitation. The ARG/ADMA ratio reflects both of these parameters and corresponds to the increase in IL-6 and persistent ischemia after resuscitation. We propose that the mechanism of IL-6 increase in trauma derives from eNO deficiency, and the ARG/ADMA ratio more accurately depicts the pathologic mechanism responsible for increased morbidity and mortality in trauma."
25239355,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25239355/,"BACKGROUND: Many institutions now use empiric full-body computed tomography (CT) as a standard step in the initial workup of stable trauma patients. Recent data suggest that these scans may reveal unexpected injuries and improve survival in patients with polytrauma. However, patients who are unstable on presentation are often taken to the operating room (OR) without CT. Many of these patients undergo empiric full-body CTs after being stabilized in the OR, yet few data exist regarding how often early postoperative CT reveals unexpected injuries within compartments that have been explored surgically. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine if empiric abdominal/pelvic (ABD) CT after emergent trauma laparotomies are likely to reveal missed injuries requiring urgent management and improve patient management compared with clinical judgment alone.
METHODS: We review retrospectively 496 trauma patients who required urgent exploratory laparotomy at UPMC Presbyterian Hospital from 2007 to 2011. Patients were included if they went to the OR for exploratory laparotomy directly from the emergency department within 2 hours of arrival. Patients were excluded if they received any preoperative ABD CT imaging. Patients who expired in the OR were similarly excluded. Patients were stratified into 2 groups based on whether or not they received an empiric ABD CT in the 24 hours immediately after laparotomy. Medical records were reviewed to look for differences in missed injuries, urgent reexplorations, nontherapeutic interventions, and time to urgent reexploration.
RESULTS: There were 278 patients who met inclusion at exclusion criteria and constituted the study cohort. Of these patients, 124 underwent early empiric postoperative ABD CT imaging (45%). The remaining 154 patients did not undergo early ABD imaging (no CT group). The overall cohort had a 45% incidence of damage control procedures and a 9% rate of negative laparotomy. The 2 groups were statistically similar in age, presenting vitals, and abdominal Abbreviated Injury Scores. When the ABD CT group was compared with the no CT group, there was no difference in the overall rate of urgent reexplorations (7.3 vs 7.1%; P = .956), nontherapeutic urgent reexplorations (22 vs 18%; P = .822), or time to urgent reexploration (14 ± 10 vs 12 ± 10 hours; P = .686). Out of the 124 ABD CT patients, only 5 (4.0%) were diagnosed with injuries that were not identified at the time of the initial operation or caused by operative technique. When controlling for demographics, mechanism of injury, and injury severity, a logistic regression analysis revealed that early postoperative ABD CT was not associated with any differential risk of the need for further intervention (odds ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.37-1.9; P = .691).
CONCLUSION: The use of ABD CT soon after trauma laparotomy did not provide meaningful improvements in patient care in the cohort studied. Further higher level research is needed to clarify what role empiric ABD CT should play in the early postoperative period."
25239361,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25239361/,"BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infections, a risk factor for readmission, have been deemed a potentially preventable problem and, therefore, not reimbursable by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services since 2008. Defining the risk factors for development of urinary tract infection in the postoperative period will provide risk stratification for development of urinary tract infection in these challenging patients.
METHODS: Pre-, intra-, and postoperative characteristics were collected for patients ≥65 years who underwent an emergency abdominal operation from the 2005 to 2012 National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Participant User File, a database of 374 participating hospitals. In-hospital urinary tract infections occurring within 30 days of the operation were identified. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify risk factors of urinary tract infection.
RESULTS: In total, 53,879 patients were included, 1,881 (3.5%) of whom were diagnosed with a postoperative urinary tract infection before discharge. In-hospital urinary tract infection was associated with a longer hospital stay (27 vs 13 days, P < .001) and greater 30-day mortality rates (18% vs 16%, P = .003). The rate of urinary tract infection decreased from 4.5% before the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services decree to 3.2% thereafter (P < .001). Multivariable logistic regression demonstrated advanced age, female sex, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, dependent functional status, open wound, hypoalbuminemia, increased American Society of Anesthesiologists class, operative approach, and prolonged operative time were independent risk factors for development of postoperative urinary tract infection.
CONCLUSION: Although postoperative rates of urinary tract infection decreased after the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services decree, the lack of reimbursement is not justified, as few modifiable risk factors to further improve postoperative urinary tract infection rates in elderly emergency surgical patients were identified. Although targeted interventions may be developed, this complication is not easily preventable and will continue to plague acute care surgeons taking care of this challenging patient population."

We aimed to establish the proportion of patients who developed brain metastases following curative surgery and to estimate how many could have been detected by preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MR).
METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 646 patients who underwent surgery for lung cancer with curative intent at a regional thoracic surgical centre in the United Kingdom. We identified those who developed brain metastases in the postoperative period and, by using volume doubling times, estimated the size of the metastasis at the time of surgery. We then determined the proportion of metastases that would have been seen on preoperative MR brain at detection thresholds of 2 and 5mm diameter.
RESULTS: There was a 6.3% incidence of postoperative brain metastases, with the majority occurring within 12 months of surgery. Those who developed metastases were more likely to have adenocarcinoma and the majority had early stage malignancy (73% stage I or stage II). We estimate that 71% of those who developed cerebral metastases might have been detected had they undergone MR brain as part of their staging (4.4% of all patients).
CONCLUSION: Based on our findings we suggest that, in addition to standard staging investigations, patients have brain imaging (MR or equivalent) prior to curative surgery in NSCLC regardless of preoperative stage."
25239424,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25239424/,"OBJECTIVES: The Sysmex XE-5000 instruments (Sysmex, Kobe, Japan) count immature granulocytes (IGs) and use the ""Imm Gran?"" flag to signal unreliable results. This study investigated the usefulness of the ""Imm Gran?"" flag and the analytical and diagnostic performance of the IG measurements in a side-by-side evaluation.
METHODS: In total, 408 samples were analyzed on three XE-5000 instruments. The IG count and the ""Imm Gran?"" flag reports from all three instruments were used for reproducibility studies. The diagnostic performance of the automated IGs and the ""Imm Gran?"" flag were studied by comparing the XE-5000 results with the results of the manual differential.
RESULTS: The reproducibility of the ""Imm Gran?"" flagging between instruments was poor (қ, 0.75-0.80). The most significant contributor to the report of the ""Imm Gran?"" flag was bands, and the flag played a minor role in detecting blasts. The interinstrument reproducibility of the IG counts was high (intraclass correlation, 0.99). The IG count reported by XE-5000s was higher than the manual IG count (36%-55%), and the difference and the variability tended to increase with increasing levels of IGs.
CONCLUSIONS: The ""Imm Gran?"" flag has a poor analytical quality and gives no substantial information on the presence of blasts in the sample. We therefore suggest reporting the automated IG count without initial microscopic slide review."

The aim of this study was to identify and describe the variation in poster exhibitions across a spectrum of conferences attended by trainees.
DESIGN: Prospective observational assessment of conference posters was carried out across 7 variables at 4 conferences attended by surgical trainees in 2012. Posters were compared by individual variables and according to overall poster score combining all 7 variables examined. The number of authors listed was also compared.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Random samples of consecutively numbered posters were examined at the exhibitions of 4 conferences, which included a UK national medical education conference (Association for the Study of Medical Education), a UK international surgical conference (Association of Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland), a European oncology conference (European Society of Surgical Oncology), and a North American joint medical and surgical conference (Digestive Diseases Week).
RESULTS: Significant variation existed between conferences in posters and their presentation. The proportion of presenters failing to display their posters ranged from 3% to 26% (p < 0.0001). Adherence to size guidelines varied from 89% to 100% (p = 0.002). The inclusion of references ranged from 19% to 82% (p < 0.0001). The presence of a presenting author during the allocated session varied widely from 21% to 86% (p < 0.0001). No significant variation was observed in the proportion of posters that were formatted using aims, methods, results, and conclusion sections (81%-93%; p = 0.513) or in the proportion of posters that were identified as difficult to read (24%-28%; p = 0.919). Association for the Study of Medical Education outperformed each of the other exhibitions overall (p < 0.0001). Posters with greater than the median of 4 authors performed significantly better across all areas (p < 0.0001-0.042) except presenter attendance (p = 0.480).
CONCLUSIONS: Poster exhibitions varied widely, with room for improvement at all 4 conferences. Lessons can be learned by all conferences from each other to improve presenter engagement with and the educational value of poster exhibitions."
25239582,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25239582/,"INTRODUCTION: Variable tests evaluate the cardio-respiratory working capacity of COPD patients. Stairclimbing testing has been less studied. Our hypothesis is that this functional exercise test represents a submaximal effort for these patients.
METHOD: We compared in 10 COPD patients the main metabolic and ventilatory parameters at the end of an effort between stairclimbing and cycle ergometer test.
RESULTS: The following parameters studied (RER, V'CO2, lactates, V'E) are significantly lower for stair climbing. Nevertheless, in 8 patients, the V'O2 at the end of the stairclimbing testing is equal to the cycle ergometer test and in two patients superior. Concerning the evolution of some parameters during stairclimbing, 2 distinct profiles were observed: stabilization of the V'O2, HR, V'E and Vt (6/10 patients) or a constant increase of those parameters (4/10 patients).
CONCLUSION: Stairclimbing represents a submaximal effort for the majority of COPD patients combined with a high metabolic cost. However, some COPD patients execute a maximal effort like in the cycle ergometer test when climbing stairs. These two groups could not be differentiated with the rest lung function data. The hypothesis of different mechanical constraints and/or motivation is suggested."

Controls were patients diagnosed to have leptospirosis during the same period, but in the absence of liver disease. Both cases and controls were followed up until recovery or death.
RESULTS: Thirty-one patients had cirrhosis of the liver, and 91 controls had leptospirosis. Significantly more number of cirrhotics had jaundice (87.1 % vs. 16.5 %; p = 0.001), elevated blood urea (41.9 % vs. 18.7 %; p = 0.01), and serum creatinine (41.9 % vs. 19.8 %; p = 0.03) compared to the controls. There were four deaths due to hepatorenal dysfunction and coagulopathy in cirrhotics and no deaths in the control group (4 vs. 0; p = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Leptospirosis should be considered as yet another important cause of acute-on-chronic liver failure in endemic areas associated with poor outcome. Death is often due to hepatorenal dysfunction."
25239965,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25239965/,"INTRODUCTION: Smoking-cessation counseling during pregnancy is important to prevent smoking-related harm in pregnant smokers and their children. Therefore we evaluated the effects of an Inspectorate's supervision programme on the provision of smoking-cessation counseling by midwifery practices in the Netherlands. The supervision programme consisted of 3 elements: A) A deadline was announced by which all practices should comply with professional norms on such counseling (2011); B) A set of randomly selected practices were assessed using a questionnaire and a personal feedback report (2010); C) Another set of randomly selected practices were assessed through a site visit and a personal feedback report (2012).
METHODS: Programme A was evaluated in a before-after study, Programmes B and C were evaluated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with only a post-intervention measurement. Primary outcome was provision of smoking-cessation counseling through a minimal-intervention strategy (V-MIS). Linear and logistic regression models were used to analyze data from 233 primary-care midwifery practices.
RESULTS: A) After announcement of the deadline, Dutch midwifery practices reported significantly more provision of smoking-cessation counseling. For example, the use of V-MIS increased substantially from 28% to 80%; B) In practices that were assessed with a questionnaire, the provision of counseling improved partially compared to controls; C) The provision of counseling did not differ between practices that were visited and their controls. While the training participation rate in counseling by midwifery practices did not differ between the intervention and control groups, the rate increased significantly in all practices after the start of the supervision programme.
CONCLUSIONS: The provision of smoking-cessation counseling improved spectacularly in Dutch midwifery practices. Despite some limitations of our study, the Inspectorate's supervision programme is likely to have contributed to the improvements in provision of counseling."
25240123,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25240123/,"OBJECTIVE: Stigma associated with epilepsy has negative effects on psychosocial outcomes, affecting quality of life (QOL) and increasing disease burden in persons with epilepsy (PWEs). The aim of our study was to measure the impact of stigma on the QOL of PWEs and the prevalence of neurological disability due to stigmatized epilepsy.
METHOD: A prospective observational study with a sample of 208 PWEs was conducted. Neuropsychological Tests used were the Indian Disability Evaluation Assessment Scale (IDEAS) to measure disability, the Dysfunctional Analysis Questionnaire (DAQ) to measure QOL, and the Stigma Scale for Epilepsy (SSE) to assess stigma.
RESULTS: Spearman correlation was calculated, and stigma (SSE) was highly significant with QOL (DAQ) (0.019) and disability due to stigmatized epilepsy (IDEAS) (0.011).
CONCLUSION: The present study supports the global perception of stigma associated with epilepsy and its negative impact on their overall QOL and its contribution to the escalation of the disease burden."
25240250,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25240250/,"BACKGROUND: Pet ownership is thought to make a positive contribution to health, health behaviours and the general well-being of older people. More specifically pet ownership is often proposed as a solution to the problem of loneliness in later life and specific 'pet based' interventions have been developed to combat loneliness. However the evidence to support this relationship is slim and it is assumed that pet ownership is a protection against loneliness rather than a response to loneliness. The aim of this paper is to examine the association between pet ownership and loneliness by exploring if pet ownership is a response to, or protection against, loneliness using Waves 0-5 from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA).
METHODS: Using data from 5,210 men and women in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, cross-sectional and longitudinal regression analysis was used to assess the bi-directional relationship between loneliness and pet ownership among adults aged 50 + .
RESULTS: In 2001 (wave 0) 41% of participants were pet owners compared with 30% in 2010 (Wave 5). The association between pet ownership and loneliness is stronger in women than men, and in both directions (i.e. pet ownership predicting loneliness and loneliness predicting pet ownership) and of the similar magnitude (OR 1.2-1.4). Age, social relationships, demographic factors and health behaviour variables have only a minimal influence upon the association between loneliness and pet ownership. The results of our longitudinal analysis showed that women who reported being lonely always in Waves 0 to 5 were more likely to have a pet in Wave 5.
CONCLUSION: Reported loneliness is dependent on socio-demographic characteristics such as gender, household income, household living arrangements and health status. Taking those factors into account, owning a pet significantly influences later reporting of loneliness in women in our longitudinal analysis. In the reverse direction, reported loneliness influences pet ownership in later waves. In both directions, the relatively strong gender interaction suggests the association is limited to women with effects for men minimal or non-existent."
25240612,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25240612/,"OBJECTIVE: This study sets out to investigate the relationship between health status [EuroQol five-dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D)] in primary SS and three of the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) SS outcome measures-the disease activity index (ESSDAI), the patient reported index (ESSPRI) and the sicca score. In particular, the goal was to establish whether there is a relationship between the EULAR outcome measures and quality of life.
METHODS: Health status was evaluated using a standardized measure developed by the EuroQol Group-the EQ5D. This permits calculation of two measures of health status: time trade-off (TTO) values and the EQ-5D visual analogue scale (VAS) scores. We used Spearman's rank correlation analysis to investigate the strength of association between health status and three EULAR measures of physician- and patient-reported disease activity in 639 patients from the UK primary SS registry (UKPSSR) cohort.
RESULTS: This study demonstrates that the EULAR SS disease-specific outcome measures are significantly correlated with health outcome values (P < 0.001). Higher scores on the ESSDAI, EULAR sicca score and ESSPRI are associated with poorer health states-i.e. lower TTO values and lower VAS scores. While all three are significantly correlated with TTO values and EQ-5D VAS scores, the effect is strongest for the ESSPRI.
CONCLUSION: This study provides further evidence supporting the use of ESSDAI, EULAR sicca score and ESSPRI measures in the clinic. We also discuss the need for disease-specific measures of health status and their comparison with standardized health outcome measures."
25240899,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25240899/,"BACKGROUND: HIV prevalence is decreasing in much of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), but the drivers of the decline are subject to much dispute. Using mathematical modeling as a tool for hypothesis generation, we demonstrate how the hypothesis that the drop in prevalence reflects declines in sexual risk behavior is self-consistent. We characterize these potential declines in terms of their scale, duration, and timing, and theorize on how small changes in sexual behavior at the individual-level could have driven large declines in HIV prevalence.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A population-level deterministic compartmental model was constructed to describe the HIV epidemics in 24 countries in SSA with sufficient trend data. The model was parameterized by national HIV prevalence and HIV natural history and transmission data. The temporal evolution of sexual risk behavior was characterized using established tools and uncertainty and sensitivity analyses on the results were conducted.
RESULTS: Declines in the scale of sexual risk behavior between 31.8% (Botswana) and 89.3% (Liberia) can explain the declining HIV prevalence across countries. The average decline across countries was 68.9%. The transition in sexual risk behavior lasted between 2.7 (Botswana) and 16.6 (Gabon) years with an average of 8.2 years. The turning point year of the transition occurred between 1993 (Burundi) and 2001 (Namibia), but clustered around 1995 for most countries. The uncertainty and sensitivity analyses affirmed our model predictions.
CONCLUSION: The hypothesis that HIV prevalence declines in SSA have been driven by declines in sexual risk behavior is self-consistent and provides a convincing narrative for an evolving HIV epidemiology in this region. The hypothesized declines must have been remarkable in their intensity, rapidity, and synchronicity to explain the temporal trends in HIV prevalence. These findings provide contextual support for the hypothesis that changes in sexual behavior that materialized in the 1990s are a dominant driver of the recent decreases in HIV prevalence."
25241073,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25241073/,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility of 3-dimensional ultrasound (3DUS) for sonographic localization of Essure microinserts, comparing it with 2-dimensional ultrasound (2DUS) insofar as time to visualize the inserts and accuracy in determining their localization.
DESIGN: Prospective study (Canadian Task Force classification II-2).
SETTING: University clinic.
PATIENTS: Twenty-seven consecutive women undergoing hysteroscopic Essure device placement.
INTERVENTIONS: Essure microinserts were inserted in the outpatient hysteroscopy clinic following the manufacturer's recommendations, leaving from 3 to 8 loops of the inserts in the uterine cavity. In all patients, 2DUS and 3DUS were performed 3 months after the procedure. 2DUS was performed first; the device(s) were located, and their position was recorded. Then 3DUS scans were acquired, trying when possible to have both devices at least at a 45-degree angle with the insonation beam for optimal rendering on 3DUS. The OmniView method with volume contrast imaging was used to show the relationships of the microinserts within the uterine cavity when possible. To define the position of the Essure device in relation to the uterus and the salpinges, we used the classification developed by Legendre and colleagues. After sonographic evaluation all women underwent hysterosalpingography to assess the success of sterilization.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Hysteroscopic insertion was successful in all patients, with 2 Essure devices placed in 25 patients and 1 device in 2 patients (due to previous salpingectomy performed because of ectopic pregnancy), for a total of 52 devices. One spontaneous late (within 3 months) expulsion of the device occurred; the device had migrated almost completely into the uterine cavity. At 3-month follow-up, all 51 correctly placed devices were easily observed at 2DUS (mean [SD] duration of the procedure, 2.25 [0.8] minutes). At 3DUS in 51 cases, the device was in perfect position (1+2+3) in 21 (41.2%), in position 2+3 in 14 (27.4%), and in position +3 in 16 (31.4%). Both microinserts were observed on 3DUS reconstructed images in 31 of 35 (88.6%) 1+2+3 and 2+3 cases. However, in the 16 cases in which the devices were in position +3 (salpinx only), a single 3D sweep failed to demonstrate both devices in 10 of 16 cases (62.5%), due to substantially different angles of orientation of the inserts. This was because if 1 of the 2 devices was placed at a <30-degree angle with the insonation beam, its identification along the uterine wall was questionable because of concurrent hyperechogenicity of the bowel loops and poor visualization. Time for performance of 3DUS was 14.4 [4.8] minutes. Hysterosalpingography was performed in all patients, and confirmed tubal occlusion in all but 1 case.
CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of a limited number of patients, 2DUS is more time-efficient and equivalent to 3DUS in locating Essure contraceptive microinserts. These results should be considered when planning sonographic follow-up of patients with Essure devices."
25241155,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25241155/,"OBJECTIVES: (1) to describe Emergency Department (ED) physicians' and nurses' perceptions about the sequence of work related to patient management with use of an integrated Emergency Department Information System (EDIS), and (2) to measure changes in the sequence of clinician access to patient information.
METHODS: A mixed method study was conducted in four metropolitan EDs. Each used the same EDIS which is a module of the hospitals' enterprise-wide clinical information system composed of many components of an electronic medical record. This enabled access to clinical and management information relating to patients attending all hospitals in the region. Phase one - data were collected from ED physicians and nurses (n=97) by 69 in-depth interviews, five focus groups (28 participants), and 26 h of observations. Phase two - physicians (n=34) in one ED were observed over 2 weeks. Data included whether and what type of information was accessed from the EDIS prior to first examination of the patient.
RESULTS: Clinicians reported, and phase 2 observations confirmed, that the integrated EDIS led to changes to the order of information access, which held implications for when tests were ordered and results accessed. Most physicians accessed patient information using EDIS prior to taking the patients' first medical history (77/116; 66.4%, 95% CI: 57.8-75.0%). Previous discharge summaries (74%) and past test results (61%) were most frequently accessed and junior doctors were more likely to access electronic past history information than their senior colleagues (χ(2)=20.717, d.f.=1, p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The integrated EDIS created new ways of working for ED clinicians. Such changes could hold positive implications for: time taken to reach a diagnosis and deliver treatments; length of stay; patient outcomes and experiences."
25241184,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25241184/,"OBJECTIVE: To characterize factors associated with readmission for acute asthma exacerbation, particularly around caregiver asthma knowledge, beliefs, and reported adherence to prescribed medication regimens.
STUDY DESIGN: We enrolled 601 children (aged 1-16 years) who had been hospitalized for asthma. Caregivers completed a face-to-face survey regarding their asthma knowledge, beliefs, and medication adherence. Caregivers also reported demographic data, child's asthma severity, exposure to triggers, access to primary care, and financial strains. We prospectively identified asthma readmission events via billing data over a 1-year minimum follow-up period. We examined time to readmission with Cox proportional hazards.
RESULTS: The study cohort's median age was 5 years, 53% were African American, and 57% were covered by Medicaid. At 1 year, 22% had been readmitted for asthma. In the multivariate analysis, a caregiver's demonstration of increased asthma knowledge was associated with increased readmission risk. In addition, children whose caregivers reported less-than-perfect adherence to daily medication regimens had increased readmission risk. Likewise, having previously been admitted for asthma, decreased medical home access, and black race were associated with increased readmission risk.
CONCLUSION: In a multifactorial assessment of risk factors for asthma readmission, greater asthma knowledge and decreased medication adherence were associated with readmission. Inpatient efforts to prevent readmission might best target medication adherence rather than continuing to primarily provide asthma education."
25241223,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25241223/,"BACKGROUND: Remote monitoring (RM) is increasingly used to follow up patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs). Randomized control trials provide evidence for the benefit of this intervention, but data for RM in daily clinical practice with multiple-brands and unselected patients is lacking.
AIMS: To assess the effect of RM on patient management and clinical outcome for recipients of ICDs in daily practice.
METHODS: We reviewed ICD recipients followed up at our institution in 2009 with RM or with traditional hospital only (HO) follow-up. We looked at the effect of RM on the number of scheduled ambulatory follow-ups and urgent unscheduled consultations, the time between onset of asymptomatic events to clinical intervention and the clinical effectiveness of all consultations. We also evaluated the proportion of RM notifications representing clinically relevant situations.
RESULTS: We included 355 patients retrospectively (RM: n=144, HO: n=211, 76.9% male, 60.3±15.2 years old, 50.1% with ICDs for primary prevention and mean left ventricular ejection fraction 35.5±14.5%). Average follow-up was 13.5 months. The RM group required less scheduled ambulatory follow-up consultations (1.8 vs. 2.1/patient/year; P<0.0001) and a far lower median time between the onset of asymptomatic events and clinical intervention (7 vs. 76 days; P=0.016). Of the 784 scheduled ambulatory follow-up consultations carried out, only 152 (19.4%) resulted in therapeutic intervention or ICD reprogramming. We also found that the vast majority of RM notifications (61.9%) were of no clinical relevance.
CONCLUSION: RM allows early management of asymptomatic events and a reduction in scheduled ambulatory follow-up consultations in daily clinical practice, without compromising safety, endorsing RM as the new standard of care for ICD recipients."
25241660,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25241660/,"BACKGROUND: Subjective visual vertical (SVV) assesses visual dependence for spacial orientation, via vertical perception testing. Using the computerized rod-and-frame test (CRFT), SVV is thought to be an important measure of cervical proprioception and might be greater in those with whiplash associated disorder (WAD), but to date research findings are inconsistent.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the most sensitive SVV error measurement to detect group differences between no neck pain control, idiopathic neck pain (INP) and WAD subjects.
DESIGN: Cross sectional study.
METHODS: Neck Disability Index (NDI), Dizziness Handicap Inventory short form (DHIsf) and the average constant error (CE), absolute error (AE), root mean square error (RMSE), and variable error (VE) of the SVV were obtained from 142 subjects (48 asymptomatic, 36 INP, 42 WAD).
RESULTS: The INP group had significantly (p < 0.03) greater VE and RMSE when compared to both the control and WAD groups. There were no differences seen between the WAD and controls.
CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that people with INP (not WAD), had an altered strategy for maintaining the perception of vertical by increasing variability of performance. This may be due to the complexity of the task. Further, the SVV performance was not related to reported pain or dizziness handicap. These findings are inconsistent with other measures of cervical proprioception in neck pain and more research is required before the SVV can be considered an important measure and utilized clinically."
25241757,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25241757/,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the current study is to determine whether serum levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) can be biological indicators for the diagnosis of schizophrenia in patients with depressive symptoms.
METHOD: Forty-seven patients (11 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, 16 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and comorbid depression and 20 patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder) and 20 healthy subjects were enrolled. The Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale, the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale were used for assessment. The serum BDNF and IL-2 levels of all the subjects were studied.
RESULTS: Decreased levels of serum BDNF and increased levels of serum IL-2 were found in the patients diagnosed with either schizophrenia, schizophrenia with depression, or major depressive disorder (p = 0.049, p = 0.010; p = 0.001 and p = 0.044; p = 0.027, p = 0.003; respectively) compared with control group. There were no significant differences between the patient groups in their serum BDNF and IL-2 levels.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that neurotrophic factors and immune system changes are involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia with or without depressive symptomatology. However, the data do not clarify whether depressive symptoms in schizophrenia occur as a dimension of schizophrenia or as symptoms of major depression that is comorbid with schizophrenia."
25241915,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25241915/,"BACKGROUND: Determining the degree of work disability following traffic accidents is very challenging. Functional capacity evaluations (FCEs) are becoming more commonly used in the process of disability assessment.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the agreement of the physicians' decision regarding the degree of work disability in two conditions: 1) based solely on a medical examination 2) based on a combined medical and FCE.
METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study, with 123 individuals who experienced car accidents; 76 with whiplash-associated disorders and 47 with a hip fracture. All subjects underwent an FCE, filled-in questionnaires and underwent a medical examination. The medical charts of each subject were rated twice and the degree of work disability was determined by orthopedic surgeons and occupational medicine specialists; once based solely on medical files and once based on medical files that included data from the FCE. The agreement was assessed by Intra-Class Coefficients (ICC) and the dependency between the two ratings by McNemar's test.
RESULTS: An excellent ICC and significant dependency were found for the percent disability in the hip injury group whereas a fair ICC and a non significant dependency for the percent disability in the whiplash group.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of FCEs highlights the worker's capacity to perform duties that are part of the physical demands at work. The integration of FCEs into the disability assessment procedure seems to be important especially for whiplash injuries or in cases of discrepancies between the rate of disability determined by the physician to the patient's complaints and participation."
25242233,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25242233/,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To establish the risk of unidentified neoplasia and subsequent adverse outcomes of laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy (SCH) with morcellation.
DESIGN: Retrospective review (Canadian Task Force classification II-2).
SETTING: University community hospital.
PATIENTS: Consecutive women who had undergone SCH with morcellation between January 2002 and December 2008.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Medical records were assessed for patient characteristics and outcomes. We identified 808 women who had undergone planned laparoscopic SCH with morcellation. Their median age was 44.1 years (range, 23.4-79.8 years). The most common indications were menorrhagia in 472 patients (58.4%) and leiomyomas in 400 patients (49.5%). Of the 30 patients in whom laparoscopy was converted to an open procedure before morcellation, 1 had leiomyosarcoma at final pathologic analysis. Of the 778 patients who underwent laparoscopic SCH with morcellation, 16 (2.0%) had endometrial hyperplasia and 3 (0.4%) had cancer at final pathologic analysis. Abnormal pathologic findings were more likely in women older than age 50 years with abnormal bleeding. Of the 778 patients, 189 were younger than 40 years, and 4 of these 189 women (2.1%) had hyperplasia at final pathologic analysis; none had cancer. Of the 433 patients aged 40 to 49 years, 8 (1.8%) had hyperplasia or cancer. Of the 156 patients aged 50 years or older, 7 (4.5%) had hyperplasia (p = .18); none had cancer. No patient with hyperplasia or morcellated cancer experienced adverse sequelae after a median follow-up of 90.4 months.
CONCLUSION: In this cohort of patients who underwent laparoscopic SCH, the risk of hyperplasia or malignancy was low. Laparoscopic SCH with morcellation seems to be a low-risk procedure."
25242339,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25242339/,"INTRODUCTION: Laparoscopy has become the gold-standard approach for excision of benign adrenal tumors but the question of its safety for malignant lesions is still controversial. Our aim was to evaluate the oncologic outcome of laparoscopic adrenalectomy for adrenal metastasis and to look for predictors of a negative surgical outcome.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of all patients who underwent laparoscopic adrenalectomy for suspicion of adrenal metastasis between 2007 and 2013 at a single academic institution. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate analysis was performed to determine risk factors of negative surgical outcome (positive surgical margins, complications, conversion, significant blood loss) and predictors of RFS and CSS.
RESULTS: Thirteen patients underwent 14 laparoscopic adrenalectomies. All patients were operated by a single highly experienced surgeon. Complications occurred in 2 patients (15%): 2 blood transfusions (Clavien-score=2). There were 3 positive surgical margins (21%). Mean length of hospital stay was 4.3 days. Unadjusted RFS and CSS were respectively 48.4% and 83.3% at 1 year, 39.5% and 66.7% at 5 years. In univariate analysis, tumor size was the only risk factor of complication (P=.009) and conversion (P=0.009). Capsule invasion and tumor size were risk factors of positive surgical margins (P=0.01 and P<0.0001). One hundred percent of complications, conversion and positive surgical margins occurred in tumor>7.5 cm on preoperative CT-scan. No predictors of RFS and CSS was found in univariate analysis.
CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic adrenalectomy for adrenal metastasis achieves good surgical and oncologic outcomes. When performed by highly experienced surgeon, complications and positive surgical margins occur only in tumors>7.5 cm. These patients may benefit from an open surgical approach."
25242460,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25242460/,"PURPOSE: Restoring a neutral mechanical axis in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) (within ±3° of varus/valgus) is associated with superior functional outcome and reduced early implant failure. Using conventional alignment jigs results in malalignment in >20 % of cases. In this study, we investigated the reduction of outliers within the threshold of ±3° of leg alignment using a ""pinless"" navigation system in comparison with conventional alignment jigs investigated.
METHODS: In this randomised prospective study, 80 patients were randomly assigned/allocated to the pinless or conventional control group. After surgery, the two groups were compared regarding outliers > ±3° by means of hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA), mechanical medial proximal tibia angle (mMPTA), mechanical lateral distal femoral angle (mLDFA) and duration of surgery. Student's unpaired t test was used for quantitative variables, Fisher's exact test compared groups (pinless vs. control) and a two-sided p value of ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: In the pinless group, outliers regarding HKA and mLDFA > ±3° was significantly reduced (p = 0.025 and p = 0.002 respectively). In the pinless group, the surgery duration was significantly longer (75.6 vs. 64.5 minutes, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Pinless navigation is effective in reducing outliers > ±3° regarding HKA without risking pin-related complications, such as fractures, infections or breaking screws. However, not all tools for conventional navigation in TKA, such as real-time measurements of the tibiofemoral axis and gap balancing, are available."
25242516,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25242516/,"BACKGROUND: Romiplostim and eltrombopag, the two marketed thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs), have distinct binding sites and might have distinct pharmacodynamic mechanisms. The aim of this study was to compare their adverse drug reaction (ADR) patterns.
METHODS: We selected in the French PharmacoVigilance Database all ADRs associated with TPO-RAs from TPO-RA marketing until the 31st of December 2013. Medical charts were reviewed. We conducted disproportionality analyses comparing romiplostim exposure in the reports of a given ADR pattern (thrombosis, neurological, cutaneous, gastrointestinal or hematological) to romiplostim exposure in all other TPO-RA-related ADR reports. Reporting Odds Ratios (RORs) were adjusted for age and gender. We also compared the number of reports of a given ADR pattern per million daily defined doses (DDDs) dispensed in France during the study period.
RESULTS: We described 45 reports (53 ADRs) with romiplostim and 26 reports (37 ADRs) with eltrombopag. There were 19 venous thromboses. At least one other risk factor was present in 83.3% of the cases. Ten (55.6%) patients had been splenectomized previously. There were eight arterial thromboses. Another risk factor was noticed in all cases. There was no signal for an excess risk of thrombosis with romiplostim versus eltrombopag (ROR: 1.45, 95% CI [0.48-4.45]). There was a signal for a higher risk of gastrointestinal ADRs with eltrombopag (ROR: 30.28, 95% CI [3.23-383.86]) and of hematological ADRs with romiplostim (ROR: 14.36, 95% CI [1.73-119.08]). Dispensing data-adjusted comparisons led to similar results.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests different ADR patterns between romiplostim and eltrombopag."
25242564,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25242564/,"OBJECTIVE: The influence of tumor size on postural control of patients with vestibular schwannoma (VS) remains to be determined. This study aimed to compare the postural performances of VS patients, according to the size of the tumor, with healthy subjects.
METHODS: The six conditions (C1-C6) of the sensory organization test (SOT) were carried out in 87 patients, split into four groups according to the Koos classification (stage I-IV), and in 72 aged-matched controls to evaluate postural control. The vestibular reflectivity and compensation were estimated with videonystagmography.
RESULTS: Among patients, lower C5 and C6 scores were found in stage I and IV patients than in stage II and III patients, whereas vestibular compensation did not impact the tumor size influence on the postural control. The scores were significantly (p<0.001) lower for all the groups of patients than the controls in the vestibular-related SOT conditions (C5-C6).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with an unilateral VS displayed altered postural performances compared to the control subjects and tumor size had a bell-like pattern effect on balance control.
SIGNIFICANCE: The tumor size could be seen as a determining factor in the implementation of adaptive mechanisms that lead to the postural compensation and might be dissociated from vestibular compensation."
25242755,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25242755/,"BACKGROUND: The Immuknow assay (IKA; Cylex) is a T-cell immune function assay that evaluates immunoreactivity in immunocompromised patients. The aim of this study was to analyze IKA values in a cohort of kidney transplantation (KT) recipients to investigate correlations between single-time point low IKA values and their trend over time with cytomegalovirus (CMV) or BK virus (BKV) reactivation.
METHODS: A total of 118 adult patients receiving deceased-donor KT were enrolled (55.6±11.9 years old; 79 [66.9%] male). IKA CMV and BKV viremia determinations and were performed at months 1, 3, and 6 after surgery.
RESULTS: Overall, 272 IKA determinations were performed: IKA values significantly decreased from month 1 (422±184 ng/mL) to month 3 (330±159 ng/mL; P<.001) and from month 3 to month 6 (300±128 ng/mL; P=.030). IKA values did not correlate with renal function or viral reactivation at any time. However, patients with either CMV or BKV viremia had a trend to higher IKA values at month 1 and lower IKA values at month 6, even if the difference did not reach a statistical significance (P=.115).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that presence of low immunologic reactivity (IKA<225 ng/mL) is not associated with an increased risk of CMV and BKV reactivation over the 1st 6 months after KT. However, a trend to a more pronounced drop in IKA values over time was observed in patients with viral reactivation. These preliminary results suggests that drop in IKA values within the 1st post-KT months, unlike single-time point immune function assay, may predict the risk of opportunistic viral infections."
25242785,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25242785/,"INTRODUCTION: Safety in conducting a clinical trial is a prerequisite for patients who will be enrolled into that study. The aim of the present study was to evaluate retrospectively if patient and graft survival were similar among patients who participated in clinical trials versus those who did not.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated pretransplant and posttransplant characteristics of 245 kidney transplant (KT) patients who were selected to participate in at least one Phase II/Phase III clinical trial. We compared them with 361 KT patients who were not enrolled or refused to participate in those clinical trials; all studies were conducted at a single transplant center. Inclusion/exclusion criteria were as noted for each individual protocol. Only studies with enrollment at time of graft implant were considered.
RESULTS: Selection of patients participating in clinical trials in general exclude high-risk patients. In our experience, only 36% of transplanted patients were selected for a multicenter, prospective, randomized, international study that included changes to the strategies in the administration of immunosuppressive drugs already on the market or development of a new immunosuppressant. After 5 years, graft and patient survival rates were similar between those who participated and those who did not participate in a clinical study. Although our data were collected retrospectively, an alternative design to achieve these conclusions would be a noninferiority study.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated similar rates of graft and patient survival among enrolled patients versus nonenrolled patients. Outcome surveillance offers safety in participating in clinical trials that involve changes in standard immunosuppression therapy and are part of the research necessary to develop patient-centered medical interventions."
25243354,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25243354/,"PURPOSE: A historical perspective on how the writings of Plato influenced Florence Nightingale in the formation of nursing as a respected profession for women. Comparing Nightingale's life and legacy to Platonic philosophy demonstrates how philosophy continues to speak to the profession of nursing practice as guardians of society in the 21st century.
METHODS: A review of the literature using EBSCO, SAGEpub, MEDLINE, and CINAHL databases and hand searches of literature were initiated for the years 1990-2014 using the terms ""Plato,"" ""Nightingale,"" and ""nursing"" restricted to English.
FINDINGS: Florence Nightingale, known as the mother of modern-day nursing, embodied her life and work after the philosophic tenets of Plato. Plato's Allegory of the Cave influenced Nightingale's attitudes with regard to the value of education, knowledge of the good, and the importance of imparting learned knowledge to others. Plato's work spoke of educating both men and women to seek the truth, affording both sexes to become competent as future leaders in the role of guardians to society. Nightingale's emphasis of education for women as a conduit for their usefulness to society mirrored Plato's philosophy.
CONCLUSION: Over 100 years after her death, the impact Florence Nightingale still has on professional nursing practice remains. Scholarship in nursing education today is infused with a liberal arts background in philosophy, ethics, and the sciences. Nightingale's holistic concepts of person, health, and environment in the practice of nursing coalesced with her statistical analyses in validating nursing actions foreshadowed the development of universal nursing knowledge and language base and meta-paradigm concepts in nursing. Further classification and categorization of Nightingale's concepts of assessing, implementing, and evaluating delivery of care became the linguistic precursors for the identification of nursing process, nursing actions, and nursing diagnoses.
NURSING IMPLICATIONS: Plato's and Nightingale's holistic, scientific, and humanistic approach to living, and to care practice in all its dimensions, grounds the discipline of nursing in a liberal arts and critical thinking matrix, elevating nursing to higher ethical, safe, and professional levels of standards."
25243500,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25243500/,"BACKGROUND: Specific learning disorders (SLDs) are a group of neuropsychological disorders which reduce a child's ability to read and/or write and/or use numbers. Internalizing disorders, and in particular anxiety, has been reported as a relatively common comorbidity in children with reading difficulties. We conducted this study in order to test if school experience (in terms of perceived support from the teacher) is associated with the development of anxiety.
METHODS: Twenty patients with SLDs (age: 8-13) were compared to 32 healthy subjects of the same age. All subjects filled the scale to measure anxiety derived from the Self-Administered Psychiatric Scales for Children and Adolescents (SAFA); results were compared using non-parametric statistics after verifying that scores were not normally distributed.
RESULTS: Patients more often had a clinically significant level of anxiety (Mann Whitney U Test; P<0.001). We found a significant inverse correlation between a school experience perceived as positive and anxiety (Spearman's rho=- 0.925; P<0.001), while no significant correlation was found for sex, age, timeliness of diagnosis or time since diagnosis.
CONCLUSION: Although these findings need to be confirmed in prospective studies, the role of school experience for children with SLDs seems highly relevant also for their psychological well-being."
25243520,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25243520/,"BACKGROUND: Past studies comparing attitudes toward transvaginal natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery (NOTES(®); American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy [Oak Brook, IL] and Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons [Los Angeles, CA]) to laparoscopic surgery have produced a wide variety of conflicting results, with some studies showing a preference for NOTES, a preference for transgastric NOTES only, or a rejection of NOTES. Given the disparity in results, our study aimed to identify demographic data as well as clinical factors, such as risk of infection, need for postsurgical abstinence from sexual activity, and risk of infertility, that significantly affect women's opinions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: At outpatient general surgery clinics, 142 women completed a survey regarding their opinions about transvaginal NOTES and their main concerns regarding surgery. Women rated their concerns using a 5-point Likert scale. De-identified demographic, social, and medical history data were also collected. Fisher's exact test and multiple logistic regression analysis were used to test associations between women's concerns and their choice for transvaginal NOTES over standard laparoscopic surgery.
RESULTS: Age was statistically significant in determining a woman's choice, and the interaction variable of age × cosmesis showed a trend toward significance. Thirty-five percent of women <36 years of age would choose transvaginal NOTES, whereas 63% and 61% of women 36-55 and >55 years of age, respectively, would choose the transvaginal technique (P=.024). Women who felt that cosmesis was a concern were much more likely to choose NOTES, especially if they were in the 36-55- or ≥ 56-year-old age groups. The comprehensive model showed that age ≥ 36 years, concern for adhesions, and concern for cosmesis made a woman more likely to choose NOTES. Similarly, concerns for hernia risk and abstinence made a woman less likely to choose NOTES.
CONCLUSIONS: Women generally have a positive perception of NOTES. However, because NOTES procedures are not yet widespread, further studies need to be done to investigate and to elucidate why this technique is not yet widely utilized despite these opinions and its potential benefits."
25244437,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25244437/,"INTRODUCTION: Spirometry should follow strict quality criteria. The American Thoracic Society (ATS) recommends the use of a noseclip; however there are controversies about its need. ATS also indicates that tests should be done in the sitting position, but there are no recommendations neither about position of the upper limbs and lower limbs nor about who should hold the mouthpiece while performing the maneuvers: evaluated subject or evaluator.
OBJECTIVES: To compare noseclip use or not, different upper and lower limbs positions and who holds the mouthpiece, verifying if these technical details affect spirometric results in healthy adults.
METHODS: One hundred and three healthy individuals (41 men; age: 47 [33-58] years; normal lung function: FEV₁/FVC = 83±5, FEV₁ = 94 [88-104]%predicted, FVC = 92 [84-102]%predicted) underwent a protocol consisting of four spirometric comparative analysis in the sitting position: 1) maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV) with vs without noseclip; 2) FVC performed with vs without upper limbs support; 3) FVC performed with lower limbs crossed vs lower limbs in neutral position; 4) FVC, slow vital capacity and MVV comparing the evaluated subject holding the mouthpiece vs evaluator holding it.
RESULTS: Different spirometric variables presented statistically significant difference (p<0.05) when analysing the four comparisons; however, none of them showed any variation larger than those considered as acceptable according to the ATS reproducibility criteria.
CONCLUSIONS: There was no relevant variation in spirometric results when analyzing technical details such as noseclip use during MVV, upper and lower limb positions and who holds the mouthpiece when performing the tests in healthy adults."
25244882,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25244882/,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the profile of the average organ non-donor, compare it to that of the average donor, and identify characteristics that predict the likelihood that a given individual will be a non-donor.
METHODS: The charts of 397 consenting potential organ donors of LifeLink of Puerto Rico from 2009 through 2011 were reviewed. Data regarding gender, age, BMI, the presence of diabetes, hypertension and/or kidney injury, death from cerebrovascular accident, and smoking were collected.
RESULTS: Of the 397 charts reviewed, 283 were from donors, 96 were from non-donors, and 18 were excluded from the analysis. When compared to donors, non-donors were found more frequently to be 60 years old or older, diabetic, hypertensive, or obese; to have suffered from kidney injury, to have smoked and to have died of a cerebrovascular accident. On multivariate analysis, age, diabetes, kidney injury and smoking remained significant. However, after adjusting for age, only smoking and death from cerebrovascular accident remained statistically associated to non-donor status.
CONCLUSION: Although being over 60 years old, having smoked and dying from a cerebrovascular accident were characteristics found significantly more frequently in non-donors, these characteristics were also present in some donors. Therefore, a careful evaluation of each potential donor is still mandatory to avoid the loss of transplantable organs."
25245132,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25245132/,"BACKGROUND: Many factors contributing to anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury risk have been investigated. Recently, some ACL-injured individuals have presented with a decreased range of hip internal rotation compared with controls. The pathomechanics of why decreased hip range of motion increases risk of ACL injury have not yet been studied.
HYPOTHESIS: Peak relative strain of the anteromedial bundle of the ACL (AM-ACL) during a simulated single-leg pivot landing is inversely related to the available range of internal femoral rotation.
STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study.
METHODS: A series of pivot landings were simulated in 10 female and 10 male human knee specimens with a testing apparatus that applied a 2-bodyweight impulsive load, inducing knee compression, flexion moment, and internal tibial torque. The range of internal femoral rotation was (1) locked at ~0°, (2) limited with a hard stop to ~7°, (3) limited with a hard stop to ~11°, or (4) free, with rotation resisted by 2 springs to simulate the resistance of the active hip rotator muscles to stretch. The AM-ACL strain was quantified with a differential variable reluctance transducer. A linear mixed model was used to determine whether a significant linear relation existed between peak AM-ACL relative strain and range of internal femoral rotation.
RESULTS: Peak AM-ACL relative strain was inversely related to the available range of internal femoral rotation (R (2) = 0.91; P < .001), with strain increasing 1.3% for every 10° decrease in rotation; this represented a 20% increase in peak relative strain, given an average range of femoral rotation of 15° upon landing in healthy athletes.
CONCLUSION: Peak AM-ACL relative strain was inversely proportional to the available range of internal femoral rotation during simulated single-leg pivot landings.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Decreased range of internal femoral rotation results in greater ACL strain and may therefore increase the susceptibility to ACL rupture with athletic cutting and pivoting activities. Screening for a limited range of hip internal rotation should therefore become a component of not only ACL injury prevention programs but also evaluation protocols for those with ACL injuries and/or reconstructions."
25245325,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25245325/,"BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic splenectomy remains a technically demanding procedure. On patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), a post operative acute chest syndrome (ACS) can occur. The aim of the study was to look for predictive factors of post operative ACS.
PATIENTS AND METHOD: It's a retrospective study on patients with SCD, who underwent a laparoscopic splenectomy in Robert Debré hospital, Paris, France, between March 2008 and December 2013. Diagnosis of ACS was done if the patient developed hypoxemia associated with fever above 38.5 °C and an infiltrate on chest x ray during the post operative course. Pre-, post- and operative factors were studied. Descriptive statistics were compared using the Mann-Whitney test or the exact Fisher test. A p inferior to 0.05 was considered as significant.
RESULTS: 52 patients with SCD underwent a laparoscopic splenectomy. Twelve patients presented a post operative ACS (23%) (mean age at surgery 4 years old) while forty did not (mean age 5.25 years old). Neither previous episode of ACS nor any factors reflecting SCD severity were significant. The shorter the operative time was, the greater the risk of developing an ACS (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: ACS is an important complication following laparoscopic splenectomy in patients with SCD. The immediate post operative management, in the absence of predictive factors for ACS, should be carefully followed in a high dependency unit at least for 48 h for all patients."
25245476,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25245476/,"BACKGROUND: Many medical schools state that empathy is important and have curricular learning outcomes covering its teaching. It is thought to be useful in team-working, good bedside manner, patient perspective taking, and improved patient care. Given this, one might expect it to be measured in assessment processes. Despite this, there is relatively little literature exploring how measures of empathy in final clinical examinations in medical school map onto other examination scores. Little is known about simulated patient (actors) rating of empathy in examinations in terms of inter-rater reliability compared with clinical assessors or correlation with overall examination results.
METHODS: Examiners in final year clinical assessments in one UK medical school rated 133 students on five constructs in Objective Structured Long Examination Record (OSLER) with real patients: gathering information, physical examination, problem solving, managing the diagnosis, and relationship with the patient. Scores were based on a standardized well-established penalty point system. In separate Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) stations, different examiners used the same penalty point system to score performance in both interactional and procedural stations. In the four interaction-based OSCE stations, examiners and simulated patient actors also independently rated empathy of the students.
RESULTS: The OSLER score, based on penalty points, had a correlation of -0.38 with independent ratings of empathy from the interactional OSCE stations. The intra-class correlation (a measure of inter-rater reliability) between the observing clinical tutor and ratings from simulated patients was 0.645 with very similar means. There was a significant difference between the empathy scores of the 94 students passing the first part of the sequential examination, based on combined OSCE and OSLER scores (which did not include the empathy scores), and 39 students with sufficient penalty points to trigger attendance for the second part (Cohen's d = 0.81).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that empathy ratings are related to clinical performance as measured by independent examiners. Simulated patient actors are able to give clinically meaningful assessment scores. This gives preliminary evidence that such empathy ratings could be useful for formative learning, and bolsters the call for more research to test whether they are robust enough to be used summatively."
25245503,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25245503/,"BACKGROUND: Salusins are recently identified endogenous bioactive peptides that have hypotensive and bradycardiac effects. Salusin-β is involved in the pathogenesis of human atherosclerosis.
METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study of a young patient population with hypertension (HTN). Based on ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), the adolescents were categorized into two groups, namely, a hypertensive group consisting of patients with essential (primary) HTN (HTN group) and a group consisting of patients with white-coat HTN [reference (R) group]. Correlations between serum salusin-β level and clinical, laboratory and ambulatory blood pressure (BP) variables were assessed.
RESULTS: The median salusin-β concentration was significantly higher in patients with essential HTN than in those with white-coat HTN (R group). Salusin-β was positively correlated with the body mass index Z-score, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) from three independent measurements, mean systolic BP during the daytime, triglyceride (TG) level, and atherogenic index (TG/high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol ratio).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this preliminary study suggest that salusin-β may play an important role in the pathogenesis of HTN in a young population. Further research should focus on the role of salusin-β in the mechanism of essential HTN and the assessment of possible correlations between salusin-β and other well-known markers of atherosclerosis in both teenagers and adults. This research should serve as a base for future studies in this field."
25245520,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25245520/,"INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to ascertain whether the University of Texas, Southwestern (UTSW) open skills curriculum (Goova et al.(13)) could be successfully implemented in the University of Minnesota (UMN) multisite training program. We posed 4 questions: (1) Is the curriculum feasible? (2) Did residents' skills improve? (3) Did UMN residents achieve the same level as UTSW residents? (4) What factors were associated with posttest success?
METHODS: Postgraduate year-1 residents (n = 22) were enrolled in the curriculum, which included orientation, access to video instruction, 3 months of independent practice using portable kits and practice logbooks, presurveys and postsurveys, and pretesting and posttesting. Evaluation was based on UTSW proficiency measures (time, errors, and total proficiency score). Descriptive statistics, paired sample t tests, analysis of variance, and bivariate correlations were calculated. Results were compared with Goova.
RESULTS: Startup costs at UMN were $9804 vs $776 at UTSW. Our curriculum required 51 direct faculty hours vs 376 at UTSW. UMN trainees' skills improved significantly (mean score = 973 [standard deviation = 267] at baseline vs 1325 [standard deviation = 215] at posttest), but they achieved proficiency in only 38.6% of tasks at posttest, compared with 88.7% by UTSW trainees. Best predictors of UMN posttest proficiency score were (1) categorical vs preliminary resident status (p < 0.001), (2) pretest proficiency score (r = 0.510, p = 0.008), and (3) self-assessed baseline proficiency (r = 0.415, p = 0.027). Participation in skills laboratories during clerkship or fourth year medical school, estimated number of cases (surgeon or first assistant), and number of practice repetitions recorded in booklets were not predictive of the posttest score.
CONCLUSIONS: The UTSW open skills curriculum is feasible and effective in a new setting. Differences from UTSW-published success rates may be related to their superior onsite monitoring of practice and a policy requiring residents to achieve proficiency for each task before posttesting."
25245530,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25245530/,"BACKGROUND: Surgeons perform THA to address a variety of conditions in younger patients, including osteoarthritis (OA), osteonecrosis, inflammatory arthritis, and congenital deformities. Younger patients aged 50 years or younger have been characterized as active in the literature, but a direct relationship between age and activity level has not been well substantiated. Younger patients with OA may engage in higher activity levels; however, associated medical conditions in patients with other surgical indications may not support a generalization that age is a surrogate for activity level. We recently evaluated these issues in younger patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and noted that the majority would not be considered active. Given this observation, we considered whether younger patients undergoing THA are characterized by high activity levels, which is relevant to understanding the long-term risk of wear-related failures.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Do demographic features of younger patients undergoing THA support high activity expectations? (2) Do preoperative or postoperative functional activity measures support projections that younger patients are active after THA?
METHODS: We retrospectively compared demographic characteristics and functional activity profiles (as determined by preoperative and postoperative UCLA activity scores, Harris hip scores [HHS], and SF-12 and WOMAC physical function subscores) of 704 patients who had undergone THA and were aged younger than 50 years (822 hips) with those of 484 patients (516 hips) aged between 65 and 75 years, who had undergone THA, with a minimum followup at 1 year after surgery (range, 12-160 months).
RESULTS: Compared with patients aged 65 to 75 years, younger patients undergoing THA were more often men (51%, 95% confidence interval [CI], 48.8%-53.2% versus 40%, 95% CI, 37.1%-42.9% women; p < 0.01) or had undergone surgery for osteonecrosis (29% versus 4%; 95% CI, 2.8%-5.2%; p < 0.001). Postoperative HHS, SF-12, and WOMAC scores were not appreciably different between the two patient groups. Compared with older patients, younger patients with OA had higher preoperative (5.0 ± 2.5 versus 3.9 ± 2.0, p < 0.001) and postoperative UCLA activity scores (6.8 ± 2.1 versus 5.3 ± 1.9, p < 0.001). Younger patients with diagnoses other than OA had slightly higher mean postoperative UCLA activity scores than older patients (6.0 ± 2.3 versus 5.3 ± 1.9; p < 0.001). Two hundred fifty-nine of 704 younger patients undergoing THA (37%; 95% CI, 34.9%-39.1%) returned to impact activity compared with 75 of 484 older patients undergoing THA (15.5%; 95% CI, 13.3%-17.7%) (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Younger patients with OA are likely to return to high levels of activity after surgery, which may impact long-term wear-related implant survivorship. High activity levels are less common among younger patients with diagnoses other than OA. Age is not the ideal surrogate for activity level in patients considering THA; instead, specific activity-level measures should be used when discussing patient expectations pertaining to postoperative activity levels after arthroplasty.

25245557,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25245557/,"PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate the pattern of lymph node metastasis and treatment outcome after intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), and assess the possibility of replacing Ho's supraclavicular fossa (SCF) with the lower level (LL; cervical extension below caudal edge of cricoid cartilage) based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a criterion for N3 disease.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: We retrospectively reviewed 749 patients with biopsy-proven non-metastatic NPC treated with IMRT. Lymph node metastasis was mapped using the 2013 International Consensus Guidelines.
RESULTS: Cervical lymph node (CLN) laterality, CLN greatest dimension (>60 vs. ⩽60 mm) and Ho's SCF were independent prognostic factors for disease-free survival (DFS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS; P<0.01) in multivariate analysis. Replacing Ho's SCF with the LL was also predictive for DFS and DMFS (P<0.01). Compared to the 7th UICC/AJCC, N-categories based on the LL provided more satisfactory distinction between hazard ratios for distant and disease failure for each N-category. N3a and N3b as defined by the 7th UICC/AJCC had similar DMFS (P=0.31) and DFS (P=0.21).
CONCLUSIONS: Replacing Ho's SCF with the LL is simple and practical. The N-category staging system could be further simplified by merging N3 subcategories."
25245577,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25245577/,"OBJECTIVES: Because of its reduced invasiveness, MitraClip (Abbott Vascular, Menlo Park, CA) therapy usually is reserved for patients with extreme left ventricular dysfunction or severe comorbidity contraindicating surgery. The appropriate post-procedural care in this high-risk population is yet to be defined. In this study, the postoperative course of such patients is reported, focusing on early complications and need for intensive care unit (ICU) management.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective analysis of patients with severe mitral regurgitation undergoing transcatheter mitral valve repair with the MitraClip system in the authors institution was performed.
INTERVENTIONS: One hundred thirty patients underwent MitraClip implantation between 2008 and 2012. At the end of the procedure, all patients were admitted to the ICU.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Median ICU stay was 0.98 (0.82-1.87) days. Median mechanical ventilation time was 9.5 (6.8-14.1) hours. One hundred one patients (78%) required inotropic support and 13 patients (10%) suffered cardiogenic shock and required intra-aortic balloon pump support. No patient died during the procedure, but 3 patients died in the ICU. Three postoperative course profiles were identified: Fast-track, overnight stay, and critical illness. Twenty-four patients (18.5%) had an uneventful postoperative course, 89 patients (68.5%) suffered minor complications, and 17 patients (13.1%) required intensive care management and organ support. Preoperative serum creatinine (odds ratio [OR] 1.8; p = 0.014), cardiogenic shock (OR 34,8; p = 0.002), ventricular tachycardia (OR 2.8; p = 0.03), and intra procedural inotropes (OR 4; p = 0.001) were correlated with a complicated postoperative course.
CONCLUSIONS: A large number of patients undergoing MitraClip could be managed with a fast-track ICU course; however, it still is difficult to predict the postoperative course based on preoperative characteristics."
25245665,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25245665/,"INTRODUCTION: April 1st 2012 saw the introduction of National Trauma Networks in England. The aim to optimise the management of major trauma. Patients with an ISS≥16 would be transferred to the regional Major Trauma Centre (level 1). Our premise was that trauma units (level 2) would no longer manage complex foot and ankle injuries thereby obviating the need for a foot and ankle specialist service.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis of the epidemiology of foot and ankle injuries, using the Gloucestershire trauma database, from a trauma unit with a population of 750,000. Rates of open fractures, complex foot and ankle injuries and requirement for stabilisation with external fixation were reviewed before and after the introduction of the regional Trauma Network. Secondly, using the Trauma Audit & Research Network (TARN) database, all foot and ankle injuries triaged to the regional Major Trauma Centre (MTC) were reviewed.
RESULTS: Incidence of open foot and ankle injuries was 2.9 per 100,000 per year. There were 5.1% open injuries before the network and 3.2% after (p>0.05). Frequency of complex foot and ankle injuries was 4.2% before and 7.5% after the network commenced, showing no significant change. There was no statistically significant change in the numbers of patients with complex foot and ankle injuries treated by application of external fixators. Analysis of TARN data revealed that only 18% of patients with foot and ankle injuries taken to the MTC had an ISS≥16. The majority of these patients were identified as requiring plastic surgical intervention for open fractures (69%) or were polytrauma patients (43%). Only 4.5% of patients had isolated, closed foot and ankle injuries.
CONCLUSION: We found that at the trauma unit there was no decrease in the numbers of complex foot and ankle injuries, open fractures, or the applications of external fixators, following the introduction of the Trauma Network. These patients will continue to attend trauma units as they usually have an ISS<16. Our findings suggest that there is still a need for foot and ankle specialists at trauma units, in order to manage patients with complex foot and ankle injuries."
25246281,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25246281/,"OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study was to analyze an association between selected factors and pancreatic cancer, assuming that knowing the etiology would help influence the incidence of this severe type of cancer through primary prevention. In addition to age, gender, BMI and education, the analysis aimed at assessing occupational and leisure-time physical activities with respect to pancreatic cancer.
BACKGROUND: In numerous studies, physical activity is reported to be a protective factor against pancreatic cancer.
METHODS: A case-control study was carried out in three centers in the Czech Republic in 2006-2009.
RESULTS: The study comprised a total of 529 individuals, of which 309 were patients with pancreatic cancer and 220 were controls. Leisure-time physical activity showed a statistically significant inverse association with a crude odds ratio of 0.65 (95% CI 0.45-0.93), even after adjustment for other studied factors (OR =0.63, 95% CI 0.43-0.92). Conversely, for occupational physical activity, a positive association was only suggested.
CONCLUSIONS: Leisure-time physical activity is a protective factor against the development of pancreatic cancer. Occupational physical activity was not confirmed as a protective factor against pancreatic cancer (Tab. 4, Fig. 1, Ref. 22)."
25246337,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25246337/,"AIM: To compare the diagnostic efficacy of the maximal, minimal, and mean pulsatility index (PI) and resistance index (RI) and determine which should be utilized in the evaluation of thyroid nodules.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 224 consecutive patients with thyroid nodules were included in this prospective study. Doppler signals from three different nodular arteries were obtained and six Doppler parameters were used for final analysis: maximal PI (PImax), minimal PI (PImin), mean PI (PImean), maximal RI (RImax), minimal RI (RImin), and mean RI (RImean).
RESULTS: Eighty-five patients had malignant and 139 cases had benign thyroid nodules. All three sets of PI and RI parameters were significantly higher in malignant than in benign thyroid nodules (p = 0.000 for all). The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (Az) of PImax was significantly higher than that of PImin (p = 0.046) and higher than that of PImean (p = 0.161). The Az value of RImax was higher than that of RImean and RImin; however, the differences were not significant (p = 0.403, and p = 0.058, respectively). The Az values of the three sets of PI parameters (PImax, PImin, and PImean) were significantly higher than those of the corresponding sets of RI parameters (p = 0.005, p = 0.003, and p = 0.003, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Maximal pulsed Doppler parameters should be utilized in the evaluation of thyroid nodules. PI parameters were superior to the RI parameters in determining malignant nodules."

METHODS: Six high-volume Italian Thoracic Surgery Institutions collaborated with their own retrospective anonymized datasets. Demographic, clinical, pathological and treatment data were examined. A WHO histological classification (WHO-HC) collapsed scheme (A/AB and B1/B2 types merged) was proposed and compared with the traditional one. Predictors of survival were assessed using a Cox model with shared frailty. Competing-risk regression models were performed to identify the association between individual factors and freedom from recurrence.
RESULTS: Between 1990 and 2011, 750 thymomas were operated on in participating centres. Myasthenia gravis was observed in 363 (48%) patients. A complete resection was achieved in 676 (91%) cases. One hundred and nine patients (15%) had a WHO-HC A type, 166 (22%) AB, 179 (24%) B1, 158 (21%) B2 and 135 (18%) B3. The rate of 5-year OS and cumulative incidence of recurrence for all cases was 91% and 0.11, respectively. Five-year survival rates by WHO-HC in the collapsed scheme were A/AB 93%, early-B 90% and advanced-B 85%. Masaoka stage only was demonstrated to be an independent predictor for survival and recurrence. The WHO-collapsed scheme showed a trend in influencing recurrence overall survival development (hazard ratio: 1.32; P = 0.16).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show evidence of lack of significance by WHO-HC in influencing prognosis, even though the proposed collapsed scheme revealed a fair stratification of risk to relapses and better correlation with patients' clinical characteristics."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eligibility criteria for participants were as follows: children at age 10-13 years with either maxillary unilateral or bilateral PDC, persisting deciduous canine and no previous experience of orthodontic treatment. Sixty-seven patients (40 girls and 27 boys; age: mean ± standard deviation: 11.4±1.0) with unilateral (45) or bilateral (22) PDCs were consecutively recruited and randomly allocated using permuted block randomization method to extraction or non-extraction. No patients dropped out after the randomization or during the study. Patients underwent a clinical examination and cone beam computed tomography at baseline (T0), after 6 (T1) and 12 months (T2). The total observation time was 24 months. Outcome measures were eruption, positional changes, length of time until eruption, and root resorption of adjacent teeth. The baseline images were measured blinded while the 6- and 12-month control images were not, since it was not possible to blind the extracted canine.
RESULTS: Significantly more spontaneous eruptions of the PDCs were seen in the extraction group (EG) than in the control group (CG), with rates of 69 and 39 per cent, respectively, with a mean eruption time of 15.6±5.6 months in the EG and 18.8±5.8 months in the CG. Significant differences in changes between the groups, in favour of the EG, were found for all variables except for the sagittal angle. In the EG, the changes in the distances of the canine cusp-tip were larger during the first 6 months, while the change of apex was larger between 6 and 12 months. There were no significant differences in resorption of adjacent teeth between the groups.
LIMITATIONS: Imputation values were used for the PDCs who had erupted at T2, since no x-rays were taken for ethical reasons, which might have given uncertainty in the positional changes between T1 and T2.
CONCLUSIONS: Extraction of the deciduous canine is an effective treatment in patients with PDCs. Significantly more positional changes and shorter mean eruption time were seen in the EG. Resorptions of lateral incisors were seen in both groups, but none exceeded grade 2 (resorption up to half of the dentine thickness to the pulp).

In an era of obesity, excessive interest in his appearance and lean silhouette assigning too much significance relates to a growing number of young women. Young women due to a period of their procreative years are particularly vulnerable to the consequences of abnormal eating habits that threaten the health of women and their offspring.
OBJECTIVES: In young women of reproductive age, to determine the emotional and habitual reasons behind binge eating and the effect that restriction diets can have for achieving desired body mass in relation to physical activity and the willingness to improve their weight.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Subjects surveyed were 372 women aged 18 to 27 years (mean 20.6 ± 1.4) who answered a questionnaire on dietary behaviour devised by Ogińska-Bulik and Putyński [21] which had been extended to include body mass perception/image, adoption of slimming diets, levels of physical activity and place of residence. The women's actual body mass, height and body fat (adipose tissue content) were also measured.
RESULTS: Most subjects (63.9%) were dissatisfied with their figures whilst 33.5% underwent slimming diets at least once. Those overweight, complained much more about their figures compared to normal weight women (97.9% vs. 65.1%, p<0.01), as well as being respectively more emotionally prone to overeating (4.5 ± 2.2 vs. 5.2 ± 2 points round, p<0.01), but less for adopting any dietary restriction (3.5 ± 2.7 vs. 4.8 ± 2.3, p<0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: It seems necessary to create a prevention and educational programs on proper nutrition and the perception of one's own body as effective tools in reducing eating disorders in terms of the health of young women and multigenerational inheritance health of their offspring."
25247853,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25247853/,"BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with increased risk of postoperative complications. The authors investigated whether preoperative diagnosis and prescription of continuous positive airway pressure therapy reduces these risks.
METHODS: Matched cohort analysis of polysomnography data and Manitoban health administrative data (1987 to 2008). Postoperative outcomes in adult OSA patients up to 5 yr before (undiagnosed OSA, n = 1,571), and any time after (diagnosed OSA, n = 2,640) polysomnography and prescription of continuous positive airway pressure therapy for a new diagnosis of OSA, were compared with controls at low risk of having sleep apnea (n = 16,277). Controls were matched by exact procedure, indication, and approximate date of surgery. Procedures used to treat sleep apnea were excluded. Follow-up was at least 7 postoperative days. Results were reported as odds ratio (95% CI) for OSA or subgroup versus controls.
RESULTS: In multivariate analyses, the risk of respiratory complications (2.08 [1.35 to 3.19], P < 0.001) was similarly increased for both undiagnosed and diagnosed OSA. The risk of cardiovascular complications, primarily cardiac arrest and shock, was significantly different (P = 0.009) between undiagnosed OSA (2.20 [1.16 to 4.17], P = 0.02) and diagnosed OSA patients (0.75 [0.43 to 1.28], P = 0.29). For both outcomes, OSA severity, type of surgery, age, and other comorbidities were also important risk modifiers.
CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis of OSA and prescription of continuous positive airway pressure therapy were associated with a reduction in postoperative cardiovascular complications. Despite limitations in the data, these results could be used to justify and inform large efficacy trials of perioperative continuous positive airway pressure therapy in OSA patients."
25247921,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25247921/,"CONTEXT: Prior research has faulted the US News and World Report hospital specialty rankings for excessive reliance on reputation, a subjective measure of a hospital's performance.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether and to what extent reputation correlates with objective measures of research productivity among cancer hospitals.
DESIGN: A retrospective observational study.
SETTING: Automated search of NIH Reporter, BioEntrez, BioMedline and Clinicaltrials.gov databases.
PARTICIPANTS: The 50 highest ranked cancer hospitals in 2013's US News and World Report Rankings.
EXPOSURE: We ascertained the number of NCI funded grants, and the cumulative funds received by each cancer center. Additionally, we identified the number of phase I, phase II, and phase III studies published and indexed in MEDLINE, and registered at clinicaltrials.gov. All counts were over the preceding 5 years. For published articles, we summed the impact factor of the journals in which they appeared. Trials were attributed to centers on the basis of the affiliation of the lead author or study principal investigator.
MAIN OUTCOME: Correlation coefficients from simple and multiple linear regressions for measures of research productivity and a center's reputation.
RESULTS: All measures of research productivity demonstrated robust correlation with reputation (mean r-squared  = 0.65, median r-squared = 0.68, minimum r-squared = .41, maximum r-squared = 0.80). A multivariable model showed that 93% of the variation in reputation is explained by objective measures.
CONCLUSION: Contrary to prior criticism, the majority of reputation, used in US News and World Rankings, can be explained by objective measures of research productivity among cancer hospitals."
25247947,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25247947/,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS) during open partial nephrectomy alters the surgical management for renal cell cancer (RCC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred ninety-eight consecutive patients undergoing IOUS during open partial nephrectomy for RCC were selected for retrospective review of clinical and imaging data. Patient age and sex, the local extent of the primary lesion, and the presence of additional lesions were recorded. Ultrasound findings were compared with preoperative CT or MRI to determine whether the IOUS findings changed surgical management. Summary statistics were performed to assess what percentage of patients with additional IOUS findings had a change in their surgical management. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate 5-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) rates for all patients. Patients were followed for 9-12 years to assess survival and measure recurrence rates.
RESULTS: Twenty-one of 198 patients (10.6%; 95% CI, 6.7-15.8%) had additional findings on IOUS not seen on preoperative imaging. As a result, surgery was modified in 15 of these 21 patients (71.4%; 95% CI, 47.8-88.7%). The 5-year OS rate was 81%, and the EFS rate was 76% for the whole group; most deaths were due to unrelated causes. There was no statistically significant difference in OS (p = 0.867) and EFS (p = 0.069) rates among patients who had a change of management because of additional lesions seen by IOUS.
CONCLUSION: IOUS performed during open partial nephrectomy for resection of RCC shows additional findings compared with preoperative cross-sectional imaging that may alter surgical management."

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Forty-five patients (25 men, 20 women; mean age, 65.6 ± 9.7 [SD] years; mean body weight, 74.9 ± 12.4 kg) underwent contrast-enhanced single-phase dual-energy CT of the abdomen by a random assignment to one of three different contrast medium (iomeprol 400) dose injection protocols: 1.3, 1.0, or 0.65 mL/kg of body weight. The contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and noise at the portal vein, liver, aorta, and kidney were compared among the different datasets using the ANOVA. Three readers qualitatively assessed all datasets in a blinded and independent fashion.
RESULTS: Nonlinear blended images at a 25% reduced dose allowed a significant improvement in CNR (p < 0.05 for all comparisons), compared with simulated 120-kVp linear blended images at a full dose. No statistically significant difference existed in CNR and noise between the nonlinear blended images at a 50% reduced dose and the simulated 120-kVp linear blended images at a full dose. Nonlinear blended images at a 50% reduced dose were considered in all cases to have acceptable image quality.
CONCLUSION: The dual-energy nonlinear image blending technique allows reducing the dose of contrast medium up to 50% during portal venous phase imaging of the abdomen while preserving image quality."
25247961,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25247961/,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to establish the upgrade rate of atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) diagnosed by stereotactic vacuum-assisted core needle biopsy for calcifications detected by digital mammography as compared with film-screen mammography.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective record search identified 101 cases of ADH. Criteria included women with calcifications biopsied using stereotactic vacuum-assisted core needle biopsy at our institution between January 2001 and December 2011. The center transitioned from film-screen mammography in 2001 to all digital mammography by 2010. Stereotactic vacuum-assisted core needle biopsies were performed using 11-gauge (59/101 [58%]) or 8-gauge (42/101 [42%]) needles. All pathology was interpreted by breast pathologists using standard criteria.
RESULTS: Of 101 cases of ADH, 57 (56.4%) were detected using digital and 44 (43.6%) were detected using film-screen mammography. Seven of 57 (12.3%) cases of ADH detected by digital mammography were upgraded to ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) (n = 6) or invasive cancer (n = 1). Six of 44 (13.6%) cases of ADH detected by film-screen mammography were upgraded to DCIS (n = 5) or invasive cancer (n = 1) (p = 0.84). There was a trend toward low-grade DCIS in cases detected by digital mammography (3/7 [42.9%]) as compared with film-screen mammography (1/6 [16.7%]) (p = 0.68). A nonsignificant overall higher percentage of upgrades occurred when calcifications were not completely removed (10/52 [19.2%]) as compared with completely removed (3/47 [6.4%]). There was no difference in upgrade rate of stereotactic vacuum-assisted core needle biopsy performed using 11-gauge (7/59 [11.9%]) versus 8-gauge (6/42 [14.3%]) needles.
CONCLUSION: The upgrade rate of ADH diagnosed by stereotactic vacuum-assisted core needle biopsy was not significantly different between digital and film-screen mammography. The current recommendation for excision of ADH diagnosed by stereotactic vacuum-assisted core needle biopsy should be applied to ADH detected by digital mammography."
25248060,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25248060/,"BACKGROUND: Current direction in trauma resuscitation includes emphasis on minimizing crystalloid, along with early transfusion of blood products. Although evidence suggests that higher crystalloid volume during the first 24 hours is associated with negative outcomes, the effect of crystalloid administration during initial resuscitation remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of the ratio of crystalloid to packed red blood cells (C/PRBCs) infused during initial emergency department resuscitation on pulmonary morbidity and mortality.
METHODS: Over 6.5 years at a Level 1 trauma center, prospective data were collected on patients that received more than 1 PRBC unit in the resuscitation room. C/PRBC was defined as the ratio of crystalloid infused in liters to the units of PRBCs transfused in the resuscitation room. Patients were stratified by high ratio (>0.75) versus low ratio (<0.75). Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were determined for the association between C/PRBC group and outcomes, namely, adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), 24-hour mortality, and in-hospital mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 383 patients met study criteria: 192 (50%) in the high-ratio and 191 (50%) in the low-ratio group. Variables associated with in-hospital mortality were Injury Severity Score (ISS) (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.03-1.07), admission base excess (OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.90-0.98), and time in the resuscitation room (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00-1.03). Variables associated with 24-hour mortality were ISS (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.02-1.06) and base excess (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.91-1.00). Only ISS (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02-1.07) was associated with ARDS. ARDS (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 0.75-2.73), 24-hour mortality (OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.49-1.63), and in-hospital mortality (OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.52-1.53) were not associated with C/PRBC.
CONCLUSION: In this cohort of patients receiving PRBC in the resuscitation room, factors related primarily to injury severity were associated with pulmonary morbidity and mortality, but C/PRBC was not. Pertaining to initial resuscitation, the purported benefit of crystalloid limitation was not observed.

25249141,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25249141/,"BACKGROUND: Open esophagectomy (OE) in elderly patients with esophageal cancer is hazardous due to high surgical mortality and limited survival. The aim of this study was to explore whether minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) has perioperative or long-term benefits in elderly patients with esophageal cancer compared with OE.
METHODS: Between February 2005 and June 2013, 407 patients older than 70 years underwent esophagectomy for esophageal cancer, including 89 who received MIE and 318 who received OE. A retrospective pair-matched study was performed to compare 116 patients (58 pairs) who underwent either OE or MIE. Patients were matched by age, sex, comorbidity, tumor location, histology, TNM stage, and operative approach. Perioperative and long-term outcomes were compared between the two groups.
RESULTS: The overall incidence of postoperative complications was significantly lower in the MIE group than in the OE group (37.9 vs. 60.3 %, P = 0.016), especially incidence of pulmonary complications (20.7 vs. 39.7 %, P = 0.026). The mean length of hospital stay was also significantly shorter (10 days [range 7-70] vs. 12 days [range 8-106], P = 0.032). The perioperative mortality rate trended lower in the MIE group but was not significantly different (3.4 vs. 8.6 %, P = 0.435). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the median disease-specific survival time in the MIE group was significantly longer than in the OE group (>27 months [range 1-82] vs. 24 months [range 1-99], P = 0.003). No difference was found in overall survival (39 ± 8.9 vs. 22 ± 3.4 months, P = 0.070).
CONCLUSION: In surgical management of elderly patients with esophageal cancer, MIE is associated with lower rates of morbidity and pulmonary complications as well as longer disease-specific survival time. Whether it provides benefit to patients' long-term survival requires further research."
25249148,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25249148/,"BACKGROUND: Three variants of Achalasia have been described using high-resolution esophageal manometry (HRM). While manometrically distinct, their clinical significance has yet to be established. Our objective was to compare the outcome after myotomy in patients with these Achalasia subtypes.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed to identify patients with Achalasia who had HRM and who underwent Heller myotomy or Per oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM). Symptoms and esophageal clearance by timed barium study were compared before and after treatment.
RESULTS: We identified 49 patients, 21 males and 28 females, with a median age of 52 years. The primary symptom in all patients was dysphagia, with a median duration of 4 years (range 4 months-50 years). By HRM, ten patients (20 %) were classified as Type I, 30 (61 %) as Type II, and 9 (18 %) as Type III. At a median follow-up of 16 months after myotomy (range 1-63 months), the median Eckardt score was zero and was similar across subtypes. Relief of dysphagia was also similar across subtypes (80 % of Type I, 93 % of Type II and 89 % of Type III). On pre-treatment timed barium study, no patient had complete emptying at 1 or 5 min. After myotomy, complete emptying occurred within 1 min in 50 % (20/40) and within 5 min in 60 % (24/40) and was similar across groups.
CONCLUSION: Myotomy for Achalasia results in excellent symptomatic outcome and improvement in esophageal clearance. There was no difference among the described HRM Achalasia variants. This calls into question the clinical utility of Achalasia sub-classification and affirms the benefit of myotomy for this disease."
25249338,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25249338/,"OBJECTIVES: In an attempt to begin ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treatment more quickly (referred to as door-to-balloon [DTB] time) by minimizing preventable delays in electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation, cardiac catheterization laboratory (CCL) activation was changed from activation by the emergency physician (code heart I) to activation by a single page if the ECG is interpreted as STEMI by the ECG machine (ECG machine auto-interpretation) (code heart II). We sought to determine the impact of ECG machine auto-interpretation on CCL activation.
METHODS: The study period was from June 2010 to May 2012 (from June to November 2011, code heart I; from December 2011 to May 2012, code heart II). All patients aged 18 years or older who were diagnosed with STEMI were evaluated for enrollment. Patients who experienced the code heart system were also included. Door-to-balloon time before and after code heart system were compared with a retrospective chart review. In addition, to determine the appropriateness of the activation, we compared coronary angiography performance rate and percentage of STEMI between code heart I and II.
RESULTS: After the code heart system, the mean DTB time was significantly decreased (before, 96.51 ± 65.60 minutes; after, 65.40 ± 26.40 minutes; P = .043). The STEMI diagnosis and the coronary angiography performance rates were significantly lower in the code heart II group than in the code heart I group without difference in DTB time.
CONCLUSION: Cardiac catheterization laboratory activation by ECG machine auto-interpretation does not reduce DTB time and often unnecessarily activates the code heart system compared with emergency physician-initiated activation. This system therefore decreases the appropriateness of CCL activation."
25249403,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25249403/,"PURPOSE: Interview methods to assess stages of change (SOC) in eating disorders (ED) indicate that SOC are positively correlated with symptom improvement over time. However, interviews require significant time and staff training and global measures of SOC do not capture varying levels of motivation across ED symptoms. This study used a self-report, ED symptom-specific SOC measure to determine prevalence of stages across symptoms and identify if SOC predict treatment outcome.
METHODS: Participants [N = 182; age 13-58 years; 92% Caucasian; 96% female; average BMI 21.7 (SD = 5.9); 50% ED not otherwise specified (EDNOS), 30.8% bulimia nervosa (BN), 19.2% anorexia nervosa (AN)] seeking ED treatment at a diverse-milieu multi-disciplinary facility in the United States completed stages of change, behavioral (ED symptom use and frequency) and psychological (ED concerns, anxiety, depression) measures at intake assessment and at 3, 6 and 12 months thereafter. Descriptive summaries were generated using ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis (continuous) and χ (2) (categorical) tests. Repeated measures linear regression models with autoregressive correlation structure predicted treatment outcome.
RESULTS: At intake assessment, 53.3% of AN, 34.0% of BN and 18.1% of EDNOS patients were in Preparation/Action. Readiness to change specific symptoms was highest for binge-eating (57.8%) and vomiting (56.5%). Frequency of fasting and restricting behaviors, and scores on all eating disorder and psychological measures improved over time regardless of SOC at intake assessment. Symptom-specific SOC did not predict reductions in ED symptom frequency. Overall SOC predicted neither improvement in Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) scores nor reduction in depression or trait anxiety; however, higher overall SOC predicted lower state anxiety across follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Readiness to change ED behaviors varies considerably. Most patients reduced eating disorder behaviors and increased psychological functioning regardless of stages of change, indicating the benefits of treatment and effectiveness of treatment-as-usual for overall psychiatric improvement."
25250402,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25250402/,"BACKGROUND: Maternal psychopathology robustly predicts poor developmental and treatment outcomes for children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Despite the high heritability of ADHD, few studies have examined associations between paternal ADHD symptoms and child adjustment, and none have also considered degree of paternal involvement in childrearing. Identification of modifiable risk factors for child conduct problems is particularly important in this population given the serious adverse outcomes resulting from this comorbidity.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study examined the extent to which paternal involvement in childrearing moderated the association between paternal ADHD symptoms and child conduct problems among 37 children with ADHD and their biological fathers.
RESULTS: Neither paternal ADHD symptoms nor involvement was independently associated with child conduct problems. However, the interaction between paternal ADHD symptoms and involvement was significant, such that paternal ADHD symptoms were positively associated with child conduct problems only when fathers were highly involved in childrearing.
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of adult ADHD symptoms may determine whether father involvement in childrearing has a positive or detrimental influence on comorbid child conduct problems."
25250813,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25250813/,"BACKGROUND: Experience curve effects were first observed in the industrial arena as demonstrations of the relationship between experience and efficiency. These relationships were largely determined by improvements in management efficiency and quality of care. In the health care industry, volume-outcome relationships have been established with respect to quality of care improvement, but little is known about the effects of experience on management efficiency. Here, we examine the relationship between experience and hospital management in Japanese hospitals.
METHODS: The study sample comprised individuals who had undergone surgery for unruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms and had been discharged from participant hospitals between April 1, 2006 and December 31, 2008. We analyzed the association between case volume (both at the hospital and surgeon level) and postoperative complications using multilevel logistic regression analysis. Multilevel log-linear regression analyses were performed to investigate the associations between case volume and length of stay (LOS) before and after surgery.
RESULTS: We analyzed 909 patients and 849 patients using the hospital-level and surgeon-level analytical models, respectively. The odds ratio of postoperative complication occurrence for an increase of one surgery annually was 0.981 (P < 0.001) at the hospital level and 0.982 (P < 0.001) at the surgeon level. The log-linear regression analyses showed that shorter postoperative LOS was significantly associated with high hospital-level case volume (coefficient for an increase of one surgery: -0.006, P = 0.009) and surgeon-level case volume (coefficient for an increase of one surgery: -0.011, P = 0.022). Although an increase of one surgery annually at the hospital level was statistically associated with a reduction of preoperative LOS by 1.1% (P = 0.006), there was no significant association detected between surgeon-level case volume and preoperative LOS (P = 0.504).
CONCLUSION: Experience at the hospital level may contribute to the improvement of hospital management efficiency."

DESIGN: Of 760 patients admitted consecutively to the authors' rehabilitation hospital because of a fall-related hip fracture, 700 were retrospectively investigated. Functional outcome was assessed using Barthel Index scores.
RESULTS: In 49 of the 700 patients, a single fall resulted in both a hip fracture and a fracture of either wrist (n = 34) or proximal humerus (n = 15). The patients with concomitant shoulder fractures had lower median Barthel Index scores after rehabilitation (70 vs. 90, P = 0.003), lower median Barthel Index effectiveness (57.1 vs. 76.9, P = 0.018), and prolonged median length of stay (42 vs. 36 days, P = 0.011) than did the patients with isolated hip fractures. Significant differences persisted after adjustment for six potential confounders. The adjusted odds ratio for achieving a Barthel Index score lower than 85 was 6.71 (95% confidence interval, 1.68-26.81; P = 0.007) for the patients with concomitant shoulder fractures. Conversely, no prognostic disadvantages were associated with concomitant wrist fractures.
CONCLUSIONS: Data show a worse functional recovery and a prolonged length of stay in the subgroup of hip fracture patients who sustained a concomitant fracture at the proximal humerus, but not at the wrist."
25251541,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25251541/,"BACKGROUND: The aim was to determine whether latitudinal (Queensland versus Tasmania) variation in reported disease frequency in Australia may be biased by differences in population.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted from data of two large Australian twin studies (n = 1,835) having undertaken ophthalmic examination, namely, Twins Eye Study in Tasmania (TEST) and the Brisbane Adolescent Twins Study (BATS). Ordinal logistic regression was used to compute odds ratios and predicted probabilities for each category of eye colour by state.
RESULTS: Tasmanian residence was associated with lower odds of darker iris colour (odds ratio 0.77, 95% CI [0.63-0.95]) signifying that participants living in Tasmania (TAS) are less likely to have darker-coloured irides than those residing in Queensland (QLD). For individuals living in Tasmania the predicted probability (TAS versus QLD) of having light blue eyes was greater (16.7 versus 13.3 per cent), approximately the same for green eyes and less for brown/dark brown-coloured eyes (6.2 versus 7.9 per cent).
CONCLUSIONS: We found a general trend of individuals living in the southern states (TAS/VIC) of Australia having lighter-coloured irides compared to those living in the north (QLD). This finding has potential implications for all epidemiological research conducted to explore differences in UV-associated disease frequency in Australia, as population heterogeneity may confound the estimates obtained."
25251641,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25251641/,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To determine the relationship between body mass index along with other anthropomorphic variables as they relate to tracheal airway dimensions.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series.
METHODS: This was a radiographic study of 123 consecutive hospitalized patients undergoing tracheotomy over a 4-year period (2007-2011). We measured airway dimensions in axial computed tomography imaging and made comparisons with height, weight, body mass index, gender, and age. Measurements were taken at the first tracheal ring level including anterior-posterior length, width, and calculated area. We expected higher body mass index not to be a good predictor of larger airway dimensions.
RESULTS: The linear regression model showed body mass index was significantly inversely related to tracheal width after controlling for gender and age (P = .0389). For every 1 kg/m(2) increase in body mass index, the tracheal width decreased by 0.05 mm. There was a trend for airway area to diminish with increasing body mass index.
CONCLUSIONS: These results are consistent with the hypothesis that obese patients do not have larger airways. Our study indicated a trend toward smaller airways as body mass index increased. Specifically, as body mass index increases, tracheal width appears to decrease. This information should help medical professionals avoid the tendency to use a larger tube to secure the airway of an obese patient. Hopefully, this will result in further research into the field and may prevent future airway injuries in a society where obesity has become epidemic.

25251863,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25251863/,"BACKGROUND: As the potentiality of deceased organ donation mostly depends on the number of brain deaths (BDs), the aim of this study is to quantify rates and probabilities of BD declaration in Italy.
METHODS: Deaths with acute cerebral lesion (ACLDs) in the Italian ICUs have been prospectively collected. A total of 27,490 ACDLs occurred in 5 years. Age, gender, etiology, timing of death and ICU Region have been utilized for multivariate analysis.
RESULTS: The global ratio of BD declarations to ACLDs was 39.9%. The rates of ACLDs, BD declarations and actual donors were 93.5, 37.3 and 19.7 pmp respectively. Wide variability resulted among Regions, with 148.2 ACLDs, 77.8 BD declarations and 42 donors pmp as benchmark. The probability of being BD declared was significantly higher in stroke compared with head injury (OR 1.6, P<0.001) and in females (OR 1.5, P<0.001), with half the Regions missing around 50% of BD declarations compared with the benchmark, particularly in elderly patients.
CONCLUSION: Predictable factors associated with BD declaration can be identified in ACLD management. Positive factors leading to the identification of potential organ donors, i.e., the capacity of declaring BD in all the patients fulfilling BD criteria irrespective of age and etiology, could be captured in the best performing regions and reproduced throughout the Country. The implementation of simple indicators based on prospective ACLD monitoring, i.e. the declared BDs to ACLDs in ICU ratio, may be helpful in achieving efficiency targets and reliable comparisons of outcomes in the identification of BD potential organ donors."
25251938,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25251938/,"BACKGROUND: Early-starting child conduct problems (CP) are linked to the development of persistent antisocial behavior. Researchers have theorized multiple pathways to CP and that CP comprise separable domains, marked by callous-unemotional (CU) behavior, oppositional behavior, or ADHD symptoms. However, a lack of empirical evidence exists from studies that have examined whether there are unique correlates of these domains.
METHODS: We examined differential correlates of CU, oppositional, and ADHD behaviors during the preschool years to test their potentially distinct nomological networks. Multimethod data, including parent and teacher reports and observations of child behavior, were drawn from a prospective, longitudinal study of children assessed at age 3 and age 6 (N = 240; 48% female).
RESULTS: Dimensions of CU, oppositional, and ADHD behaviors were separable within Confirmatory Factor Analyses across mother and father reports. There were differential associations between CU, oppositional, and ADHD behaviors and socioemotional, cognitive, and behavioral outcomes: CU behavior was uniquely related to lower moral regulation, guilt, and empathy. ADHD was uniquely related to lower attentional focusing and observed effortful control. Finally, CU behavior uniquely predicted increases in teacher-reported externalizing from ages 3-6 over and above covariates, and ADHD and oppositional behavior.
CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with theory, dimensions of CU, ADHD, and oppositional behavior demonstrated separable nomological networks representing separable facets within early-starting CP."
25251958,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25251958/,"OBJECTIVE: To prospectively evaluate self-reported pain levels associated with diagnostic cystoscopy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who underwent diagnostic cystoscopy and subsequently graded their pain level during the procedure were enrolled. Pain was graded on a Likert visual analog scale (VAS) of 1-10 where 0 = no pain and 10 = excruciating unbearable pain. Local lidocaine gel 2% was used as intraurethral lubricant.
RESULTS: Data from 1320 consecutive cystoscopies (929 males, 391 females, age range 15-93 years) between 6/2009-1/2010 were analyzed. This was the first cystoscopy for 814 patients. The overall mean VAS was 2.74 ± 1.51 (range 0-9) for rigid cystoscopy and 2.48 ± 1.53 (range 0-10) for flexible cystoscopy (P = 0.004). The reported mean pain level for first-time cystoscopy was significantly higher than that for repeat cystoscopy (2.8 ± 1.6 vs. 2.2 ± 1.4, P < 0.001), regardless of gender or type of cystoscope. Men reported significantly higher pain levels than women 2.6 ± 1.5 vs. 2.4 ± 1.4 (P < 0.04). The highest mean pain level was reported by men (3.4 ± 1.6) and women (2.5 ± 1.6) for rigid cystoscopy compared to flexible cystoscopy (2.5 ± 1.4 and 1.1 ± 1.9, respectively, P < 0.001). Pain levels > 5 were reported in 75 (5.7%) cystoscopies.
CONCLUSIONS: Cystoscopy was not associated with distressing levels of pain. Pain levels during first cystoscopies were higher than those for repeated ones. Using a flexible cystoscope is associated with a lower pain level in both men and women and it should be used for both genders."
25252097,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25252097/,"AIM: To evaluate whether aspirin can reduce the risk of colorectal cancer in people with diabetes.
METHODS: We studied ≥ 30-year-old people with diabetes, included in the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2005 in Taiwan, who were treated with hypoglycaemic drugs. We used a time-varying Cox regression model to adjust for immortal time bias and to estimate the adjusted hazard ratio and 95% CI for the association between aspirin use and colorectal cancer occurrence.
RESULTS: We studied a total of 60 828 people with diabetes (31 176 men and 29 652 women). Their mean (sd) age was 58.72 (13.33) years. A total of 26 494 people were taking aspirin. Aspirin use 3-5 times/week (moderate frequency) for > 5 years (long duration) was found to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer by 46% (hazard ratio 0.54, 95% CI 0.34-0.86). Aspirin use > 5 times/week (high frequency) for 4-5 years (moderate duration) and > 5 years reduced the risk of colorectal cancer by 56 and 68%, respectively (hazard ratio 0.44, 95% CI 0.24-0.80; hazard ratio 0.32, 95% CI 0.20-0.50). Low frequency (≤ 2 times/week) and/or short duration (≤ 3 years) of aspirin use did not reduce the risk of colorectal cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: Aspirin use with high frequency and long duration reduced the risk of colorectal cancer in people with diabetes in a frequency- and duration-dependent manner, whereas low frequency and/or short duration of aspirin use did not. The dosage, frequency and duration of aspirin use that are sufficient to prevent the incidence of colorectal cancer in people with diabetes require further study."
25252481,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25252481/,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between Sex Hormone Binding Globulin and preeclampsia in Iranian women considering the probable confounding effect of insulin resistance.
METHODS: The case-control study was conducted at the Semnan University of Medical Sciences, Iran, and comprised pregnant women who received prenatal care at Amiralmomenin Hospital in 2011. Cases represented patients admitted because of preeclampsia, while controls were randomly selected eligible pregnant women without hypertension and/or proteinuria. Fasting blood sugar and insulin were assessed for all participants as well as their blood concentration of Sex Hormone Binding Globulin. The Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance Score was used. The correlation between dependant and independent variables was reported by crude and adjusted odds ratio applying logistic regression models. SPSS 16.0 was used for statistical analysis.
RESULTS: Of the 100 pregnant women in the study, 45 (45%) were cases. Insulin resistance was found to be significantly more frequent in the cases compared to the controls (adjusted odds ratio = 2.78; 95% Confidence Interval: 1.11, 6.90; p < 0.01). There was a significant reverse correlation between level of Sex Hormone Binding Globulin in blood and being a case of preeclampsia (adjusted odds ratio = 0.99; 95% Confidence Interval: 0.98, 1.00; p = 0.04).
CONCLUSION: Independent of insulin resistance, every 1 nmol/l increase in Sex Hormone Binding Globulin, decreases the odds of preeclampsia by 1%, notifying Sex Hormone Binding Globulin as an important biomarker about its etiology and prediction."
25252635,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25252635/,"BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection represents a major global health problem, which in high-income countries now mostly affects people who inject drugs (PWID). Many studies show that the treatment of HCV infection is as successful among PWID as among other populations and recently PWID have been included in the international guidelines for the treatment of HCV infection. The aim of this survey was to collect data from European countries on the existence of national strategies, action plans and clinical guidelines for HCV treatment in the general population and PWID in particular.
METHODS: Thirty-three European countries were invited to participate. Data on available national strategies, action plans and guidelines for HCV treatment in general population and in PWID specifically were collected prospectively by means of a structured electronic questionnaire and analyzed accordingly.
RESULTS: All of the 33 invited European countries participated in the survey. Twenty-two responses came from non-governmental organizations, six from public health institutions, four from university institutions and one was an independent consultant. Fourteen (42.4%) of the countries reported having a national strategy and/or national action plan for HCV treatment, from which ten of them also reported having a national strategy and/or national action plan for treatment of HCV infection in PWID. Nearly three-quarters reported having national HCV treatment guidelines. PWID were included in the majority (66.7%) of the guidelines. Fourteen (42.4%) countries reported having separate guidelines for the treatment of HCV infection in PWID.
CONCLUSIONS: Given the high burden of HCV-related morbidity and mortality in PWID in Europe, the management of HCV infection should become a healthcare priority in all European countries, starting with developing or using already-existing national strategies, action plans and guidelines for this population."
25252884,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25252884/,"BACKGROUND: Preference for sons in India has resulted in a skewed sex ratio at live birth, probably as a consequence of female feticide. However, it is unclear if these cultural preferences are also currently present in communities who have emigrated from India to England and Wales.
METHODS: Data of all live births in England and Wales from 2007-2011 were obtained from the Office of National Statistics. A logistic regression analysis was used to compare the probability of having a male infant in mothers born inside the United Kingdom (UK) to those born outside the UK, stratified by mothers' region and country of birth.
RESULTS: Mothers born in India were not observed to be giving birth to disproportionately more boys than mothers that were born in the UK (Odds Ratio OR: 1.00, 95% Confidence Interval CI: 0.98-1.02), although an excess of male births were observed in mothers born in South-East Asia (OR 1.03; 95% CI: 1.01-1.05, p = 0.005), the Middle East (OR 1.02; 95% CI: 1.00-1.05, p = 0.047), and South America (1.04; 95% CI: 1.00-1.07, p = 0.025). Mothers who were born in Africa were found to be less likely to give birth to boys than girls when compared to mothers born in the UK (OR: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.97-0.99), and this observation was attributable to women born in East and West Africa.
CONCLUSION: There was no evidence of an excess of males born to women from India in England and Wales. An excess of males were observed in mothers born in South-East Asia, the Middle East and South America. Women born in Africa are less likely to give birth to boys than UK born mothers, an observation that is consistent with previous data."
25253183,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25253183/,"AIM: Although propranolol is widely used in the treatment of infantile hemangiomas, the standard 40 mg tablet needs to be fractioned to obtain 10 mg parts, with even lower doses (i.e., 2-3 mg/kg/day divided into 2-3 daily doses) required in infants. This study evaluated the weight and dose uniformity in split quarters of propranolol tablets.
METHODS: Twenty pharmacy students split 70 propranolol tablets by using a kitchen knife in order to obtain 200 quarters, which were considered integral and adequate for administration. Intact tablets and quarters were weighed. The content of propranolol in tablet quarters was determined on 200 quarters by using high performance liquid chromatography.
RESULTS: Overall, 265 parts (94.6%) were integral and 213 (76.1%) were considered as adequate for administration. The mean (± standard deviation) weight of quarters judged as suitable and non-suitable for administration was 49.56 ± 5.27 mg and 46.24 ± 7.53 mg, respectively. Splitting caused a mean weight loss in each tablet of 2.97 ± 2.91 mg (median 2.06 mg). The percentage of quarters with weight lower than theoretical was 55.88%, and the remaining weighted more than expected. The mean propranolol content in quarters was 9.52 ± 0.96 mg (median 9.42 mg, range 7.36-12.23 mg) and 42% of quarters were out of the ± 10% acceptance range.
CONCLUSION: The manual splitting of propranolol 40 mg tablets produced a significant proportion of quarters not suitable for administration in children or with a weight and/or an active concentration outside of the required range. The availability of a pediatric oral solution of propranolol will reduce the risk of incorrect dosing."
25253211,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25253211/,"BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Diagnosis of lymphatic filariasis using serum has been established but the utility of hydrocele fluid for the purpose is not exactly known. Since, hydrocele is a chronic form of the disease manifestation in a variety of situations and often poses difficulty in diagnosing its origin, we have evaluated the usefulness usage of hydrocele fluid for diagnosis of filarial origin of hydrocele in this study.
METHODS: Paired samples of serum and hydrocele fluid from 51 individuals with hydrocele, living in an endemic area of Wuchereria bancrofti were assessed. Circulating filarial antigen, filarial specific antibody and cytokine assay were performed in both serum and hydrocele fluid of patients.
RESULTS: Og4C3 assay detected circulating filarial antigen (CFA) in serum and corresponding hydrocele fluids. The level of IgG, IFN-γ and IL-10 were found to be high in CFA-negative, while IgM and IgE were high in CFApositive hydrocele fluid and serum samples associated with hydrocele. On the other hand neither CFA-positive nor CFA-negative hydrocele fluid and serum samples associated with hydrocele showed any difference in IgG4 level.
INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: This study showed that the filaria related antigens and antibodies found in serum can be detected with equal sensitivity in hydrocele fluid. Therefore, it can be used as an alternative to serum for immunodiagnosis of filariasis, and help monitoring the filarisis elimination programme."
25253299,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25253299/,"PURPOSE: To investigate volumetric changes in lumbar disc herniation (LDH) using three-dimensional measurements obtained by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and to identify possible factors affecting such changes.
METHODS: Between January 2004 and December 2011, 43 patients who underwent conservative treatment for LDH were enrolled. In all, 56 disc levels were investigated. MRI was performed on two or more occasions (minimally, at the initial visit and 6 months later). The volume of each herniated disc was determined. For each patient, disc migration, morphology, initial LDH size, and clinical outcome were evaluated.
RESULTS: The mean volumes of herniated discs at the initial and follow-up visits were 1,304.57 ± 837.99 and 993.84 ± 610.04 mm(3), respectively. The mean change in volume from the initial to the follow-up visit was 310.73 ± 743.60 mm(3). Volumes decreased at 35 disc levels and increased at 21 levels. The disc containment, the extent of LDH, the initial size of the herniated disc, and the degree of intactness of the posterior longitudinal ligament were significantly correlated with disc resorption and an increase in disc volume (p = 0.01, p = 0.018, p = 0.001, and p < 0.001, respectively). No significant association was evident between disc volumetric change and clinical outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: We observed that LDH is a dynamic disease and that a herniated disc is not always spontaneously resorbed, in contrast to what has been reported previously. Alleviation of clinical symptoms can be achieved via conservative treatment even if the volume of the herniated disc changes. Spinal surgeons should not only present an option of initial non-surgical treatment to LDH patients but should also inform them that the LDH may change in size during daily activity or exercise."
25253653,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25253653/,"PURPOSE: To describe the association between lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD), with adjustment for age and other confounders. We were specifically interested in the possible predictive value of LUTS to the incidence of CVD in the future in the general population.
METHODS: We performed post hoc analyses using data from the Krimpen study, a large community-based study in the Netherlands. All men aged 50-75 years, without prostate or bladder cancer, a history of radical prostatectomy, or neurogenic bladder disease, were invited to participate for a response rate of 50%. At baseline, 1,610 men were included. CVD status was compared to LUTS category, using logistic regression, providing odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (OR 95% CI). For the longitudinal analyses in men without CVD at baseline, hazard ratios (HR) and 95% CI were estimated using Cox proportional hazard models with the occurrence of a CVD as outcome variable.
RESULTS: At baseline, 362 men (22%) had a history of CVD. The ORs for CVD for men with moderate to severe LUTS were 2.04 (unadjusted, 95% CI 1.58-2.63), 1.86 (1.43-2.41, adjusted for age), and 1.81 (1.38-2.37, adjusted for age and other confounders). Of the 1,248 CVD-free men, 58 (4.6%) had a CVD event. HRs for moderate to severe LUTS were 0.98 (95% CI 0.52-1.86, unadjusted) and 1.08 (0.57-2.07, adjusted for age, obesity, hypertension, and erectile dysfunction).
CONCLUSIONS: The cross-sectional analyses revealed a clear correlation between moderate to severe LUTS and CVD. In longitudinal analyses, however, no significant association was shown."

PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Whole genome duplication (WGD) and specific polyploidy events marked turning points for angiosperm genome structure and evolution. Therefore, cytogenetic studies of polyploidy-prone groups such as the tropical Malvaceae and plant formations such as as the Brazilian Cerrado have gained further importance. We present new chromosome counts for Cerrado Bombacoideae and revised chromosome numbers for the Malvaceae s.l., compare these between subfamilies, and relate them to phylogenetic signal.•
METHODS: We studied the chromosome number of Eriotheca candolleana, E. gracilipes, E. pubescens, Pachira glabra, Pseudobombax longiflorum, and P. tomentosum. We also compared Eriotheca species ploidy levels using flow cytometry. We compiled chromosome numbers for 557 species of Malvaceae s.l., including 37 Bombacoideae species. We included this information in a phylogenetic reconstruction based on chloroplast matK-trnK DNA to evaluate chromosome evolution of the Malvaceae s.l. and the Bombacoideae in particular.•
KEY RESULTS: The Cerrado Bombacoideae presented consistently high chromosome numbers. Numbers for Eriotheca species were among the highest and varied among populations. Flow cytometry analyses showed similar 1Cx DNA for all cytotypes and indicated neopolyploidy. Chromosome numbers differed between subfamilies, with the lowest numbers in the Malvoideae and Byttnerioideae and the highest in Tilioideae. Chromosome numbers had significant phylogenetic signal for Bombacoideae but not for Malvoideae or Malvaceae s.l.•
CONCLUSIONS: Clearly distinct chromosome numbers allied to monophyly provide some support for a circumscription of the Bombacoideae and distinction within the Malvaceae. The phylogenetic signal for chromosome number supports the idea of an ancient WGD and further neopolyploidy events as important evolutionary trends for the Bombacoideae."

PREMISE OF THE STUDY: The characteristics of clonal growth that are advantageous in invasive plants can also result in native plants' ability to resist invasion. In Maine, we compared the clonal architecture and diversity of an invasive lineage (introduced Phragmites) and a noninvasive lineage (native Phragmites) present in much of North America. This study is the first on stand-scale diversity using a sample size and systematic spatial-sampling scheme adequate for characterizing clonal structure in Phragmites. Our questions included: (1) Does the structure and extent of clonal growth suggest that the potential for clonal growth contributes to the invasiveness of the introduced lineage? (2) Is clonal growth common in the native lineage, acting as a possible source of ecological resistance and resilience?•
METHODS: Microsatellite markers were used to measure clonal sizes, architecture, and diversity within each lineage in stands within four marshes in Maine.•
KEY RESULTS: Clonal diversity measures indicated that clonal growth was significantly greater in stands of the native lineage than in the introduced. While lineage was a consistent predictor of clonal diversity relative ranking, the marsh location was a much stronger predictor of the absolute range of these values.•
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate an important role for clonal growth in the space consolidation of native Phragmites and could explain why the introduced lineage, with stronger competitive traits, has not replaced the native where they co-occur. These results with regard to clone size, size distributions, singleton occurrence, and clonal architecture provide some evidence for stand development that follows a genotypic initial floristics model."

RESULTS: Both qualitative and quantitative analyses were carried out. Participants presented the same habituation profiles generally obtained in infancy research.
CONCLUSION: Stimulus presentation has a significant impact on the participants' visual behaviour and fixation measurement appears to be an interesting indicator as to how an individual with PIMD is able to process external information. The elaboration of perceptual tasks based on a visual habituation method is one of the major implications of these results."

OBJECTIVE: We asked whether intravenous isotonic saline and either NaHCO3 in 5% dextrose or else a high dose of NAC in 5% dextrose prevent CI-AKI in outpatients exposed to high-osmolal iodinated contrast medium more than does saline alone.
METHODS: This completed prospective, parallel, superiority, open-label, controlled, computer-randomized, single-center, Brazilian trial (NCT01612013) hydrated 500 adult outpatients (214 at high risk of developing CI-AKI) exposed to ioxitalamate during elective coronary angiography and ventriculography. From 1 hour before through 6 hours after exposure, 126 patients (group 1) received a high dose of NAC and saline, 125 (group 2) received NaHCO3 and saline, 124 (group 3) received both treatments, and 125 (group 4) received only saline.
RESULTS: Groups were similar with respect to age, gender, weight, pre-existing renal dysfunction, hypertension, medication, and baseline serum creatinine and serum cystatin C, but diabetes mellitus was significantly less prevalent in group 1. CI-AKI incidence 72 hours after exposure to contrast medium was 51.4% (257/500), measured as serum creatinine > (baseline+0.3 mg/dL) and/or serum cystatin C > (1.1 · baseline), and 7.6% (38/500), measured as both serum creatinine and serum cystatin C > (baseline+0.3 mg/dL) or > (1.25 · baseline). CI-AKI incidence measured less sensitively was similar among groups. Measured more sensitively, incidence in group 1 was significantly (p<0.05) lower than in groups 2 and 3 but not group 4; adjustment for confounding by infused volume equalized incidence in groups 1 and 3.
CONCLUSION: We found no evidence that intravenous isotonic saline and either NaHCO3 or else a high dose of NAC prevent CI-AKI in outpatients exposed to high osmolal iodinated contrast medium more than does saline alone.

25254617,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25254617/,"BACKGROUND: Depression later in life may have a more somatic presentation compared with depression earlier in life due to chronic somatic disease and increasing age. This study examines the influence of the presence of chronic somatic diseases and increasing age on symptom dimensions of late-life depression.
METHODS: Baseline data of 429 depressed and non-depressed older persons (aged 60-93 years) in the Netherlands Study of Depression in Old Age were used, including symptom dimension scores as assessed with the mood, somatic and motivation subscales of the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report (IDS-SR). Linear regression was performed to investigate the effect of chronic somatic diseases and age on the IDS-SR subscale scores.
RESULTS: In depressed older persons a higher somatic disease burden was associated with higher scores on the mood subscale (B = 2.02, p = 0.001), whereas higher age was associated with lower scores on the mood (B = -2.30, p < 0.001) and motivation (B = -1.01, p = 0.006) subscales. In depressed compared with non-depressed persons, a higher somatic disease burden showed no different association with higher scores on the somatic subscale (F(1,12) = 9.2; p = 0.003; partial η(2)=0.022).
LIMITATIONS: Because the IDS-SR subscales are specific for old age, it was not feasible to include persons aged < 60 years to investigate differences between earlier and later life.
CONCLUSIONS: It seems that neither higher somatic disease burden nor higher age contributes to more severe somatic symptoms in late-life depression. In older old persons aged ≥ 70 years, late-life depression may not be adequately recognized because they may show less mood and motivational symptoms compared with younger old persons."
25255032,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25255032/,"INTRODUCTION: There is still no consensus on the ideal material to be used in craniofacial defects. Autogenous bone grafts are mostly preferred owing to their use with fewer complications. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the scapular bone graft can be used with equal or more advantages to other bone graft resources in orbital, maxillary sinus front wall, and frontal bone defects.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-four orbital, maxillary sinus front wall, and frontal bone defects were reconstructed with scapular bone grafts. Sixteen patients presented with complicated orbital fractures, 5 patients presented with isolated orbital floor fractures, and 3 patients presented with frontal bone fractures. The grafts were radiologically evaluated 1 day, 6 months, and 12 months postoperatively by 3-dimensional computed tomography scan.
RESULTS: All orbital, maxillary sinus front wall, and frontal bone defects were reconstructed successfully with scapular bone grafts. Clinical evaluation of the patients at 6 to 24 months of follow-up was considered satisfactory. Minimal donor site morbidity was observed. Scapular bone grafts adapted nicely to the recipient area, and bony union was complete as demonstrated by 3-dimensional computed tomography scans.
CONCLUSIONS: Reconstruction of orbital, maxillary sinus front wall, and frontal bone defects with scapular bone grafts is an easy and safe procedure with minimal donor site morbidity. Scapular bone graft is a good reconstructive option for orbital, maxillary sinus front wall, and frontal bone defects."

This study mainly investigates the impact of lifestyle, residential environment, cognitive efficiency and social desirability in predicting self-assessed depressive signs in late adult span.
METHOD: One hundred forty-nine elders were recruited in Northern Italy and Sardinia - an Italian island characterized by the longevity of people living in the inner areas. Participants were presented a battery of questionnaires assessing cognitive efficiency and self-referent measures of depression, metacognition and social desirability.
RESULTS: A hierarchical regression analysis showed that residential environment was the most effective predictor of depressive symptoms, along with gardening and spending time for hobbies. In contrast, social desirability and metacognitive scores played a minor role in predicting mental health. An analysis of variance showed that Sardinian elders showed fewer signs of depression than age-matched elders residing in Northern Italy.
CONCLUSION: The Sardinian residential environment is a strong predictor of preserved mental health in late adulthood. In contrast, self-rated metacognitive efficiency and social desirability play a very marginal role in predicting depression among the elderly."

The previously validated questionnaire contained questions on neurosurgeon, patient, and practice characteristics; perceptions of the liability environment; and defensive-medicine behaviors. Bivariate and multivariate analyses examined the state liability risk environment as a predictor of a neurosurgeon's likelihood of practicing defensive medicine.
RESULTS: A total of 1026 neurosurgeons completed the survey (31% response rate). Neurosurgeons' perceptions of their state's liability environment generally corresponded well to more objective measures of state-level liability risk because 83% of respondents correctly identified that they were practicing in a high-risk environment. When controlling for surgeon experience, income, high-risk patient load, liability history, and type of patient insurance, neurosurgeons were 50% more likely to practice defensive medicine in high-risk states compared with low-risk-risk states (odds ratio: 1.5, P<.05).
CONCLUSION: Both avoidance and assurance behaviors are prevalent among US neurosurgeons and are correlated with subjective and objective measures of state-level liability risk. Defensive medicine practices do not align with patient-centered care and may contribute to increased inefficiency in an already taxed health care system."
25255414,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25255414/,"BACKGROUND: Teaching resident physicians to appropriately document patient diagnoses in the medical record is critical to ensure accuracy of publicly reported data and to enable quality improvement initiatives. We sought to determine if providing real-time feedback to resident or attending physicians would lead to improved medical documentation.
METHODS: We audited charts to determine if target diagnoses were present and documented. After a baseline data-gathering period, during the intervention period the first author randomly provided feedback to either residents alone or residents plus their attending physicians. Capture rates for targeted diagnoses, total diagnoses documented and coded, severity of illness (SOI), risk of mortality (ROM), and case mix index were compared pre- and postintervention.
RESULTS: During the intervention, the proportion of target diagnoses captured increased from 30% to 54% (P < 0.001), as did the median (interquartile [IQ] range) number of diagnoses captured (from 11 [IQ range, 8-13] to 12 [IQ range, 9-16], P < 0.05). We also achieved significant increases in median (IQ range) SOI scores (from 2 [IQ range, 2-3] to 3 [IQ range, 2-3], P = 0.04) and complication code capture (61% vs 75%, P = 0.01). However, there was no significant increase in ROM, case mix index, or hospital billing. Notifying attending physicians in addition to residents was of no benefit.
CONCLUSIONS: An educational program based on real-time feedback to resident physicians regarding documentation improved diagnostic capture and SOI scores, but not case mix index or billing at our public, safety net, teaching hospital. Even with enhanced education of resident physicians regarding documentation, other interventions are needed to further improve diagnostic capture."
25255707,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25255707/,"BACKGROUND: Wolfram syndrome (WS) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by diabetes mellitus (DM), optic atrophy (OA), central diabetes insipidus (CDI) and deafness (D). The phenotype of the disease has been associated with several mutations in the WFS1 gene, a nuclear gene localized on chromosome 4. Since the discovery of the association between WFS1 gene and Wolfram syndrome, more than 150 mutations have been identified in WS patients. We previously described the first case of perinatal onset of Wolfram syndrome newborn carrying a segmental uniparental heterodysomy affecting the short arm of chromosome 4 responsible for a significant reduction in wolframin expression. Here we review and discuss the pathophysiological mechanisms that we believe responsible for the perinatal onset of Wolfram syndrome as these data strongly suggest a role for WFS1 gene in foetal and neonatal neurodevelopment.
CASE PRESENTATION: We described a male patient of 30 weeks' gestation with intrauterine growth restriction and poly-hydramnios. During the first days of life, the patient showed a 19% weight loss associated with polyuria and hypernatremia. The presence of persistent hypernatremia (serum sodium 150 mEq/L), high plasma osmolarity (322 mOsm/L) and low urine osmolarity (190 mOsm/l) with a Uosm/Posm ratio < 1 were consistent with CDI. The diagnosis of CDI was confirmed by the desmopressin test and the brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 34 weeks of age, that showed the lack of posterior pituitary hyperintense signal. In addition, a bilateral asymmetrical optic nerve hypoplasia associated with right orbital bone hypoplasia was observed, suggesting the diagnosis of WF. During the five years follow-up the patient did not developed glucose intolerance or diabetes mellitus. By the end of the second year of life, primary non-autoimmune central hypothyroidism and mild neurodevelopment retardation were diagnosed.
CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of our case, in the light of the most recent literature, suggests a possible role for WFS1 gene in the development of certain brain structures during the fetal period. Wolfram syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis of the rare cases of congenital central diabetes insipidus developed in the neonatal period."
25255742,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25255742/,"OBJECTIVE: To test whether people with shortened dental arches (SDA) have impaired oral health-related quality of life than those with more natural teeth.
METHOD: We analysed data from the 2004-2006 Australian National Survey of Adult Oral Health (including telephone interview, oral epidemiological examinations and mailed questionnaire). Participants aged ≥ 15 years and with intact anterior teeth were eligible in this study. We used multivariable negative binomial regression analyses to test the association of SDA, according to two alternative definition (1. having intact teeth and 3-5 natural occlusal units; 2. having intact anterior teeth and four natural occlusal units), with OHIP-14 severity and extent, adjusting for potential confounders, including demographic variables (age and sex), socioeconomic variables (income and education), behaviour characteristics (time since last visit, reason for the last dental visit, difficult in paying $100 dental bill and dental insurance possession), and dental outcomes (coronal and root caries, and periodontal disease).
RESULT: We analysed on 2,750 dentate participants that were eligible for the study. When SDA was classified as intact anterior teeth, four occlusal units and no dental prosthesis, no statistical difference in OHIP-14 severity or extent was identified compared with those with intact anterior teeth, over four occlusal units and no dental prosthesis. Participants who presented intact anterior teeth, 3-5 occlusal units and no prosthesis showed 50% higher rates of OHIP-14 severity than those with intact anterior teeth, over five occlusal units and no prosthesis while their OHIP-14 extent was similar to that of the reference group.
CONCLUSION: SDA is not associated with negative impacts on quality of life, according to both OHIP-14 severity and extent, when SDA is defined as four occlusal units and no dental prosthesis. When SDA is defined as 3-5 occlusal units and no dental prosthesis, it is only associated with OHIP-14 severity, but not OHIP-14 extent."
25255844,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25255844/,"INTRODUCTION: Implicit memory tasks differ along two orthogonal dimensions, tapping the relative involvement of perceptual/conceptual and identification/production processes. Previous studies have documented a dissociation between perceptual (spared) and conceptual (impaired) implicit memory, using in the latter case a production task (category exemplar generation), in which there is high response competition during the retrieval phase. The present study sought to determine whether the perceptual/conceptual dissociation held when comparing two identification tasks, in which there is no response competition at retrieval.
METHODS: In two experiments, repetition priming was assessed in 44 schizophrenic patients and 46 healthy controls in lexical decision (a test based on perceptual identification processes) and category verification (a test based on conceptual identification processes).
RESULTS: Schizophrenic patients achieved a priming as high as that of controls in the lexical decision task. In contrast, only controls exhibited significant priming in the category verification task.
CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that schizophrenia is associated with a specific deficit in conceptual implicit memory, irrespective of the degree of response competition in the test phase."
25255984,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25255984/,"BACKGROUND: The clinical course of peritoneal and parietal recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC-PPL) is not well known.
METHODS: Twenty-eight patients with a histologically proven HCC-PPL were analyzed out of a series of 515 patients operated for HCC (group 1). The risk factors, histological features, growing dynamic and results of surgical treatment were analyzed and compared with patients having other extrahepatic localizations of HCC (group 2; 26 patients). Survival data were also compared with patients with intrahepatic-only recurrence (group 3; 211 patients).
RESULTS: In group 1, a needle tract injury was present in 57.1% and a previous spontaneous rupture in 14.3% of cases. Parietal seeding was generally single, while peritoneal seeding was frequently multiple. Grading was poor in 84.7%, microvascular infiltration was observed in 57.1% and a rapid growth in 55.5% of cases. In Group 2, only 4 out of 26 patients underwent surgery. Survival was significantly better in group 3 than in group 1, and in group 1 than in group 2.
CONCLUSIONS: Extrahepatic HCC recurrence is related to an aggressive biology of the cancer; many characteristics of high malignancy are usually present in these cases. After radical surgery for HCC-PPL, an acceptable survival may be obtained."
25256130,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25256130/,"BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) for large malignant tumors can be technically challenging. Data on this topic are scarce, and many question its feasibility, safety, and oncologic efficiency. This study aimed to assess outcomes of LLR for large (≥ 5 cm) and giant (≥ 10 cm) malignant liver tumors.
METHODS: A prospectively collected database of 422 LLRs was reviewed from August 2003 to August 2013. The data for 52 patients undergoing LLR for large malignant tumors were analyzed. A subgroup analysis of giant tumors also is reported.
RESULTS: During the period studied, 52 LLRs were performed (males, 53.8 %; mean age, 64.6 years) for large malignant tumors. Colorectal liver metastasis was the most common indication (42.3 %). The 52 LLRs included 32 major (61.5 %) and 20 minor (38.5 %) LLRs for tumors with a mean diameter of 83 mm. The median operative time was 240 min [interquartile range (IQR), 150-330 min], and the blood loss was 500 ml (IQR, 200-1,373 ml). Eight conversions (15.4 %) were performed. Six patients experienced complications (11.5 %). Among the 44 patients with successful LLRs, two patients (4.5 %) had an R1 resection. The median hospital stay was 5 days (range, 1-21 days), and no mortality occurred during a 90-day period. A subgroup analysis of patients with giant tumors showed greater blood loss (p = 0.002) and a longer operative time (p = 0.052) but no difference in terms of conversions (p = 0.64) or complications (p = 0.32).
CONCLUSION: The findings showed that LLR is feasible and safe for large malignant tumors and can be performed with acceptable morbidity and oncologic efficiency. When used for giant malignant tumors, LLR is associated with greater blood loss and a longer operative time but no increase in complications."
25256437,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25256437/,"BACKGROUND: There are limited numbers of PET studies of solid pseudopapillary tumors (SPT) of the pancreas.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 37 patients who underwent resection of pancreatic SPT and had been preoperatively evaluated by (18)F-FDG PET or PET/CT scan. Immunohistochemical analysis of glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1) and hexokinase II (HK-II) was performed.
RESULTS: SPT could be categorized into five types according to the morphologic characteristics observed in PET images. Type I (hot FDG uptake in the entire tumor portion) was the most frequent (13, 34.2%), followed by type IV (focal uptake, 12, 31.6%), II (focal defect, 8, 21.1%), III (multiple and geographic uptake, 3, 7.9%), and V (total defective type, 1, 2.6%). The SUVmax in the solid portion of the SPT was 5.3 ± 4.1. The clinical pattern of FDG uptake in SPT was not associated with histopathologic features suggesting malignant potential. The SUVmax of SPT followed a pattern according to pattern of FDG uptake (R(2) = 0.203, p = 0.055), and was significantly associated with adjusted tumor volume (p = 0.001). GLUT-1 was not expressed in SPT, and only eight patients (12.3%) showed mild to moderate expression of HK-II, which was associated with the clinical pattern of SPT in PET images (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: SPT of the pancreas could be categorized according to the morphologic patterns observed in PET images. The clinical significance of FDG uptake, glucose metabolism, and clinical usefulness of PET scan in SPT need to be further investigated, and thus this tumor remains a surgical enigma."
25256879,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25256879/,"OBJECTIVE: Menstrual problems are common among adolescent females. Mood changes are related to menstrual problems (menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, and abnormal menstrual cycle length). The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between depressive symptoms, anxiety, and premenstrual syndrome (PMS) with dysmenorrhea in adolescent girls.
METHODS: A total of 159 adolescent girls (aged 13-19 y) with regular menstrual cycles presenting to the gynecology clinic with any complaints were included in the study during April-May 2013. All of the participants filled up the sociodemographic data collection form, FACES Pain Rating Scale, Beck anxiety inventory (BAI), Beck depression inventory (BDI), and a questionnaire form on criteria for PMS. Mann-Whitney U and chi-square tests were used to analyze the data.
RESULTS: The prevalence of dysmenorrhea was 67.9%. The mean BAI and BDI scores of the patients were 13.64 ± 12.81 and 11.88 ± 10.83, respectively. Statistically significant differences were observed between patients and control groups on the BAI and BDI scoring (P < .05). At least 1 of the symptoms of the PMS was detected in all of the participants and 29 (18.2%) of them were diagnosed as premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). The mean BAI score of the patients with PMS and PMDD were 9.65 ± 9.28 and 21.31 ± 15.75, respectively. The mean BDI score of the patients with PMS and PMDD were 8.39 ± 8.62 and 19.1 ± 11.85, respectively. Statistically significant differences were observed between PMS/PMDD and BAI/BDI scoring (P = .00).
CONCLUSION: Adolescent girls with dysmenorrhea have an increased risk of depression and anxiety. These results of our study are significant in emphasizing the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to primary dysmenorrhea follow-up and treatment."
25257121,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25257121/,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: This study aims to identify the effects of type D personality on symptom control and quality of life and to explore factors influencing quality of life among asthma patients in Korea.
BACKGROUND: Psychological factors such as depression and stress are well known to be related to medical outcomes and quality of life in asthma patients. People with type D personality are vulnerable to stress, show poor prognosis in disease and experience low quality of life.
DESIGN: A descriptive cross-sectional design was used.
METHODS: A total of 144 patients with asthma participated in this study. Data were collected through face-to-face interviews using structured questionnaires: the Type D Personality Scale-14, Asthma Control Test and Asthma-Specific Quality of Life.
RESULTS: About 33% of participants were classified into the type D personality group. The type D personality group showed statistically significantly lower symptom control and asthma-specific quality of life compared to the non-type D personality group. Based on forward stepwise multiple regression, the most significant factor of quality of life was symptom control, followed by type D personality, hospitalisation within the previous one year, and lifetime hospitalisation experiences.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of type D personality in asthma patients was high, and type D personality was significantly associated with poor symptom control and low quality of life. Psychosocial interventions might be beneficial to improve symptom control and quality of life in asthma patients with type D personality.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurses should be aware of the high prevalence of type D personality and the effects on symptom control and quality of life in asthma patients. Nurses should also provide personality-specific interventions to improve quality of life in such patients."
25257199,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25257199/,"INTRODUCTION: The incident user design is the preferred study design in comparative effectiveness (CER) research. Usually, 180-365 days of exposure free time is adequate to remove biases associated with inclusion of prevalent users. In HIV research, the use of antiretrovirals (ARVs) at any time in the past may influence future treatment choices and CER results; thus, identifying naive as opposed to incident users is of importance. We examined misclassification of antiretroviral naive status based on Medicaid administrative data through linkage to the UNC CFAR HIV Clinical Cohort (UCHCC).
METHODS: We identified Medicaid patients with incident exposure to common first-line ARV regimens between 2002 and 2008 that were also patients enrolled in the UCHCC. We calculated the proportion of antiretroviral naive patients based on the UCHCC, among patients identified as having incident exposure in Medicaid and examined factors associated with being antiretroviral naive in both data sources using logistic regression to generate prevalence odds ratios and associated 95% confidence intervals.
RESULTS: Of the 3500 Medicaid patients with incident antiretroviral (ARV) exposure, 1344 were also enrolled in the UCHCC. In this sample, 34% were antiretroviral naive at the time of first exposure in the Medicaid data based on the UCHCC. In multivariable models, higher CD4 cell counts and log HIV RNA values were associated with being antiretroviral naive in both data sources.
CONCLUSIONS: Administrative data are an important source of information related to HIV treatment. As the construction of a durable and long-lasting HIV treatment plan involves knowledge of current and past antiretroviral therapy, augmentation of this data with comprehensive clinical cohort information is necessary."
25257755,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25257755/,"INTRODUCTION: Spinal neuroarthropathy (SNA), also called ""Charcot spine"", is very uncommon disease of unknown etiology. Kronig first reported this pathology in 1884 on a patient with Tabes dorsalis (also known as syphilitic myelopathy). As syphilis tends to disappear in developed countries, spinal cord lesion is the most frequent etiology of SNA.
OBJECTIVES: To describe clinical and radiographic results in 12 patients suffering from spinal neuroarthropathy (SNA).
METHODS: Twelve patients diagnosed with SNA were included in the study. All patients were wheelchair users. The average delay between the neurological disease and the diagnosis of SNA was 18 years. All patients were initially treated conservatively. Surgery was only indicated in persistent symptomatic or instable cases, and for infected SNA. Surgery was a circumferential arthrodesis.
RESULTS: From 12 patients, with a median follow-up of 4 years, five patients were operated on and 7 patients were still conservatively treated. Two patients with back pain and evolutive destruction were declined for surgery. One suffered of bilateral hip ankylosis and extensive spinal surgery would have confined him to bed, and one due to an evolutive bedsore. One patient improved with a complete regression of back pain.
CONCLUSION: Nowadays, surgical treatment is recommended with an extensive and circumferential fusion, in order to prevent relapses. Good radiographic outcome is reported but functional results have not been studied. Natural evolution of SNA remains unknown but can be less disabling than surgery. This pathologic mobility can contribute to patient's autonomy and can therefore be considered as opportune. Conservative therapy can be considered for SNA.

25257779,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25257779/,"BACKGROUND: The ideal position of the unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) in the axial plane remains undefined the medical literature. The aim of this study was to observe how tibial components are placed in the axial plane and identify whether this could influence the postoperative clinical outcome.
METHODS: A retrospective transversal study of 101 UKA was performed in 88 patients by a single surgeon. Postoperative CT scans were performed at a mean follow-up period of 71 months (36 to 150), and clinical and functional outcomes were assessed by the WOMAC and the KSS scores. Patients were divided several times in two groups depending on a different WOMAC or KSS value each time, and differences in axial angulation were analyzed in every comparison. Distribution of data and influence on outcomes were also analyzed.
RESULTS: The tibial component was positioned with a mean angulation of 11.9° (-1 to 32) of external rotation (ER). A lower angle of ER was observed in all comparisons in the groups with better outcomes. Differences between groups were statistically significant when a good result was defined as a WOMAC score lower than 10.
CONCLUSIONS: Variability in axial positioning (33°) is higher than in other planes due to the free-hand technique. A trend towards better outcomes is observed when the tibial component is placed in a lower angle of ER. Rotational alignment in UKA should be investigated in subsequent studies with larger sample sizes.

25257807,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25257807/,"OBJECTIVE: Current recommendations advocate treatment with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in all patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We analyzed short-term disease outcome in patients according to the consistency of DMARD use in a clinical rheumatology cohort.
METHODS: Patients in an RA registry (n = 617) were studied for DMARD use at semi-annual study time points during the first 18 months of follow-up and were divided into 4 groups according to the number of study time points with any DMARD use [0-1 study time points (n = 31), 2 study time points (n = 24), 3 study time points (n = 77), and 4 study time points (n = 485)]. The primary outcome analyses were performed at 24 months and included Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28-CRP), modified Health Assessment Questionnaire (MHAQ) change, Short Form Health Survey-12 physical and mental summary scores (SF-12 PCS, SF-12 MCS), EuroQol 5-Dimensional health index (EQ-5D), and radiographic progression. Unadjusted, adjusted, and analyses stratified for seropositivity and disease activity were performed. A secondary analysis investigated 36-month outcomes.
RESULTS: No significant 24-month outcome differences could be found between the DMARD use categories. For seropositive patients, there was evidence of a linear trend for SF-12 PCS (p = 0.02) and EQ-5D (p = 0.01) with worse outcomes for inconsistent DMARD users. At 36 months, there was a linear trend for higher DAS28-CRP scores for inconsistent users (p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we found poor correlation between inconsistent DMARD use and short-term disease outcome. However, outcome in the longer term could be negatively influenced by inconsistent DMARD use, as well as short-term outcome in seropositive patients."
25257856,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25257856/,"PURPOSE: To provide a complete evaluation of the long-term impact of full-field digital mammography (FFDM) on the improvement of early diagnosis in a population-based screening program.
METHODS: We included 82,961 screen-film mammograms (SFM) and 79,031 FFDM from women aged 50-69 screened biennially from 1995-2010 in Spain and followed-up to 2012. The first screening round of the program was excluded. Rates of cancer detection, interval cancer, tumoral characteristics and other quality indicators were compared between SFM and FFDM periods using the Chi-square test. Multivariate logistic regression models were fitted.
RESULTS: Detection of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) significantly increased with FFDM (0.05 % vs 0.09 %; p = 0.010), along with the proportion of small invasive cancers (<20 mm) (69.37 % vs 78.90 %; p = 0.040). The false-positive rate decreased with FFDM (4.79 % vs 3.38 %; p < 0.001) without differences in the cancer detection rate (0.42 % vs 0.43 %; p = 0.685) or in the interval cancer rate (0.14 % vs 0.14 %; p = 0.816). Adjusted models showed a significant increase in the detection of DCIS in the FFDM periods.
CONCLUSION: Digitalization has supposed an improvement in early diagnosis because DCIS and small invasive cancers increased without a change in detection rate. Moreover, false-positive reduction without an increase in the interval cancer rate was confirmed."

METHODS: A reporting template for the collection of data about drug shortages was designed based on a literature search. Countries offering a reporting system for drug shortages such as Belgium, the Netherlands, England, Italy, France, Germany and Spain were included in this study. Data about the characteristics of the drugs in shortage and the causes of the shortage were collected from publicly available online reporting systems. Descriptive analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Drug shortages included in the considered reporting systems can be characterized as branded, oral drugs that affect different disease domains. When considering essential medicines and oncology drugs, generic injectables are more involved. Causes for drug shortages are largely underreported. In case the cause is known, production problems take the lead.
CONCLUSIONS: Reporting of drug shortages in Europe needs to be standardized and more transparency about the reasons for drug shortage is required to investigate the problem. A link between production problems and market attractiveness and market capacity is recognized to be at the root of drug shortages in U.S. Such insights are highly lacking in Europe. Monitoring of the effect of national and European health policies on the sustainability of the drug market is required to present fundamental solutions and to tackle the problem of drug shortages in Europe."
25257921,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25257921/,"INTRODUCTION: The association of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is rare. It is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Information about risk factors and clinical outcomes is scant.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective case-control study was performed in a referral center in Mexico City between 1994 and 2013. Patients were diagnosed with TTP if they fulfilled the following criteria: microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, high LDH levels, normal fibrinogen and negative Coombs' test. Patients with SLE were diagnosed with ≥ 4 ACR criteria. We included three study groups: group A included patients with SLE-associated TTP (TTP/SLE; cases n = 22, TTP events n = 24); patients with non-autoimmune TTP (NA-TTP; cases n = 19, TTP events n = 22) were included in group B and patients with SLE without TTP (n = 48) in group C.
RESULTS: After multivariate analysis, lymphopenia < 1000/mm3 [OR 19.84, p = 0.037], high SLEDAI score three months prior to hospitalisation [OR 1.54, p = 0.028], Hg <7g/dL [OR 6.81, p = 0.026], low levels of indirect bilirubin [OR 0.51, p = 0.007], and less severe thrombocytopenia [OR 0.98, p = 0.009] were associated with TTP in SLE patients. Patients with TTP/SLE received increased cumulative steroid dose vs. NA-TTP (p = 0.006) and a higher number of immunosuppressive drugs (p = 0.015). Patients with TTP/SLE had higher survival than NA-TTP (p=0.033); however, patients hospitalised for TTP/SLE had a higher risk of death than lupus patients hospitalised for other causes
CONCLUSIONS: Lymphopenia is an independent risk factor for TTP/SLE. It is likely that patients with TTP/SLE present with less evident clinical features, so the level of suspicion must be higher to avoid delay in treatment."
25257978,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25257978/,"INTRODUCTION: Social support has been linked to quitting smoking, but the mechanisms by which social support affects cessation are poorly understood. The current study tested a stress-buffering model of social support, which posits that social support protects or ""buffers"" individuals from stress related to quitting smoking. We hypothesized that social support would be negatively associated with risk of relapse, and that this effect would be mediated by reduced withdrawal and depressive symptoms (i.e., cessation-related stress) over time. Further, we predicted that trait neuroticism would moderate this mediational effect, such that individuals high in negative affectivity would show the greatest stress-buffering effects of social support.
METHODS: Participants were weight-concerned women (n = 349) ages 18-65 enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled smoking cessation trial of bupropion and cognitive behavioral therapy. Social support was assessed at baseline, and biochemically-verified abstinence, withdrawal-related symptoms, and depressive symptoms were assessed at 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-months follow-up.
RESULTS: Social support was negatively related to risk of relapse in survival models and negatively related to withdrawal symptoms and depression in mixed effects models. These relationships held after controlling for the effects of pre-quit day negative affect and depression symptoms, assignment to treatment condition, and number of cigarettes smoked per day. A temporal mediation model showed that the effect of social support on risk of relapse was mediated by reductions in withdrawal symptoms over time but not by depression over time. Contrary to hypotheses, we did not find that neuroticism moderated this mediation effect.
CONCLUSIONS: Increased social support may buffer women from the harmful effects of cessation-related withdrawal symptoms, which in turn improve cessation outcomes."
25258016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25258016/,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The direct bridging concept in acute stroke treatment combines intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) and endovascular treatment (EVT). The frequency and extent of reperfusion obtained already due to IVT were evaluated. Additionally undesired events and the clinical outcome were analysed.
METHODS: Fifty-seven acute stroke patients treated with direct bridging were analysed for this study. The response to IVT was evaluated according to the modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction scale (m-TICI). IVT responders (m-TICI ≥2B in digital subtraction angiography) were compared with IVT non-responders (m-TICI <2B in digital subtraction angiography) with respect to clinical outcome and occurrence of undesired events.
RESULTS: Fourteen patients (25%) got a change from TICI 0 to ≥2B due to IVT alone. There were otherwise no differences between the IVT responders and IVT non-responders.
CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous thrombolysis pretreatment in the context of the bridging approach contributes substantially to revascularization."
25258089,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25258089/,"BACKGROUND: Pain is an important problem for individuals with cerebral palsy (CP). In addition to pain associated to the pathology, individuals with CP are often exposed to physiotherapy procedures which may cause or relieve pain.
OBJECTIVE: The major aim of this study was to compare pain ratings self-reported by individuals with cerebral palsy and ratings about pain in others provided by their physiotherapists.
METHOD: Cross-sectional study. Children and young adults with cerebral palsy (n = 50) and their physiotherapists (n = 18) completed semi-structured interviews about clinical pain, as well as about procedural pain and pain relief elicited by standardized health procedures. Moreover, pain ratings were obtained during the application of hamstring stretching and passive joint mobilization.
RESULTS: Moderate-to-high agreement was observed between individuals with cerebral palsy and their physiotherapists on presence and intensity of pain, pain interference with physical activities and current and retrospective pain ratings elicited by physiotherapy procedures. By contrast, agreement regarding pain relief elicited by physiotherapy techniques was low.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that although physiotherapists may be reliable proxies for the recognition of pain in individuals with cerebral palsy, further research should be done to improve the communication between health professionals and individuals with cerebral palsy around pain."
25259663,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25259663/,"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify if there is any predictor of residual disease at repeat operation after cervical conization with positive surgical margins for high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) or microinvasive cervical cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Records of patients who underwent immediate repeat conization or hysterectomy because of positive surgical margins for HSIL or microinvasive cervical cancer reported after conization were obtained. The relation between the residual disease and age, parity, menopausal status, and the factors of first conization (method, cone base area, height of cone, endocervical margin, glandular and endocervical curettage specimen involvement, and the number of quadrants with positive surgical margins) was assessed. Standard statistical tests were used.
RESULTS: Seventy-four patients were included. Mean time between the 2 operations was 5.1 weeks. Thirty-four patients (45.9%) had residual disease in the second-operation specimen: 4 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, 24 HSILs, 5 microinvasive lesion, and 1 invasive cervical carcinoma. The number of involved quadrants was the only predictor of residual disease (41% if ≤2 and 80% if >2, p = .02).
CONCLUSIONS: Residual disease is found in nearly half of repeat operations after conization with positive margins for HSIL or microinvasive cervical cancer. Particularly, residual disease is present in 80% of the patients with more than 2 involved quadrants. This should be considered when making management decisions."
25260052,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25260052/,"BACKGROUND: Transepidermal drug delivery (TED) is a new potential method in dermatology. Permeability alterations induced by ablative fractional resurfacing have been described with the aim to increasing the delivery of different substances into the skin.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate clinical response and side effects of TED in areata alopecia (AA) treatment using ablative fractional methods associated with acoustic pressure ultrasound (US) to deliver triamcinolone solution into the skin.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Five cases of AA underwent treatment which comprised of 3 steps: 1) Ablative fractioned RF or CO2 laser 2) topical application of triamcinolone 3) acoustic pressure wave US. The number of sessions varied according to the clinical response, ranging from one to six sessions.
RESULTS: All patients had complete recovery of the area treated. Two of them treated with ablative fractional RF + triamcinolone + US had complete response after three and six sessions. The other two treated with ablative fractional CO2 + triamcinolone + US had complete response after one session.
CONCLUSION: Fractioned ablative resurfacing associated with acoustic pressure wave US is a new option to areata alopecia treatment with good clinical result and low incidence of side effects."
25260130,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25260130/,"BACKGROUND: In early pregnancy, maternal transfer of thyroxine (T4) significantly contributes to the foetal T4 requirements. Interruption of the maternal transfer of T4 may lead to inadequate T4 exposure, potentially leading to neurodevelopmental deficits.
AIM: To determine if maternal factors are associated with the thyroid hormone status of extremely premature infants during the first five days of life.
METHOD: This prospective study looked at 117 mothers and their extremely premature babies (born before 28 weeks' gestation). The relationship between neonatal thyroid hormone status and maternal factors (gestation, route of delivery, exogenous maternal glucocorticoid administration, maternal free T4 (FT4), presence or absence of maternal chorioamnionitis, maternal smoking status, maternal body mass index (BMI) index, maternal thyroid peroxidase antibody status (TPO) and maternal haemoglobin levels) were evaluated. Multiple linear regression was used to study independent factors affecting neonatal thyroid function.
RESULTS: Mean gestational age was 25(+5) ± 1.3 weeks (range 22(+0) to 27(+6)). Neonatal FT4 strongly correlated with gestation, with a greater severity of hypothyroxinaemia associated with lower gestation (r = 0.6, p < 0.0001). Multiple regression found gestation to be the only independent factors affecting thyroid status (beta coefficient = 0.08, p = 0.01), and no maternal factors were found to be associated with neonatal thyroid status.
CONCLUSION: Neonatal thyroid status in extreme preterm infants is independently affected by gestation and not maternal factors such as route of delivery, exogenous maternal glucocorticoid administration, third trimester maternal FT4, presence or absence of chorioamnionitis, smoking status, BMI, TPO status or haemoglobin levels. The severity of neonatal hypothyroxinaemia increases with lower gestational age."
25260384,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25260384/,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about whether health-state preferences differ among Chinese populations. This study compared the preference values for EQ-5D-5L health states between mainland Chinese and Singaporean Chinese.
METHODS: The preference values for ten EQ-5D-5L health states were elicited from general population samples of mainland Chinese and Singaporeans. In computer-assisted self-interviews, each participant completed five time trade-off (TTO) tasks to value five different EQ-5D-5L health states. The difference in TTO values between mainland Chinese and Singaporean Chinese was examined using random-effects linear regression and logistic regression models.
RESULTS: A total of 194 eligible mainland Chinese and 145 eligible Singaporean Chinese provided data for this study. All ten health states considered, the mean TTO value was 0.18 for Singaporean Chinese and 0.35 for mainland Chinese, with the unadjusted and adjusted difference [95% confidence interval (CI)] being -0.17 (-0.28, -0.07) and -0.16 (-0.27, -0.05). Singaporean Chinese had substantially lower TTO values than mainland Chinese for states with severe or extreme problems, with the adjusted difference being -0.30 (95% CI -0.42, -0.17). On the other hand, Singaporean Chinese and mainland Chinese had similar TTO values for states with mild or moderate problems, with the adjusted (95% CI) difference being 0.04 (-0.07, 0.15). Logistic regression analysis showed that Singaporean Chinese were more likely to rate health states with severe or extreme problems as worse than death compared to mainland Chinese.
CONCLUSIONS: Mainland Chinese and Singaporean Chinese have different preferences for EQ-5D-5L health states, supporting the development of local value sets for the EQ-5D-5L instrument for the two populations."
25260400,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25260400/,"PURPOSE: The objective of this report was to analyse injury patterns and definitive management of local casualties with multiple blast extremity injuries in the Kabul International Airport Combat Support Hospital.
METHODS: A clinical prospective study was performed from July 2012 to January 2013. Afghan victims of a blast trauma with a minimum of two extremities injured and an Injury Severity Score (ISS) greater than 8 were included. Two groups were considered for analysis: group A including patients with amputations and group LS including patients with limb salvage procedures.
RESULTS: During this period 19 patients were included with a total of 57 extremity injuries. There were six patients in group A and 13 patients in group LS, with a mean number of injuries of 3.5 and 2.8, respectively. The ISS, blood products utilization and overall time of surgery were significantly greater in group A.
CONCLUSION: Reconstruction of multiple blast extremity injuries may be achieved in a field hospital despite limited resources and operational constraints. However, this activity requires the utilization of significant supplies and major investment from the caregivers deployed."
25260422,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25260422/,"BACKGROUND: The distinctive feature of unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) is the dissociation between arousal and awareness. Cortico-cortical and thalamo-cortical connectivity and plasticity play a key role in consciousness. UWS patients do not usually show any ""cortical"" behavioral sign in response to painful stimulation. Nevertheless a ""focal conscious"" pain perception has been hypothesized.
HYPOTHESIS: Since defective plasticity and connectivity within pain matrix could be striking mechanisms of non-conscious pain perception and, consequently, of non-cortical responses in UWS subjects, aim of our study was to investigate pain-motor plasticity in such patients through a specific paired laser associative stimulation protocol (L-PAS).
METHODS: We enrolled 10 post-anoxic subjects and 10 healthy controls evaluating clinical and electrophysiological parameters before and after the application of such protocol.
RESULTS: Some patient showed a restored pain-motor integration with a partial motor cortex excitability modification.
CONCLUSIONS: Although we studied a small cohort of post-anoxic UWS patients and the results obtained were short-lasting, L-PAS seems a feasible and suitable technique in order to induce plastic change within pain matrix in some UWS patients, allowing the production of ""cortical"" responses to painful stimuli, which are signs of at least partially (""focal"") preserved consciousness. Cortico-thalamic plasticity could have also an important role in the emergence of pain perception as compared to other sensory modalities."
25260443,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25260443/,"OBJECTIVE: To examine any association between polypropylene mesh used in midurethral slings and malignancy in humans. Macroporous, monofilament polypropylene midurethral slings have been established as a safe and effective treatment for stress urinary incontinence. However, despite long-term studies supporting the efficacy and safety of midurethral slings, there have been concerns regarding the general risks of using mesh in transvaginal surgery. In addition, concerns have recently been raised about synthetic midurethral slings and a possible link with malignancy. Therefore, the goal of this work was to further assess any association between polypropylene mesh slings and malignancy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All sling procedures performed at our institution from 2004 to 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. From within this group, the International Classification of Disease codes for urethral cancer, vaginal cancer, and bladder cancer were reviewed.
RESULTS: From 2004-2013, 2545 procedures were performed. Of these, 2361 (96.3%) underwent polypropylene midurethral sling placement. Average follow-up after sling placement was 42.0 ± 38.6 months, with follow-up extending up to 122.3 months. The rate of bladder cancer after the sling procedure was 1 of 2361 (0.0%), with the same rate of vaginal cancer. No sarcomas were noted.
CONCLUSION: Overall, the rate of malignancy after polypropylene mesh midurethral sling placement in our series was 0.0% (2 of 2361). With a mean follow-up of almost 4 years and follow-up extending up to a maximum of 122.3 months, our series does not support any association between the polypropylene mesh used for midurethral slings and the development of malignancy in humans."
25260605,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25260605/,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of a medical audit assessing the accuracy of caesarean indications on the final caesarean section rate of an obstetrics department.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: Comparative observational study conducted in a regional university teaching hospital on the two first quadrimester periods of 2013. During the first quadrimester, there was no cesarean section audit introduced for the daily reports meetings, while an audit was introduced during the second quadrimester. The caesarean rate and the instrumental delivery rate on both quadrimesters were compared.
RESULTS: In the first quadrimester period, there were 248 caesarean sections for 947 deliveries (26.2%), while in the second quadrimester period, there were 246 for 1033 deliveries (23.8%), P=0.014. The emergency caesarean rate decreased from 19.6 to 16.7%, P=0.02 in the second quadrimester period while the instrumental delivery rate increased from 14.4 to 17.2%, P=0.0004. Mothers and children's health was not modified between the two periods.
CONCLUSION: In our experience, the introduction of a daily obstetric audit of the caesarean indications is effective to decrease the emergency caesarean section rate and it encourages us to be active in the first like in the second part of the labor."
25260684,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25260684/,"BACKGROUND: Increases in pregnancy complication rates and use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) have been demonstrated in female urologists and orthopaedic surgeons when compared with the general US population. To determine if childbearing differences exist across specialties, we evaluated female surgeons in all fields, particularly with regard to fertility.
STUDY DESIGN: An anonymous, 199-item survey was distributed via specialty female surgeon interest groups and word of mouth to general surgery, gynecology, neurosurgery, ophthalmology, orthopaedics, otolaryngology, plastic surgery, podiatry, and urology. The 1,021 responses were analyzed and compared with Centers for Disease Control National Survey for Family Growth and National Institute of Health data to identify differences between populations.
RESULTS: Of women surgeons, 32% reported fertility difficulty; 84% of whom underwent infertility workup. Seventy-six percent of these women used ART to attempt pregnancy. In comparison, only 10.9% of women in the general US population report infertility, and 11% seek infertility services. Of all babies born to female surgeons, at least 13% were conceived using ART. Surgeons had 1.4 biological children, less than the national average. Age at first pregnancy was 33 years, compared with a national average of 23. If ART was implemented, surgeon age at first birth increased to 35.4 years. Highest rates of infertility existed in otolaryngology (29%), general surgery (22%), and orthopaedics (18%).
CONCLUSIONS: Female surgeons have first pregnancies later in life, fewer children, and report more issues with infertility. Assisted reproductive technology is implemented more often by female surgeons than the general population. Differences in fertility exist between specialties and warrant additional study."
25260686,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25260686/,"BACKGROUND: Geriatric trauma is becoming a significant public health concern. The most commonly used prediction models for mortality benchmarking are based on vital signs and injury pattern, including the Trauma and Injury Severity Score (TRISS), which is less accurate in the elderly. The ICD-9-based prediction models incorporating injuries and comorbidities, such as the University Health System Consortium Expected Mortality (UHC-EM), may be more accurate for the elderly.
STUDY DESIGN: We retrospectively studied all trauma admissions from January 2005 to June 2012 at an academic level I adult trauma center. This was an observational study comparing expected to actual in-hospital mortality for both geriatric (age ≥65 years) and nongeriatric populations. Predictive ability for TRISS and UHC-EM was determined by the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC).
RESULTS: Geriatric patients had higher median TRISS predicted mortality (8.4% [interquartile range (IQR) 4.8%, 27.4%] vs 2.8% [IQR 1.1%, 30.2%], p < 0.001). Geriatric patients had a median UHC-EM 5 times higher than nongeriatric patients (5.0% [IQR 1.0%, 19.0%] vs 1.0% [IQR 0%, 7.0%], p < 0.001). In-hospital mortality was 3 times higher in geriatric patients (18.1% vs 6.0%, p < 0.001). The UHC-EM had superior AUC to TRISS in both geriatric (0.89 [95% CI 0.87, 0.91] vs 0.81 [95% CI 0.78, 0.84], p < 0.05) and nongeriatric (0.93 [95% CI 0.92, 0.94] vs 0.90 [95% CI 0.89, 0.91], p < 0.05) patients.
CONCLUSIONS: An ICD-9-based algorithm, such as the UHC-EM, which incorporates injuries and comorbidities, may be superior to algorithms based on vital signs and injury patterns without comorbidities in predicting mortality after trauma in the geriatric population."
25261141,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25261141/,"PURPOSE: The aim of this pilot study was to investigate whether it was feasible and safe to mobilize patients shortly after lumbar disc surgery with the objective of reducing postoperative complications and allowing shorter hospitalization.
DESIGN: Randomized controlled study.
METHOD: The patients were randomized into two groups, intervention and control groups. Those in the intervention group used a walking frame to walk, with a porter and a nurse, from the postanesthesia care unit to the general ward. Patients in the control group were transported in their beds. The Bournemouth Questionnaire was used to define the various aspects of well-being of the patients.
FINDINGS: A total of 22 patients were included, 11 in each group. Owing to the limited number of patients, statistical comparisons were not performed. However, patients in the walking group were mobilized earlier than the controls, and needed fewer painkillers and less oxygen supplement during the first postoperative day. The length of stay and the number of postoperative complications were similar in the two groups as tested during the three weeks after surgery.
CONCLUSION: This pilot study suggests that it might be feasible and safe to mobilize patients shortly after lumbar disc surgery. There were no indications of an increased number of postoperative complications."
25261296,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25261296/,"INTRODUCTION: The prognostic significance of the involvement of anatomical masticator space (MS) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) was retrospectively reviewed.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: 1104 Patients with non-metastatic NPC treated with radical radiotherapy between 1998 and 2010 were re-staged according to the 7th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system; tumors with medial pterygoid muscle (MP) and/or lateral pterygoid muscle (LP) involvement but did not fulfill the criteria for T3 or T4 were staged as TX. The tumor volume data, dosimetric data and survival endpoints of different T stage diseases were analyzed and compared to study the significance of MS involvement.
RESULTS: The overall MS involvement rate was 61.0%. The median volumes of the primary gross tumor volume were 9.6ml, 15.2ml, 19.9ml, 32.6ml and 77.3ml for T1, T2, TX, T3 and T4, respectively (p<0.001). T1, T2 and TX tumors received higher minimum dose to the gross tumor volume and planning target volume than T3 and T4. Multivariate analysis showed that age, gender, T-/N-classification and the use of chemotherapy were significant prognostic factors for various survival end-points. Patients with TX disease had similar survival rates as with T1-T2; and had a significantly better 5-year overall survival rate (86.6% vs. 76.6%; p=0.013) and a trend of higher 5-year distant failure-free survival rate (91.5% vs. 81.3%; p=0.09) than patients with T3 disease.
CONCLUSION: NPC with the involvement of MP and/or LP alone should be classified as T2 disease."
25261316,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25261316/,"OBJECTIVES: Longitudinal studies have linked stress at work with a higher incidence of musculoskeletal pain. We aimed to explore the extent to which musculoskeletal pain is a cause as opposed to a consequence of perceived occupational stress.
METHODS: As part of the international cultural and psychosocial influences on disability study, we collected information from 305 Italian nurses, at baseline and again after 12 months, about pain during the past month in the low-back and neck/shoulder, and about effort-reward imbalance (ERI) (assessed by Siegrist's ERI questionnaire). Poisson regression was used to assess the RR of ERI >1 at follow-up according to the report of pain and of ERI >1 at baseline.
RESULTS: Among nurses with ERI ≤1 at baseline, ERI >1 at follow-up was associated with baseline report of pain in the low-back (RR 2.7, 95 % CI 1.4-5.0) and neck/shoulder (RR 2.6, 95 % CI 1.3-5.1). However, there was no corresponding association with persistence of ERI in nurses who already had ERI >1 at baseline. Associations of ERI at baseline with pain at follow-up were weak.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the well-documented association between job stress and musculoskeletal pain is not explained entirely by an effect of stress on reporting of pain. It appears also that workers who report musculoskeletal pain are more likely to develop subsequent perceptions of stress. This may be because pain renders people less tolerant of the psychological demands of work. Another possibility is that reports of pain and stress are both manifestations of a general tendency to be aware of and complain about symptoms and difficulties."
25261662,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25261662/,"PURPOSE: To determine the prognostic value of trace element levels in cases with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
METHODS: This prospective study included patients receiving chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced NSCLC and healthy individuals as control group. In both groups, 37 trace element levels in hair were studied by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer technique. Treatment response and survival were evaluated and possible relationship between them and trace element levels was investigated.
RESULTS: The mean age was 58.01 ± 7.7 years in the patient group (N=70) and 56.3 ± 9.03 years in the control group (N=85). When trace element levels were compared, it was found that there was significant differences between groups regarding Al, As, Be, Ca, Cr, Hg, Li, Ni, Rh, Sb, Se, Sn, Ti and Zn levels (p<0.05; Student's t-test). In the patient group, mean overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 16.3 and 11.4 months, respectively. After concurrent chemoradiotherapy, complete response (CR) was detected in 7 patients (10%), partial response(PR) in 16 (22.9%), stable disease (SD) in 18 (25.7%) and progression (PD) in 29 patients (41.4%). In univariate and multivariate analyses, Au and Cu levels were significantly associated with PFS (p-0.017 and p=0.020, respectively).
CONCLUSION: An increase was noticed in heavy metal levels in patients with NSCLC. Copper and gold affected significancy PFS while other trace elements had no significant impact on survival."
25261666,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25261666/,"PURPOSE: We retrospectively assessed the treatment results of patients with testicular non-seminoma to evaluate possible predictive and prognostic factors.
METHODS: 189 patients with testicular non-seminoma treated between 2000 and 2012 were retrospectively evaluated. Treatment was based on orchiectomy plus chemotherapy (bleomycin/etoposide/cisplatin and vinblastine/ifosfamide/ cisplatin); retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy was only performed for residual disease after chemotherapy. The treatment protocol was updated regularly according to international standards. Overall survival (OS) was evaluated with the Kaplan-Meier method at a significance level of 5% according to stage, Karnofsky performance status (KPS), and chemotherapy dose intensity.
RESULTS: OS differed significantly for patients at different TNM stages (p=0.000); however, detailed analysis revealed significantly worse survival only in stage IIIC (10-year OS for IIIC vs IIIA+B, 35 vs 88%, p=0.001), while the difference between IIIB and lower stages was not significant (p=0.383). Patients with no chemotherapy dose reduction had significantly higher OS than those with any kind of dose reduction (10-year OS 96 vs 0%, p=0.000). For stage IIIC disease, however, dose intensity had no influence on OS (p=0.167). KPS had no prognostic significance for OS (KPS<80 vs ≥80, p=0.627) for stage IIIA+B and for stage IIIC.
CONCLUSION: The standard of care for testicular non-seminoma offers excellent prognosis with no significant differences in OS for good- and intermediate-risk patients. Reduction of chemotherapy dose negatively impacted OS in patients with stage IIIA+B and thus should be avoided."
25261671,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25261671/,"PURPOSE: To study the data on the distress scale points (DSP) of patients in oncology clinics in relation to age, the reasons for admission to the hospital, the educational status and the family support.
METHODS: Six hundred and fifty three patients diagnosed with malignancies were enrolled. All of the patients were asked to fill in a questionnaire that included data about their demographic characteristics, diagnoses, the cause of hospital admission and the educational status. The family support of each patient was observed and noted by clinicians and other healthcare providers during the clinical visits.
RESULTS: The mean patient age was 54.8 years (± SD 13.7). Of the patients 314 (48.1%) were male and 339 (51.9%) female. The median DSP for the group that included patients <35 years of age was 3; this was 5 for the 36-49 age group, 4 for the 50-69 age group and 4.5 for the >70 age group. A statistically significant difference in DSP between these groups was noticed (p=0.035). The DSP for patients <35 years of age was lower than that of the other age groups. The median DSP for the patients presenting to the outpatient clinic for adjuvant therapy was 5; this was 5 for patients presenting for palliative therapy, and 3 in the active surveillance group, and a statistically significant relationship was determined between the DSP and the reason for admission to the outpatient clinic (p<0.001). The patients that had presented to the outpatient clinic for active surveillance had statistically significantly lower DSP compared to the other groups (p<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Distress in oncology clinics seems to be continuous; thus, the use of distress thermometer as a precautionary measure for distress development in patients with malignancies should be mandatory to help medical oncologists understand the psychosocial needs of their patients and start to treat them as a human beings."
10180379,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10180379/,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the need for further evaluation of general practice-based outreach clinics in two specialties using data from a UK pilot study to model their cost-effectiveness.
METHODS: A pilot study was undertaken comparing one outreach and one outpatient clinic held by three dermatology specialists and three orthopaedic specialists. Information was collected on waiting times, costs to patients, casemix and resource use.
RESULTS: Only dermatology outreach clinic patients experienced significantly shorter waiting times for first appointments than their hospital counterparts. Outreach clinic patients incurred lower costs in attending appointments in either specialty but the differences were not statistically significant. Evidence of a difference in casemix between patients attending outreach and outpatient clinics meant that treatment costs incurred in both types of clinic could not be compared. Outreach clinics in both specialties were significantly more costly in terms of staff, staff travel and associated opportunity costs compared with outpatient clinics. Sensitivity analysis showed that outreach and outpatient clinics had the same marginal cost if the number of patients per outreach clinic increased greatly or attendance fell considerably at outpatient clinics.
CONCLUSIONS: This study has found no evidence that outreach clinics in these two specialties are cost-effective in terms of costs and benefits. A more definitive conclusion could only be made if studies estimated other costs and benefits not accounted for in this study. Further research is required to see whether outreach clinics in other specialties or clinics with different configurations to those studied are efficient."
10180387,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10180387/,"OBJECTIVE: To examine whether variations in the number of whole-time equivalent (wte) practice nurses across family health services authorities (FHSAs) can be explained by population characteristics and the organisation of general practice.
METHODS: Analysis of nine health and 16 social indicators for 98 FHSAs identified three factors underlying health care needs. These factors and seven practice characteristics were analysed by stepwise regression. A formula for allocating health care resources and a logistic growth model were used to estimate the 'expected' number of nurses.
RESULTS: Past trends indicate an eventual (wte) practice nurse workforce of 12,500 (95% CI +/- 3500). Although geographical disparities have declined, there was a two-fold variation in nurse numbers across FHSAs. Around 2000 (wte) posts would be required to bring under-provided areas, mostly in northern England and metropolitan districts, up to the highest level of provision. There were more nurses in areas with higher proportions of elderly people but fewer where deprivation, morbidity and mortality levels were above average. The number of general practitioners was the most significant predictor of practice nurse provision (t = 5.0); population needs and practice characteristics explained 24% of the variation.
CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of practice nurses scarcely corresponded with health care needs at the FHSA level. Despite a lack of evidence that nurses are a cost-effective addition to the primary health care team, their role and numbers will be driven by the extent to which they take on responsibilities performed by doctors. Achieving equity in practice nurse provision probably requires explicit consideration in a formula for allocating primary care funds, backed by audit of the services they provide."
10180841,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10180841/,"OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to detect any effect of order when modules on disease-specific and overall health status are combined in an outcomes research questionnaire.
METHODS: Men with symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) were prospectively enrolled in a clinical trial of an educational intervention in Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound, a prepaid group practice. Within the trial, 392 consecutive men were randomized to one of two versions of a baseline questionnaire. One had a 38-item module on BPH-specific health status first, followed by a 30-item module on overall health status; the other had the modules in reverse order. Scores were compared for three BPH-specific scales and eight scales measuring overall health. Data were collected in the form of self-administered questionnaires.
RESULTS: Comparing the groups assigned the two versions of the questionnaire, no significant differences in scores on any of the health status scales were found.
CONCLUSIONS: In this dataset, we could find no evidence of an order effect when modules on BPH-specific and overall health status were combined in different sequences."
10180842,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10180842/,"OBJECTIVES: To help develop a means, based on the views of purchasers and providers of health care, of incorporating national research on clinical effectiveness into local professional advisory mechanisms in order to inform health care purchasing and contracting.
METHODS: Three geographically based multidisciplinary workshops attended by National Health Service (NHS) staff drawn from the principal purchaser and provider groups in one English region were organized around the discussion of three health care purchasing case studies: coronary artery disease, diabetes and management of clinical depression in general practice. The proceedings were transcribed and analyzed using content analysis methods.
RESULTS: 95 people took part. There were major differences between the purchasers' and health care providers' views on the right balance between local and national information and advisory sources for purchasing. In general, providers wanted the provision of advice to purchasers to be local, in which their opinion was sought, either individually or collectively, acted on and the results fed back to them. In contrast, health authority purchasers considered that local professionals were only one source of professional advice, albeit an important one, to be utilized in coming to decisions. General practitioner fundholders as purchasers, however, preferred to rely on their own experiences and contacts with local providers in making purchasing decisions.
CONCLUSIONS: Professional specialist advisory groups are necessary to inform the purchasing of health care, but should extend beyond advising on the placement of individual contracts. Involving health care providers in all short-term contracting is unlikely to be cost-effective given the time commitment required. The emphasis at purchaser/provider meetings should be on education: providing an opportunity for purchasers and providers to develop closer relationships to discuss political imperatives and financial constraints; increasing communication and understanding of providers' and purchasers' roles; and providing an environment for professionals and purchasers to share their views on purchasing. As currently presented, elements of the national policies in the NHS advocating the use of both national evidence on clinical effectiveness and local professional advice are contradictory and should be clarified."
10180872,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10180872/,"OBJECTIVES: HIV and AIDS represent a considerable challenge to the British National Health Service, and the resources devoted to treatment and prevention of HIV/AIDS are significant and likely to increase. The focus of recent campaigns promoting safer sexual practices to prevent the spread of HIV have focused on the use of condoms, since condom use reduces the probability of infection. Furthermore, it has also been suggested that condoms should be provided routinely on prescription by general practitioners (GPs). The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of GP-provision of condoms in the prevention of HIV infection. Since risk factors for HIV infection differ across population groups, cost-effectiveness ratios for three at-risk groups were considered.
METHODS: Estimates of the cost per infection prevented and the cost per life year gained were made for female heterosexuals, male heterosexuals, and male homosexuals in England and Wales. Sensitivity analysis was conducted on a number of key parameters.
RESULTS: The costs per infection prevented were 2,327,744 Pounds for female heterosexuals, 9,709,987 Pounds for male heterosexuals and 1315 Pounds for male homosexuals. The corresponding costs per life year gained were 56,774 Pounds, 269,722 Pounds and 37 Pounds. When savings from the costs of care were taken into account the use of condoms resulted in cost savings of nearly 50,000 Pounds for homosexual males.
CONCLUSIONS: The provision of GP-prescribed condoms is highly cost-effective for male homosexuals. Such provision is much less cost-effective for heterosexuals, primarily due to the relatively low prevalence of HIV in the heterosexual population and the low infectivity parameter. This suggests that routine GP-provision of condoms would be inappropriate for all at-risk groups, and should target high-risk groups, specifically male homosexuals."
10181144,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10181144/,"PURPOSE: This study examines the association between self-reported health risks and short-term use of medical resources.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study comparing responses from a mailed survey with medical encounter and expenditure data. Bivariate analyses and multivariate linear and logistic regressions controlling for age, gender, and health status were conducted to illustrate the relationship between selected risk factors and resource use.
SETTING: A group network model health maintenance organization (HMO) in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
SUBJECTS: The study population was comprised of a randomly selected sample of nonsenior adults (18 to 64 years old, n = 3825) and seniors (65 years and older, n = 1955) who were enrolled in an HMO. The response rate was 72%.
MEASURES: Five independent variables: smoking, alcohol use, obesity, lack of physical activity, and unhappiness were derived from a questionnaire designed to assess health status and health risks. Outcome measures were medical care charges and use of hospital services.
RESULTS: Obesity, physical inactivity, and unhappiness were related to higher charges among seniors. These relationships dissipated to some degree after controlling for age, gender, and health status. Unexpected differences were found for alcohol use among both age groups, with those considered to be ""not at risk"" accruing higher charges and demonstrating a higher likelihood of using inpatient hospital services than those defined to be at risk.
CONCLUSIONS: Bivariate and multivariate regression results demonstrated that traditional risk factors are weak and inconsistent predictors of short-term medical charges. Charging smokers and other high risk individuals a higher annual insurance premium than is offered for those at low risk raises questions about fairness when such risk factors are not necessarily good predictors of short-term resource use. The rationale for insurance cost-shifting should be supported with reliable data connecting risks to charges."
10183419,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10183419/,"UNLABELLED: Precise communication among clinicians of chest-auscultation findings depends on use of standardized nomenclature for lung sounds. To identify the current practice of clinicans in describing lung sounds, we surveyed physicians and respiratory care practitioners (RCPs).
MATERIALS AND METHOD: Surveys were specifically designed to identify: (1) whether RCPs and physicians use similar terms to describe adventitious lung sounds (ALS), (2) whether changes are occurring in response to the recommendations of the ATS-ACCP Ad Hoc Subcommittee on Pulmonary Nomenclature, and (3) whether RCPs and physicians differ in their ability to accurately recognize ALS. We surveyed 156 RCPs at the 1987 Annual Meeting of the American Association for Respiratory Care and 223 pulmonary physicians (PPs) and 54 nonpulmonary physicians (NPPs) at the 1988 Annual Meeting of the American College of Chest Physicians. Each survey participant was required to listen to five examples of ALS using earphones and an audiocassette player and then to write 'free-form' descriptions of what they heard. (All participants listened to the same ALS.)
RESULTS: Fine crackles and high-pitched monophonic and polyphonic wheezes were readily recognized by the majority of RCPs and physicians. Fine crackles were described as rales or crackles; high-pitched, monophonic wheezes were described as stridor or wheezes; however, high-pitched, polyphonic wheezes were usually described as wheezes. RCPs and physicians used a variety of terms to describe coarse crackles and rhonchi. The term rhonchi was frequently used inappropriately by all groups surveyed. There were no significant differences between PPs and RCPs in their ability to accurately recognize adventitious lung sounds; however, PPs were superior to NPPs (p less than 0.05) in this regard. PPs were superior to RCPs and NPPs (p less than 0.05) in appropriately using the term 'fine' for the description of crackles.
CONCLUSION: All three groups of clinicians need to improve their ability to recognize and describe lung sounds."
10185372,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10185372/,"OBJECTIVES: To determine how public (NHS or local government), private (for-profit) and voluntary (non-profit) providers of residential mental health care compare. Do they support different clienteles? And do their services cost different amounts?
METHODS: Based on a cross-sectional survey of residential care facilities and their residents in eight English and Welsh localities, the characteristics and costs of care in the different sectors (NHS, local government, private, voluntary) were compared. Variations in cost were examined in relation to residents' characteristics using multiple regression analyses, which also allowed standardisation of results before making inter-sectoral comparisons.
RESULTS: Private and voluntary providers of residential care support different clienteles from the public sector. The patterns of inter-sectoral cost differences vary between London and non-London localities. In London, voluntary sector facilities may be more cost-efficient than the other sectors, but local government/private sector comparisons show no consistent difference. Outside London, the results suggest clear cost advantages for the private and voluntary sectors over the local government sector.
CONCLUSIONS: Private and voluntary providers may have some economic advantages over their public counterparts. However, outcomes for residents were not studied, leaving unanswered the question of comparative cost-effectiveness."
10187198,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10187198/,"BACKGROUND: A validation study of routine hospital outpatient data was carried out as part of a broader project focusing on outpatient re-attendance. The aim was to compare two patient administration system (PAS) data items with the same information collected directly from hospital clinicians.
METHODS: A total of 140 cases from four specialties at four National Health Service hospitals was randomly selected for comparison. The specific data items compared were the grade of doctor seen and the management decision taken following an outpatient appointment. The proportion of cases in which there was agreement was calculated, together with kappa values and relevant statistics indicating the accuracy of the PAS data when compared with information compiled immediately after the consultation by the relevant clinician.
RESULTS: There was agreement between the clinician's data and the PAS data in 118/140 (84.3%) cases for grade of doctor seen and in 105/139 (76.7%) cases for the management decision. There was complete agreement for both items in 88/139 (62.6%) cases. Kappa values indicated good agreement between the two data sources. However, 'sensitivity' statistics suggested that the likely accuracy of each data item varied.
CONCLUSION: Although there was good agreement within individual categories between the two sources, 37% of patient computerised records held at least one inconsistency in this small study focusing on only two data items. Further systematic evaluation is needed to test the extent to which other items are similarly discrepant."
10187199,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10187199/,"OBJECTIVE: To document the variability in consultation length and to examine the relative weight of different kinds of characteristics (of the patients, of the general practitioner (GP), or of the practice) in affecting consultation length, and, thus, to assess whether consultation length can legitimately be used as a quality marker.
DESIGN: A multilevel statistical analysis of 836 consultations across 51 GPs in ten practices.
SETTING AND SUBJECTS: Ten general practices across four regions in England with varying list sizes, number of partners and fundholding status.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Length of time face-to-face with patients in consultation measured in minutes and fractions of minutes.
RESULTS: There is substantial inter-practice variation in consultation length, from a mean of 5.7 minutes to one of 8.5 minutes. In some practices the longest average GP consultation time is about twice that of the shortest. Trainees and new partners spend, on average, about 1 minute less than their longer-serving colleagues. Consultation lengths for individual GPs range from a mean of 4.4 minutes to 11 minutes. Late middle-aged women (55-64 years) receive the longest consultations, followed by elderly people, with children receiving the shortest consultations. The number of topics raised affects the length of the consultation by about 1 minute per additional topic. When female patients consult female GPs, approximately 1 minute is added to the average consultation. A significant fraction of the variability in consultation lengths can be explained in terms of characteristics of patients, of GPs and of practices.
CONCLUSIONS: The fact that there is little unexplained variation in GP consultation lengths that might be attributable to variations in quality (i.e. GP-related) throws doubt on the proposition that length of consultation can be used as a marker for quality of consultation in general practice."
10187201,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10187201/,"OBJECTIVES: To determine whether new technology increases or decreases formal health care costs, with reference to the diagnosis and treatment of peptic ulcers.
METHODS: A costing method has been devised which is designed to investigate directly the way in which the costs to formal health services of diagnosing and treating an individual illness have changed with changes in technology.
RESULTS: The cost of diagnosis has increased almost entirely as a result of the high cost of endoscopy compared with X-ray examination. The introduction of H2-receptor antagonist drugs increased the cost of treatment compared with the earlier phases of surgical treatment. Subsequently, Helicobacter pylori eradication treatment has reduced the cost of treatment compared with all earlier phases of technology.
CONCLUSIONS: A method has been devised that allows the impact of changes in medical technology on formal health care costs to be investigated for individual illnesses. In the treatment of peptic ulceration, the current technology, H. pylori eradication, has lower treatment costs than all previous technologies. The evidence from previous studies and this study is insufficient to support the assertion that new technology in general leads either to an increase or to a decrease in health care costs."
10187866,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10187866/,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials of acute stroke care have shown care in stroke units (SUs) to be superior to that in conventional general medical, neurological, or geriatric wards, with reductions in early case fatality, functional outcome, and the need for long-term institutionalization. This study examined whether these results can be reproduced in clinical practice.
METHODS: A multicenter observational study of procedures and outcomes in acute stroke patients admitted to designated SUs or general medical or neurological wards (GWs), the study included patients of all ages with acute stroke excluding those with subarachnoid hemorrhage, who were entered into the Riks-Stroke (Swedish national quality assessment) database during 1996 (14 308 patients in 80 hospitals).
RESULTS: Patients admitted to SUs who had lived independently and who were fully conscious on admission to the hospital had a lower case fatality than those cared for in GWs (relative risk [RR] for death, 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.79 to 0.96) and at 3 months (RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.85 to 0.98). A greater proportion of patients cared for in an SU could be discharged home (RR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.10), and fewer were in long-term institutional care 3 months after the stroke (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.89 to 0.99). No difference was seen in outcome in patients cared for in SUs or GWs if they had impaired consciousness on admission.
CONCLUSIONS: The improvement in outcomes after stroke care in SUs compared with care in GWs can be reproduced in the routine clinical setting, but the magnitude of the benefit appears smaller than that reported from meta-analyses."
10188740,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10188740/,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this manuscript was to provide a basis for establishing safety cutoffs for hematocrit levels in triathletes and background data for possible future medical control regulations.
METHODS: Competitors from three different distance triathlons participated: Olympic (N = 118), half-Ironman (N = 87), and Ironman (N = 207). Blood samples were drawn within 24-36 h prerace (N = 412) and within minutes of race finish (N = 296). Prerace hematocrits approximated a normal distribution for men (X = 43.2 +/- 2.9) and women (X = 40.2+/-2.6). Prerace hematocrits decreased as competitive distance increased for men (X = 45.0, 43.4, 42.5; respectively; P < 0.01) but not for women (P > 0.05).
RESULTS: Mean race day changes were small but statistically significant for Olympic and Ironman men and for half-Ironman women. Individual responses were more variable with hemoconcentration occurring in 57%, hemodilution in 43%, and no change in 2% of participants. The magnitude of individual responses was also variable with hematocrit changes ranging from -7.1 to + 10%. No athlete in this sample had a hematocrit that would place him/her in the ""danger zone"" (Hct > 55%).
CONCLUSIONS: Cutoff values (3 SD above the means) of 52% for men and 48% for women are suggested by these data. However, the relationship of these cutoffs to either athlete safety or the ability to detect rules violations remains unknown."
10188857,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10188857/,"AIMS: To evaluate p53 and Bcl-2 expression and proliferating status (PCNA) in subgroups of patients with high-risk superficial and invasive bladder cancer, with relation to cancer progression and death, and to correlate the results with established clinical prognostic factors.
METHODS: Paraffin-embedded sections from 42 high-risk superficial (T1G2,T1G3) and 33 invasive (T2-T4aG3 N0M0) tumours were investigated immunohistochemically for p53, Bcl-2 and PCNA. The median follow-up was 52 months.
RESULTS: In the cohort of superficial tumours, statistical analysis showed that p53 and PCNA positivity were significant prognostic factors (P-values: 0.008 and 0.006, respectively) for disease-specific death (DSD). When life expectancy was evaluated (log-rank test), p53(+) (P = 0.015) and PCNA(+) (P = 0.017) offered the most accurate prognosis compared to grade, tumour size and multiplicity. Bcl-2 status had no significant effect on patient survival. In the subset of muscle-invasive tumours we failed to demonstrate any important role of p53, Bcl-2 or PCNA positivity.
CONCLUSIONS: p53 and PCNA over-expression may offer valuable additional prognostic information in high-risk subgroups of superficial bladder tumours. From our results, Bcl-2 does not appear to contribute significantly to the prognosis of these patients. None of the studied markers offered prognostic information in muscle-invading disease."
10189040,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10189040/,"OBJECTIVES: Recent experimental studies have suggested that isoflavones (such as genistein and daidzein) found in some soy products may reduce the risk of cancer. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between soy milk, a beverage containing isoflavones, and prostate cancer incidence.
METHODS: A prospective study with 225 incident cases of prostate cancer in 12,395 California Seventh-Day Adventist men who in 1976 stated how often they drank soy milk.
RESULTS: Frequent consumption (more than once a day) of soy milk was associated with 70 per cent reduction of the risk of prostate cancer (relative risk = 0.3, 95 percent confidence interval 0.1-1.0, p-value for linear trend = 0.03). The association was upheld when extensive adjustments were performed.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that men with high consumption of soy milk are at reduced risk of prostate cancer. Possible associations between soy bean products, isoflavones and prostate cancer risk should be further investigated."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors retrospectively evaluated the radiology reports from 283 patients (168 female and 115 male patients; mean age, 55.7 years; age range, 1-93 years) in whom US was performed to rule out lower extremity DVT. In all patients, the initial thigh examination was negative for DVT. All patients were classified as to the reason for the examination, risk factors for DVT (including recent surgery), whether they received anticoagulation therapy, and findings on calf US scans. Adverse outcomes were considered a clinically important PE or DVT in the thigh.
RESULTS: Only 1.1% of patients (95% CI = 0.2%, 3.1%) had adverse outcomes. Adverse outcomes occurred only in postsurgical patients (P = .028) and were not related to the presence or absence of calf DVT or method of treatment.
CONCLUSION: US of the calf is unnecessary at initial evaluation to identify patients at risk of clinically important PE or propagation of DVT into the thigh."
10189459,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10189459/,"PURPOSE: To assess the relevance of the signal intensity time course for the differential diagnosis of enhancing lesions in dynamic magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the breast.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred sixty-six breast lesions were examined with a two-dimensional dynamic MR imaging series and subtraction postprocessing. Time-signal intensity curves of the lesions were obtained and classified according to their shapes as type I, which was steady enhancement; type II, plateau of signal intensity; or type III, washout of signal intensity. Enhancement rates and curve types of benign and malignant lesions were compared.
RESULTS: There were 101 malignant and 165 benign lesions. The distribution of curve types for breast cancers was type I, 8.9%; type II, 33.6%; and type III, 57.4%. The distribution of curve types for benign lesions was type I, 83.0%; type II, 11.5%; and type III, 5.5%. The distributions proved significantly different (chi 2 = 139.6; P < .001). The diagnostic indices for signal intensity time course were sensitivity, 91%; specificity, 83%; and diagnostic accuracy, 86%. The diagnostic indices for the enhancement rate were sensitivity, 91%; specificity, 37%; and diagnostic accuracy, 58%.
CONCLUSION: The shape of the time-signal intensity curve is an important criterion in differentiating benign and malignant enhancing lesions in dynamic breast MR imaging. A type III time course is a strong indicator of malignancy and is independent of other criteria."
10190378,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10190378/,"PURPOSE: Nonwhite dialysis patients survive longer than white patients; however, their clinical characteristics differ. We examined whether case mix differences explain the apparent survival advantage of nonwhite dialysis patients.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study using data from the US Renal Data System Case Mix Severity Study that included 4,797 randomly selected dialysis patients 20 years of age and older who were followed up for up to 6 years. Demographic, comorbidity, laboratory, nutritional, and functional status data were obtained. Multivariable proportional hazards models adjusted for case mix differences between nonwhite and white dialysis patients. Additional analyses examined the effects of differences in transplantation rates, withdrawal from dialysis rates, and treatment modality selection.
RESULTS: Unadjusted survival rates of black, Native American, and Asian or Pacific Islander dialysis patients were similar, and better than that for white dialysis patients. Relative to whites, the unadjusted relative risk (RR) for mortality among nonwhite patients was 0.64 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.58 to 0.70). Adjustment for case mix reduced, but did not eliminate, the survival advantage associated with nonwhite race (RR = 0.78, CI: 0.71 to 0.86). Adjustment for differences in transplantation rates (RR = 0.83, CI: 0.75 to 0.91), withdrawal from dialysis rates (RR = 0.81, CI: 0.73 to 0.90), and initial treatment modality (RR = 0.79, CI: 0.71 to 0.87) did not explain the lower mortality among nonwhites.
CONCLUSIONS: A survival advantage for nonwhite dialysis patients persists after case mix adjustment. Future studies should explore additional physiologic and socioeconomic factors that might explain this difference."

METHODS: Ten patients (mean age 55 years (range 41-65)) were studied during diagnostic cardiac catheterisation. The haemodynamic response to an intravenous (i.v.) infusion for 30 min of BMS-180048 (0.56 mg kg(-1) h(-1) for 10 min and 0.39 mg kg(-1) h(-1) for 20 min) was assessed via a 7F Swan Ganz catheter and thermodilution cardiac output system. Quantitative coronary angiography was performed at 10 min intervals.
RESULTS: BMS-180048 caused a significant increase in systemic arterial systolic blood pressure (rise of 32.5 mmHg, 95% CI 24,44.5) P=0.009), pulmonary artery systolic (12.2 mmHg, 95% CI 6.8,18.5; P=0.009) and diastolic pressures (8.5 mmHg, 95% CI 5.0,13.8; P=0.009), right atrial pressure (4 mmHg, 95% CI 1.5,5.2; P=0.013) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (9.5 mmHg 95% CI 5.2,14.0; P=0.09). There was no significant change in cardiac output (0.1 l min(-1), 95% CI -0.17,0.57, P>0.05). Mean coronary artery diameter in the proximal coronary segments decreased by 0.73 mm (95% CI -1.22,-0.15; P=0.03) at 35 min. The corresponding reduction in middle segments was 0.26 mm (95% CI -0.395,-0.08; P=0.02). There was a non-significant trend to constriction in the most distal segments of 0.28 mm (95% CI -0.68,0.015); P=0.06). One patient experienced chest pain with ECG changes suggestive of ischaemia.
CONCLUSIONS: BMS-180048 displayed a cardiovascular profile similar to that previously reported for sumatriptan. These changes appear to reflect a class effect of these agents."
10190668,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10190668/,"OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the station of the fetal head when lumbar epidural analgesia is administered influences the duration or the mode of delivery in low-risk laboring women.
METHODS: We prospectively evaluated 131 consecutive cases of low-risk parturients at term who requested intrapartum epidural analgesia. Obstetric outcome of 65 parturients who underwent epidural analgesia when the fetal head was low in the birth canal was compared to 66 patients whose fetal head station was above the ischial spine.
RESULTS: Both groups were similar in their obstetric characteristics. Cervical dilatation when performing the epidural analgesia was similar in both groups. The duration of labor and mode of delivery, as well as percentage of malpositions, were not significantly different in the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The station of the fetal head while initiating epidural analgesia does not influence the duration of labor or the mode of delivery. Therefore, there is no justification to delay epidural analgesia in labor until the presenting fetal part is engaged."
10190832,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10190832/,"BACKGROUND: Dyspnea is among the most common reasons for emergency department (ED) visits, yet little is known about how it is associated with visit characteristics and disposition or about how such associations differ across diagnoses.
OBJECTIVES: To characterize ED visits for chronic cardiorespiratory diseases in which dyspnea is a prominent symptom. Visit demographics and relations among reasons for presenting, visit urgency, medications, and visit disposition were examined.
METHODS: Data for this cross-sectional descriptive-exploratory study came from the 1992 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. All adult ED visits in the dataset for asthma (n = 395), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; n = 239), and congestive heart failure (CHF; n = 320), as well as for mixed and restrictive chronic lung diseases (n = 18 and n = 14, respectively), were analyzed.
RESULTS: Dyspnea was the most common reason for ED visit across diagnoses, and was associated with an approximate twofold increase in likelihood of admission for patients with COPD (odds ratio [OR] = 1.9, p < .04), and, controlling for age, CHF (OR = 1.7, p = .035). Dyspnea, alone or controlling for age, did not significantly increase the likelihood of admission for asthma. However, across all diagnoses, dyspnea was associated with a two- to threefold increase in the likelihood of receiving intravenous (i.v.) fluids (p < or = .006), whereas receiving an i.v. markedly increased the likelihood of admission (OR = 10.0, p < .0001 for COPD; OR = 10.2, p < .0001 for asthma; and OR = 3.8; p < .0001 for CHF). Age independently predicted admission for asthma and CHF, but not COPD. The percentage of nonurgent visits resulting in admission was markedly higher for COPD (19%) and CHF (41%) than for asthma (4%) or adult visits in general (6%).
CONCLUSIONS: Reports of dyspnea increased the likelihood of admission from the ED either directly or indirectly, depending on diagnosis. Judgments of nonurgency may be less dependable in ED visits for COPD and CHF than for asthma or adult visits generally."

METHODS: A time and motion evaluation of the activities of four A&E consultants before and after a doctor's assistant was established as a team member within our department. A review of the literature was undertaken to allow comparisons with the American model of the physician assistant within the emergency department.
RESULTS: The initial evaluation indicated that over 20% of the consultant's time could have been saved if an assistant were available to perform a variety of non-medical tasks. The restudy performed once the assistant was in post indicated less time was spent by the doctors in ""medical"" clerical duties (6.7% v 11.5% time), telephone use (5.6% v 7.7%), and venepuncture/cannula insertion (0.4% v 2.1%), and more time was spent on consultation over cases (15.3% v 11.3%) and supervision of other staff (9.3% v 4.1%). These five areas changed significantly (p = 0.005 by paired t test).
CONCLUSIONS: The doctor's assistant may have a role in reprofiling the workload of senior doctors in A&E departments in the UK. They may also have a role in reducing the pressure on junior doctors, though this effect was not evaluated."

METHODS: A telephone survey of 30 A&E departments was conducted to determine current tissue harvesting practices from NHBDs. The potential number of tissue donors in our own medium sized district general hospital A&E department was estimated. Senior nursing staff were asked to complete a questionnaire to establish their knowledge, attitudes, and experience of tissue harvesting from NHBDs.
RESULTS: Only seven of the 30 A&E departments surveyed (23%) had an active involvement in requesting tissue donation after a sudden death. Several others had limited experience. The level of involvement was unrelated to department size. In our own A&E department, there were 110 deaths in 1995. Tissue donation had occurred on just three occasions. However, departmental staff attitudes towards reducing this shortfall were positive.
CONCLUSIONS: The A&E department is a resource of tissues for donation, which is currently under used."

DESIGN: The process of retrospective case note audit was used to identify areas of poor performance, reiterate national guidelines, introduce a post-sedation advice sheet, and demonstrate improvement.
SETTING: Emergency Department, Musgrove Park Hospital, Taunton.
SUBJECTS: Forty seven patients requiring sedation for relocation of a dislocated shoulder or manipulation of a Colles' fracture between July and October 1996 and July and October 1997.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Evidence that the following items had been documented: consent for procedure, risk assessment, monitored observations, prophylactic use of supplementary oxygen, and discharging patients with printed advice. Case note review was performed before (n = 23) and after (n = 24) the introduction of a sedation audit form. Notes were analysed for the above outcome measures. The monitored observations analysed included: pulse oximetry, respiratory rate, pulse rate, blood pressure, electrocardiography, and conscious level.
RESULTS: Use of the form significantly improved documentation of most parameters measured.
CONCLUSIONS: Introduction of the form, together with staff education, resulted in enhanced documentation of data and improved conformity with national guidelines. A risk management approach to preempting critical incidents following sedation, can be adopted in this area of emergency medicine."
10191841,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10191841/,"BACKGROUND: Respiratory symptoms are common in older adults. In young populations the predictive value of such symptoms for chronic airflow obstruction and bronchial hyperresponsiveness is low. We investigated whether symptoms predict airflow obstruction and bronchial responsiveness in adults aged 45-86 years.
METHODS: An age-stratified random sample of white adults aged 45 years and older was obtained from family doctor lists in Central Manchester, UK, and sent a respiratory symptoms questionnaire (exclusions: housebound, confused). Responders were invited to participate in a methacholine challenge (Newcastle dosimeter method; exclusions: ischemic heart disease, oral steroids, anticholinergic or beta-blocker medication).
RESULTS: Of 783 eligible subjects, 723 responded (response rate 92.3%). Symptoms were reported by 53.8%. Methacholine challenge was completed by 208 subjects. Sixty-five (26.4%) had chronic airflow obstruction, of whom 76.6% reported respiratory symptoms. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness (PD20 < or = 100 micrograms) was present in 26.0% of subjects overall, and in 36.8% of symptomatic and 14.6% of asymptomatic subjects (p < .001). Of those with bronchial hyperresponsiveness, 26.4% were asymptomatic. Predictive values of symptoms for chronic airflow obstruction and bronchial hyperresponsiveness were low.
CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory symptoms, chronic airflow obstruction, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness were all common in this adult population sample. However, the predictive value of symptoms for airflow obstruction/bronchial hyperresponsiveness was low. It was concluded that respiratory symptoms do not identify adults with airflow obstruction or bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Investigation by spirometry and peak flow monitoring is necessary to guide appropriate management."

Hypoglycemia was due to glucocorticoid deficiency secondary to ACTH insensitivity. Molecular biology showed a composite heterozygotism for the ACTH receptor gene.
CONCLUSION: Any congenital glucocorticoid deficiency should lead to search for cardiomyopathy."
10192124,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10192124/,"PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: The authors report their experience of Zadek's wedge osteotomy in the treatment of posterior talalgia in adults and evaluate the various radiographical measurements for calcaneus deformity measurement....
MATERIAL: This procedure was performed in 27 patients with a total of 36 calcanea treated between 1985 and 1996. The sex ratio was 20 women for 7 men with an average age of 27 years. Prior to this osteotomy nine feet were operated by resection of the postero-superior tuberosity with recurrence of pain and disability, and two patients presented an inflammatory arthritis.
METHOD: For the surgical procedure, the patient was placed in lateral position. Skin incision was five to six centimeters long, curvilinear along the lateral side of the tendo achillis. Two dorsal pins were inserted, creating a triangle so that the apex pointed plantarly and the base dorsally. The sagittal saw was then used to create a wedge osteotomy with a dorsal base of seven to ten millimeters. A screw was then driven across the osteotomy site for ultimate fixation.
RESULTS: Eighty per cent (29 osteotomies) of patients had been examined clinically and radiologically with a mean follow-up of 29 months. Considering pain, daily activity and discomfort with footwear, results were excellent in 12 cases, good in 10, fair in 5 and poor in two cases. No radiological criteria used for the diagnosis of Haglund's disease were absolutely reliable. The ""total angle"" of Ruch, the ""c.l angle"" of Chauveaux and the ""parallel pitch lines"" of Heneghan reflect the amount of deformation most accurately, but especially, the calcaneal inclination angle was always increased (16 cases between 18 degrees and 30 degrees, 6 cases > 30 degrees). All patients had a weight-bearing calcaneal talus, either alone or in the context of posterior pes cavus.
CONCLUSION: This study confirms the responsibility of rearfoot morphostatic disorders in posterior talalgia and the goods results obtained by Zadek osteotomy."
10193032,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10193032/,"OBJECTIVE: Thyroid anaplastic carcinoma is associated with a very poor prognosis. The goal of this study was to determine whether an aggressive treatment is worthwhile.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Of 22 thyroid anaplastic carcinomas confirmed with immunohistochemistry, 17 were judged eligible for surgery. Total thyroidectomy was planned in all patients. Frozen section of the lower lateral lymph nodes was routinely performed and in case of involvement (n = 9), a modified radical neck dissection was carried out. Fractionated radiotherapy was started within 5 weeks following surgery: 6,000 cGy was delivered on the thyroid area and all involved areas while 4,500 cGy was delivered on the lymph nodes of the neck and of the superior mediastinum when non involved.
RESULTS: The three patients without distant metastasis, with thyroid removal considered as complete, were still free of disease 10, 12 and 13 years later. One of these patients had been initially considered inoperable and was operated later when a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy obtained a decrease of the tumor. All other patients, 13 with incomplete removal and one with pulmonary metastasis died from their cancer; the median of the survival was 7 months.
CONCLUSION: When anaplastic carcinoma is suspected on clinical appearance, the diagnosis should be rapidly confirmed with percutaneous biopsy and immunohistochemistry. If a lymphoma is found, surgery is not indicated. Our results demonstrate that except for widely infiltrating tumors or distant metastasis, a complete removal of the tumor should be attempted as soon as possible. Surgery should be followed with hyperfractionated radiotherapy. Multimodal therapy may result in long-term survival. A patient free of disease at 5 years may be considered as definitively cured."
10193172,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10193172/,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Little is known about the differences between children and adults in the results of head-up tilt test. This study sought to investigate the potential differences concerning: a) the clinical profile and circumstances of spontaneous syncope; b) the overall diagnostic performance of the test, and c) the type of positive response obtained.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We studied 31 children and 123 adults with unexplained syncope. If baseline test (tilting at 70 degrees for 30 min) resulted negative, it was repeated under isoprenaline low-dose infusion.
RESULTS: There were no differences in either clinical profile, except for severe traumatism more frequent in adults (25% vs. 3% in children; p < 0.05), or overall diagnostic performance (39% in children vs. 33% in adults; p = NS). However, the way the test rendered positive (via basal tilting in 92% of children vs. 50% in adults; p < 0.05) and the rate of cardioinhibitory response (42% in children vs 8% in adults; p < 0.01) were significantly different.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study children, in contrast to adults, rarely have a positive response in tilting under isoprenaline infusion. They also present a much higher rate of cardio-inhibitory response than adults."
10193550,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10193550/,"OBJECTIVE: Transcapillary heat transfer after injections of cold saline into the right atrium generates bronchial thermodilution curves resembling those observed in the aorta. Under the assumption that no indicator is lost or gained within the pulmonary capillary bed and changes in blood temperature are instantaneously recorded in the bronchial system, we tested the hypothesis that flow rates calculated from bronchial temperature-time curves are similar to those from aortic curves.
DESIGN: Comparative study of two cardiac output estimates in five dogs.
SETTING: Research laboratory for Experimental Anaesthesiology.
INTERVENTIONS: Cardiac output was decreased (repeated withdrawal of blood) and increased (infusion of colloids or dobutamine) in order to study a wide range of cardiac outputs.
MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Thermistors were placed in a bronchiole (wedge position) and in the ascending aorta of anaesthetized dogs. Bronchial and aortic thermodilution curves were recorded after injection of 5 ml ice-cold saline into the right atrium. We found that bronchial thermodilution yields flow estimates similar to those from aortic curves. Correlation between the two flow estimates was acceptable (r = 0.84) with a mean difference between the two of less than 2%.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that the Stewart-Hamilton equation may be extended to bronchial temperature-time curves for estimations of cardiac output. At this time, however, we do not advocate bronchial thermistors as suitable and less invasive alternatives to pulmonary arterial catheters for routine cardiac output measurements in patients."
10193812,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10193812/,"BACKGROUND: Recent reports describe that erythropoietin (Epo) is produced by peritubular interstitial fibroblast-like cells in response to a hypoxic stimulus. We studied serum Epo levels as a possible marker of tubulointerstitial damage in the progression of IgA nephropathy (IgAN), in comparison with urinary (u-) levels of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), which is mainly derived from proximal tubular cells and is used as a marker of tubular damage.
METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with IgA nephropathy (IgAN) with relatively preserved renal function (serum creatinine: sCr, 0.5-2.2 mg/dl) were examined. The severity of glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis of the renal biopsy tissue was expressed by semiquantitative grading scores. Clinical parameters including serum creatinine (sCr), blood pressures, and 24-h proteinuria levels were obtained at the renal biopsy. Epo was measured by a radioimmunoassay (RIA) of sera obtained in the morning and u-NAG was measured by colorimetric method of 24-h urine samples.
RESULTS: The mean Epo level of the patients (17.7+/-6.3 mU/ml) was not different from the control level (19.3+/-3.7 mU/ml). There were no significant correlations between Epo levels and red blood cell (RBC) counts, haematocrit (Hct), or haemoglobin (Hb) levels. The mean u-NAG level of the patients (6.7+/-6.2 U/gCr) was significantly higher than the control level (1.9+/-0.5 U/gCr). There was an inverse quantitative correlation between Epo and u-NAG levels in the patients (P<0.02). The u-NAG levels showed quantitative positive correlations with sCr (P<0.001), u-proteins (P<0.001), systolic (SBP) (P<0.001), and diastolic blood pressures (DBP) (P<0.05). Conversely, Epo levels were inversely correlated with sCr, SBP and DBP (each P<0.05). The patients with higher u-proteins (>2.0 g/day) showed significantly decreased Epo levels (P<0.05) than those with lower u-proteins (<2.0 g/day). The both scores of glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis were positively correlated with the u-NAG levels (each P<0.001), but were not correlated with the Epo levels.
CONCLUSIONS: The significant correlation between u-NAG and serum Epo levels suggests that tubular damage and interstitial cell dysfunction are associated each other in the progression of IgAN. Serum Epo levels bearing inverse correlations with sCr, blood pressure levels and heavy proteinuria seem to reflect clinical severity of IgAN, whereas u-NAG can be more useful progression marker of IgAN bearing correlations with both clinical and histological findings."
10193839,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10193839/,"BACKGROUND: Between January 1996 and April 1998, 17 chronic haemodialysed patients underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Two of them simultaneously had valve replacement.
METHODS: Except for two cases in which CABG was performed in an emergency, 15 patients (CRF group) received 3 consecutive days of haemodialysis in the preoperative period, intraoperative haemodialysis connected to cardiac pulmonary bypass (CPB) and continuous hemodiafiltration in the early postoperative period. The perioperative clinical parameters of the CRF group were compared with those of 17 age-matched patients with normal renal function undergoing CABG as the control (NRF group).
RESULTS: When the perioperative variables were compared, no significant differences were seen in total operation time and CPB time, but we noted significant increases in the mean volume of transfused blood in the 6 perioperative days, postoperative intubation time, postoperative fasting time, and time spent in the intensive care unit. Levels of central venous pressure, systolic blood pressure, respiratory index (PaO2/FiO2) and daily fluid balance of the CRF group were the same as the control group in the early postoperative period. In addition, the levels of serum creatinine, urea nitrogen, potassium and hematocrit of CRF group remained almost constant in the early postoperative period. After all, the hospital morbidity of the CRF group was not more serious than that of the NRF group, and hospital mortality of the CRF and NRF groups was 0%.
CONCLUSIONS: Our intensive perioperative dialysis programme could successfully manage the perioperative clinical course of haemodialysed patients undergoing CABG."
10193879,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10193879/,"OBJECTIVES: This present study describes weight control strategies used by a heterogeneous sample of US adults and their associations with weight and behaviour change over time.
DESIGN: A prospective cohort study.
PARTICIPANTS: Participants for this study were 1120 US adults recruited from the community who enrolled in a three-year intervention study to examine methods for preventing age-related weight gain.
MEASURES: Measured body weight and self-reported behaviours related to body weight (dieting practices, dietary intake and physical activity) were completed annually for four years.
RESULTS: Over 70% reported using each of the following dieting strategies at least once in four years: increase exercise (82.2%); decrease fat intake (78.7%); reduce food amount (78.2%); and reduce calories (73.2%). Cumulative duration of use of these behaviours was brief (for example, even the most common behaviours were used only 20% of the time). Global reports of dieting were not predictive of weight change over time. However, a dose-response relationship was observed between reported duration of use of several specific weight loss strategies over the four years and change in behaviours and weight gain.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that public health recommendations for weight control may need to place greater emphasis on persistence of weight control behaviours."
10193964,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10193964/,"BACKGROUND: Histologic studies indicate that C&D fails to mechanically remove all the tumor in a percentage of cases that far exceeds the 5-year recurrence rate. This raises the question that if C&D does not mechanically remove the tumor in a significant number of patients, why don't we observe tumor recurrence in most of these patients? Our previous study indicates that inflammation occurring over 1 month following C&D does not clear residual tumor. It may be some other process, requiring more time, that clears the residual tumor. Perhaps the proliferative or maturation phase of wound healing or, alternatively, a slow-acting process such as a low-grade immune response set in motion earlier, clears the residual tumor.
OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that wound healing and maturation following C&D clear residual tumor that has not mechanically removed by the procedure.
METHODS: The frequency of residual BCC detected histologically immediately following C&D was compared with the frequency 3 months after the C&D, an amount of time in which the maturation phase of wound healing is well under way.
RESULTS: Twenty-two of 29 primary BCC less than 1 cm in size were tumor-free immediately following the procedure (clearance rate 75.9%). Twelve primary BCC <1 cm were treated by C&D, allowed to heal for 3 months, and then excised and checked histologically. Ten of the twelve BCC were free of tumor, for a clearance rate of 83.3%, which is not a statistically significant difference (p = 0.7187).
CONCLUSION: By 3 months, the proliferative phase of wound healing is complete, and our study indicates that this phase has no effect on clearing the tumor. The maturation phase is well under way three months following C&D, and no statistically significant effect was observed."
10195030,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10195030/,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the predictive values for HIV infection of diagnosis of oral manifestations of the infection.
METHOD: Prevalence of oral manifestations was compared in cross sectional blinded clinical examinations of homosexual men attending a genitourinary medicine clinic. Data were extrapolated to populations in England and Wales based on estimates of the prevalence of HIV infection.
RESULTS: Data were analysed for 572 HIV infected and non-infected men (312 and 260 respectively). Positive predictive values for erythematous candidiasis, hairy leucoplakia and pseudomembranous candidiasis were greater than 0.96 at the genitourinary medicine clinic and are estimated to be greater than 0.72 among homosexual men in London.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinical diagnoses of mucosal lesions alone are poor predictors of HIV infection but are useful when used in conjunction with a social history to establish if there are risk factors for infection."
10195048,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10195048/,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of conducting a large randomised controlled trial (RCT) of peer led intervention in schools to reduce the risk of HIV/STD and promote sexual health.
METHODS: Four secondary schools in Greater London were randomly assigned to receive peer led intervention (two experimental schools) or to act as control schools. In the experimental schools, trained volunteers aged 16-17 years (year 12) delivered the peer led intervention to 13-14 year old pupils (year 9). In the control schools, year 9 pupils received the usual teacher led sex education. Questionnaire data collected from year 9 pupils at baseline included views on the quality of sex education/intervention received, and knowledge and attitudes about HIV/AIDS and other sexual matters. Focus groups were also conducted with peer educators and year 9 pupils. Data on the process of delivering sex education/intervention and on attitudes to the RCT were collected for each of the schools. Analysis focused on the acceptability of a randomised trial to schools, parents, and pupils.
RESULTS: Nearly 500 parents were informed about the research and invited to examine the study questionnaire; only nine raised questions and only one pupil was withdrawn from the study. Questionnaire completion rates were around 90% in all schools. At baseline, the majority of year 9 pupils wanted more information about a wide range of sexual matters. Focus group work indicated considerable enthusiasm for peer led education, among peer educators and year 9 pupils. Class discipline was the most frequently noted problem with the delivery of the peer led intervention.
CONCLUSION: Evaluation of a peer led behavioural intervention through an RCT can be acceptable to schools, pupils, and parents and is feasible in practice. In general, pupils who received the peer led intervention responded more positively than those in control schools. A large RCT of the long term (5-7 year) effects of this novel intervention on sexual health outcomes is now under way."
10195664,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10195664/,"BACKGROUND: Several studies have used a simplified approach for the assessment of physical activity such as the frequency of exercise-induced sweating. In this study leisure-time physical activity has been assessed using this and another more detailed measure.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A sample of 4171 adults answered the Health Interview Survey of Barcelona in 1992. The respondents were classified into categories depending on participation in moderate and/or intense physical activity (> or =20 min) and also according to the frequency of exercise-induced sweating: 0, 1-2 and > or =3 times/week. Agreement between the two measures was calculated using the weighted Kappa (Kw) statistic with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Stratified analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Prevalence of physical activity > or =3 times/week was lower with the sweat question (12.5%) than with the questions about the frequency of performance of selected activities (19.6%). The physical activity patterns by age, gender and overweight were similar for the two measures, but differed by month of the year. Agreement was lower among the older age categories and was higher among males (Kw = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.57-0.62) than among females (Kw = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.46-0.50). Overall, the agreement was higher in the hotter months (Kw = 0.72 among males and 0.58 among females).
CONCLUSIONS: In the assessment of physical activity in the population by means of the sweat question there can be interference from other variables, apart from the intensity of the activity, which influence sweating during the exercise. Further assessments of the validity of exercise-induced sweating in representative samples of the general population would be useful."
10195717,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10195717/,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have demonstrated inadequate reimbursement for severely injured patients with a resultant negative economic impact for the trauma service and hospital. The purpose of this study was to assess the total cost of care for all injured patients discharged from the trauma service in fiscal year 1997, and to determine the proportion of costs for the most severely injured on total cost. In addition, we assessed the total service costs and the revenue for treatment of the most severely ill. The final result was the determination of the profit (loss) margin for the entire service.
STUDY DESIGN: All patients discharged from our Level I Trauma Center in fiscal year 1997 were included (n = 696). The population was then stratified into 2 subgroups using the Injury Severity Score (ISS). Patient grouping was facilitated by integration of the trauma registry with the hospital cost accounting system. The population was sub-divided into 2 distinct groups. Group A represented all patients with an ISS >15 (n = 192). Group B contained all patients with an ISS <15 (n = 504). Length of stay and mortality of each group was recorded. Cost of care was determined by the hospital cost accounting system TSI (Transition System Incorporated, Boston, MA), which is designed to generate cost center data on a cost per patient basis. Total costs were determined for the entire population and Groups A and B. The proportion of costs consumed by each group was then calculated. Reimbursement was determined by calculating expected payments for each patient. These calculations are based on previously agreed upon allowances from each insurer and are reconciled at the end of each fiscal year to ensure accuracy.
RESULTS: The average length of stay for the population and Groups A and B were 7.5, 9.8, and 6.7 days respectively. Mortality in each group was 9.7%, 19.3%, and 6%. Over 92% of the population sustained blunt mechanism injury and only 8% were penetrating. When controlled for length of stay, the profit margin for Group A is $1,242/day and for Group B is $519/day. Comparison of mean cost/patient between Group A and Group B was $35,727 versus $17,623, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Trauma centers can be profitable. Group A is responsible for 44% of the total service cost while accounting for only 28% of the discharges. Moreover, this group is responsible for 57% of the profit, and yields the greatest return. The ability to care for the sickest patients, while enormously costly, is essential to the economic viability of the trauma center and its future growth."

METHOD AND MATERIALS: Ten disposable and two reusable probe tips were tested. Three maximum light output readings for each tip were recorded with a radiometer. Heat generation at the probe tip was recorded, at 30-second intervals over a five-minute period, with a thermocouple probe placed under a 3-mm-thick glass slide. After light-activated ""compomer"" was placed in a sectional two-piece stainless steel mold and cured, depth of cure was evaluated using the scrape technique.
RESULTS: With respect to light output and depth of cure, there were no statistically significant differences between probe types, but the disposable probe generated significantly less heat.
CONCLUSION: The disposable probe performed clinically as well as an autoclavable counterpart with respect to light output, heat generation, and depth of cure."
10197288,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10197288/,"BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that frequent food intake is metabolically advantageous. We investigated whether meal frequency was associated with the development of peripheral arterial disease among smokers.
DESIGN: Hospital-based case-control study of smokers, recruited from outpatient clinics and inpatient wards at two London teaching hospitals.
METHODS: Two-hundred and ninety-one smokers, newly referred with peripheral arterial disease (cases) and 828 age- and sex-matched smokers without smoking-related disorders and with negative Rose questionnaire responses for intermittent claudication (controls) were recruited. All cases and controls completed a validated questionnaire concerning dietary habits. Odds ratios for peripheral arterial disease in association with several dietary variables were calculated, after adjustment for confounding variables.
RESULTS: After adjustment for age, sex, pack-years of smoking, diabetes, hypertension and body mass index, the odds ratio for peripheral arterial disease among those smokers eating between meals (grazing) compared with those who did not, was 0.54 (95% confidence interval 0.42-0.83; P < 0.001). Among cases and controls, grazing was also associated with significantly lower plasma cholesterol concentrations (median 5.67 mmol/l in grazers compared with 6.08 mmol/l in non-grazers; P < 0.001) in those with apparently similar overall fat intakes. Neither plasma lipoprotein (a) nor fibrinogen concentrations varied with meal frequency.
CONCLUSIONS: In smokers, grazing was associated with a reduced risk of developing symptomatic peripheral atherosclerosis. This is the first study to demonstrate the apparent benefits of grazing on a cardiovascular end-point."

OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the effect of tomato intake on plasma carotenoid concentrations and lymphocyte resistance to oxidative stress.
DESIGN: Ten healthy women (divided into 2 groups of 5 subjects each) ate a diet containing tomato puree (providing 16.5 mg lycopene) and a tomato-free diet for 21 d each in a crossover design. Before and after each diet period, plasma carotenoid concentrations and primary lymphocyte resistance to oxidative stress (evaluated by means of single-cell gel electrophoresis) were analyzed.
RESULTS: After the first 21-d experimental period, total plasma lycopene concentrations increased by 0.5 micromol/L (95% CI: 0.14, 0.87) in the group that consumed the tomato diet and decreased by 0.2 micromol/L (95% CI: -0.11, -0.30) in the group that consumed the tomato-free diet (P < 0.001). Tomato consumption also had an effect on cellular antioxidant capacity: lymphocyte DNA damage after ex vivo treatment with hydrogen peroxide decreased by 33% (95% CI: 0.8%, 61%; P < 0.05) and by 42% (95% CI: 5.1%, 78%; P < 0.05) in the 2 groups of subjects after consumption of the tomato diet.

10197651,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10197651/,"BACKGROUND: Only anecdotal reports about the results of combined resection of T4 lung tumors infiltrating the thoracic aorta exist.
METHODS: Seven patients (mean age, 57.5 years; range, 43 to 78 years) underwent a resection of the infiltrated segment of the thoracic aorta together with a left pneumonectomy (n = 6) or left upper lobectomy (n = 1). Five tumors were primary non-small cell lung carcinomas (T4N2 in 3 patients, T4N1 in 2), one was a metastasis of breast cancer, and one was rhabdomyosarcoma.
RESULTS: No patient died perioperatively. The 2 patients with rhabdomyosarcoma and metastasis of breast cancer died 2 and 7 months postoperatively. Of the 5 patients with bronchial carcinoma, 3 died after 17, 26, and 27 months as a result of distant metastasis. Two patients are alive after 14 and 50 months without evidence of disease recurrence. One-year, 2-year, and 4-year survival rates for patients with bronchial carcinoma were 100%, 75%, and 25%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Combined resection of the lung and thoracic aorta can be performed with low morbidity and mortality when offered to highly selected patients. Adequate local control of tumor can be achieved for N1 and single-level N2 non-small cell lung carcinomas, but not for tumors with other histologies."
10197671,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10197671/,"BACKGROUND: The incidence of mediastinitis after cardiac surgical intervention is reported to be between 0.15% and 5% and is a major cause of postoperative morbidity. A number of risk factors have been identified, most of which are not modifiable. It is our contention that this complication can be reduced to a minimum by the consistent application of good operative technique and postoperative management.
METHODS: We reviewed the records of all 9,771 patients who underwent cardiac surgical procedures between 1987 and 1997. All operations were performed using a common skin preparation, draping, and antibiotic prophylaxis. Cases of mediastinitis were defined according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria and were identified from three sources: medical records database, hospital infection control, and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons database. Risk factors were assessed using chi2 and Fisher's exact tests.
RESULTS: Of 24 patients identified as having deep sternal wound infection (incidence, 0.25%), 2 died (mortality rate, 8.3%), 18 required reoperation (75%), and only 4 needed pectoral muscle flaps. Statistical analysis revealed only the presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as a significant risk factor (p < 0.01). Other factors, including diabetes, renal failure, smoking, sex, age, reoperation, morbid obesity, and steroid use, were not significant. The use of internal mammary arteries (single or bilateral) was not associated with mediastinitis. Postoperative complications, including prolonged ventilation, inotropic support, and the need for blood products, were not significant risk factors. The patients who developed mediastinitis were more likely to be readmitted to the hospital (p < 0.005) and more likely to require reoperation (p < 0.005).
CONCLUSIONS: In a large patient series we found a low incidence of mediastinitis (0.25%) and an even lower incidence of required reoperation (0.19%). Except for the use of bone wax and the use of bilateral mammary arteries in diabetic patients, none of the previously identified risk factors are modifiable. We believe that with strict adherence to perioperative aseptic technique, attention to hemostasis, and precise sternal closure, a very low incidence of mediastinitis can be achieved."
10197675,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10197675/,"BACKGROUND: Repeat coronary artery bypass grafting is more difficult if the right ventricle is firmly attached to the inner table of the sternum. Closure of the pericardium at the time of the initial procedure may prevent attachment of the right ventricle to the sternum. This study attempts to identify the geometric effects of pericardial closure early after isolated coronary artery bypass grafting.
METHODS: Forty-two patients undergoing elective, isolated coronary artery bypass grafting were randomized into two groups: 20 patients underwent closure of the pericardium (Closure group) and the pericardium was left open in 22 patients (Open group). Radiopaque markers were attached to the anterior aspect of the right ventricular epicardium in both groups.
RESULTS: Postoperative chest roentgenograms revealed that the distance between the epicardial surface and the posterior table of the sternum was larger in the Closure group compared to the Open group at 1 week and 3 months postoperatively (p < 0.001). Cardiac index and stroke work index in the early postoperative period was lower in the Closure group compared to the Open group (p < 0.001) despite similar filling pressures.
CONCLUSIONS: Pericardial closure may reduce the risk of myocardial injury during sternotomy for repeat coronary artery bypass grafting by preventing right ventricular adhesions. However, adverse hemodynamic effects in the early postoperative period may preclude pericardial closure in patients with impaired ventricular function."
10197840,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10197840/,"OBJECTIVES: The presence of metastatic lesions is the only acceptable fact to confirm malignant pheochromocytoma. Patients with malignant pheochromocytomas, however, have a very poor survival rate. The aim of our study was to postulate predictive values for malignant pheochromocytomas.
METHODS: We evaluated symptoms, diagnostic modalities, treatment, and long-term follow-up of 86 patients with 85 benign and 10 malignant pheochromocytomas. Parameters from the benign were compared with those of the malignant pheochromocytomas.
RESULTS: Preoperative 24-hour urinary dopamine was in the normal range for benign pheochromocytomas but increased in malignant pheochromocytomas (P<0.0001). Vanillylmandelic acid was elevated in both benign and malignant pheochromocytomas but higher in malignant than in benign tumors (P = 0.01). No differences could be shown in urinary epinephrine and norepinephrine samplings. Tumor location was divided into 77 adrenal (81%) and 18 extra-adrenal (19%) sites. Malignant pheochromocytomas were located more often at extra-adrenal sites (P = 0.03). There was no increased incidence of malignancy in patients with familial bilateral pheochromocytomas or multiple endocrine neoplasia. Tumors greater than 80 g in weight corresponded to malignancy (P<0.0001). Dopamine tumor concentration was higher in malignant than in benign pheochromocytomas (P = 0.01). Persistent arterial hypertension occurred in 9 (13%) of 72 benign and 6 (60%) of 10 malignant pheochromocytomas (P = 0.001). The 10-year survival rate was 94% for benign pheochromocytomas. All patients with malignant pheochromocytomas died within this period (P = 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: High preoperative 24-hour urinary dopamine levels, extra-adrenal tumor location, high tumor weight, elevated tumor dopamine concentration, and postoperative persistent arterial hypertension are all factors that increase the likelihood of malignant pheochromocytoma. Patients with these characteristics should have more frequent follow-up evaluations to identify malignancy at earlier states."

Testosterone is converted by 5-alpha-reductase to the more potent dihydrotestosterone, which is the primary androgen in the prostate. Leuprolide is a stronger antiandrogen that is used to downstage prostate cancer before radical prostatectomy. Leuprolide induces marked atrophy of prostate carcinoma cells, which sometimes makes pathologic diagnosis of cancer difficult, although evaluation at radical prostatectomy is easier than at biopsy. It is unknown whether finasteride produces similar changes, which would result in greater diagnostic difficulty because such changes would be seen on biopsy to rule out cancer in men with suspicious clinical findings treated for BPH. The current study investigated the histologic effects of finasteride therapy on human prostate cancer and benign prostatic tissue on needle biopsy.
METHODS: In blinded manner, we reviewed 53 needle biopsy specimens showing prostate carcinoma (35 treated with finasteride, 18 with placebo). Also reviewed in blinded manner were 50 benign needle biopsy specimens (25 treated with finasteride, 25 with placebo). The Gleason score, number of cores involved, percentage cancer involvement in a core, percentage of atrophic changes in cancer cells, presence of mitoses, blue-tinged mucinous secretions, prominent nucleoli, and high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia were documented for each case in the cancer group. The percentage of atrophy, basal cell hyperplasia, transitional metaplasia, chronic inflammation, and stromal proliferation was documented for each case in the benign group.
RESULTS: No significant histologic differences were present in either the benign or cancer group between cases treated with finasteride and placebo.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that finasteride treatment for BPH does not cause difficulty in the diagnosis of cancer in prostate needle specimens. It is possible that there are severely atrophic areas resulting from finasteride treatment that are undersampled. However, the conclusion that cancer seen on needle biopsy in men treated with finasteride is unaltered and readily identified as cancer remains valid."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and seventy pediatric patients with S-W were found from a register of 39,322 consecutive EEGs performed in an EEG laboratory dedicated to general clinical practice. Patients that only suffered febrile seizures were not considered epileptic.
RESULTS: Of the 170 patients, 154 (90.6%) were epileptic and 16 (9.4%) were not. Mean follow-up was 4.5 years. Twelve of the 16 non-epileptic children with S-W suffered febrile seizures.
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of S-W in EEGs is uncommon. Almost 10% of the children with S-W were not epileptic patients and none of them suffered from epilepsy during the follow-up period. Performance of an EEG on a child without epilepsy, especially those with febrile seizures, can be a factor of confusion."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of scoliosis screening of patients with a positive test was performed. The screening was performed in children between 10 and 15 years by visual inspection of the back and the Adams forward-bending test.
RESULTS: In 31.6% of the children, the screening test detected the presence of abnormal findings on initial physical examination. 19% of the total population was sent to a traumatology service. In 11% the diagnosis was confirmed (16 scoliosis, 12 of them idiopathic and 4 due to other conditions), PPV: 58%. In 8% of the adolescents exercise was recommended. In 1.2% braces were recommended. There were no differences in prevalence between sex, but the height of the children with scoliosis was greater (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Because of the potential severe adverse effects and because the studies of the efficacy of the screening are not reliable, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, Canadian Task Force and the Program de Actividades Preventivas y Promoción de la Salud have excluded the routine screening of the asymptomatic adolescent for idiopathic scoliosis."
10199222,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10199222/,"OBJECTIVE: Although non-ulcerative sexually transmitted diseases (STD) and bacterial vaginosis are implicated as cofactors in heterosexual HIV-1 transmission, the mechanisms have not been defined. Recent in vitro data suggest that interleukin (IL)-10 may increase susceptibility of macrophages to HIV-1 infection. Therefore, we performed this study to assess whether non-ulcerative STD are associated with detection of IL-10 in the female genital tract.
METHODS: Women with clinical pelvic inflammatory disease with or without cervicovaginal discharge were recruited from an STD clinic in Nairobi, Kenya. Endocervical and endometrial specimens were obtained for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis DNA detection, Trichonomas vaginalis culture, and CD4 and CD8 T-cell enumeration. Bacterial vaginosis was diagnosed by Gram stain. IL-10 was detected in endocervical specimens using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Blood was obtained for HIV-1 serology.
RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-two women were studied. N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis, bacterial vaginosis, and T. vaginalis were detected in 38 (21%), 17 (9%), 71 (43%), and 22 (12%) women, respectively. Cervical IL-10 was detected more often in women with N. gonorrhoeae [adjusted odds ratio (AOR), 3.4; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.4-8.4], C. trachomatis (AOR, 4.4; 95% CI, 1.2-15.6), and bacterial vaginosis (AOR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.4-6.9) than in women without these infections.
CONCLUSIONS: The association of non-ulcerative STD and bacterial vaginosis with increased frequency of IL-10 detection in endocervical secretions suggests a potential mechanism through which these infections may alter susceptibility to HIV-1 infection in women."
10199297,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10199297/,"BACKGROUND: A case of osteoblastoma localized at the pedicle of the 10th thoracic vertebra is presented.
CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient complained of nocturnal back pain not relieved by salycilates, a typical symptom of osteoblastoma. Bone scintigraphy showed a lower thoracic focus of increased osteoblastic activity; however, X-rays, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance images (MRI) were within normal limits, showing only obscure changes that were also noted in the rest of the spine. Repeat MRI with contrast revealed a focal enhancement. After pediculectomy, histopathologic examination confirmed the diagnosis of osteoblastoma. Fifteen months postoperatively, the patient is symptom-free.
CONCLUSION: Our case demonstrates that some cases of osteoblastoma may not have the classical radiological appearance. Although non-contrast computed tomography and T1-weighted MRI are mildly positive in some instances, osteoblastoma is best visualized on MRI with gadolinium. Like any other neoplasm, osteoblastoma should be detected and removed early, before it can cause structural bony changes."
10199308,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10199308/,"HYPOTHESIS: Uninjured skin contributes to the elevation in circulating levels of proinflammatory cytokines seen following severe injury.
DESIGN: Male C3H/HeN mice underwent trauma, trauma-hemorrhage and resuscitation, or closed long-bone fracture. Serum, skin, and liver samples were harvested at designated times after experimental treatment.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Levels of interleukin (IL) 1beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) were determined in serum and skin cultures at 1, 8, and 24 hours after trauma-hemorrhage. The RNA was isolated from liver and skin samples at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours from all 3 experimental groups, and gene expression of the cytokines was determined.
RESULTS: Remote (nontraumatized) skin from trauma-hemorrhage animals released significantly more IL-6 and TNF-alpha into culture supernatants at 1 and 24 hours and significantly more IL-1beta at 1, 8, and 24 hours than did skin from sham animals. Serum levels of all 3 cytokines were significantly elevated at 1 and 24 hours after trauma-hemorrhage relative to sham animals. Gene expression of all 3 cytokines was detected in skin and liver following trauma-hemorrhage. Furthermore, gene expression of all 3 cytokines was detected in uninjured skin after soft tissue trauma and closed long-bone fracture.
CONCLUSIONS: Proinflammatory cytokine gene expression is up-regulated in uninjured skin following trauma, trauma-hemorrhage, and long-bone fracture. This increase in gene expression correlates with increased cytokine production by cultured skin as well as increased circulating cytokine levels. These results suggest that uninjured skin may also contribute to the rise in circulating cytokine levels seen after injury."
10200750,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10200750/,"OBJECTIVE: The authors' goal was to determine whether improved outcomes from enhanced acute-phase (3-month) treatment for depression in primary care persisted.
METHOD: They conducted a 19-month follow-up assessment of 156 patients with major depression in the Collaborative Care intervention trials, which had found greater improvements in treatment adherence and depressive symptoms at 4 and 7 months for patients given enhanced acute-phase treatment than for patients given routine treatment in a primary care setting. Sixty-three of the 116 patients who completed the follow-up assessment had received enhanced treatment, and 53 had received routine treatment in primary care. The Inventory for Depressive Symptomatology and the Hopkins Symptom Checklist were used to measure depressive symptoms. Automated pharmacy data and self-reports were used to assess adherence to and adequacy of pharmacotherapy.
RESULTS: At 19 months, the patients who had received enhanced acute-phase treatment did not differ from those who had received routine primary care treatment in clinical outcomes or quality of pharmacotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Even though enhanced acute-phase treatment of depression in primary care resulted in better treatment adherence and better clinical outcomes at 4 and 7 months, these improvements failed to persist over the following year. Continued enhancement of depression treatment may be needed to ensure better long-term results."
10200808,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10200808/,"BACKGROUND: Although anti-pseudomonal antibiotics are routinely used in the treatment of acute respiratory exacerbations of adult cystic fibrosis (CF), the specific efficacy of such treatment remains uncertain, the mechanism of action of these agents is not fully understood, and the role of sputum susceptibility testing in clinical decision making is controversial.
AIMS: We investigated the relationship between susceptibility testing and clinical outcome in adult CF patients colonised with Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
METHODS: Sputum samples were collected before, during and after respiratory exacerbations from 31 admissions (17 patients). Sputum colony counts and MIC of P. aeruginosa were performed.
RESULTS: Sputum colony counts did not change significantly during or after intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy. Clinical outcome parameters (lung function, 12-minute walking distance, sputum weight and quality of life) were compared with susceptibility of P. aeruginosa colonies isolated at admission to the antibiotics used, and no correlation was evident. There was no evidence for the development of cross-resistance and there was no change in the proportion of mucoid colonies with therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: While this study has a small patient sample size, it highlights the inconsistency of the role of antipseudomonal drugs also shown in other similar studies. The presence of P. aeruginosa in sputum of acutely ill CF patients prompts us to prescribe i.v. antipseudomonal drugs. If this approach was valid, we would expect to find a reduction in sputum colony counts and improvement in clinical parameters with the use of antibiotics to which the organisms were sensitive. The fact that such a relationship cannot be consistently demonstrated in this and other studies suggests that the use of antipseudomonal therapy in these patients requires more critical bacteriological and clinical evaluation."
10200918,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10200918/,"PURPOSE: Four authoritative organizations (American Association of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Rehabilitation [AACVPR], the American College of Cardiology [ACC], the American College of Physicians [ACP], and the American Heart Association [AHA]) have risk stratification guidelines for supervised exercise in patients with cardiovascular disease. The ability of the guidelines to predict exercise complications is untested.
METHODS: A prospective sample was evaluated that included 239 patients enrolled for a total of 5720 patient exercise hours in a phase II supervised outpatient cardiac rehabilitation exercise program between December 1, 1992, and June 16, 1995, who had had preprogram stress testing and/or left ventricular ejection fraction determination. Complications during supervised exercise were measured.
RESULTS: Overall, 12 patients experienced complications during supervised exercise. None of the guidelines was predictive of complications (positive predictive values, 3-7%). Regression analyses demonstrated that current cigarette smoking was the only predictor of complications. There was reasonable correlation of patient risk stratification among the four guidelines (r = 0.19-0.47; P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Currently proposed exercise risk stratification guidelines are not predictive of complications during supervised exercise. Further work is needed before exercise risk stratification guidelines are used to adjudicate use of supervised services."
10201064,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10201064/,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: To compare the examination results of self-reported snoring and nonsnoring medical students
DESIGN: We studied the examination scores obtained by medical students answering a multiple-choice test forming part of their final examinations. The students were asked to classify themselves as ""nonsnorers,"" ""occasional snorers,"" or ""frequent snorers,"" and to state their age, sex, height and weight.
SETTING: University Hospital, Erlangen, Germany
PARTICIPANTS: 201 medical students (61% males/39% females; mean age 24.6 +/- 2.1 years; BMI 22.4 +/- 2.5 kg/m2) taking their final examinations in internal medicine.
MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Seventy-eight students (38.8%) claimed to be nonsnorers, 99 (49.3%) occasional snorers and 24 (11.9%) frequent snorers. The mean examination scores (adjusted for age, sex, and BMI) were 69.6 +/- 9.9% for the nonsnorers, 65.3 +/- 10.0% for the occasional snorers and 62.0 +/- 8.2% for the frequent snorers (p < 0.0001). 12.8% of the nonsnorers failed the exam, compared with 22.2% of the occasional snorers and 41.7% of the frequent snorers (p < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis showed an association between failing the exam and snoring (p = 0.013), but not between failure and age, BMI, or sex (relative risk for snorers adjusted for age, sex and BMI: 1.26; 95%--CI 1.01-1.57).
CONCLUSIONS: In medical students, snoring seems to be associated with an increased risk of failing exams in a dose-response manner, even after controlling for age, sex and BMI. For the present, the mechanisms underlying this association must remain a matter of speculation. Snoring-related sleep fragmentation (""upper airway resistance syndrome"") might be a causal factor."
10201336,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10201336/,"OBJECTIVE: It has recently been reported that a high peritoneal transport rate was associated with increased mortality in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. One possible explanation is that a high peritoneal transport rate might be caused by a state of chronic inflammation, which also per se might result in increased mortality. Therefore, in this study we investigated whether high peritoneal transport rate patients are in a state of chronic inflammation.
METHODS: The study included 39 clinically stable peritoneal dialysis patients (free of peritonitis) who had been on PD for more than 3 months (16.8+/-11.8 months). Seven patients were treated with continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD) and the others were on CAPD. A 4-hour standard peritoneal equilibration test (PET) using 2.27% glucose solution was performed in each patient. Dialysate samples at 4 hours and blood samples at 2 hours were measured for interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), tumor necrosis factor(alpha)(TNFalpha), C-reactive protein (CRP), and hyaluronan as markers of inflammation.
RESULTS: There was no significant correlation between dialysate/plasma (DIP) creatinine (0.82+/-0.15, range 0.51 - 1.15) and blood concentrations of IL-1beta (11.2 ng/L, range <5 - 65.9 ng/L),TNFalpha (12.1 ng/L, range <5 - 85.4 ng/L), CRP (<10 mg/L, range <10 - 76 mg/L), nor with the blood hyaluronan concentration (165 microg/L, range 55 - 955 microg/L). The dialysate concentrations of IL-1beta and TNFalpha were below the detectable level in most of the samples. Although dialysate hyaluronan concentration (334 microg/L, range 89 - 1100 microg/L) was correlated with D/P creatinine (r= 0.36, p< 0.05), there was no correlation between the total amount of hyaluronan in the effluent and D/P creatinine. However, a significant correlation was found between serum hyaluronan concentration and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (r = -0.49, p< 0.005); GFR also tended to be correlated with serum TNFalpha (r = -0.31, p = 0.058) but not with serum IL-1beta and serum CRP.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that a high peritoneal transport rate is not necessarily related to a state of chronic inflammation in CAPD patients. The high mortality rate observed in high transporters may relate to other issues, such as fluid balance or abnormal nutrition and metabolism, rather than to chronic inflammation."
10201460,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10201460/,"OBJECTIVES: Few studies have evaluated the ability of the endoscopist to predict the presence of Barrett's esophagus (BE) at index endoscopy. The goals of this study were to determine the operating characteristics of endoscopy in diagnosing BE, and to determine the clinical and endoscopic predictors of BE in suspected BE patients at the index endoscopy.
METHODS: From September 1993 to October 1997, endoscopic reports were examined to identify patients with suspected BE. All esophageal pathology reports during the same period were evaluated for the presence of specialized intestinal metaplasia.
RESULTS: During the study period, 4053 endoscopies were performed on 2393 patients. Eight percent of all procedures were performed for suspected or confirmed BE. Fifty-three patients were known to have BE and thus their reports were excluded from this analysis. Five hundred seventy of the remaining patients had esophageal biopsies performed, and were included in this analysis. Among these 570 patients, 146 were suspected to have BE on endoscopy, while 424 were not suspected to have BE at the time of endoscopy. There were no differences among the two groups in terms of gender, race, and dyspepsia as an indication for the endoscopy. However, suspected BE patients were slightly younger and were more likely to have heartburn, but were less likely to have dysphagia as an indication for the endoscopy. The sensitivity and specificity of the endoscopists' assessments were 82% (95% confidence interval [CI], 72-92) and 81% (95% CI, 78-84), respectively. The positive predictive value and the negative predictive value were 34% and 97%, respectively. The positive likelihood ratio was 4.32 (95% CI, 3.49-5.31) and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.22 (95% CI, 0.13-0.38). Univariate analysis showed that endoscopists diagnosed BE in those with long-segment BE (LSBE) more accurately than in those with short-segment BE (SSBE) (55% vs 25% p = 0.001; odds ratio [OR] = 3.63, 95% CI, 1.71-7.70). Barrett's esophagus was correctly diagnosed in 38.5% of white patients but in only 14.7% of black patients (p = 0.01; OR = 3.63, 95% CI, 1.31-10.13). Multivariable logistic regression identified only the length of the columnar-appearing segment (p = 0.002; OR = 3.33, 95% CI, 1.54-7.17) and race (p = 0.08; OR = 2.31, 95% CI, 0.88-6.03) to be associated with the presence of BE on biopsy.
CONCLUSIONS: Barrett's esophagus is frequently suspected at endoscopy; SSBE was more frequently suspected than LSBE, but was correctly diagnosed only 25% of the time, versus 55% for LSBE. Endoscopists diagnosed BE with a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 81%. However, the positive predictive value was only 34%, whereas the negative predictive value was 97%. The length of the columnar-appearing segment is the strongest predictor of BE at endoscopy. Alternative methods are needed to better identify BE patients endoscopically, especially those with SSBE."
10201631,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10201631/,"PURPOSE: To examine the frequency of metastasis to the eye and central nervous system (CNS) from ocular adnexal lymphomas and to evaluate whether CNS prophylaxis is appropriate for these tumors.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-one patients with biopsy-confirmed ocular adnexal lymphomas were evaluated between 1989 and 1995. The lymphomas were subclassified histopathologically according to the new Revised European-American Lymphoma (REAL) criteria. Molecular genetic analysis of tumor cell DNA was done by Southern blot. Patients had a complete ophthalmologic evaluation and metastatic work-up and were then routinely followed up by an ophthalmologist and a medical oncologist.
RESULTS: The 34 men and 37 women studied had a median age of 67 years (23 to 92). Ocular adnexal lymphomas were situated in the orbit in 54 patients, in the conjunctiva in 14 patients, and in the eyelid in 3 patients. Bilateral involvement occurred in 11 patients. The most common histologic diagnoses were (54 patients, 76%) extra-nodal marginal zone lymphomas and small lymphocytic lymphomas in 10 patients (14%). Molecular genetic analysis performed in all patients confirmed a monoclonal B-cell population in 55 patients (77%), including a single rearrangement of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene in 14 patients, and more than two rearrangements in 41 patients. No patients had isolated T-cell gene rearrangements. Localized ocular adnexal lymphoma was diagnosed in 43 patients (61%), 17 patients (24%) were found to have concurrent extraocular lymphoma on metastatic work-up and 11 patients (15%) had a previous diagnosis of systemic lymphoma before the onset of their ocular tumor. The median duration of follow-up was 20 months. Overall, 32 patients (45%) had tumors, which remained localized to the orbit adnexa. Eleven patients (15%) relapsed, but none had eye or central nervous system involvement nor required CNS-directed therapy. Although eight patients died, only two died as a direct result of systemic lymphoma. No patient received CNS prophylaxis with either intrathecal chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.
CONCLUSION: Ocular adnexal lymphomas are rare non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphomas. Metastatic involvement of the eye or central nervous system is rare and CNS prophylaxis with radiotherapy or chemotherapy is unnecessary."
10202063,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10202063/,"BACKGROUND: The intact gallbladder after endoscopic sphincterotomy is thought to be a potential risk factor for recurrent biliary complications. The aim of this non-randomized prospective study was to investigate whether cholecystectomy soon after endoscopic sphincterotomy could prevent the recurrence of biliary complications.
METHODS: From January 1991 to October 1995, 140 patients with intact gallbladder underwent endoscopic sphincterotomy for clearance of stones in the bile duct. Of the 140 patients, 46 underwent elective cholecystectomy soon after sphincterotomy (group A) and 94 did not (group B). All 140 patients had quantitative cholescintigraphy after normalization of liver function and were followed on a regular basis with liver biochemistry, sonography, and/or computed tomography. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography was also performed if a recurrent biliary problem was suspected.
RESULTS: After a median 43 months (range 23 to 80) of follow-up, 5 patients in group A developed bile duct stones whereas 12 patients in group B had recurrent stones; 4 patients in group A versus 6 patients in group B had recurrent biliary symptoms. One patient in group A and 5 patients in group B with recurrent biliary stones were without symptoms. In group B, the age, gender, diameter of the bile duct, preexisting cholelithiasis, abnormal filling of the gallbladder on quantitative cholescintigraphy, and presence of juxtapapillary diverticulum were not found to be the significant factors affecting the recurrence of biliary symptoms or stones. Endoscopic removal of recurrent biliary stones was successful in all patients. Three patients in group B underwent cholecystectomy after abatement of symptoms.
CONCLUSION: Elective cholecystectomy after endoscopic sphincterotomy does not reduce the incidence of recurrent biliary complications."

OBJECTIVES: To apply a nine-virus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) panel to postmortem specimens of lower airway secretions and compare the prevalence of viral nucleic acid among patients who died of asthma, asthmatic patients who died of other causes and persons who died without lung disease.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Postmortem specimens of lower airway secretions from patients who died of asthma (fatal asthma [n=10]), asthmatic patients who died of other causes (n=4) and nonasthma controls (n=6) underwent PCR for nine common respiratory viruses. The prevalence of each virus was compared among the three groups.
RESULTS: PCR was positive for at least one virus in 19 of 20 cases, and multiple viruses were detected in 14 of 20 cases. The prevalence of each virus was similar in the three groups studied.
CONCLUSIONS: In fatal asthma, lower airway secretions do not show a specific pattern of viral nucleic acid. Intriguingly, these results suggest that the lower respiratory tract may act as a potential reservoir for common respiratory viruses."
10203087,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10203087/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the likelihood of nonsentinel axillary metastasis in the presence of sentinel node metastasis from a primary breast carcinoma.
SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Sentinel lymphadenectomy is a highly accurate technique for identifying axillary metastasis from a primary breast carcinoma. Our group has shown that nonsentinel axillary lymph nodes are unlikely to contain tumor cells if the axillary sentinel node is tumor-free, but as yet no study has examined the risk of nonsentinel nodal involvement when the sentinel node contains tumor cells.
METHODS: Between 1991 and 1997, axillary lymphadenectomy was performed in 157 women with a tumor-involved sentinel node. Fifty-three axillae (33.5%) had at least one tumor-involved nonsentinel node. The authors analyzed the incidence of nonsentinel node involvement according to clinical and tumor characteristics.
RESULTS: Only two variables had a significant impact on the likelihood of nonsentinel node metastasis: the size of the sentinel node metastasis and the size of the primary tumor. The rate of nonsentinel node involvement was 7% when the sentinel node had a micrometastasis (< or =2 mm), compared with 55% when the sentinel node had a macrometastasis (>2 mm). In addition, the rate of nonsentinel node tumor involvement increased with the size of the primary tumor.
CONCLUSIONS: If a primary breast tumor is small and if sentinel node involvement is micrometastatic, then tumor cells are unlikely to be found in other axillary lymph nodes. This suggests that axillary lymph node dissection may not be necessary in patients with sentinel node micrometastases from T1/T2 lesions, or in patients with sentinel node metastases from T1a lesions."

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
SETTING: A community survey in 37 randomly selected parishes.
SUBJECTS: A random sample of French community dwellers aged 65 and older included in the PAQUID study followed-up at 3 (1582 subjects) and 5 years (1283 subjects).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of dementia at 3 and 5 years, diagnosed by two-step screening: (1) MMS and DSM-III-R; (2) diagnosis of dementia confirmed by a neurologist.
RESULTS: A score summing up the number of dependencies at baseline on four IADLs is a predictor of 3-year but not of 5-year incident dementia. Increase in the level of dependence between baseline and 3-year follow-up is associated with an increased risk of incident dementia at 5-year follow-up.
CONCLUSION: These four IADLs can help to identify older subjects at high risk of dementia who should then undergo neuropsychological testing."
10203304,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10203304/,"BACKGROUND: The study was an audit of patients who attended the Menstrual Disorders Clinic at Glasgow Royal Infirmary over a five year period, and received gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analog (GnRHa). We aimed to identify the clinical indications for the use of GnRHa, and the effect of the latter in terms of symptom resolution and ultimate outcome. We aim to use this information to formulate a strategy for the use of GnRHa by targeting this expensive therapy to those situations where maximum benefit will be achieved.
METHODS: A retrospective case review analysis of 201 patients.
RESULTS: Thirty-eight percent of women presented with pelvic pain, 33% with disordered menstruation and 26% with premenstrual symptomatology. Overall, 74% of patients reported a beneficial effect of GnRHa. In the non-cyclical pelvic pain group, those patients with adhesions constituted a much greater proportion of those who did not derive benefit from GnRHa than those who did (43% vs. 16%; p<0.05; data not shown). In those patients with disordered menses, there was no difference between the diagnosis in those who did or did not derive benefit from GnRHa. Also with the exception of endometrial preparation prior to ablation and in the correction of anemia, the ultimate outcome was no different in the two groups. Of the patients with premenstrual symptomatology, the greatest proportion of those deriving benefit from GnRHa (41%) ultimately had an operative resolution.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results enable us to use GnRHa as a first line in those clinical situations where maximum benefit will be achieved, either in terms of symptom resolution or as a tool to identify the most appropriate therapeutic option. We can therefore rationalize our prescribing both to the benefit of the patient and to our budget."
10204555,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10204555/,"BACKGROUND: Third-year medical students' complaints focus on the number of hours worked and subsequent lack of study time among three general surgery blocks. We hypothesize that this difference between the surgical blocks does not adversely influence student examination scores.
METHODS: Student scores for the academic years 1996-97 to 1997-98 for the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) surgery subtests were compiled. A comparison of two ""slow"" general surgery blocks (B/C) with one ""busy"" block (A) was made using a two-tailed t test. A multiple regression analysis was also employed. Finally, United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) part I scores were used to determine equivalency of groups.
RESULTS: No significant difference existed between block A and blocks B/C in USMLE part I and NBME (P = 0.35 and 0.16 respectively). However, USMLE and rotation sequence influenced NBME scores (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The data suggest that no difference exists in examination scores between students assigned to a busy general surgery block versus those students assigned to slow blocks."

METHODS: A representative sample of the German population (N=2201) completed a questionnaire that included, in addition to the criterion (number of physician visits in the past 12 months), items aimed at identifying the target group and questions about physical symptoms, illness behavior, living situation, personality features, and sociodemographic status (a total of 31 predictors).
RESULTS: Individuals with functional gastrointestinal disorders who consulted a physician for their gastrointestinal disorders and those who did not differed significantly, especially on psychological measures. The differences between these individuals and the general population were greater for the consulters than for the nonconsulters. Multiple regression analyses yielded nine predictors that explained 40.2% of the variance of the criterion. The best predictors of frequency of physician consultations were the duration of periods with symptoms and psychological factors, such as the severity of depression and the patients' views on the cause of their illness.
CONCLUSIONS: The psychopathology seen in people with functional gastrointestinal disorders is of two types: one is a characteristic of the illness itself and the other leads the individual to consult a physician. When gastroenterologists see patients with such disorders, they can assume that they may be dealing with a self-selected group of individuals with psychological stress. Psychological assessment would, therefore, be useful to determine whether a given individual with FGD might benefit from psychotherapy."

DESIGN: An observational prospective study in which infertility cases were treated with laparoscopic surgery was followed up (mean 11 months), either by treatment (ovulation induction) or no further treatment (expectant management) and the outcomes recorded. In both groups pregnancies were compared by Cox's regression survival model.
SETTING: Gazi University Hospital, Department of Obstetric and Gynecology, Ankara, Turkey.
PATIENTS: Infertile women with different stages of endometriosis who were treated by laparoscopic surgery, with a mean duration of infertility of 80.7 (+/-50 [SD]) months.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients were treated by cauterization of the foci, adhesiolysis, endometrioma stripping, and distal tubal reconstruction according to their lesions. Postoperatively, patients had either ovulation induction (clomiphene, hMG) therapy or no further treatment.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Cumulative pregnancy rate of infertile women after laparoscopic treatment of endometriosis with or without ovulation induction.
RESULTS: A total of 36 out of 128 patients became pregnant after laparoscopy, with a 34% cumulative pregnancy rate. In the ovulation induction group, relative risk (chance) of pregnancy was 1.42 (1.02-2.05, 95 % CI) when the duration of infertility was less than 5 years. In this lower risk group, the overall cumulative pregnancy rate was 46%--56% and 27% for the ovulation induction and expectant management groups, respectively. In the expectant management group, per cycle fecundity was 0.021, whereas it was 0.066 and 0.174 (p = 0.001) in the clomiphene citrate- and hMG-treated patients, respectively. Expectant management significantly increased the likelihood of pregnancy compared to ovulation induction in previous pregnancy, stage 1 or 2 endometriosis, and no male infertility groups (p = 0.04-0.009).
CONCLUSION: After laparoscopic treatment of endometriosis, ovulation induction has a positive effect only if done with hMG and the duration of infertility was less than 5 years (P<.05)."
10206565,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10206565/,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of gender and a set of pain characteristics on the threat or challenge appraisal of pain and the impact of these appraisals on the coping strategies used to manage the pain.
DESIGN: This study used a community telephone survey to examine these relationships for a troublesome pain experienced by respondents in the 2 weeks preceding the interview. STUDY RESPONDENTS: The sampling frame consisted of 1,430 households randomly selected from the Halifax-Dartmouth-Bedford community. Of the 390 respondents with a troublesome pain in the 2 weeks preceding the interview, 309 respondents agreed to participate (79% response rate).
RESULTS: Women tended to report more pain located in the head and more somatic problems. They reported significantly more intense pain. For women and men, the most important impact on threat appraisal of pain was overall interference of pain and emotional upset due to pain. These two variables accounted for 48% of the variance in threat appraisal for women and 37% of the variance for men. There was no gender difference in emotional upset due to pain or in the impact of emotional upset on threat appraisal. There was no gender difference in challenge appraisal. Threat appraisal was associated with increased catastrophizing whereas challenge appraisal was associated with positive self-statements. Women reported significantly more problem solving, social support, positive self-statements, and palliative behaviors than did men.
CONCLUSIONS: Interference of pain has a greater impact on threat appraisal of pain for women. Increasing threat appraisal is associated with health care utilization for women, but women's more frequent use of several coping strategies is unrelated to their appraisal of pain. Appraisal of pain may have important implications on coping and overall well-being of women and men."
10206606,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10206606/,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of cognitive status at admission on functional gain during rehabilitation of elderly hip-fractured patients.
DESIGN: Cohort study.
SETTING: A hospital geriatric rehabilitation department.
PATIENTS: Two hundred twenty-four elderly patients admitted consecutively for rehabilitation after surgery for hip fracture.
MEASUREMENTS: Cognitive status was assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination and the cognitive subscale of the Functional Independence Measure (cognFIM); functional status was assessed by the motor subscale of FIM; absolute functional gain was determined by the motor FIM gain (deltamotFIM); and relative functional gain (based on the potential for improvement) by the Montebello rehabilitation factor score (MRFS).
RESULTS: A significant increase in FIM scores (19.7) occurred during rehabilitation, mainly due to motor functioning (19.1). When the relative functional gain (as measured by both motor MRFS efficacy [r = .591] and efficiency [r = .376] was compared with the absolute gain (as measured by deltamotFIM [r = .304]), a stronger association between cognFIM and the relative measures was found. In addition, motor FIM efficacy and efficiency were significantly lower in the cognitively impaired patients (p<.01). A better rehabilitation outcome was seen in patients with higher admission cognitive status, adjusting for the effects of age, sex, length of stay, and type of fracture (odds ratio = 2.2, 95% confidence interval 1.5-3.7).
CONCLUSIONS: Impaired cognitive status at admission lowered the rehabilitation outcome of elderly hip fracture patients. Cognitive impairment was strongly and directly associated with functional gain in these patients. Absolute motor gain appeared to be independent of cognitive status, whereas the relative motor gain depended on it. These findings support the implementation of comprehensive rehabilitation for selected cognitively impaired elderly hip fracture patients."
10206930,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10206930/,"BACKGROUND: The study examines the residual impairment of performance due to alcohol on the descending limb of the blood alcohol curve. The occurrence of residual impairment at low or zero levels of blood alcohol is well established but its cause is uncertain. It is hypothesized that residual impairment may be due in part to the methodological procedure of repeated performance testing in the post-ingestion period.
METHODS: There were 80 volunteers randomly allocated to one of four treatment conditions: a) alcohol and repeated performance (A-R) where psychomotor tasks were performed at 20-min interval for 2 h post ingestion; b) alcohol and double performance (A-D) where tasks were performed only at 1 h and 2 h from ingestion; c) placebo and repeated performance (P-R); and d) placebo and double performance (P-D). Alcohol was administered as vodka to achieve a peak blood-alcohol concentration (BAC) of approximately 80 mg per 100 ml. Performance effects were assessed by a dual task of primary pursuit tracking and secondary visual reaction time, and a visual sustained attention task.
RESULTS: Alcohol caused significant impairment of secondary reaction time, the effect being greatest at peak BAC. Sustained attention was also impaired by alcohol but the effect just missed significance. Repeated performance conditions were associated with significantly greater impairment of secondary reaction time and sustained attention when compared with double performance conditions. The factor of performance condition did not, however, interact with that of alcohol.
CONCLUSIONS: The monotony and boredom that may be associated with repeated performance do not contribute to residual alcohol impairment."
10207235,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10207235/,"BACKGROUND: Kuzmak developed a horizontal gastroplasty for morbid obesity using his adjustable silicone gastric banding (ASGB). The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency at weight loss, early and late morbidity and mortality.
METHOD: The records of 44 patients (mean age 36 years) were reviewed. The indication for ASGB was a BMI >40 (group A = 37 patients) or a BMI between 35 and 40 with obesity-related morbidity (group B = 7 patients). The mean preoperative BMI was 44 (+/-5). The paired t test was used to evaluate the BMI.
RESULTS: Early complications occurred in 5 patients: splenic injury (n = 1), aspiration pneumonia (n = 1), wound infection (n = 1), gastric perforation (n = 2); mortality was 2%. Late complications occurred in 19 patients: 17 patients (39%) had a functional stenosis with pouch dilatation (FSPD) and 6 patients had an injection port leakage (14%). At the 1-year follow-up, the mean BMI (of the 39 patients available) was 30 (+/-5) and remained stable. At 36 months, 54% of group A and 100% of group B had a BMI <30.
CONCLUSION: The original technique of Kuzmak is effective to lose weight. However the technique must be adjusted in order to decrease the unacceptable high incidence of FSPD."
10207550,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10207550/,"OBJECTIVE: To compare three possible therapeutic strategies for the treatment of patients with an intermediate risk of HIV disease progression.
DESIGN: Mathematical modeling based on assumptions derived from published data.
METHODS: A parametric survival model was fitted to empirical data to describe the survival trajectory of untreated individuals. It was assumed that successful treatment decreases the risk of disease progression curing the first year after its introduction by a constant that is dependent on the magnitude of the initial drop in HIV viral load. Thereafter, individual members of the treatment cohort follow different pathways, depending on the duration of the initial response or, in case of virologic failure, the response to a new drug regimen.
RESULTS: Sub-groups of patients starting therapy with two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) or two NRTI and a protease inhibitor had the highest instantaneous risk of disease progression at the end of the 5-year follow-up period. Patients who started therapy with two NRTI and a non-NRTI had the lowest likelihood of progression to AIDS or death at 5 years of follow-up. This is because, in the case of the subgroup whose initial treatment included a protease inhibitor, failure rates due to non-adherence to therapy are high and response to salvage therapy is limited by past protease inhibitor experience.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the superior virologic potency of the protease inhibitor-containing regimens, in this analysis other strategies performed equally well or even better. In the absence of solid empirical data and until the advent of antiretroviral regimens that are shown to be safe, simple to take, and maximally suppress viral load, caution may be required in selecting the long-term therapy for patients with less advanced HIV disease."
10207553,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10207553/,"OBJECTIVE: Prophylactic zidovudine during pregnancy and labour reduces maternal viral load and, with neonatal therapy, has been shown to reduce vertical transmission. However, zidovudine may have additional effects. Advanced HIV disease is associated with premature delivery, which in turn results in increased vertical transmission. Data from the European Collaborative Study (ECS) were analysed to investigate whether zidovudine could be associated with decreased prematurity risk and/or with a reduced frequency of low birthweight.
METHODS: HIV-infected pregnant women enrolled in the ECS were followed prospectively according to a standard protocol. Gestational age was assessed by ultrasound, prematurity was defined as delivery before 37 weeks and the cut-off for low birthweight was 2500 g. We calculated odds ratios (OR) to estimate the effect of zidovudine on the risk of premature of low birthweight delivery.
RESULTS: In 2299 mothers, zidovudine taken to reduce the risk of vertical transmission decreased the odds of premature delivery by a quarter (OR = 0.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53-1.09), and the odds of low birthweight by nearly half (OR = 0.55, 95% CI 0.39-0.79). Allowing for CD4 count and mode of delivery did not greatly alter these OR values. A multivariate analysis suggested that prophylactic zidovudine and prematurity were independently associated with risk of transmission.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest an additional health benefit of zidovudine. Even if most vertical transmission occurs around the time of delivery, therapy earlier in pregnancy could have an indirect effect on transmission rates through delaying delivery. This hypothesis needs to be confirmed or refuted by more appropriate studies."
10208203,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10208203/,"BACKGROUND: The pathobiological characteristics of lung adenocarcinoma are still unclear. To identify the factors that may affect the survival of patients undergoing pulmonary resections for adenocarcinoma of the lung, univariate and multivariate analyses were performed for 17 variables of the host, histopathology, nuclear DNA content (NDC), and morphometry of nucleus (nuclear area [NA]) of tumor cells.
METHODS: Seventy-two consecutive patients who underwent resection at the National Cancer Center in Tokyo were studied. They consisted of 45 men and 27 women with an average age of 61.7 years (range, 27 to 83 years). For these patients, NDC and NA were prospectively measured by cytofluorometry and morphometry, respectively. For univariate analysis, 17 factors were studied, including age, sex, TNM stage, diameter of the tumor, pleural involvement, degree of differentiation, scar grade, nuclear atypia, mitotic index, histogram pattern of NDC, mean NDC, number of aneuploid stem cell lines, and mean and SD of NA. A multivariate analysis was performed with Cox's regression model for 16 variables.
RESULTS: In the univariate analysis, 12 factors were significantly related to postoperative survival, including TNM stage, diameter, pleural involvement, nuclear atypia, mitotic index, mean NA, mean NDC, number of aneuploid stem cell lines, and the DNA histogram pattern. In the multivariate analysis, M, T, and the histogram pattern of NDC were significantly associated with survival while N showed a strong, but not significant, association.
CONCLUSIONS: Multivariate analysis of histopathologic prognostic factors indicated that the TNM stage, as well as each component independently, still provided the greatest prognostic value in resected adenocarcinomas of the lung. Among other factors, only NDC significantly affected survival. The importance of NDC measurement should be stressed for predicting the survival after surgical resection more accurately and for selecting patients with a higher risk of recurrence."

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study with follow-up of 5 years for all patients.
PATIENTS: Three hundred two patients with advanced (stage II or IV) squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx were treated with curative intent with surgery and postoperative radiation therapy between January 1, 1970, and December 31, 1990.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Survival after recurrence of the index tumor or the development of a second head and neck primary tumor.
RESULTS: Overall actuarial 5-year survival was 56%. Relapse occurred in 119 patients, and salvage therapy was attempted in 49 patients. Only 2 patients survived to 5 years after relapse.
CONCLUSION: In patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, routine follow-up is more important for evaluation of treatment results and emotional support than of benefit in improving patient survival."

All subjects were explored with selected high-resolution CT scans. Studied parameters were age, exposure data, pulmonary function test results.
RESULTS: None of the exposure data or pulmonary function test results suggested with certainty the presence or absence of asbestos-related pleural and parenchymal lung disease. The studied parameters could not be used to select patients who could benefit from CT screening.

10209798,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10209798/,"STUDY DESIGN: The association between leg length discrepancy and the side of the radiating pain in lumbar disc herniation was investigated in a case series.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether pain tends to radiate into the longer or shorter leg in patients with a lumbar herniated disc.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: No previous studies have investigated the association between leg length discrepancy and side of radiating pain in patients with a herniated disc. Results of studies of low back pain with radiation and leg length discrepancy are inconsistent concerning this association.
METHODS: Of 132 consecutive patients admitted to a district hospital for surgical management of a lumbar herniated disc, leg length discrepancy was assessed using the indirect method as described by Calliet.
RESULTS: Seventy-three patients (55%) were men, and 59 (45%) were women. The mean age was 40 years, and 99% of all herniated discs appeared at L4-L5 (n = 60) or L5-S1 (n = 71). In 64 (62%) of the 104 patients with a leg length discrepancy of 1 mm or more, the pain radiated in the shorter leg (P = 0.02). In subgroups of patients with larger leg length discrepancies, similar results were found but because of smaller sample sizes, these findings did not each statistical significance. In 32 of the 57 men (56.1%), the pain radiated to the shorter leg (P = 0.43); this was observed in 33 of the 47 women (70.2%; P = 0.01).
CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed a statistically significant association between leg length discrepancy and the side of radiating pain in a case series of patients with lumbar herniated discs. The relation was more pronounced and statistically significant in women only."
10209800,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10209800/,"STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective analysis of back pain claim data from two sources, a workers' compensation provider and Washington State Department of Labor and Industries. The Workers' Compensation Provider claim data were examined over a 9-year period, 1987-1995, and the Washington claim data were examined over a 5-year period, 1991-1995. In addition, a third source of data, reports of back pain from the the Bureau of Labor Statistics, was examined over a 4-year period, 1992-1995.
OBJECTIVES: To characterize occupational low back pain trends in the United States. More specifically, trends in back pain rates and costs as well as back injury rates from the Bureau of Labor Statistics were discerned.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The literature often refers to a recent rise in occupational low back pain. However, the question is: Do empirical data support this notion?
METHODS: Retrospective analysis of workers' compensation provider, Washington State, and Bureau of Labor Statistics data.
RESULTS: The U.S. estimate of the annual low back pain claim rate decreased 34% between 1987 and 1995, although the trend was not monotonic. There was a sharper decrease in the U.S. estimate of the annual low back pain claim costs during this time (58%). In 1995, however, occupational low back pain remained a major problem in the U.S.: an estimated $8.8 billion was spent on low back pain claims, and the rate of filing low back pain claims was 1.8 per 100 workers.
CONCLUSIONS: Evidence of a rise in occupational low back pain was not discerned for the 8-year period studied. Data from three sources support this finding. However, occupational back pain remains a major problem in the U.S."
10209801,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10209801/,"STUDY DESIGN: Compressive loading of the lumbar spine was analyzed using electromyographic, movement analysis, and force-plate techniques.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the inertial forces that cannot be detected by electromyographic techniques alone.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Links between back pain and manual labor have stimulated attempts to measure spine compressive loading. However, direct measurements of intradiscal pressure are too invasive, and force plates too cumbersome for use in the workplace. Electromyographic techniques are noninvasive and portable, but ignore certain inertial forces.
METHODS: Eight men lifted boxes weighing 6.7 and 15.7 kg from the ground, while joint moments acting about L5-S1 were quantified 1) by using a linked-segment model to analyze data from Kistler force plates and a Vicon movement-analysis system, and 2) by measuring the electromyographic activity of the erector spinae muscles, correcting it for contraction speed and comparing it to moment generation during static contractions. The linked-segment model was used to calculate the ""axial thrust,"" defined as the component of the L5-S1 reaction force that acts along the axis of the spine and that is unrelated to trunk muscle activity or static body weight.
RESULTS: Peak extensor moments predicted by the two techniques were similar and equivalent to spinal compressive forces of 2.9-4.8 kN. The axial thrust ""hidden"" from the electromyographic technique was negligible during slow lifts, and remained below 4% of peak spinal compression even during fast heavy lifts. Peak axial thrust was proportional to the peak vertical ground reaction (R2 = 0.74).
CONCLUSIONS: Electromyographic techniques can measure dynamic spinal loading, but additional force-plate data would improve accuracy slightly during lifts requiring a vigorous upward thrust from the legs."
9009028,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9009028/,"OBJECTIVE: To examine primary noncompliance in patients suffering with asthma.
METHOD: A prospective matching of prescriptions written and then dispensed for patients with asthma. The subjects were patients who were given a general practitioner's prescription for asthma during a 3 month period (1993) in an isolated rural setting.
RESULTS: During the period of the study, participating GPs documented 359 prescriptions and of these only 251 (70%) were dispensed by the pharmacies. Primary noncompliance was therefore 30%. The relative risk (RR) of mild asthmatics not filling their prescriptions is 0.81 (95% CI; 0.771 < RR < 0.92) when compared to severe asthma. Compared to patients of high socioeconomic status; patients of low and medium socioeconomic status have decreased relative odds of filling their prescriptions, that is, RR = 0.84 (95% CI; 0.71 < RR < 1.00). Gender and age had no bearing on primary compliance.
CONCLUSIONS: Primary noncompliance is high in patients with asthma and is another factor contributing to morbidity. GPs should spend more time counselling patients on the need for treatment and not only its correct use. Patients with mild to moderate asthma and those in lower socioeconomic groups may need more intensive counselling."
9009937,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9009937/,"BACKGROUND: Glossopharyngeal nerve (GPN) blocks may provide reliable analgesia for awake direct laryngoscopy, although this has not been evaluated prospectively. This study was designed to determine if GPN blocks provide a superior route of local anesthetic administration for awake direct laryngoscopy as measured by hemodynamic, gag, and subjective pain responses.
METHODS: A prospective, randomized, single-blinded, crossover design was used. All participants (n = 11) were anesthesiologists. Three routes of local anesthetic administration were evaluated: 2 min of 2% viscous lidocaine swish and gargle (S&G); S&G combined with 10% lidocaine spray (S&G/spray); and S&G combined with 1% lidocaine bilateral GPN blocks (S&G/block; anterior tonsillar pillar method). Five minutes after the local anesthetic was administered, laryngoscopy was performed and sustained for 20 s. Noninvasive hemodynamic measurements and serum lidocaine concentrations were determined. Visual analogue scale scores and a poststudy questionnaire were used to assess participants' ability to tolerate local anesthetic administration and laryngoscopy and their choice for use in clinical practice.
RESULTS: No significant hemodynamic changes were observed, although there was a modest increase (< 15%) in heart rate in the S&G/block group in the first minute after laryngoscopy. Serum lidocaine concentrations were higher (P < 0.05) in the S&G/block group at 5 and 10 min (0.5 +/- 0.1 and 1.0 +/- 0.2 microgram/ml) compared with the S&G group. Participants' visual analogue scale scores, which assessed their ability to tolerate laryngoscopy, showed that S&G (5.4 +/- 0.9) resulted in more discomfort (P < 0.05) than either S&G/spray (3.5 +/- 0.9) or S&G/block (3.3 +/- 0.7). The laryngoscopist's visual analogue scale scores, which assessed the ease of visualization, revealed a trend (P < 0.08) toward less coughing and gagging with S&G/spray (1.8 +/- 0.9) compared with S&G (4.0 +/- 1.3) and S&G/block (3.7 +/- 1.1). Oropharyngeal discomfort lasting 24 h or more was reported by 91% of participants after S&G/block, whereas no participant reported oropharyngeal discomfort after S&G or S&G/spray. Significantly more participants (73%) indicated their preference for using S&G/spray in future clinical practice compared with S&G (P < 0.01) and S&G/block (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Glossopharyngeal nerve blocks do not provide a superior route of local anesthetic administration for awake direct laryngoscopy. Two minutes of 2% viscous lidocaine S&G followed by 10% lidocaine spray was the anesthetic route preferred by participants and laryngoscopists."
9010402,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9010402/,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the influence of family history on the occurrence of stroke.
METHODS: A case-control study was carried out from August 1992 to January 1994. The study population comprised 502 patients with a first stroke, aged between 20 and 70 years, who were treated at 48 affiliated hospitals. The same number of age and sex matched controls were selected from outpatients. Diagnoses were based on CT findings and clinical signs. There were 155 case-control pairs for subarachnoid haemorrhage, 158 for intracerebral haematoma, and 159 for cerebral infarction. Information about the patients and their families was obtained from a questionnaire which included the family histories of each subtype of stroke and other potential risk factors for stroke. The data were analysed focusing on the role of the family histories in the occurrence of stroke.
RESULTS: In univariate analysis, the family histories of subarachnoid haemorrhage and intracerebral haematoma were positively associated with each of the subtypes of stroke (odds ratios 11.24 for subarachnoid haemorrhage, 2.39 for intracerebral haematoma), whereas family history of cerebral infarction was not a significant risk factor for its occurrence (odds ratio 1.41). Family history of intracerebral haematoma was correlated with a personal history of hypertension and habitual alcohol consumption. After adjustment for potential risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, obesity, alcohol consumption, and regular smoking), family history of subarachnoid haemorrhage still remained the most powerful risk factor for subarachnoid haemorrhage, whereas family history of intracerebral haematoma no longer showed a significant association with haematoma.
CONCLUSION: Genetic factors play a major part in the pathogenesis of subarachnoid haemorrhage, and family history of subarachnoid haemorrhage is the strongest independent risk factor for the disease. On the other hand, family history of intracerebral haematoma was not an independent risk factor for haematoma, but it might be a good predictor, which indirectly influences the pathogenesis of intracerebral haematoma via certain hereditary components such as hypertension, and even lifestyle factors such as alcohol consumption. In cerebral infarction, genetic factors play a minor part in its pathogenesis."
9010403,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9010403/,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether ""diseased nerves"" are more prone to entrapment neuropathy than normal nerves. Nerve conduction studies of human neuropathies have shown that electrophysiological abnormalities are often most prominent at potential sites of nerve entrapment, and entrapments are more common in patients with radiculopathies--a concept designated as ""double crush"". As entrapment neuropathies commonly occur in otherwise healthy subjects, it is unclear whether this relation is coincidental or whether peripheral nerves affected by disease are rendered more susceptible to effects of repeated minor trauma, traction, or mechanical compression.
METHODS: Sequential ulnar nerve conduction studies were prospectively performed at baseline and at four, eight, and 12 month intervals in 16 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Ulnar nerve entrapment was defined as a focal reduction (> 10 m/s) in conduction velocity in the across-elbow segment.
RESULTS: Ulnar sensory and motor nerve fibres showed similar findings of ulnar nerve entrapment at baseline and at follow up over the period of the study. Nerves with ulnar nerve entrapment showed a significantly greater reduction in distal motor amplitudes than nerves without entrapment, even though distal ulnar sensory amplitudes remained unchanged.
CONCLUSIONS: Motor nerves in motor neuron disease do not seem to be more susceptible to entrapment at the elbow than do healthy sensory nerves, thus casting doubt on the double crush hypothesis. Nerves with double pathology (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and ulnar nerve entrapment), however, seem to undergo more rapid axonal loss than do nerves with single pathology (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or ulnar nerve entrapment alone)."
9010893,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9010893/,"BACKGROUND: The tobacco industry increased the portion of its marketing budget for sales promotion to $2.5 billion in 1993. Although it claims not to target those under age 18 years, it is important to determine the extent to which adolescents are affected as participation may lead to smoking initiation.
METHODS: California population surveys, conducted in 1993 among youth ages 12-17 years (N = 5,531) and in 1994 among both youth (N = 1,735) and adults (N = 4,170), asked questions regarding possession and willingness to use promotional items.
RESULTS: In 1994, young adults (18-24 years) were the most likely to possess a promotional item (27.5 +/- 4.1, +/- 95% confidence limit). However, willingness to use an item was highest among those ages 15-17 years (35.4 +/- 3.4%) and was also high among those ages 12-14 years (24.4 +/- 2.7%). Among youth, ownership or willingness to use promotional items was more likely for boys, whites, those reporting below average school performance, and those smoking or susceptible to smoking. Youth ownership of promotional items increased from 1993 to 1994, as did the frequency of their obtaining items from coupons.
CONCLUSIONS: Promotional marketing undertaken by the tobacco industry was effective in capturing the interest of adolescents, although actual acquisition was highest among young adults. The rapidly increasing interest in tobacco promotional items from 1993 to 1994 may soon translate into increased adolescent smoking rates."
9011930,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9011930/,"AIMS: In the absence of curative treatment, the diagnosis of HIV infection imposes a heavy burden. Infected persons are therefore confronted with psychological, social and physical problems and cope with them via different strategies and social resources. We investigated the question of what factors help to maintain a psychologically symptom-free state.
METHODS: A sample of 117 asymptomatic HIV-infected persons was recruited out of the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (Part A) in 1989 and 1990. The psychological symptoms were assessed with a self-rating questionnaire (SCL-90-R). The structured interview focused on social network, social support (SONET), and coping strategies (FEKB).
RESULTS: 79% of the asymptomatic persons did not report psychological symptoms. In multivariate analyses, ""rumination"" (= preoccupational thinking), female gender, and affectively negative relationships correlated with more, but affectively positive relationships and the strategy ""defence against threat"" with fewer, psychological symptoms. Additionally, there was no significant correlation between the immunological markers (CD4-, CD8-cell count, p24 antigen) and psychological complaints.
CONCLUSIONS: The low number of asymptomatic HIV-infected persons with psychological symptoms (21%) is in accordance with other studies. Psychological symptoms and rumination correlate significantly in our sample. As rumination is difficult to recognize, HIV-infected patients should be directly questioned about rumination and their defence against threat should be supported in order to prevent the development of psychological symptoms."
9013168,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9013168/,"BACKGROUND: We report the clinical and histologic features of a distinctive form of chronic esophagitis for which we propose the term chronic esophagitis dissecans.
METHODS: The study group included five patients diagnosed at Hôpital Beaujon, Clichy, from 1988 to 1994. Clinical and endoscopic examinations were performed. Samples of esophageal biopsy specimens were analyzed by histologic and ultrastructural examinations and by immunohistochemistry with antibodies directed against cell adhesion molecules.
RESULTS: All patients were elderly (mean age, 66 years). They presented the following combination of clinical and endoscopic features: (1) long-standing history of chronic dysphagia, without symptoms of reflux, (2) shedding of mucosal fragments, occurring spontaneously or after mechanical trauma, (3) existence of localized esophageal strictures, (4) lack of concurrent chronic cutaneomucous lesions. Two patients presented with thymoma. Histologic examination showed evidence of mucosal blistering, in the absence of significant inflammatory lesions. Altered cell-cell adhesion was suggested by the reduced number of desmosomes on ultrastructural examination and the decreased expression of immunoreactive intercellular adhesion molecule E-cadherin.
CONCLUSION: Chronic esophagitis dissecans likely represents a hitherto unrecognized clinicopathologic entity and must be added to the causes of chronic dysphagia."
9013242,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9013242/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the annual cost of implementing and maintaining a respiratory personal protective equipment (PPE) program at an urban hospital.
SETTING: St Clare's Hospital and Health Center, a 250-bed hospital in Manhattan that treats 60 to 100 cases of tuberculosis annually.
METHODS: Review of Purchasing Department records for all masks acquired by the hospital from 1992 to 1995, and an estimate of administrative time spent developing and implementing the guidelines recommended by various agencies during the study interval.
RESULTS: Respiratory isolation was provided for 6,360 to 10,883 days annually during the 4-year interval. Yearly costs for the PPE program ranged from $86,560 to $175,690. Of note, the daily cost for a respiratory isolation day decreased dramatically between 1994 and 1995 ($25/day to $13/day), when the high-efficiency particulate air-filter (HEPA) respirator was used by all staff. The decrease occurred because of lower administrative costs and a sharp decrease in the numbers of HEPA units purchased. Objective measures of worker compliance with HEPA respirators demonstrated the decrease was not due to less HEPA use but rather that employees were using each HEPA unit for several weeks, as recommended.
CONCLUSION: We found a significant decrease in cost in the second year of our HEPA program due to increasing employee familiarity with the program. Newly approved, cheaper, but less durable, N-95 masks are unlikely to withstand multiple wearings and may be discarded after a few uses. Thus, cheaper masks may result in a more expensive PPE program."
9013919,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9013919/,"PURPOSE: It is reported that 25% to 50% of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) have severe coronary artery disease (CAD) and should undergo an aggressive cardiac workup before AAA repair. In contrast, it has been our policy that patients referred for AAA repairs undergo no cardiac testing before surgery.
METHODS: This report reviews the last 113 consecutive patients who underwent elective AAA repair by the senior author using this policy. Seventy-four patients (group A) had only an electrocardiogram before surgery. The remaining 39 patients (group B) were referred having already had additional testing that included a thallium stress test (n = 20), echocardiogram (n = 18), multiple gated acquisition (MUGA) scan (n = 3), cardiac catheterization (n = 8), or some combination of these.
RESULTS: There was no statistical difference between group A and group B with regard to age, sex, tobacco use or history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, stroke (CVA), hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Group B more commonly had a history of myocardial infarction (41% vs 19%, p < 0.03) and congestive heart failure (23% vs 7%, p < 0.03). During surgery there was no significant differences in blood loss, transfusion requirements, or operative times. There were no myocardial infarctions in group A and two (5.1%) in group B, which was not significantly different. Other complications, such as CVA, renal failure, pulmonary failure, pneumonia, wound infection, and hemorrhage, were not significantly different between the two groups. Postoperative hospital stay was not significantly different. There were three deaths in the entire series (2.7%), and only one in group B was cardiac-related in a patient with known end-stage cardiac disease and a symptomatic 8 cm AAA.
CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that most patients with AAA can safely undergo repair with no cardiac workup and that cardiac workup before AAA repair contributes little information that impacts on treatment or final clinical outcome. We conclude that cardiac testing in preparation for AAA repair is not usually necessary and that intraoperative hemodynamic management may be the most important variable in determining outcome."
9014715,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9014715/,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the use of dextran or the combination of low molecular weight heparin and dextran increases the blood loss in elective transurethral resection for benign prostatic hyperplasia.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This open randomized controlled study included 198 patients operated under spinal anaesthesia who were allocated to four groups differing in the combination of prophylactic treatment used for thrombosis and for the substitution of blood loss. The prophylactic treatment was either dalteparin sodium, continued each day until mobilization, or 3% Ringer dextran-60 just before operation and continued with 6% dextran-70 for 2 days post-operatively, and the volume substitute was Ringer dextran or Ringer's acetate. Thus, the four treatments (by prophylaxis and volume substitute, respectively) were dalteparin and Ringer's acetate, dalteparin and dextran, dextran and Ringer's acetate, and dextran and dextran. The haemoglobin lost to the irrigation fluid was measured and used to calculate blood loss.
RESULTS: Patients receiving dextran had a larger post-operative and total blood loss than those who did not. The need for transfusion did not differ between the treatment groups.
CONCLUSION: The combination of dalteparin and dextran was not associated with an increased blood loss above that with dextran alone."
9015026,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9015026/,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical significance of in utero detection of fetal cerebral lateral ventricular asymmetry.
METHODS: We used high resolution ultrasonography to study asymmetries of the fetal lateral ventricles in the human brain. A retrospective survey was conducted on 7200 pregnant women who presented at two large district hospitals in Israel. Only fetuses with a difference of greater than 2.4 mm (two standard deviations) in the width of the lateral ventricles, with no known brain pathology, were included in the study. Index cases were evaluated regarding maternal complications, prenatal ultrasound examinations, postnatal imaging studies, and neonatal outcome up to 6 months of age.
RESULTS: Lateral ventricular asymmetry was found in 21 subjects, all with available clinical data. In 15 fetuses (71%), the body or the occipital horn of the left lateral ventricle was larger than the right, whereas in six fetuses (29%), the right was larger than the left. In four cases (20%), serial scans noted resolution of asymmetry; in 15 (75%), it was persistent; and in one (5%), asymmetry increased. In one case, termination of pregnancy was performed; however, pathologic examination of the fetal brain failed to detect any structural abnormality. Underlying cerebral pathology was later found only in three fetuses (14%); one had subclinical cytomegalovirus ventriculitis, one had insidious periventricular hemorrhage, and in one fetus with increased asymmetry, trisomy 21 was verified. All the remaining 17 cases had normal neurologic development.
CONCLUSIONS: Some degree of asymmetry of the lateral ventricles exists in the human fetal brain and is detectable in utero. Lateral ventricular asymmetry alone is probably not clinically significant, and it may be considered as a normal variant, rather than a pathologic finding."
9015036,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9015036/,"OBJECTIVE: To identify variables that increase the chance of neonatal scalp injury during vacuum extraction.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study of 134 vacuum extraction-assisted deliveries at Olive View-UCLA Medical Center in 1995. Data collected included parity, gestational age, duration of first and second stages of labor, indication for operative delivery, station and position of fetal head, duration of vacuum application, number of ""pop-offs,"" neonatal weight, and descriptions of scalp marks or injury. Cranial imaging studies were obtained if clinically indicated.
RESULTS: There were 28 infants with scalp trauma, including 17 superficial lacerations, six large caputs, and 12 cephalohematomata; one infant had subgaleal, subdural, and subarachnoid hemorrhages. Logistic regression analysis showed duration of vacuum application to be the best predictor of scalp injury, followed by duration of second stage of labor and paramedian cup placement. Duration of vacuum application ranged from 0.5 to 26 minutes, with a median length of 3 minutes. The proportion of injuries was greater for applications exceeding 10 minutes (6 of 9) than for those 10 minutes or shorter (22 of 121, P < .01). We did not encounter any cases of clinically important scalp injury.
CONCLUSIONS: Cosmetic scalp trauma occurred in 21% of our newborns delivered by vacuum extraction and was more common after longer vacuum applications, longer second stages, and paramedian cup placement."
9015083,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9015083/,"PURPOSE: To assess the attenuation of the adrenal gland with computed tomography (CT) before and after multiple phases of contrast enhancement in both control subjects and patients with adenomas and nonadenomas.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-two patients with 78 adrenal masses (41 adenomas, 37 nonadenomas) underwent helical CT. Forty subjects served as controls. Unenhanced CT was performed followed by enhanced CT at 30, 60, 90, and 180 seconds and 30 minutes.
RESULTS: At unenhanced CT, mean attenuation was 4 HU +/- 16 for adenomas compared with 37 HU +/- 12 for the nonadenomas (P < .001) and 24 HU +/- 3 for normal glands. Although the mean attenuation of nonademonas was significantly greater than that of adenomas on 60- and 90-second scans (P < .001), there was greater overlap in attenuation of the adenomas and nonadenomas than on unenhanced images. At 180 seconds, nonadenomas had higher attenuation than adenomas (73 HU +/- 17 vs 41 HU +/- 18; P < .001). At 30 minutes, all adenomas had attenuation less than 37 HU, whereas all nonadenomas had attenuation greater than 41 HU.
CONCLUSION: Delayed-enhanced CT scans obtained 30 minutes after administration of contrast material can enable differentiation of adenomas and nonadenomas."
9015087,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9015087/,"PURPOSE: To determine if runners have an increased prevalence of marrow edema in the foot and ankle compared with nonrunners at magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ankles and feet were imaged in 20 runners and 12 nonrunners with a fast short inversion time inversion-recovery sequence at 1.5 T. Edema within each bone was graded from 0 (no edema) to 3 (severe edema). Total scores for each subject equaled the sum of the grades.
RESULTS: Reader 1 found edema in 16 of 20 runners and four of 12 nonrunners (P < .04); runners had a mean score of 4.7 and nonrunners had a mean score of 0.9 (P < .006). The average number of bones with edema was 3.4 for runners and 0.7 for nonrunners (P < .005). Reader 2 found edema in 16 of 20 runners and two of 12 nonrunners (P < .002); runners had a mean score of 4.5 and nonrunners had a mean score of 0.3 (P < .001). The average number of bones with edema was 3.6 for runners and 0.3 for nonrunners (P < .001).
CONCLUSION: When the fast short inversion time inversion-recovery sequence is performed, edema seen within the marrow of runners on MR images may be due to exercise alone."
9016421,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9016421/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine if health-related quality of life (HRQL) in patients of middle age and older with elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and normal total thyroid hormone levels-subclinical hypothyroidism-improves with L-thyroxine replacement therapy.
DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
SETTING: Outpatient clinic.
PATIENTS: Thirty-seven patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, most with symptoms consistent with hypothyroidism, over 55 years of age.
INTERVENTIONS: Placebo or L-thyroxine replacement therapy to achieve normal TSH level.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Disease-specific and general HRQL, cognitive function, bone mineral density, lipid levels. The mean daily dose of L-thyroxine replacement in the active group was 68 +/- 21 micrograms. TSH decreased by 8.6 mIU/L (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.1 to 13.1) and T4 increased by 27.9 nmol/L (95% CI 14.8 to 41.2). There was a statistically significant improvement in a composite psychometric memory score in treated versus control patients; all other outcomes showed similar findings in the two groups. Although confidence intervals for most measures did not exclude an important improvement in HRQL with thyroid replacement, no measure of symptoms or HRQL either showed clinically important trends in favor of treatment, or approached conventional levels of statistical significance.
CONCLUSIONS: In middle-aged and older patients with elevated TSH and normal T4, it may not be harmful to follow biochemical and clinical status even in the presence of nonspecific symptoms potentially associated with hypothyroidism."
9016964,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9016964/,"OBJECTIVE: The peripheral vascular resistance is an important factor determining the outcome of infrainguinal revascularizations. When measured intraoperatively, it correlates to graft patency, but to select patients to surgery a preoperative, preferably noninvasive, method is necessary. The aim of the present study is to test if parameters recorded during postocclusive reactive hyperemia can be used for that purpose.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: This prospective study compares patients with occluded grafts within 30 days postoperatively to patients with patent grafts.
SETTING: University Hospital.
PATIENTS: Thirty patients with critical ischemia scheduled for infrainguinal bypass surgery.
MEASURES: Correlations between intraoperatively measured peripheral resistance and preoperatively recorded parameters of postocclusive reactive hyperemia. The ability of the values to predict outcome.
RESULTS: Peripheral resistance correlated significantly to two parameters during postocclusive reactive hyperemia recorded after thigh occlusion, flux reappearance time (r=0.47, p=0.01) and time to peak flux (r=0.41, p=0.03). Intraoperative peripheral resistance predicted graft occlusion at 30 days with a 90% accuracy, while parameters obtained during reactive hyperemia, only tended to predict adverse outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: Several parameters during reactive hyperemia show weak correlation to intraoperatively measured peripheral resistance, but none was able to accurately predict graft failure. Further studies are needed to evaluate its capability for patient selection."

DESIGN: Prospective, randomized trial.
SETTING: Mother-infant care wards in a tertiary care teaching hospital.
PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-five primiparae with sore nipples who were breastfeeding after a vaginal delivery at 37 or more weeks gestation, who were 36 hours or less postpartum, and had combined mother-infant care.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants were assigned randomly to one of six treatment groups with one of three regimens (tea bag compress, water compress, or no compress) randomly assigned to right or left sides. Participants applied the treatments at least four times a day, from Days 1 to 5 postpartum.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Reduction of nipple pain.
RESULTS: Tea bag and water compresses were more effective than no treatment, with no statistically significant difference between the two types of compresses.
CONCLUSION: Warm water or tea bag compresses are an inexpensive, equally effective treatment for sore nipples during the early postpartum period."
9017617,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9017617/,"BACKGROUND: ANCA are thought to play a pathogenic role in renal vasculitis. ANCA may also be detected in patients with diseases not usually associated with renal pathology, such as ulcerative colitis. Our study was conducted to determine if the presence of ANCA in patients with ulcerative colitis is associated with renal pathology.
METHODS: Eight ANCA-positive and five ANCA-negative patients with a histological and endoscopic diagnosis of active ulcerative colitis were investigated. Repeated complete urinalyses and determination of microalbuminuria and creatinine clearance were performed. Serum IgG and IgA ANCA were evaluated in all patients by indirect immunofluorescence and ELISA, and when detected the antibodies were further characterized by alpha granules preparation, myeloperoxidase, lactoferrin, and cathepsin G.
RESULTS: In both ANCA-positive and ANCA-negative patients renal function was normal or near normal and urinalyses (including microalbuminuria) failed to disclose any abnormalities. ANCA exhibited a perinuclear pattern in all ANCA-positive patients. Interestingly, none of the ANCA-positive patients had antibodies to myeloperoxidase or to alpha granules which are usually found in the sera of patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis, and only one had antibodies to lactoferrin. The ANCA specificity remained undetermined in the remaining seven patients. At the end of the 1-year observation period, all ANCA-positive patients remained ANCA-positive without developing symptoms, signs or laboratory abnormalities consistent with renal involvement.
CONCLUSIONS: Renal damage was not observed in ANCA-positive patients with ulcerative colitis even after 1 year of follow-up, suggesting that the ANCA found in these patients do not share the antigenic targets with the ANCA commonly found in renal vasculitis. Therefore the potential of ANCA of inducing renal lesions (if any) is dependent on their own antigenic specificity."
9017942,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9017942/,"BACKGROUND: Studies have reported that blacks undergo fewer coronary-revascularization procedures than whites, but it is not clear whether the clinical characteristics of the patients account for these differences or whether they indicate underuse of the procedures in blacks or overuse in whites.
METHODS: In a study at Duke University of 12,402 patients (10.3 percent of whom were black) with coronary disease, we calculated unadjusted and adjusted rates of angioplasty and bypass surgery in blacks and whites after cardiac catheterization. We also examined patterns of treatment after stratifying the patients according to the severity of disease, angina status, and estimated survival benefit due to revascularization. Finally, we compared five-year survival rates in blacks and whites.
RESULTS: After adjustment for the severity of disease and other characteristics, blacks were 13 percent less likely than whites to undergo angioplasty and 32 percent less likely to undergo bypass surgery. The adjusted black:white odds ratios for receiving these procedures were 0.87 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.73 to 1.03) and 0.68 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.56 to 0.82), respectively. The racial differences in rates of bypass surgery persisted among those with severe anginal symptoms (31 percent of blacks underwent surgery, vs. 45 percent of whites, P<0.001) and among those predicted to have the greatest survival benefit from revascularization (42 percent vs. 61 percent, P<0.001). Finally, unadjusted and adjusted rates of survival for five years were significantly lower in blacks than in whites.
CONCLUSIONS: Blacks with coronary disease were significantly less likely than whites to undergo coronary revascularization, particularly bypass surgery - a difference that could not be explained by the clinical features of their disease. The differences in treatment were most pronounced among those predicted to benefit the most from revascularization. Since these differences also correlated with a lower survival rate in blacks, we conclude that coronary revascularization appears to be underused in blacks."
9017951,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9017951/,"OBJECTIVES: This study examines the association between the regional availability of cardiac technology and outcomes of care for patients admitted to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) hospitals. Patients using the VA regional medical system initially are admitted to a hospital with or without the on-site availability of technology-intensive cardiac services.
METHODS: The authors identified male veterans (n = 24,229) discharged from VA hospitals with a primary diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) from January 1, 1988 through December 31, 1990. Analyses of mortality up to 2 years after AMI and the use of cardiac procedures were stratified by the type of VA hospitals to which patients initially were admitted. Logistic regression models adjusted for age, race, marital status, hospitalization in previous year, comorbidities, cardiac complications coded, and year of AMI.
RESULTS: Adjusted mortality was significantly higher for patients initially admitted to hospitals without on-site cardiac technology at: 2 days (odds ratio [OR] 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.62-0.81), 90 days (OR 0.78; 95% CI 0.73-0.85); 1 year (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.81-0.93); and 2 years (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.81-0.92) compared with hospitals with on-site cardiac technology (ie, coronary angioplasty and cardiac surgery facilities). Patients initially admitted to hospitals without on-site cardiac technology also were less likely to undergo cardiac procedures than patients admitted to hospitals with on-site cardiac technology.
CONCLUSIONS: The regional distribution of cardiac technology may restrict patient access to technology-intensive services and to ""equally good medical care."" Policies that promote regionalization of medical services should consider carefully the distribution of benefits and burdens to patients."
9017953,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9017953/,"OBJECTIVES: According to some studies, women with heart disease receive fewer procedures and have higher in-hospital death rates than men. These studies vary by data source (hospital discharge abstract versus detailed clinical information) and severity measurement methods. The authors examined whether evaluations of gender differences for acute myocardial infarction patients vary by data source and severity measure.
METHODS: The authors considered 10 severity measures: four using clinical medical record data and six using discharge abstracts (diagnosis and procedure codes). The authors studied all 14,083 patients admitted in 1991 for acute myocardial infarction to 100 hospitals nationwide, examining in-hospital death and use of coronary angiography, coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG), and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios for death and procedure use for women compared with men, controlling for age and each of the severity scores.
RESULTS: After adjusting only for age, women were significantly more likely than men to die and less likely to receive CABG and coronary angiography. Severity measures provided different assessments of whether women were sicker than men; for all cases, clinical data-based MedisGroups rated women's severity compared with men's, whereas four code-based severity measures viewed women as sicker. After adjusting for severity and age, women were significantly more likely than men to die in-hospital and less likely to receive coronary angiography and CABG; women and men had relatively equal adjusted odds ratios of receiving PTCA. Odds ratios reflecting gender differences in procedure use and death rates were similar across severity measures.
CONCLUSIONS: Comparisons of severity-adjusted in-hospital death rates and invasive procedure use between men and women yielded similar findings regardless of data source and severity measure."
9018186,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9018186/,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the appropriateness of lights and siren (L&S) in the transport of pediatric patients by ambulance/emergency medical vehicle in a region with no specific guidelines regarding L&S use.
METHODS: We reviewed audiotapes of eligible calls made during a 7-month period to a pediatric medical control center (PMCC) at a children's hospital emergency department in an urban, tertiary care. Level trauma center serving the greater Cincinnati area. We obtained the following information: L&S use, time of day, patient age, chief complaint, vital signs, mental status, and physical examination findings. Final disposition was determined from the corresponding ED charts. We also recorded the level of training of the emergency medical services personnel (basic versus paramedic) and any voluntary comments made by the EMS personnel concerning overall patient stability and their comfort with the situation. Patients were categorized as being in stable condition if all vital signs and mental status were normal, significant abnormalities were absent on examination, and EMS personnel stated they were comfortable with the patient's condition. Inappropriate use of L&S was defined as ""running hot"" (using L&S) with a stable patient.
RESULTS: We reviewed 622 calls; 504 met inclusion criteria. L&S were used in 312 (62%); of these instances, 123 (39.4%) were classified as involving inappropriate use of L&S. Basic units were more likely to use L&S inappropriately with a patient in stable condition than were paramedic units (P < .015). Inappropriate use was not related to patient age or time of day. Patients transported with inappropriate L&S were more likely to be discharged home than were patients whose transports were marked by appropriate L&S use (74% versus 41%, P < .001). Patients with cardiovascular and respiratory chief complaints were more likely to be transported with appropriate L&S than were those with general medical, trauma, or central nervous system chief complaints.
CONCLUSION: In our preliminary study, inappropriate use of L&S in the transport of pediatric patients in stable condition is common Definitive studies are needed to evaluate the risks and benefits of using L&S."
9018210,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9018210/,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the relative abilities of clinical and administrative data to predict mortality and to assess hospital quality of care for CABG surgery patients.
DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: 1991-1992 data from New York's Cardiac Surgery Reporting System (clinical data) and HCFA's MEDPAR (administrative data). STUDY DESIGN/SETTING/SAMPLE: This is an observational study that identifies significant risk factors for in-hospital mortality and that risk-adjusts hospital mortality rates using these variables. Setting was all 31 hospitals in New York State in which CABG surgery was performed in 1991-1992. A total of 13,577 patients undergoing isolated CABG surgery who could be matched in the two databases made up the sample.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hospital risk-adjusted mortality rates, identification of ""outlier"" hospitals, and discrimination and calibration of statistical models were the main outcome measures.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Part of the discriminatory power of administrative statistical models resulted from the miscoding of postoperative complications as comorbidities. Removal of these complications led to deterioration in the model's C index (from C = .78 to C = .71 and C = .73). Also, provider performance assessments changed considerably when complications of care were distinguished from comorbidities. The addition of a couple of clinical data elements considerably improved the fit of administrative models. Further, a clinical model based on Medicare CABG patients yielded only three outliers, whereas eight were identified using a clinical model for all CABG patients.
CONCLUSIONS: If administrative databases are used in outcomes research, (1) efforts to distinguish complications of care from comorbidities should be undertaken, (2) much more accurate assessments may be obtained by appending a limited number of clinical data elements to administrative data before assessing outcomes, and (3) Medicare data may be misleading because they do not reflect outcomes for all patients."
9018215,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9018215/,"OBJECTIVE: To develop a case mix model for inpatient substance abuse treatment to assess the effect of case mix on readmission across Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs).
DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: The computerized patient records from the 116 VAMCs with inpatient substance abuse treatment programs between 1987 and 1992.
STUDY DESIGN: Logistic regression was used on patient data to model the effect of demographic, psychiatric, medical, and substance abuse factors on readmission to VAMCs for substance abuse treatment within six months of discharge. The model predictions were aggregated for each VAMC to produce an expected number of readmissions. The observed number of readmissions for each VAMC was divided by its expected number to create a measure of facility performance. Confidence intervals and rankings were used to examine how case mix adjustment changed relative performance among VAMCs.
DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS: Ward where care was provided and ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes were used to identify patients receiving treatment for substance abuse (N = 313,886).
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The case mix model explains 36 percent of the observed facility level variation in readmission. Over half of the VAMCs had numbers of readmissions that were significantly different than expected. There were also noticeable differences between the rankings based on actual and case mix-adjusted readmissions.
CONCLUSIONS: Secondary data can be used to build a reasonably stable case mix model for substance abuse treatment that will identify meaningful variation across facilities. Further, case mix has a large effect on facility level readmission rates for substance abuse treatment. Uncontrolled facility comparisons can be misleading. Case mix models are potentially useful for quality assurance efforts."
9018642,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9018642/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine if human defensins and lactoferrin, both markers of neutrophil activation, are elevated in preeclamptic plasma.
STUDY DESIGN: Blood samples were obtained from 18 preeclamptic and 29 normal pregnant women in the third trimester. Demographic and clinical data were obtained from the medical record. No patient had evidence of labor and/or infection when blood was drawn. Preeclamptic patients were defined by elevated blood pressure, 140/90 mm Hg, proteinuria of > 300 mg in a 24-hour collection and hyperuricemia. Human defensins and lactoferrin were measured by enzyme immunoassay of plasma samples diluted 1:100 and 1:10, respectively. Standard curve values ranged from 0.25 to 16 ng/mL. Data for human defensins and lactoferrin are presented as median values +/-SE. Statistical analysis included Student's t test for comparison of clinical data, Mann-Whitney U test for comparison of absolute values between groups and Fisher's exact test, when appropriate.
RESULTS: There was no difference in age or estimated gestational age between the two groups. There were more nulliparous patients in the preeclamptic group. Human defensin levels were significantly elevated (P = .005) in plasma of preeclamptic patients (25.1 ng/mL +/- 16.2) as compared to normal controls (9.0 ng/mL +/- 8.9). Nine of 18 (50%) preeclamptic patients and 2 of 29 (7%) normal controls had defensin levels above the low point on the standard curve (P = .001). There was no difference in lactoferrin levels between the two groups.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that preeclampsia is associated with neutrophil activation. The biologic effect of elevated human defensins in preeclamptic plasma remains to be determined."
9019964,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9019964/,"BACKGROUND: Endothelins are a family of peptides with a potent constriction action that can play a role in the etiology of vascular diabetic complications.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 26 prepubertal patients diagnosed with type I diabetes mellitus and treated by both insulin and dietetic regime. They were analyzed according to their age. A morning blood sample was obtained after 12 hours of overnight fasting for endothelin determination (RIA from Nichols Institute) and HbA1c (Biorad). Patients were classified into two groups: 1) good control, with HbA1c values < 8% and 2) poor control with HbA1c levels > 8%. The control groups was comprised of endocrinologically normal children that consulted the pediatrician for suspected constitutional delay of growth. Statistical analysis was made by means of nonparametric methods and with the Spearman coefficient.
RESULTS: In the control group, the plasma concentration of endothelin were 4.01 +/- 1.1 pg/ml (x +/- SD). In diabetics with good control, values were 3.15 +/- 0.62 pg/ml and 3.91 +/- 1.25 in diabetics with poor control. No statistical differences were noted among these groups.
CONCLUSIONS: We deduce that plasmatic levels of endothelin does not seem to be affected by the metabolic control in patients with type I diabetes mellitus without complications."
9021788,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9021788/,"OBJECTIVE: To correlate urodynamic with perineal sonographic findings in pressure variations.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 15 women presenting with urethral pressure variations a urodynamic evaluation with water filling cystometry, urethral pressure at rest and during coughing and uroflowmetry were performed. During water filling cystometry, there were simultaneous perineal video-sonography and urethrocystometry. Video ultrasound images and urodynamic curves were simultaneously monitored on a computer screen.
RESULTS: Simultaneous ultrasound and urodynamic evaluation in the 15 patients revealed movements in two areas leading to urethral pressure variations: activity of the pelvic floor muscles and of the urethral sphincter muscles. For the pelvic floor, we found either slow or fast contractions with, respectively, slow (15-30 cm H2O for 3-10 sec) or fast (30-130 cm H2O for 1-3 sec) urethral pressure changes. Urethral sphincter contractions were always fast, resulting in fast pressure changes of 30-170 cm H2O for 1-3 sec.
CONCLUSION: Evaluation of simultaneous perineal sonography and urethrocystometry shows the association of urethral pressure variations and muscle activity. Urethral pressure variations are caused by the activity of urethral sphincter or pelvic floor muscles. With ultrasound the activity of the urethral sphincter muscle can directly be seen whereas pelvic floor muscle activity is indirectly visible. Pelvic floor muscle contractions are either fast or slow, whereas the urethral sphincter muscle contractions are always fast contractions."
9022116,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9022116/,"OBJECTIVES: The antibody response in sera and tears of 167 patients with suspected chlamydial conjunctivitis was compared with the antibody response in sera and tears of 45 patients with symptoms of urogenital chlamydial infection to discover whether and which type of antichlamydial antibody detected in tears may be of diagnostic help in chlamydial conjunctivitis.
METHODS: Diagnosis was based on chlamydial antigen detection from the conjunctiva and urogenital tract, done by a direct immunofluorescence assay, McCoy cell culture, and polymerase chain reaction. Additionally, antichlamydial immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) were determined in sera and tears of all patients by an immunoperoxidase assay.
RESULTS: Two hundred twelve patients were examined--167 with conjunctivitis, 45 with symptoms of urogenital chlamydial infection. Cell culture, direct immunofluorescence assay, and polymerase chain reaction brought identical results. Conjunctival specimens taken from 33 (20%) of the patients with conjunctivitis were Chlamydia antigen positive; specimens taken from 134 (80%) were negative. Antichlamydial antibodies were found in tears of 29 (88%) of the patients with conjunctivitis whose specimens were Chlamydia antigen positive. Fifty-four (40%) of the patients with conjunctivitis whose specimens were Chlamydia antigen negative had antichlamydial antibodies in their tears. Twenty-five patients with urethritis (56%) were Chlamydia antigen positive in urethral swabs; 20 (44%) were negative. Antichlamydial antibodies were found in the tears of eight (32%) of the Chlamydia antigen-positive and two (10%) of the Chlamydia antigen-negative patients with urethritis. In contrast to patients with conjunctivitis, findings for patients with urethritis always were negative for antichlamydial IgG in the tears.
CONCLUSION: Antichlamydial antibodies in tears were seen significantly more often in patients with conjunctivitis than in those with urethritis (P < or = 0.05). Antichlamydial IgG was found only in tears of patients with conjunctivitis. Therefore, the authors conclude that the detection of antichlamydial IgG in the tears might be helpful for diagnosis in patients with suspected chlamydial conjunctivitis who have antigen-negative conjunctival swabs."
9022490,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9022490/,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the contribution of neuroleptic drugs to cognitive decline in dementia.
DESIGN: Two year prospective, longitudinal study consisting of interviews every four months, with necropsy follow up.
SETTING: Community settings in Oxfordshire.
SUBJECTS: 71 subjects with dementia, initially living at home with informant.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cognitive function (score from expanded minimental state examination); behavioural problems (physical aggression, hallucinations, persecutory ideas, and disturbance of diurnal rhythm); and postmortem neuropathological assessment (cortical Lewy body pathology).
RESULTS: The mean (SE) decline in cognitive score in the 16 patients who took neuroleptics was twice that in the patients who did not (20.7 (2.9) v 9.3 (1.3), P = 0.002). An increased rate of decline was also associated with aggression, disturbed diurnal rhythm, and persecutory ideas. However, only use of neuroleptics and severity of persecutory ideas were independently associated with more rapid cognitive decline when all other variables were adjusted for. The start of neuroleptic treatment coincided with more rapid cognitive decline: median rate of decline was 5 (interquartile range 8.5) points per year before treatment and 11 (12) points per year after treatment (P = 0.02). Cortical Lewy body pathology did not account for association between neuroleptic use and more rapid decline.
CONCLUSIONS: Neuroleptic drugs that are sometimes used to treat behavioural complications of dementia may worsen already poor cognitive function. Randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm a causal relation."
9022653,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9022653/,"OBJECTIVE: Literature suggests that both ethanol and omeprazole may affect the endocrine system. We studied the effect of concurrent use of ethanol and omeprazole on the pituitary gonadal axis in healthy males.
METHODS: Serum testosterone, luteinizing hormone, and follicle stimulating hormone levels were assessed in a fasting state before and after ingestion of 0.5 g/kg bodyweight of ethanol. Subjects then received omeprazole therapy (20 mg 2x/d for one week) followed by assessment of hormone levels before and after ethanol ingestion as done previously.
RESULTS: Total testosterone levels before and after ethanol at baseline declined an average of 46.6 ng/dL (n = 8; p = NS). The testosterone levels before and after ethanol following omeprazole therapy rose an average of 55.4 ng/dL (n = 8; p = NS). There was no significant difference in the change of ethanol induced testosterone concentrations as a result of omeprazole therapy. Similarly the free testosterone, follicle stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone were also not affected by ethanol or omeprazole alone or in combination.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that omeprazole and/or acute ingestion of ethanol do not affect the pituitary gonadal axis in healthy male subjects."
9022744,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9022744/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the value of computerized interactive morphometry in the preoperative prediction of malignancy in fine needle aspirates of Hürthle cell neoplasms.
STUDY DESIGN: Alcohol-fixed, Papanicolaou-stained fine needle aspiration smears of histologically proven Hürthle cell adenomas (HCA) (n = 10) and Hürthle cell carcinomas (HCC) (n = 9) were studied by interactive computerized morphometry. The measured features included the areas, perimeters and shape factors of individual cells, nuclei and nucleoli; the nucleocytoplasmic and nucleolonuclear ratios; and the eccentricities of nuclei and nucleoli.
RESULTS: Only nucleolar features showed statistically significant differences between HCA and HCC. These features were the nucleolar area and its standard deviation, the nucleolar form factor and circularity, and the nucleolonuclear ratio. The most effective, albeit imperfect, discrimination was achieved by the nucleolar form factor.
CONCLUSION: Nucleolar features, such as size, variation in size and roundness, may be more effective than cellular or nuclear features in differentiating between HCA and HCC in fine needle aspiration smears."
9023621,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9023621/,"OBJECTIVE: (1) To compare the rate of contamination of syringes prepared under laminar flow conditions in pharmacy with those prepared by nurses in the emergency department; (2) to determine whether the time elapsed since preparation or number of doses given affected the contamination rate; (3) to determine whether any adverse effects resulted from bacterially contaminated drugs.
METHODS: Prospective, blinded trial exploring the effect of method of preparation, time since preparation, and number of doses given on contamination rates and infective adverse events associated with bacterially contaminated specimens.
RESULTS: The rate of bacterial contamination was 12% (95% confidence interval 6% to 18%). There was no difference in contamination rate in respect of method of preparation, number of doses given, or time since preparation. No infective complications were identified.
CONCLUSIONS: Abandonment of titrated intravenous opioids is not justified by the results. However, there is concern about the use of this technique of pain control for immunocompromised patients and those with prosthetic heart valves."
9023809,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9023809/,"BACKGROUND: Cardiac rehabilitation is an effective intervention, lowering mortality following myocardial infarction and reducing morbidity in patients with coronary heart disease. However, its level of provision was unclear. This study aimed to provide a comprehensive description in Scotland.
METHODS: A national survey of hospital, general practice and community sources was conducted in 1994 to identify cardiac rehabilitation programmes in Scotland. Detailed information about each programme was collected by computer-assisted telephone interviews.
RESULTS: Sixty-nine programmes were identified, providing out-patient cardiac rehabilitation to 4980 patients and in-patient cardiac rehabilitation to 8920 patients. This represented 17 per cent and 30 per cent of patients admitted to hospital with coronary heart disease (excluding heart failure), respectively. There was considerable geographical variation in provision and dependence on sources outside the health service for much funding.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite evidence of benefits from randomized trials, the overall provision of cardiac rehabilitation in Scotland was low. Considerable inequity was demonstrated between different health board areas. There is opportunity for better provision, which would improve care for many patients with coronary heart disease."
9024110,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9024110/,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this research was to test a widely publicized theory that nausea and vomiting of pregnancy protects women from ingesting certain vegetables and other foods that produce congenital anomalies and other adverse outcomes of pregnancy.
STUDY DESIGN: The theory was tested with use of data on dietary intake, illness, and pregnancy outcome obtained from 549 women participating in a prospective, population-based study.
RESULTS: No relationship between intake of proscribed vegetables and other foods and the presence of nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy was identified. Intake of proscribed foods was unrelated to adverse outcomes of pregnancy.
CONCLUSION: It is suggested that claims made in the popular press about food and health relationships should be evaluated by the media as fiction unless supported by scientific research."
9024299,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9024299/,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Calcium phosphate binds unconjugated bilirubin in vitro, and dietary calcium phosphate supplementation reduces the serum bilirubin level in rats with hereditary unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (Gunn rats). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of oral calcium phosphate supplementation on plasma bilirubin levels in patients with Crigler-Najjar disease.
METHODS: A placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover design was used. Eleven patients, 2-42 years of age, participated. The group included 5 patients with type I disease who were all treated with phototherapy and 6 patients with type II disease who were primarily treated with phenobarbital. In addition to plasma bilirubin levels, dietary intake and urinary and fecal excretion of calcium and phosphate were evaluated.
RESULTS: A modest but significant decrease in serum bilirubin was observed in patients with type I disease (18% +/- 6%, P = 0.03) but not in patients with type II disease during treatment with calcium phosphate. Urinary output of calcium and phosphate did not change during the treatment period.
CONCLUSIONS: Oral calcium phosphate may be a useful adjuvant to photo-therapy in Crigler-Najjar type I disease."
9026097,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9026097/,"PURPOSE: The value of 13 MHz ultrasound regarding the preoperative localisation in combination with mammography were investigated into.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: Out of 112 mammaographically detected calcifications, 30 (30 patients) were clusters of microcalcifications. Out of these, 23 were classified as suspicious of malignancy and were preoperatively localised with a 7.5 and 13 MHz probe. Upon marking the skin, a fine needle was inserted, and after due correction blue dye or coal solution was instilled.
RESULTS: Following mammographically shown position, 23 clusters of microcalcifications could be localised using the 13 MHz probe. A localisation with the 7.5 MHz probe was impossible in all cases. A single correction of the needle's site was necessary with 35% (8/23) of patients. The maximum distance of the needle's tip in case of misposition measured 11 mm.
CONCLUSION: Giving a known mammographic position and a sonographic perceptibility of clusters of microcalcifications in a maximal depth of penetration of 2 cm, 13 MHz high resolution ultrasound examination in combination with mammography prove to be a valuable means in facilitating the preoperative localisation."
9028360,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9028360/,"BACKGROUND: This study was conducted to determine if pelvic computed tomography (CT) should routinely be appended to abdominal CT in the workup of patients with breast carcinoma.
METHODS: The abdominal-pelvic CTs of 139 breast carcinoma patients (195 exams) were reviewed. Scans were grouped by indication and whether pelvic pathology was known before CT. Pelvic CT results were correlated with their effect on patient management.
RESULTS: Among the 119 patients without pre-CT evidence of pelvic disease, a nonosseous pelvic metastasis was identified in only 1; this patient also had liver metastases and management was not changed. No unsuspected pelvic CT finding altered therapy for breast carcinoma. However, three patients underwent surgery for asymptomatic masses discovered on pelvic CT; all were benign.
CONCLUSIONS: Pelvic CT is unlikely to affect the management of patients with breast carcinoma by detecting occult metastatic disease."
9030782,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9030782/,"OBJECTIVE: To test prospectively the unsubstantiated claim that patient-specific predictions of time-related outcome after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) from multivariable parametric equations are reliable for medical decision making and for intra- and interdepartmental quality control in surgical training and practice.
METHODS: 3720 survival curves were generated prospectively for all primary, isolated CABG patients operated upon at the Katholieke Universiteit (KU) Leuven between July, 1987 and January, 1992 using the published AHA/ACC guidelines multivariable equation derived from prior KU Leuven experience. The average of these curves (risk-adjusted predicted survival) was compared to the Kaplan-Meier (actual) estimates, overall and for patient subsets. Variables associated with systematic deviation of actual from predicted number of deaths were sought by multivariable residual risk analysis.
RESULTS: Actual overall survival was less good than predicted (P = 0.03) and the excess risk was distributed uniformly across time. The excess risk was not attributable to substantial changes in prevalence of known risk factors. It was attributable largely to a small subset of patients (n = 292) with low-prevalence, but important risk factors not accounted for by the equation (P = 0.7, for difference in survival among the remaining 3428 patients).
CONCLUSIONS: Within the confines of a single institution, patient-specific predictions of outcome after CABG can be made reliably in most patients using multivariable equations developed from a heterogeneous experience, despite changes in prevalence of risk factors. New subsets of high-risk patients, failure or inability to account for important rare risk factors or for institutional changes, may lead to systematic errors of prediction. Under these limitations it is an excellent tool for medical decision making and audit of surgical training and practice."
9030786,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9030786/,"OBJECTIVE: Surgical management is indicated in recurrent forms of pneumothorax and for failure of tube drainage. We have for several years performed pleurodesis and apical blebs stapling by axillary thoracotomy. Thoracoscopy has been a well established procedure for 70 years and recently further developed as the result of current technological progress. For 10 years thoracoscopy has been developed as an alternative to thoracotomy in several indications. Spontaneous pneumothorax is ideally suitable for thoracoscopic management. The aim of this retrospective study is to evaluate this new approach.
METHODS: We compare our results of axillary thoracotomy management of spontaneous pneumothorax in 237 patients (group 1) with those of thoracoscopic management in 101 patients (group 2). Sex distribution, average age, indications and stapling of apical blebs were comparable in both groups.
RESULTS: Etiologies were comparable in both groups. The average operation time was 71 min in group 1 and 57 min in group 2. The average duration of chest tube placement was 8 days in group 1 and 6.5 days in group 2. The mean hospital stay was 14 days in group 1 and 9.5 days in group 2. The overall morbidity was 16 and 11% in groups 1 and 2, respectively. The most frequent complication was early or late failure of pleurodesis which required second drainage or a subsequent operation. Late failure occurred more frequently after thoracoscopy (3 vs. 0.4%) but there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Thoracoscopic management of spontaneous pneumothorax is a safe procedure. Moreover, it offers the benefits of a shorter hospital stay and less postoperative pain."
9030793,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9030793/,"OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study are to describe: (1) The incidence of change in pre-operative rhythm (cardioversion) with mitral valve repair early and at 1 year's review after surgery (late). (2) The characteristics of those patients who remain in atrial fibrillation (AF) or sinus rhythm (SR) at late follow up. (3) The characteristics of those patients whose rhythm is seen to change (cardiovert) from SR to AF, or AF to SR and to remain so at 1 year. In this way it is hoped to more clearly define those patients who would benefit from the combination of mitral valve repair and surgical cardioversion (Cox-maze procedure).
METHODS: Retrospective study was made of the case notes of all patients undergoing mitral repair at our hospital during the 3 years between January 1st, 1991 and December 31st, 1993. Early (hospital discharge) and late (1 year) post operative e.c.g. rhythm was compared to pre-operative e.c.g. rhythm. The study explored the association of cardioversion with pre-operative rhythm, patient age, aetiology of mitral valve lesion (mitral regurgitation or stenosis) and echo cardiographic estimations of left atrial size and left ventricular dimensions.
RESULTS: Patients (89) underwent repair with a 30 day mortality of 2.2% (2 of 89). Of these, 55 were male with an average age of 65 +/- 12 years. Regurgitation was the valvular lesion in 93% and 18% were associated with coronary artery disease, 48 (55%) were in SR before surgery. Both deaths occurred in patients with AF as a pre-operative rhythm. Of the 39 survivors originally in AF, only one was of recent onset ( < 6 months). The frequency of an enlarged left atrium (> or = 5.0 cm) was significantly greater in those with AF compared to SR (P < 0.001). Atrial fibrillation was also associated with increasing age (P = 0.006) and increasing left ventricular end systolic diameter (LVESD; P = 0.018). Spontaneous cardioversion of pre-operative rhythm was common at the time of hospital discharge (AF to SR: 46% and SR to AF: 25%). At the 1 year review after mitral repair only 8 (21%) of those originally in AF were then in sinus rhythm. Eight (17%) of those originally in SR were in AF. A lower left ventricular end systolic diameter (LVESD) was associated with spontaneous cardioversion of AF to SR by one year (P = 0.005). Similarly, patients originally in SR with a lower LVESD continued in SR. Those with a higher value were seen to cardiovert to AF (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Immediately prior to surgery the presence of AF was associated with a tendency to larger left atrial size, older age and a greater LVESD. Cardioversion was common for both patients in AF (46%) and SR (25%) early following conservative mitral surgery. The prevalence of late cardioversion was of a similar order in both those originally in AF (21%) and SR (17%). The maintenance of, or cardioversion to SR seemed to be characterised only by the LVESD. This analysis captures many of the problems of retrospective review. A multi-centre, prospective study is proposed to achieve the aim of an accurate formula predicting long standing cardioversion with mitral valve surgery."
9031783,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9031783/,"BACKGROUND: According to the literature, tinea capitis in adults is supposed to be rare; we have recently observed a significant increase in cases.
METHODS: Epidemiological, clinical and mycological features were studied in all adult tinea capitis diagnosed over 1 year in our department.
RESULTS: Eight cases were observed: 75% of them were women, 50% never traveled and 62.5% had an underlying immunosuppressive disease. Scalp scaling and alopecia were the most frequent clinical features. A zoophilic dermatophyte was recovered in 50% of cases.
CONCLUSION: These cases represent 11% of all tinea capitis observed in the same period of time (higher than the 3-5% observed in the literature). Secretion of sebum and colonization by Pityrosporon orbiculare are supported to protect the scalp against dermatophytic invasion after puberty, but an immune defect may also facilitate hair invasion. The erroneous notion of the disease being uncommon and the frequent atypical clinical presentation require a high degree of clinical suspicion."

METHODS: An observational descriptive study was performed in a large university-affiliated teaching hospital. The suspicion of intrauterine disorders described in theater-reports involving D&C was compared with the hysteroscopical findings in 131 premenopausal patients with persistent complaints of abnormal uterine bleeding who were referred by other gynecologists within six months after D&C. Pre-test probability (prevalence), post-test probabilities (predictive values) and likelihood-ratio's were calculated.
RESULTS: The pre-test probability for all intrauterine disorders was 0.49. The post-test probabilities for a 'suspect' and a 'not suspect' D&C were 0.61 and 0.46 respectively with an overlap of confidence-intervals. The corresponding likelihood-ratio's were 1.69 and 0.87 respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: D&C findings were of no value in the prediction of the presence or absence of intrauterine disorders in this population with persistent complaints."
9033301,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9033301/,"BACKGROUND: There is the potential for left ventricular outflow obstruction when small aortic valve bioprostheses are employed in normal-sized or large adults. It has been hoped that bovine pericardial valves would improve hemodynamic performance in the smaller tissue valve sizes.
METHODS: To determine in vivo hemodynamic performance of heterograft aortic valve prostheses, we analyzed echocardiographic data from patients receiving 21- or 23-mm Carpentier-Edwards pericardial, Medtronic Intact, and Carpentier-Edwards porcine bioprostheses. In addition, data from 19-mm Carpentier-Edwards pericardial valves were included for comparison of hemodynamic performance between valve sizes. Doppler echocardiography was performed in 151 patients within 2 weeks of operation. Left ventricular outflow gradient was derived from continuous Doppler measurements of flow velocity, and effective orifice area was calculated by the continuity equation.
RESULTS: There were statistically significant differences in hemodynamic performance of different sized prostheses for each valve type (effective orifice area, p < 0.01; valvular gradient, p < 0.03). There were, however, no significant differences in effective orifice area or mean gradient for different valve types within each size category.
CONCLUSIONS: The in vivo hemodynamic performance of these three different aortic valve heterograft bioprostheses is similar. Patient-prosthesis mismatch with heterograft prostheses, as demonstrated by the indexed effective orifice area can be avoided by appropriate sizing and use of annular enlarging techniques when necessary."
9034253,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9034253/,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate French, Swiss, and Belgian intensive care physicians' knowledge about the pulmonary artery catheter.
DESIGN: Survey study by questionnaire.
SETTING: Eighty-six European university and nonuniversity intensive care units (ICUs).
SUBJECTS: One hundred thirty-four ICUs identified from the directories of two European intensive care medicine societies were asked to participate. Five hundred thirty-five critical care physicians working in 86 ICUs participated.
INTERVENTIONS: In any particular ICU, all physicians were to complete--simultaneously, anonymously and without prior notice--a multiple choice questionnaire consisting of 31 questions regarding all aspects of bedside pulmonary artery catheterization. This questionnaire was the same one already used and extensively validated in a similar study conducted several years earlier in the United States and Canada.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The percentage of correct answers per participant (score) was tabulated. Sixty-eight percent of respondents still in training (n = 232) believed that their knowledge of the pulmonary artery catheter was less than adequate; 36% of those who had completed their postgraduate training (n = 294) also believed their knowledge to be inadequate. The mean score of all respondents was 72.2 +/- 14.4%, significantly lower (p <.0001) in case of uncompleted postgraduate training (67.3 +/- 14.7%, lower quartile 56.7%, median 70.0%, upper quartile 76.7%), as compared with completed postgraduate training (76.1 +/- 13.0%, lower quartile 70.0%, median 80.0%, upper quartile 86.7%). When using multivariate analysis, the location of the ICU in a university hospital, the belief of respondent that his/her knowledge of the pulmonary artery catheter was adequate, and the responsibility for supervising catheter insertion were the only independent predictors of good performance on the questionnaire (p < .001 for all three variables). It was impossible to identify any subcategory of physicians with a uniformly good knowledge of the pulmonary artery catheter. The proportion of incorrect answers to some basic items was disturbingly high. For instance, approximately 50% of the respondents, whether trained or in training, did not correctly identify pulmonary artery occlusion pressure from a clear chart recording.
CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of right-heart pulmonary artery catheterization is not uniformly good among ICU physicians. Accreditation policies and teaching practices concerning this technique need urgent revision."
9034469,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9034469/,"OBJECTIVE: To set out correctly the law on mandatory reporting of child abuse in each Australian jurisdiction and New Zealand; to argue that all patients should be forewarned of the limits of confidentiality in respect of this; and to discuss the question of whether mandatory reporting is in the best interests of the child.
METHOD: Discussion of statutes mandating reporting of child abuse, duty of confidentiality, the experience of mandatory reporting and failure to comply, forewarning of limits of confidentiality, arguments for and against mandatory reporting, and alternatives.
RESULTS: Not all mental health providers comply with the law, for reasons both altruistic and non-altruistic. Although ethical codes for Australian mental health providers do not require forewarning, ethical practice would seem to do so.
CONCLUSIONS: Mandatory reporting statutes now in force are not necessarily in the best interests of the child. An important clinical implication of the law is that considerations should be given to forewarning patients."
9037233,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9037233/,"BACKGROUND: Because of the well-known negative effects of carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum on the hemodynamic and respiratory system, it was questionable how pneumoperitoneum may affect hepatic and renal blood flow. Therefore the influences of different gases, different intraperitoneal pressures, and different body positions on hepatic and renal blood flow were investigated in a porcine model.
METHODS: Cardiac and hemodynamic function were monitored by means of implanted catheters in the pulmonary artery and the femoral vein and artery. Renal and hepatic blood flow were recorded with a transonic volume flow meter placed at the renal and hepatic arteries and the portal vein. Eighteen animals were randomly assigned to receive one of three insufflation gases (carbon dioxide [CO2], argon, or helium. After baseline recording, one of three intraperitoneal pressures (8, 12, or 16 mm Hg) and one of three body positions (supine head up, or head down) were randomly chosen. After an adaptation time of 15 minutes, all data were recorded for 15 minutes. This was repeated until all nine combinations had been investigated. The end points of the study were blood flow in the hepatic and renal arteries and the portal vein, cardial output, systemic vascular resistance, and central venous pressure.
RESULTS: Total liver blood flow was reduced on relation to intraabdominal pressure, head-up position, and argon insufflation. Arterial hepatic blood flow was reduced by the head-up position and argon insufflation. Portal venous blood flow decreased with the pig in the head-up position, with increased intraabdominal pressure, and argon insufflation. Renal blood flow was reduced by the head-up position and increased pressure. There was no correlation (p < 0.6) between systemic hemodynamic parameters (cardiac output, central venous pressure, and systemic vascular resistance) and hepatic and renal blood flow.
CONCLUSIONS: Head-up position and intraperitoneal pressure greater than 12 mm Hg should be avoided during laparoscopic surgery because they compromise hepatic and renal blood flow. Argon insufflation impairs liver blood flow. However, helium may be advantageous compared with CO2 insufflation."
9037338,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9037338/,"INTRODUCTION: Prevention is being promoted as a means to improve health status and to save health care costs. Economic evaluations of prevention (i.e., cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analyses) indicate that some prevention activities, like many treatments, do not save money, although many are relatively cost-effective. It has been suggested, however, that prevention is held to a higher standard than treatment because prevention programs are expected to demonstrate cost savings, and that the methods of economic evaluation understate the cost-effectiveness of prevention. Although the converse assertion is less commonly made, economic evaluations may also overstate the cost-effectiveness of prevention. The purpose of this article is to examine how the methods of economic evaluation may systematically understate, or overstate, the cost-effectiveness (or net benefits) of prevention.
METHODS: We examine three key methods: (1) how future costs and benefits are valued (""discounting""), (2) how costs and benefits to people beyond those who are the users of prevention are valued (""externalities""), and (3) how nonmonetary costs and benefits to individuals are valued (""intangibles"").
RESULTS: We discuss several recommendations for each key method, and we use a hypothetical example of the cost-effectiveness of a vaccine to prevent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) to illustrate our points.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the methods of economic evaluation may both understate and overstate the cost-effectiveness of prevention."

SETTING: In the south-west region of Ireland, a mixed urban and rural community (pop. 536,000), there is a residuum of human tuberculosis caused by M. bovis.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the incidence of culture-positive M. bovis disease in humans in south-west Ireland from 1983 to 1994 and of the results of tuberculin testing in cattle from 1978 to 1994 for the same region.
RESULTS: One to five cases of human tuberculosis due to M. bovis were recorded per year while the overall prevalence of bovine infection fell gradually during the period of study from 467 tuberculin-positive animals per 100,000 cattle tested in 1983 to 158 per 100,000 in 1994.
CONCLUSION: The low incidence plateau of human tuberculosis due to M. bovis together with the decline in prevalence of animal infection in the overall period studied suggest a cut-off in the animal to human chain of infection at two points; the animal source and the ingestion of (now pasteurized) milk. This would suggest that disease in humans is now due to reactivation of previous foci of infection which were acquired when milk pasteurization was not compulsory. Based on this, we would anticipate a further reduction and possible elimination of human tuberculosis due to M. bovis in this region in the next 10-15 years."
9040137,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9040137/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there is an association between spinal cord injury and ""atraumatic"" osteolysis of the distal clavicle.
PATIENTS AND DESIGN: Seventy-seven consecutive spinal cord injury patients without upper extremity injuries were studied. Of these, 39 each had a pair of chest radiographs--one at admission and one at least 1 month later--which included both acromioclavicular joints. Each radiograph was evaluated by two independent musculoskeletal radiologists, who were masked as to which radiograph was the baseline.
RESULTS: Ten of 76 acromioclavicular joints demonstrated osteolysis of the distal clavicle: three bilateral, three left side only, and one right side only. There was one case in which the admission radiograph was read as osteolysis but reverted to normal at 35 months follow-up.
CONCLUSION: There is an apparent association between spinal cord injury and osteolysis of the distal clavicle."
9040200,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9040200/,"OBJECTIVES: To compare cure rates of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection, ulcer healing, and side effects of three simplified regimens of triple therapy in patients with peptic ulcer disease.
METHODS: Two hundred thirty-one patients were prospectively randomized to receive either regimen OAM (omeprazole 20 mg b.i.d., amoxicillin 750 mg b.i.d., and metronidazole 400 g b.i.d.), OCM (omeprazole 20 mg b.i.d., clarithromycin 250 mg b.i.d., and metronidazole 400 mg b.i.d.), or BCM (bismuth subcitrate 240 mg b.i.d., clarithromycin 250 mg b.i.d., and metronidazole 400 mg b.i.d.), all for 10 days. Side effects were reported immediately afterward in a self-administered questionnaire. Upper endoscopy was carried out before treatment and 2 months after treatment. Three antral and three corpus biopsy specimens were analyzed microbiologically and with rapid urease test to determine the presence of H. pylori. Altogether 143 patients (62%) had an active ulcer at start of treatment. Metronidazole resistant (M-R) H. pylori strains were found in 30% of patients, while none had clarithromycin resistant (C-R) strains.
RESULTS: According to intention-to-treat analysis, H. pylori cure rates were 91, 95, and 95% with OAM, OCM, and BCM, respectively (p = 0.63). In patients with metronidazole-sensitive (M-S) strains versus M-R strains, the cure rates were 96 versus 77% with OAM (p = 0.025), 94 versus 94% with OCM, and 94 versus 96% with BCM. Ulcer healing rates were 95, 94, and 92%, respectively (p = 0.91). There were no significant differences in side effects between the regimens, and only five patients (2%) had to stop the treatment prematurely.
CONCLUSIONS: All treatment regimens were highly effective for cure of H. pylori infection and for ulcer healing. Metronidazole resistance reduced the efficacy of OAM, but was of no importance for the efficacy of OCM or BCM. Side effects were of minor importance."
9040203,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9040203/,"UNLABELLED: Accurate measurement of intragastric acidity has both clinical and investigational importance in studying gastric pathophysiology.
OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were fourfold: (1) to investigate whether regional differences in intragastric acidity exist; (2) to determine intragastric acidity after a standard antacid was administered in both the fasting and fed states; (3) to monitor gastric emptying of and anatomic distribution of radiolabeled antacid during fasting and postprandial periods; and (4) to determine whether the regional effects of ingested antacid correlated with the anatomic distribution of the antacid.
METHODS: Eight normal male volunteers were studied after fluoroscopically guided nasogastric placement of a tube assembly containing four pH electrodes, with one electrode in each quartile of the stomach. Simultaneous pH readings were made from the four electrodes while fasting, after administration of fasting antacid (30 ml, 79 mEq buffering capacity), postprandially, and after postprandial antacid ingestion. All subjects repeated the protocol on a separate day, five of them using radiolabeled antacid. Gastric emptying and gastric distribution over time of radiolabeled antacid were determined for comparison to regional intragastric acidity.
RESULTS: Intragastric acidity varied regionally over time in response to meals and to fasting and postprandial antacid. In the fasting state, intragastric acidity returned to baseline after antacid ingestion in a proximal to distal (cardia to antrum) sequence, while postprandial antacid resulted in a return to baseline acidity in a distal to proximal (antrum to cardia) sequence. Radiolabeled antacid distribution paralleled intragastric pH and hydrogen ion concentration in the fasting state, with 82% of the antacid localizing in the distal half of the stomach within the first minute after antacid ingestion. Postprandially, the greatest initial and most prolonged antacid buffering effect occurred proximally, correlating with the presence of radiolabeled antacid. Postprandial antacid remained in the stomach for a longer time (T1/2 = 93.1 +/- 23.4 min) compared with fasting antacid (T1/2 = 23.6 +/- 11.1 min).
CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of acidity in the four quartiles of the stomach demonstrated regional variation in response to both food and a standard antacid. A single pH electrode does not detect regional intragastric pH differences."
9040326,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9040326/,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the effectiveness of routine clinic review in detecting relapse after treatment for Hodgkin's disease.
DESIGN: Review of hospital records.
SETTING: Regional centre for cancer treatment and research.
SUBJECTS: 210 patients with Hodgkin's disease recruited to a chemotherapy trial protocol between 1984 and the end of 1990 who had achieved a complete or partial remission after treatment.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The number of clinic visits made by patients over the period of observation, the number of relapses occurring during that time, and the route by which relapse was detected.
RESULTS: The 210 patients generated 2512 outpatient reviews, and 37 relapses were detected. Thirty relapses (81%) were diagnosed in patients who described symptoms, which in 15 cases had resulted in an earlier appointment being arranged. In only four cases (11%; 95% confidence interval 4% to 25%) was relapse detected as a result of routine physical examination on investigation of a patient who did not have symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: Relapse of Hodgkin's disease after treatment is usually detected as a result of the investigation of symptoms rather than by routine screening of asymptomatic patients. It is therefore proposed that the frequency of routine follow up visits should be reduced and greater emphasis placed on patient education. This should underline the importance of symptoms and encourage patients to arrange an earlier appointment if these develop."

DESIGN: Prospective study.
SETTING: Two Scottish Premier League football grounds.
SUBJECTS: 10 healthy men, each a supporter of one of two clubs.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate at home, while walking, and during the match.
RESULTS: Systolic blood pressure and heart rate were significantly higher when the men were watching the match than when they were at home. While they were watching the match, heart rate was maximal immediately after a goal had been scored by the supported team.
CONCLUSION: The emotional stress invoked by Scottish football is associated with significant increases in heart rate and systolic blood pressure."
1774050,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1774050/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether women who have a history of genital warts or whose sexual partners have such a history were more likely to have borderline or dyskaryotic cervical smears than other women.
DESIGN: Prospective study conducted over a five month period.
SETTING: A genitourinary medicine clinic in Cambridge, UK.
PATIENTS: One hundred and eighty five women who attended the clinic during the study period, on whom cervical cytology was performed. Ninety-seven had a history of genital warts and twenty had partners with genital warts.
METHODS: Cervical cytology taken by standard methods. Demographic data and sexual history obtained by questionnaire. Colposcopy was performed on patients with a history of warts or wart contact.
OUTCOME MEASURED: Relative incidence of cytological abnormalities in the various groups of patients.
RESULTS: ""Borderline"" nuclear change was the most frequent abnormality reported in the wart contact group (six cases) whereas mild dyskaryosis was the most frequent abnormal finding in those women with a history of warts (21 cases).
CONCLUSIONS: Women with warts or contact with genital warts were more likely to have borderline or dyskaryotic cervical smears than women without such a history. Recommendations for follow-up of these patients are made."
1777457,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1777457/,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between fatal myocardial infarction and use of modern low-dose oral contraceptives.
DESIGN: A case-control study.
SETTING: General practices throughout England and Wales.
SUBJECTS: 161 women aged under 40 dying from myocardial infarction during 1986-1988. Living controls (2 per case), matched for age and marital status, were chosen from general practice lists. Information was collected during structured interviews with general practitioners, and from postal questionnaires sent to surviving partners of the cases and to control women.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mortality from myocardial infarction in relation to many risk factors, notably oral contraception, as measured by relative risk.
RESULTS: After allowing for the confounding effects of medical risk factors and for surgical sterilization, the overall relative risk associated with both current and past use of oral contraceptives was estimated to be 1.9 (95% CI 0.7 to 4.9, and 1.0 to 3.5 respectively). The relative risk associated with current use of preparations containing 50 micrograms of oestrogen, however, was estimated to be 4.2 (0.5 to 39.2). At least some of the relative risk associated with oral contraceptive use is likely to be attributable to the confounding effect of cigarette smoking, but it is impossible to estimate how much from the available data.
CONCLUSIONS: If there was an increased risk of fatal myocardial infarction associated with oral contraceptive use in 1986-1988 it is likely to have been less than two-fold; in this study risks were slightly, but not significantly, elevated with both current and previous use. It may be that any increase in risk is associated solely with the older combined preparations containing 50 micrograms of oestrogen."
1792447,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1792447/,"UNLABELLED: The aim of the study was to relate the physical signs of the chest to the degree of airflow obstruction in asthma and COPD.
METHODS: 113 patients with COPD and 76 patients with asthma were recruited from general practice. A standard physical examination of the chest was performed by trained medical students. Physical signs were related to the degree of airflow obstruction.
RESULTS: the signs correlating closely with the degree of airflow obstruction were: a prolonged expiratory phase, low-standing diaphragm, decreased expiratory breath sounds, noisy inspiratory sounds, and decreased diaphragmatic excursions. There was a fair correlation between the number of physical signs and the degree of airflow obstruction. This was especially the case in asthma (r = 0.62), but it was less clear in COPD (r = 0.45). Sensitivity of separate physical signs to detect airflow obstruction was less than 50%, but at least one of the signs was present in 70% of the patients with obstruction. Specificity of separate signs was more than 85%, apart from wheezing in asthma.
CONCLUSION: the combination of physical signs can offer relevant information in monitoring the severity of airflow obstruction in asthma and COPD."
1524266,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1524266/,"BACKGROUND: Isolation gowns have traditionally been used in health care situations to protect against microbial contamination. There is now concern over protection of the health care worker from contamination by patients' blood and body fluids. We quantitatively determined the effectiveness of commercially available isolation gowns against human blood leakage or strike through.
METHODS: More than 1200 samples of 11 types of disposable gown and one type of reusable gown (new and washed 40 and 80 times) were tested at five different pressures (0.25 to 2 psi) and six durations (1 second to 2 minutes) by means of an apparatus designed to simulate pressures generated during gown usage.
RESULTS: In all studied conditions, testing showed significant differences (p less than 0.0001) in the amount of strike through allowed by the gowns and demonstrated important differences in the gowns' protective capabilities.
CONCLUSION: Although traditional thought assumes that isolation gowns protect the wearer from contamination, our data show this belief may provide a false sense of security."
1527287,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1527287/,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the long-term outcome and multivariate predictors of late events in patients who underwent transventricular mitral commissurotomy at the Mayo Clinic in the early 1960s.
BACKGROUND: Percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty is an important new procedure for which long-term follow-up data are not yet available. However, such data do exist for patients who have undergone transventricular mitral commissurotomy, a similar but older and more invasive procedure.
METHODS: Follow-up data (mean duration 13.9 years) for 207 women and 60 men who underwent transventricular mitral commissurotomy were obtained from medical records, referring physicians, questionnaires and telephone interviews. Survival and survival free of repeat commissurotomy or mitral valve surgery were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine predictors of survival and repeat mitral valve surgery.
RESULTS: Postoperatively, 92% of patients had symptomatic improvement, which was sustained for at least 3 to 4 years in 78%. At 10, 15 and 20 years postoperatively, 79%, 67% and 55%, respectively, of patients were alive and 57%, 36% and 24%, respectively, were alive and free of repeat mitral valve surgery. At 10 years, 90% of all patients were free of transient or fixed cerebrovascular events. In multivariate analyses, atrial fibrillation, age and male gender were independently associated with death, whereas mitral valve calcification, cardiomegaly and mitral regurgitation independently predicted repeat mitral valve surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term results after transventricular mitral commissurotomy are excellent in selected patients with symptomatic mitral stenosis. Because of similarities in patient selection and mechanisms of mitral valve dilation, similar favorable long-term outcomes may be expected after percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty."

STUDY DESIGN: Medical records of 246 consecutive women treated over a 3-year period for primary cervical cancer were reviewed. Frequency of recurrence was the outcome measure of interest and subjected to chi 2 analysis.
RESULTS: Only eight patients had improved survival from treatment modifications based on computed tomography findings. Eight patients underwent additional surgical procedures because of computed tomography findings that proved to be erroneous.
CONCLUSIONS: Considering the high cost and limited benefit, computed tomography for cervical cancer staging is not recommended."
1530200,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1530200/,"OBJECTIVE: To appraise the measurement properties of the Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) classification of stable angina pectoris.
DATA SOURCES: Relevant articles were identified through a MEDLINE search (1976 to November 1991). Bibliographies of retrieved articles were also reviewed.
STUDY SELECTION: Studies chosen directly addressed the validity and reliability of the CCS scale. Recent studies and reviews of related topics (for example, silent ischemia) are selectively cited.
DATA SYNTHESIS: No data address the scale's applicability, that is, how clinicians typically assign angina grades in practice. Comprehensiveness would be improved by coverage of the patient's perceptions of symptom burden; mixed exertional and rest symptoms; episodic or changing symptoms; and modifying factors. Reliability was assessed in one study with two clinicians; the interobserver, chance-corrected agreement on patient grading was 60%. Content validity (the ability of the scale to measure what it claims) is threatened by the unproven assumption of symptomatic or physiologic equivalence among diverse levels of different activities within any given grade of angina. Construct validity is uncertain, given weak relations between angina grade and noninvasive markers of ischemia, anatomical disease, or prognosis. The scale's responsiveness (the ability to detect the smallest clinically important changes) is limited by the reliance on four coarse gradations based on only ambulation or stair-climbing.
CONCLUSIONS: The CCS scale for stable angina might be made more useful by developing measurements for patients' self-rated symptom burden and the changes they deem important; by adding items on clinical instability (that is, progressive symptoms or pain at rest); and by empirically testing the current scale to eliminate redundant or inconsistent elements."
1530806,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1530806/,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between an exaggerated exercise systolic blood pressure response and the occurrence of left ventricular hypertrophy in healthy, normotensive individuals.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey using M-mode echocardiography to measure left ventricular mass and to detect left ventricular hypertrophy.
SETTING: The Framingham Heart Study.
SUBJECTS: Eight-hundred sixty men and 1118 women were studied who were free of cardiovascular or pulmonary disease, who were not taking any antihypertensive or cardiovascular medications, and who successfully achieved at least 90% of their age-predicted maximum heart rate during a monitored exercise treadmill test. All subjects had normal baseline and exercise electrocardiograms.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Men with a peak exercise systolic blood pressure of 210 or more and women with a peak exercise systolic blood pressure of 190 or more were considered to have an ""exaggerated"" blood pressure response; 122 men and 67 women met these criteria. Subjects with an exaggerated exercise systolic blood pressure response had 10% higher left ventricular mass than those with a normal exercise systolic blood pressure response (in men: 115 +/- 25 compared with 105 +/- 24 g/m, P less than 0.001; in women: 86 +/- 22 compared with 73 +/- 16 g/m, P less than 0.001); they also had a higher prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy (in men: odds ratio, 1.34, 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.80; in women: odds ratio, 2.12, CI, 1.48 to 3.03). After adjusting for age, resting systolic blood pressure, and body mass index, however, subjects with an exaggerated exercise systolic blood pressure response had only 5% higher left ventricular mass (in men: 111 +/- 2.1 compared with 106 +/- 0.8 g/m, P = 0.02; in women: 80 +/- 1.8 compared with 74 +/- 0.4 g/m, P = 0.002), and they no longer had a statistically increased prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy (in men: odds ratio, 1.21, CI, 0.87 to 1.67; in women: odds ratio, 1.30, CI, 0.84 to 2.01).
CONCLUSIONS: The apparent relation between exercise systolic blood pressure response and left ventricular mass is confounded by age, resting systolic blood pressure, and body mass; the degree of confounding is such that the biologic significance of this relationship should be questioned."
1530808,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1530808/,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether published cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analyses have adhered to basic analytic principles.
DESIGN: Structured methodologic review of published articles.
STUDY SAMPLE: Seventy-seven articles published either from 1978 to 1980 or from 1985 to 1987 in general medical, general surgical, and medical subspecialty journals.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Articles were reviewed to assess the use and reporting of six fundamental principles of analysis. These principles were derived by reviewing widely cited textbooks and articles describing the methods for performing economic analyses and by selecting the methods universally recommended.
MAIN RESULTS: Overall performance was only fair. Three articles adhered to all six principles, and the median number of principles to which articles adhered was three. Among the problems noted were failure to make underlying assumptions explicit and, therefore, verifiable, and failure to test assumptions with sensitivity analyses. No improvement in performance was observed between 1978 and 1987. Articles in general medical journals, however, were more likely to use analytic methods appropriately than articles in the general surgical or medical subspecialty literature.
CONCLUSIONS: Greater attention should be devoted to ensuring the appropriate use of analytic methods for economic analyses, and readers should make note of the methods used when interpreting the results of economic analyses."
1531572,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1531572/,"OBJECTIVE: If maximum cytoreductive surgery benefits the survival of women with advanced ovarian cancer, the median survival time of groups of such women will improve as the proportion of women undergoing maximum cytoreductive surgery is increased.
STUDY DESIGN: Fifty-eight suitable studies that encompass 6962 patients with advanced ovarian cancer were identified. Multiple linear regression was used to analyze the effects on median survival time of the following variables: the proportion of each cohort undergoing maximum cytoreductive surgery, the use of platinum-containing chemotherapy, the dose intensity of chemotherapy, the proportion of each cohort with stage IV disease, and the year of publication of the study.
RESULTS: Maximum cytoreductive surgery was associated with only a small improvement in median survival time, but platinum-containing chemotherapy improved median survival time substantially. Increased dose intensity also conferred a useful survival benefit.
CONCLUSION: Cytoreductive surgery probably has only a small effect on the survival of women with advanced ovarian cancer. The type of chemotherapy used is more important."
1535419,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1535419/,"BACKGROUND: Medical practice patterns change in response to a variety of stimuli, one of which may be the publication of the results of randomized clinical trials. We assessed the temporal association between the publication of clinical trials on myocardial infarction and changes in treatment practices for this disorder.
METHODS: We analyzed the use of aspirin before and after myocardial infarction and that of calcium antagonists after myocardial infarction in 2231 survivors of myocardial infarction enrolled in the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE) study over a three-year period (from January 1987 through January 1990). The proportion of patients using these treatments was analyzed before and after the publication dates of three clinical trials: the Physicians' Health Study, published in January 1988, which supported the use of aspirin to prevent a first myocardial infarction; the Second International Study of Infarct Survival (ISIS-2), published in August 1988, which supported the use of aspirin after myocardial infarction; and the Multicenter Diltiazem Postinfarction Trial, published in August 1988, which reported a deleterious effect of diltiazem in some patients after myocardial infarction.
RESULTS: The use of aspirin before myocardial infarction increased from 16.2 percent to 23.9 percent between January 1987 and January 1990 (P less than 0.001). Enrollment in the study after the publication of the Physicians' Health Study independently predicted aspirin use before myocardial infarction (odds ratio, 1.43; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.11 to 1.85). The use of aspirin after myocardial infarction increased from 38.8 percent to 71.9 percent (P less than 0.001) during the three-year study period. Enrollment in the study after the publication of ISIS-2 independently predicted the use of aspirin after myocardial infarction (odds ratio, 2.28; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.89 to 2.76). The use of calcium antagonists after myocardial infarction decreased from 57.1 percent to 33.1 percent (P less than 0.001) during the study period. Enrollment in the study after the publication of the Multicenter Diltiazem Postinfarction Trial independently predicted the use of calcium antagonists after myocardial infarction (odds ratio, 0.47; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.39 to 0.57).
CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest that randomized clinical trials have a measurable influence on medical practice patterns."
1535568,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1535568/,"BACKGROUND: Cilazapril is a novel angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor with antiproliferative effects in the rat model after balloon injury.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial to assess the effect of cilazapril in angiographic restenosis prevention after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Patients received cilazapril 2.5 mg in the evening after successful PTCA and 5 mg b.i.d. for 6 months or matched placebo. In addition, all patients received aspirin for 6 months. Coronary angiograms before PTCA, after PTCA, and at 6-month follow-up were quantitatively analyzed. In 94% of 735 recruited patients, PTCA was successful and all inclusion and exclusion criteria were met. For the per-protocol analysis, quantitative angiography after PTCA and at follow-up was available in 595 patients who complied with the treatment regimen (309 control, 286 cilazapril). The mean difference in minimal coronary lumen diameter between post-PTCA and follow-up angiogram (primary end point) was -0.29 +/- 0.49 mm in the control group and -0.27 +/- 0.51 mm in the cilazapril group. Clinical events during 6-month follow-up, analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis, were ranked according to the most serious clinical event ranging from death (control, two; cilazapril, three), nonfatal myocardial infarction (control, eight; cilazapril, 5), coronary revascularization (control, 51; cilazapril, 53), or recurrent angina requiring medical therapy (control, 67; cilazapril, 68) to none of the above (control, 224; cilazapril, 212). There were no significant differences in ranking.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition with cilazapril in a dose of 5 mg b.i.d. does not prevent restenosis and does not favorably influence the overall clinical outcome after PTCA."

1540363,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1540363/,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of using a heated humidifier (HH), a heat and moisture exchanger (HME), or no warming device in maintaining body temperature during surgical procedures of 1 to 4 hours' duration.
DESIGN: A randomized, controlled study.
SETTING: Operating room, Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, Philadelphia, PA.
PATIENTS: 51 ASA physical status I, II, and III patients, age 16 to 69 years, scheduled for a variety of lower abdominal procedures under general endotracheal anesthesia anticipated to last 1 to 4 hours.
INTERVENTIONS: We randomly assigned patients to receiving an HH, an HME, or no warming device during the procedure. We then measured the patient's sublingual temperature every 5 minutes prior to induction, every 15 minutes intraoperatively, and every 15 minutes postoperatively until he or she was discharged from the postanesthesia care unit, (PACU). We also measured the esophageal temperature every 15 minutes intraoperatively.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Sublingual temperature or esophageal temperature probes placed at the site of maximal heart tones indicated that the patients' temperatures dropped significantly from baseline values in all three groups during the first 60 minutes of surgery, then remained constant during the next 120 minutes of surgery. Patients who had no warming device shivered and felt cold significantly more often than patients in the HH group but not more often than patients in the HME group. There was no difference in shivering between the HH and HME groups. The patients who received an HH tended to have a higher temperature (a mean of 0.5 degrees C) throughout the study, but this did not reach statistical significance.
CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that these warming devices provide little benefit in preventing a temperature drop during procedures of 1 to 4 hours' duration, although patients with an HH tended to have a higher temperature than those with an HME or no device."
1540364,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1540364/,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To establish the frequency of large visible bubbles or collections of bubbles in the jugular vein during radical neck dissection in the supine position.
DESIGN: Prospective observation by at least two investigators of random consecutive patients scheduled for radical neck surgery.
SETTING: Operating room suite in a university hospital specializing in head and neck cancer surgery.
PATIENTS: Twelve consecutive ASA physical status II and III patients undergoing modified radical dissection for cancer.
INTERVENTIONS: General anesthesia with fentanyl, oxygen (O2) 30% to 40%, nitrous oxide (N2O) 60% to 70%, and isoflurane 0.5% to 1.5%, with mechanical ventilation. Table position horizontal. Modified radical neck dissections performed by attending surgeons. Surgical field (jugular vein) carefully observed by the surgeons and an independent anesthesiologist investigator for the presence of bubbles during the dissection.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Easily visible bubbles were observed in the jugular veins of 42% (5 of 12) of the consecutive radical neck dissection patients studied. Some of the collections of bubbles were large (greater than 2.5 cm in diameter). In one case, the appearance and subsequent disappearance of bubbles was followed by a transient drop in arterial blood pressure (BP) and in end-tidal carbon dioxide (PETCO2), which was suggestive of a diagnosis of central venous air embolization.
CONCLUSIONS: We theorize that some unexplained, undesirable intraoperative events (hypotension, arrhythmia, and hypoxemia) during radical neck dissection could be a result of venous air embolus or paradoxical air embolus. The anesthesia community should be aware of the high frequency of these visible bubbles in the jugular veins during radical neck surgery, even in the supine position. At minimum, this phenomenon is a frequent event of intellectual interest. At worst, these bubbles may be harbingers of significant central air embolism."
1540435,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1540435/,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the accuracy of four enzymatic tests, including early release rates of creatine kinase and alpha-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, in assessing coronary reperfusion after thrombolytic therapy.
DESIGN: A prospective clinical trial identifying patients with a successful thrombolytic treatment.
PATIENTS: Eighty nine patients with acute myocardial infarction were studied. Arteriography showed a closed infarct related artery in all of them. Reperfusion due to thrombolysis occurred in 74 patients and there was no reperfusion in 15 patients.
RESULTS: The 74 patients showing coronary reperfusion had a significantly shorter time to peak creatine kinase activity, higher early release rates for creatine kinase and alpha-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, and a more rapid release of alpha-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (ratio of cumulative release of alpha-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase during the first 24 hours to that 72 hours after infarction). All these differences were statistically significant (p less than 0.001). Optimum cut off levels were determined with decision level plots and the accuracy of the four enzymatic tests was calculated. Accuracy was low for all four tests (73%, 70%, 70%, and 82%).
CONCLUSION: None of the four enzymatic tests accurately predicted the perfusion state of the infarct related coronary artery after thrombolysis. These tests cannot be used reliably in routine clinical practice as non-angiographic markers of coronary reperfusion."
1541137,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1541137/,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: To assess specialists' adaptation to long waiting lists for coronary revascularization, and their acceptance of a formal queue-ordering schema proposed by an expert panel.
DESIGN: Mail survey of practitioners in referral centers using 49 hypothetical case scenarios. Scenarios were rated for maximum acceptable delay prior to coronary surgery, on a scale with seven interventional time frames graded from emergency to three to six months' permissible delay. The survey included the proposed schema and rating system; respondents were invited to differ as they saw fit. HYPOTHETICAL PATIENTS: Assumed uniformly to be middle aged with typical angina, but clinical factors varied, eg, severity and stability of angina, response to medical therapy, coronary anatomy, and noninvasive test results. PHYSICIAN SUBJECTS: There were 122 respondents, for a 60 percent response rate, including a majority of cardiac surgeons and invasive cardiologists on staff in Ontario teaching hospitals.
MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Fifty-seven percent rated some scenarios for acceptable waiting times of three to six months; another 39 percent rated their least urgent scenarios to wait six weeks to three months. Interpractitioner agreement was high: for 48/49 scenarios, at least 75 percent of urgency ratings fell within two contiguous points on the scale. Symptom status was the dominant determinant of waiting time, with mean maximum acceptable wait of 74 days for patients with mild-moderate stable angina but three days for those receiving parenteral nitroglycerin (p less than 0.00001). About half the ratings matched those predicted based on the original panel's consensus criteria; 90 percent were within one scale point.
CONCLUSIONS: Specialist practitioners in Ontario have adapted to waiting lists for coronary artery bypass surgery/percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, and assess the priority of hypothetical patients in similar ways and in reasonable accord with formal queue-ordering criteria. This behavior may help mitigate the impact of resource constraints, allowing delay of services for those with less acute need--a potential contrast to delayed access in America based on low income or lack of insurance."
1543180,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1543180/,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between stage of sexual maturation and eating disorder symptoms in a community-based sample of adolescent girls.
PARTICIPANTS: All sixth- and seventh-grade girls (N = 971) enrolled in four northern California middle schools.
MAIN VARIABLES EXAMINED: Pubertal development measured using self-reported Tanner stage and body mass index (kg/m2). The section of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R Disorders (SCID) discussing bulimia nervosa was used to evaluate symptoms of bulimia nervosa.
RESULTS: Girls manifesting eating disorder symptoms, while not significantly older than their peers without such symptoms, were more developmentally advanced as determined with Tanner self-staging. The odds ratio for the association between sexual maturity and symptoms was 1.8 (95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 2.8); ie, at each age, an increase in sexual maturity of a single point was associated with a 1.8-fold increase in the odds of presenting symptoms. The odds ratio for the association between body mass index (adjusted for sexual maturity) and symptoms was 1.02 (95% confidence interval, 1.0 to 1.05). There was no independent effect of age or of the interaction between age and the sexual maturity index.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that (1) puberty may be a risk factor for the development of eating disorders, and (2) prevention efforts might best be directed at prepubertal and peripubertal adolescents."
1547164,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1547164/,"OBJECTIVE: To test whether a policy of admission to hospital for rest is of value in the management of women with non-proteinuric hypertension during pregnancy.
DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial.
SETTING: Harare Maternity Hospital, Zimbabwe.
SUBJECTS: 218 (28 first pregnancies) women with non-proteinuric hypertension and a singleton pregnancy at between 28 and 38 weeks gestation allocated to rest in hospital or routine outpatient care.
INTERVENTION: Admission to hospital for rest. Encouraged to rest in bed although voluntary ambulation around the ward was allowed. The women in the control group were encouraged to continue normal activity at home, to check urine each day for proteinuria. All the women were reviewed weekly.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Disease progression was assessed by the development of severe hypertension (greater than or equal to 160/110 mmHg), development of proteinuria, need for induction of labour and number of infants born preterm (less than 37 weeks). Fetal outcome was assessed by birthweight, number of infants small-for-gestational age (SGA), and the number of infants requiring admission to the neonatal unit and their length of stay.
RESULTS: The hospital rest group had a decreased risk of developing severe hypertension (blood pressure greater than or equal to 160/110 mmHg [odds ratio 0.47, 95% CI 0.26-0.83]). No differences were found in fetal growth or neonatal morbidity. The mean antenatal stay in hospital was 22.2 (SD 16.5), and 6.5 (SD 7.9) days in the rest and control groups, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Hospital admission for bed rest decreased the risk of developing severe hypertension but no improvement in fetal growth or neonatal morbidity was observed. Fetal monitoring at home and continued outpatient antenatal care provided a safe, alternative policy to hospital admission."

DESIGN: A retrospective review of all Stage I ovarian cancer patients registered from 1.1.80 to 31.12.84.
SETTING: West Midlands Regional Cancer Registry.
POPULATION: 457 patients with Stage I ovarian cancer--373 with epithelial ovarian carcinoma.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Survival at censor date of 30.6.89.
RESULTS: 28% developed recurrent disease, and the overall 5-year survival of the group was 70%. Univariate analysis of all possible prognostic factors showed that stage, adjuvant chemotherapy, histological grade and type, surgical rupture of the tumour, intact capsule histologically, clinical finding of ascites and the performance of peritoneal washings were significantly associated with survival. Adequate surgical staging as defined by FIGO was not significantly associated with survival. A multivariate analysis based on the Cox proportional hazard model identified histological grade, adjuvant chemotherapy, patient age and peritoneal washings as having independent prognostic effects. Surprisingly adjuvant chemotherapy and peritoneal washings had negative effects on survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Although a retrospective review has limitations, it would appear that adequate surgical staging and adjuvant chemotherapy confer no benefit in terms of survival in Stage I disease."
1550174,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1550174/,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to examine whether the acid-base balance in amniotic fluid reflects the acid-base state in fetal blood.
STUDY DESIGN: The pH, PCO2, PO2, bicarbonate, and base excess concentrations were measured in umbilical venous, umbilical arterial, and maternal venous blood and in amniotic fluid samples obtained at fetoscopy. This was performed before intraamniotic termination of 16 normal pregnancies (mean gestation 19.4 weeks), as well as in 14 red blood cell isoimmunized pregnancies (mean gestation 28.4 weeks) undergoing fetoscopy for the diagnosis and treatment of fetal anemia.
RESULTS: In normal pregnancies, amniotic fluid pH and bicarbonate were significantly lower than umbilical venous and umbilical arterial blood concentrations, and this was due to the high concentration of base deficit in amniotic fluid. Whereas amniotic fluid PCO2 did correlate significantly with fetal umbilical venous PCO2 values, there was no correlation between other acid-base characteristics.
CONCLUSION: Simultaneous sampling of human fetal umbilical blood and amniotic fluid under the acute conditions of this study did not show significant correlations in acid-base values."

METHODS: PFT records and medical history of 49 patients with diagnosis of PVFMD and 39 patients with SGS were compared. Groups were then subdivided to compare PFTs in patients with and without smoking history or lung disease.
RESULTS: Peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) and Expiratory Disproportion Index (ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) over PEFR (FEV1/PEFR)) were both significantly different between patients with SGS and those with PVFMD (p<0.02). FEV1 was also significantly different, but only in the patients with no smoking history or lung disease (p<0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that spirometry can be a valuable tool in distinguishing SGS from PVFMD. Previous studies have shown the utility of PFTs for distinguishing SGS from pulmonary pathology, but this is the first study to exploit PFTs for distinction of SGS from PVFMD. Given that the flexible laryngoscopic exam used to diagnose PVFMD does not always visualize the subglottis completely, PFTs can be used to increase suspicion of SGS and direct further work-up."
27553602,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27553602/,"PURPOSE: To report interim results from a single-institution study conducted to assess accelerated hypofractionated radiotherapy (AHRT) delivered with 3D conformal radiotherapy in two groups of patients with non-small cell lung cancer: (1) patients with early stage disease unable to tolerate surgery and ineligible for stereotactic body radiation therapy, and (2) patients with locally advanced disease unsuitable for concurrent chemoradiotherapy.
METHODS/PATIENTS: A total of 83 patients (51 stage I-II, 32 stage III) were included. Radiotherapy targets included the primary tumor and positive mediastinal areas identified on the pre-treatment PET-CT. Mean age was 77.8 ± 7.8 years. ECOG performance status (PS) was ≥2 in 50.6 % of cases. Radiotherapy was delivered in daily fractions of 2.75 Gy to a total dose of 66 Gy (BED 84 Gy). Acute and late toxicities were evaluated according to NCI CTC criteria.
RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 42 months, median overall survival (OS) and cause-specific survival (CSS) were 23 and 36 months, respectively. On the multivariate analysis, PS [HR 4.14, p = 0.0001)], stage [HR 2.51, p = 0.005)], and maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) [HR 1.04, p = 0.04)] were independent risk factors for OS. PS [HR 5.2, p = 0.0001)] and stage [HR 6.3, p = 0.0001)] were also associated with CSS. No cases of severe acute or late treatment-related toxicities were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: OS and CSS rates in patients treated with AHRT for stage I-II and stage III NSCLC were good. Treatment was well tolerated with no grade three or higher treatment-related toxicity. PS, stage, and SUV max were predictive for OS and CSS."
27553613,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27553613/,"BACKGROUND: There has been a dramatic rise in office-based surgery. However, due to wide variations in regulatory standards, the safety of office-based aesthetic surgery has been questioned.
OBJECTIVES: This study compares complication rates of cosmetic surgery performed at office-based surgical suites (OBSS) to ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) and hospitals.
METHODS: A prospective cohort of patients undergoing cosmetic surgery between 2008 and 2013 were identified from the CosmetAssure database (Birmingham, AL). Patients were grouped by type of accredited facility where the surgery was performed: OBSS, ASC, or hospital. The primary outcome was the incidence of major complication(s) requiring emergency room visit, hospital admission, or reoperation within 30 days postoperatively. Potential risk factors including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), smoking, diabetes, type of procedure, and combined procedures were reviewed.
RESULTS: Of the 129,007 patients (183,914 procedures) in the dataset, the majority underwent the procedure at ASCs (57.4%), followed by hospitals (26.7%) and OBSS (15.9%). Patients operated in OBSS were less likely to undergo combined procedures (30.3%) compared to ASCs (31.8%) and hospitals (35.3%, P < .01). Complication rates in OBSS, ASCs, and hospitals were 1.3%, 1.9%, and 2.4%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, there was a lower risk of developing a complication in an OBSS compared to an ASC (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.59-0.77, P < .01) or a hospital (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.52-0.68, P < .01).
CONCLUSIONS: Accredited OBSS appear to be a safe alternative to ASCs and hospitals for cosmetic procedures. Plastic surgeons should continue to triage their patients carefully based on other significant comorbidities that were not measured in this present study. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE 3."
27553795,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27553795/,"BACKGROUND: The Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) still remains the gold standard in bariatric surgery. However, no consensus exists on the optimal limb lengths to induce maximum weight reduction. The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of a longer alimentary limb (AL) length on weight reduction after RYGB.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database of patients who underwent a primary laparoscopic RYGB between January 2001 and March 2011 was performed. Patients received a short AL (SAL; 100 cm) or a long AL (LAL; 150 cm). Primary outcome was weight loss, and secondary outcomes were short- and long-term complication rates.
RESULTS: A total of 768 patients received a RYGB during the study period. Of these, 730 consecutive patients were included for long-term analysis and had a mean follow-up (FU) of 37 ± 26 [range 0-120] months; 360 (47 %) patients received a SAL RYGB. Overall %TBWL was 33 ± 9 % after 2 years (FU 74 %) and 28 ± 12 % after 5 years (FU 20 %). No significant differences in %TBWL were found between SAL RYGB and LAL RYGB during the study period. The 30-day mortality rate was 0.13, 9 % overall short-term complication rate and 19 % cumulative long-term complication rate. No differences in complications were found between SAL and LAL RYGB patients.
CONCLUSION: Lengthening of the alimentary limb from 100 to 150 cm did not affect post-RYGB weight loss. Overall complication rates were low and comparable in this series of RYGB patients."
27553805,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27553805/,"INTRODUCTION: Barrett's esophagus (BE) is recognized as a premalignant lesion for esophageal adenocarcinoma. BE appears as a consequence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which is increased among obese population. Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) is the best treatment option for obesity combined with GERD. However, data on evolution of BE after LRYGB are scarce.
METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Patients were studied with esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and gastric biopsy preoperatively. If BE was suspected, esophageal biopsy was performed. If BE was confirmed, LRYGB was indicated with yearly surveillance EGD with biopsies. LRYGB patients who had BE with at least 1-year follow-up were included.
RESULTS: Between 10/07 and 1/16, 2144 patients underwent laparoscopic bariatric surgery at our institution. There were 1681 (78 %) LRYGB, 399 (19 %) laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomies, and 64 (3 %) revisions. Nineteen patients (0.9 %) had BE preoperatively, and they all underwent LRYGB; 11 of them (58 %) were eligible for this study. There were 6 women and 5 men, mean age 49 ± 11 years, initial BMI 44 ± 6 kg/m. Mean follow-up was 41 ± 31 months; there were 9 short-segment BE (SSBE) and 2 long-segment BE (LSBE). On pre- and post-op EGD, BE length was 2.1 ± 1.6 and 1.2 ± 1.2 cm, respectively (p = NS). Post-op EGD was compatible with BE in all cases, although esophageal biopsy showed remission in 4 (36 %) cases: three short-segment BE (SSBE) and one long-segment BE (LSBE). One patient was indefinite for dysplasia and remained the same after the operation.
CONCLUSION: Our preliminary data showed that LRYGB is a suitable treatment option for obese patients with BE, demonstrated by 36 % regression rate of this premalignant disease. Although BE persisted in the remaining patients, no progression to dysplasia was observed. A larger number of patients and longer follow-up are needed for more definitive conclusions."
27553968,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27553968/,"PURPOSE: To systematically compare, via ranking and best worst tasks, the relative importance of key dimensions of quality of life for younger and older people.
METHODS: A web-based survey was developed for administration to two Australia-wide community-based samples comprising younger people aged 18-64 years and older people aged 65 years and above. Respondents were asked to rank 12 quality of life dimensions. Respondents also completed a successive best worst task using the same 12 quality of life dimensions.
RESULTS: The relative importance of the quality of life dimensions differed for younger and older person samples. For older people, the ability to be independent and to have control over their daily lives were particularly important for their overall quality of life whereas for younger people, mental health was considered most important.
CONCLUSIONS: Many interventions accessed by older people in geriatric medicine and aged care sectors have a broader impact upon quality of life beyond health status. The findings from this study indicate that a focus on broader aspects of quality of life may also be consistent with the preferences of older people themselves as to what constitutes quality of life from their perspective."
27554268,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27554268/,"BACKGROUND: We previously introduced a manual surgical technique that makes small perforations (cracks) through the sclerotic bone shell that typically forms during the process of aseptic loosening (""crack"" revision technique). Perforating just the shell (without violating the proximal cortex) can maintain overall bone continuity while allowing marrow and vascular elements to access the implant surface. Because many revisions require bone graft to fill defects, we wanted to determine if bone graft could further increase implant fixation beyond what we have experimentally shown with the crack technique alone. Also, because both titanium (Ti6Al4V) and hydroxyapatite (HA) implant surfaces are used in revisions, we also wanted to determine their relative effectiveness in this model.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We hypothesized that both (1) allografted plasma-sprayed Ti6Al4V; and (2) allografted plasma-sprayed HA-coated implants inserted with a crack revision technique have better fixation compared with a noncrack revision technique in each case.
METHODS: Under approval from our Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, a female canine animal model was used to evaluate the uncemented revision technique (crack, noncrack) using paired contralateral implants while implant surface (Ti6Al4V, HA) was qualitatively compared between the two (unpaired) series. All groups received bone allograft tightly packed around the implant. This revision model includes a cylindrical implant pistoning 500 μm in a 0.75-mm gap, with polyethylene particles, for 8 weeks. This engenders a bone and tissue response representative of the metaphyseal cancellous region of an aseptically loosened component. At 8 weeks, the original implants were revised and followed for an additional 4 weeks. Mechanical fixation was assessed by load, stiffness, and energy to failure when loaded in axial pushout. Histomorphometry was used to determine the amount and location of bone and fibrous tissue in the grafted gap.
RESULTS: The grafted crack revision improved mechanical shear strength, stiffness, and energy to failure (for Ti6Al4V 27- to 69-fold increase and HA twofold increases). The histomorphometric analysis demonstrated primarily fibrous membrane ongrowth and in the gap for the allografted Ti6Al4V noncrack revisions. For allografted HA noncrack revisions, bone ongrowth at the implant surface was observed, but fibrous tissue also was present in the inner gap. Although both Ti6Al4V and HA surfaces showed improved fixation with grafted crack revision, and Ti6Al4V achieved the highest percent gain, HA demonstrated the strongest overall fixation.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that novel osteoconductive or osteoinductive coatings and bone graft substitutes or tissue-engineered constructs may further improve bone-implant fixation with the crack revision technique but require evaluation in a rigorous model such as presented here.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This experimental study provides data on which to base clinical trials aimed to improve fixation of revision implants. Given the multifactorial nature of complex human revisions, such a protocoled clinical study is required to determine the clinical applicability of this approach."

METHODS: A retrospective review of the results of breast core biopsies performed between 1st January, 2005 and 2nd July, 2014 was conducted, and those with a diagnosis of DCIS were identified. Data including final excision pathology, lesion size, performing radiologist, core biopsy system and guidance method used were collected and included in the analysis.
RESULTS: We report an overall upgrade rate to invasive cancer of 20.5% (95% CI = 16.1-24.9%). No statistically significant relationship was identified between biopsy systems used or clinicians performing the biopsies and the rate of upgrade to invasive cancer. Initially a statistically significant relationship was demonstrated between upgrade rates and lesion size, DCIS grade, as well as guidance method. Subsequent multivariable analysis showed no statistically significant relationship between guidance method and upgrade rates but a trend towards statistical significance (P < 0.1).
CONCLUSION: Our recommendation is to inform women diagnosed with DCIS preoperatively in our programme, that there is a one in five chance the diagnosis will prove to be invasive cancer on definitive surgery. This is particularly important for women contemplating whether or not to undergo surgery for DCIS. Additionally, as the most significant predictor of upgrade rate demonstrated in this study is increasing lesion size, consideration should be given to increasing the number of core samples taken of larger lesions."

(2) Compare outcomes of UPPP between multilevel and single-level procedures for the treatment of sleep apnea.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective database analysis.
METHODS: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-a nationally validated, prospective, multi-institutional database from 2005 to 2013-was analyzed for patients who underwent UPPP, per corresponding Current Procedural Terminology codes. Patients were categorized into 3 groups: UPPP alone, UPPP + nasal cavity (NC), and UPPP + base of tongue (BOT). Perioperative outcome measures of interest include surgical/medical complications, reoperation, readmission, and death. Comparisons were made among surgical groups through univariate cross-sectional analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 1079 patients underwent UPPP; 413 patients had UPPP + NC; and 200 patients had UPPP + BOT procedures. One death was reported for the entire cohort of patients. Among all 3 groups (UPPP, UPPP + NC, and UPPP + BOT), no differences were noted in the rates of medical complications (P = .445), surgical complications (P = .396), reoperation (P = .332), and readmission (P = .447). However, the length of hospital stay in days was greatest for the UPPP + BOT group (UPPP, 0.81 ± 0.69; UPPP + NC, 0.87 ± 0.90; UPPP + BOT, 1.50 ± 2.70; P < .001).
CONCLUSION: These national data demonstrate no significant increase in risk when UPPP is performed as a single- or multilevel procedure. When indicated, UPPP with multilevel procedures may be safely performed for treatment of sleep apnea. These data set a benchmark for perioperative risk in UPPP surgery and will prove useful for counseling patients."
27554616,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27554616/,"AIM: To assess the clinical utility of perfusion computed tomography (pCT) parameters in microwave ablation (MWA) of lung tumours.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were included who had primary or metastatic lung tumours and underwent pCT studies immediately pre- and post-MWA. Perfusion maps of the tumours were constructed using CT perfusion software (GE, Milwaukee, WI, USA). Regions of interest were drawn on sequential axial sections to extract the pCT parameters, blood volume (BV), average blood flow (BF), and mean transit time (MTT) from the entire tumour volume. Direct visualisation of perfusion maps were performed by two experienced readers blinded to outcome. Data were analysed using the Mann-Whitney test.
RESULTS: Thirty-one patients with 34 lung tumours had follow-up data at 12 months. The median tumour diameter was 19 mm (10-52 mm). Seven patients developed local tumour progression (LTP) at 12 months. There was no statistical difference between patients with LTP and complete treatment based on quantitative pCT parameters. Using radiologist visualisation of perfusion maps, there was moderate agreement between the two readers (kappa coefficient 0.53) with a combined 96% sensitivity, 62% specificity, 91% positive predictive value, and 80% negative predictive value.
CONCLUSION: Quantitative pCT parameters do not help differentiate between LTP and complete treatment, but subjective analysis of perfusion maps may be a useful assessment tool for identifying treatment adequacy potentially enabling identification of areas requiring further treatment at the time of the procedure."

DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey
SETTING: Academic hospital
PATIENTS: A total of 267 women having undergone mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection between 2003 and 2008 INTERVENTIONS: All patients were contacted between October and December 2012, with a questionnaire asking for persistent pain after surgery and its characteristics.
MEASUREMENTS: Besides demographical data, tumor characteristics, and adjuvant treatment, we recorded type and doses of intraoperative anesthetics/analgesics (sufentanil, ketamine, clonidine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, MgSO4, propofol, or halogenated agents).
RESULTS: Of the 128 patients returning analyzable questionnaires, 43.8% reported chronic pain (48.2% with neuropathic characteristics). Multivariate logistic/linear regression model showed 4 factors independently associated with persistent pain: recall of preoperative pain (odds ratio [OR], 1.27; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-1.48), chemotherapy (OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.13-1.55), need for strong opioids in postanesthesia care unit (OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.11-1.53), and halogenated agent anesthesia (OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.70-0.95).
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our study confirms the high prevalence of CPMP, 4 to 9 years after surgery. Recall of preoperative pain, chemotherapy, and need for strong opioids in the postanesthesia care unit were all associated with the presence of chronic pain. Of the intraoperative analgesics/anesthetics studied, only use of halogenated agents was associated with a lower prevalence of CPMP."
27555212,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27555212/,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine if an endotracheal (ET) tube will distort the laryngeal view obtained with direct laryngoscopy measuring with the modified Cormack-Lehane scale (MCL).
DESIGN: Observational single-arm study.
SETTING: The University of Calgary teaching hospitals.
PATIENTS: Patients between 18 and 86 years of age undergoing elective surgical procedures. A total of 173 patients were enrolled and analyzed.
INTERVENTIONS: Direct laryngoscopy view obtained before ET intubation and directly after intubation.
MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The MCL scales were described for each view obtained and compared to each other with each patient serving as their own control. The primary objective was a change in the best obtainable view by direct laryngoscopy from an acceptable view (MCLS 1 or 2a) to an unacceptable view (MCLS 2b, 3, or 4) or changing from an unacceptable view (MCLS 2b, 3, or 4) to an acceptable view (MCLS 1 or 2a). The main finding of this study was that the ET tube altered the MCL in 58 (33%) of 173 patients, ""worsening"" the grade in 30 patients (17.34%) and ""improving"" the grade in 28 patients (16.18%).
CONCLUSIONS: We performed a prospective observational study to address the predictive value of postintubation laryngoscopy grade in adults. The presence of the ET tube both increased visualization of the glottis and worsened the view in different subjects. The important outcome was that the presence of the ET tube did in fact change the view obtained of the larynx during direct laryngoscopy. In conclusion, postintubation MCL grades may not be reliable to predict laryngeal grade and should be used with caution in the right clinical context."
27555437,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27555437/,"PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Specialized brood pollination systems involve both mutualism and antagonism in the overall interaction and have led to diversification in both plants and insects. Although largely known for mutualism, the role of the antagonistic side of the interaction in these systems has been overlooked. Specialization may be driven by plant defenses to feeding by the insect larvae that consume and kill developing plant ovules. The interaction among yuccas and yucca moths is cited as a classic example of the importance of mutualism in specialization and diversification. Pollinators moths are very host specific, but whether this specificity is due to adult pollination ability or larval feeding ability is unclear. Here, I test the potential role of antagonism in driving specialization among yuccas and yucca moths.
METHODS: I examined the ability of the most-polyphagous yucca moth pollinator, Tegeticula yuccasella, to pollinate and develop on five Yucca species used across its range. Yucca species endemic to the Great Plains and Texas were transplanted to a common garden in Syracuse, New York and exposed to the local pollinator moth population over 3 years.
KEY RESULTS: Local moths visited all but one of the Yucca species, but had drastically lower rates of successful larval development on non-natal Yucca species in comparison to the local host species.
CONCLUSION: Specialization in many brood pollination systems may be strongly influenced by the antagonistic rather than the mutualistic side of the overall interaction, suggesting that antagonistic coevolution is a possible source of diversification."

Patients with severe disease may undergo placement of both a penile prosthesis (PP) and an artificial urethral sphincter (AUS).
AIM: We hypothesized that concomitant PP may promote AUS cuff erosion by impaired corporal blood flow and/or direct pressure on the cuff. The aim of this study was to compare the rate of AUS cuff erosion in patients with and without a PP.
METHODS: We reviewed 366 AUS operations at our tertiary center between 2007 and 2015 with a mean follow-up of 41 months (range 6-104). Included in the analysis were first-time AUS cuff erosions. Patients with recurrent erosions, AUS revisions, and iatrogenic erosions were excluded. In a separate analysis, we analyzed AUS explantations for all causes. Cohorts were compared by demographic information, preoperative characteristics, and rates of erosion and explantation.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Erosion confirmed by cystourethroscopy and explantation of the AUS for all causes.
RESULTS: Among 366 AUS surgeries at a mean follow-up of 41 months, there were 248 (67.8%) AUS alone cases compared to 118 (32.2%) AUS and PP cases (AUS/PP). Sixty-two patients met exclusion criteria for first-time cuff erosion. Among 304 evaluable AUS patients, we found a significantly higher rate of erosion in the AUS/PP group (11/95, 11.6%) compared to the AUS alone group (9/209, 4.3%, P = .037). When examining explantations for all causes in the entire cohort (n = 366), we observed a significantly higher rate of device removal, (20/118, 17%) in the AUS/PP group compared to the AUS group (23/248, 9.2%, P = .044).
CONCLUSION: AUS/PP patients appear to have a higher risk of AUS cuff erosion and explantation compared to men with AUS alone."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with trauma who underwent facial CT examination and inpatient operative intervention during a 1-year period were retrospectively analyzed. Patient demographic characteristics, the mechanism of injury, the radiology report, the surgical diagnosis, and clinical indications were reviewed. Fractures were documented according to bone type and were classified into the following subtypes: LeFort 1, LeFort 2, LeFort 3, naso-orbital-ethmoidal, zygomaticomaxillary complex (ZMC), orbital, and mandibular. Concordance between the radiology and surgery reports was assessed.
RESULTS: A total of 115,000 visits to the emergency department resulted in 9000 trauma activations and 3326 facial CT examinations. One hundred fifty-six patients (4.7%) underwent facial surgical intervention, and 133 cases met criteria for inclusion in the study. The mean injury severity score was 10.2 (range, 1-75). The three most frequently noted injury mechanisms were as follows: assault (77 cases [57.9%]), a traffic accident (21 cases [15.8%]), and a fall (20 cases [15%]). The three most frequently noted facial bone fractures were as follows: mandible (100 cases [75.2%]), maxilla (53 cases [39.8%]), and orbit (53 cases [39.8%]). The five descriptors most frequently found in the radiology and surgery reports were the mandibular angle (25 cases), the orbital floor (25 cases), the mandibular parasymphysis (22 cases), the mandibular body (21 cases), and ZMC fractures (19 cases). A classification was not specified in 31 of the radiologic impressions (22.5%), with 28 of 31 radiologists expecting the surgeon to read the full report. The descriptors used in the radiology and surgery reports matched in 73 cases (54.9%) and differed in 51 cases (38.3%). No classifications were used by one or both specialties in nine cases (6.8%).
CONCLUSION: For 38.3% of patients needing facial surgery, descriptors used in the radiologic and surgery reports differed. Speaking a common language can potentially improve communication between the radiology and surgery services and can help expedite management of cases requiring surgery."
27556384,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27556384/,"BACKGROUND: Recent studies have shown that the magnitude of the metabolic and autonomic responses during progressive resistance exercise (PRE) is associated with the determination of the anaerobic threshold (AT). AT is an important parameter to determine intensity in dynamic exercise.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the metabolic and cardiac autonomic responses during dynamic resistance exercise in patients with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD).
METHOD: Twenty men (age = 63±7 years) with CAD [Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) = 60±10%] underwent a PRE protocol on a leg press until maximal exertion. The protocol began at 10% of One Repetition Maximum Test (1-RM), with subsequent increases of 10% until maximal exhaustion. Heart Rate Variability (HRV) indices from Poincaré plots (SD1, SD2, SD1/SD2) and time domain (rMSSD and RMSM), and blood lactate were determined at rest and during PRE.
RESULTS: Significant alterations in HRV and blood lactate were observed starting at 30% of 1-RM (p<0.05). Bland-Altman plots revealed a consistent agreement between blood lactate threshold (LT) and rMSSD threshold (rMSSDT) and between LT and SD1 threshold (SD1T). Relative values of 1-RM in all LT, rMSSDT and SD1T did not differ (29%±5 vs 28%±5 vs 29%±5 Kg, respectively).
CONCLUSION: HRV during PRE could be a feasible noninvasive method of determining AT in CAD patients to plan intensities during cardiac rehabilitation."
27556600,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27556600/,"BACKGROUND: Mastectomy flap necrosis is one of the most common and significant complications in immediate expander-based breast reconstruction. Negative-pressure wound therapy is widely used for open wounds but is not commonly used for closed incisional wounds. However, the postoperative use of incisional negative-pressure wound therapy is demonstrated to reduce complication rates. The authors evaluate the incidence of mastectomy flap necrosis in patients with incisional negative-pressure wound therapy after immediate expander-based breast reconstruction compared with the incidence in patients with conventional dressing.
METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted to identify patients who underwent immediate expander-based breast reconstruction between January of 2010 and February of 2015 at a single institution. Patients were divided into a conventional dressing group and an incisional negative-pressure wound therapy group. Patient demographics, intraoperative findings, and complications were compared between the two groups.
RESULTS: A total of 228 breasts (206 patients) were included in this study. Of these, the incisional negative-pressure wound therapy group included 45 breasts (44 patients) and the conventional dressing group included 183 breasts (162 patients). The incisional negative-pressure wound therapy group had a lower overall complication rate (11.1 percent versus 27.9 percent; p = 0.019), overall mastectomy flap necrosis rate (8.9 percent versus 23.5 percent; p = 0.030), and major mastectomy flap necrosis rate (2.2 percent versus 13.7 percent; p = 0.031) compared with the conventional dressing group.
CONCLUSIONS: Incisional negative-pressure wound therapy reduced the incidence of mastectomy flap necrosis. This simple and reliable dressing technique can be effective in preventing mastectomy flap necrosis in immediate expander-based breast reconstruction.

27556606,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27556606/,"BACKGROUND: Cleft lip represents one of the most common birth defects in the world. Although the timing of cleft lip repair is contingent on a number of factors, the ""rule of 10s"" remains a frequently quoted safety benchmark. Initially reported by Wilhelmsen and Musgrave in 1966 and modified by Millard in 1976, this rule referred to performing surgery once patients had reached cutoffs in weight, hemoglobin, and age/leukocyte count. Despite significant advances in both surgical and anesthetic technique, the oft-quoted ""rule of 10s"" has not been systematically investigated since its inception.
METHODS: Patients who underwent primary cleft lip repair were identified from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Pediatric database. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to determine the independent effect of each rule of 10 metric or violation of the rule of 10s as a whole on postoperative complications, and to determine independent risk factors for complications in cleft lip surgery.
RESULTS: One thousand three hundred thirteen patients met inclusion criteria, with a 3.6 percent complication rate. Of the included patients, 151 (11.5 percent) violated at least one facet of the rule of 10s. Other than patient weight, neither the rule of 10s nor any individual metric was significantly predictive of postoperative complications.
CONCLUSIONS: Since its introduction nearly a half century ago, the risks associated with performing surgery in patients who violate the rule of 10s has undergone dramatic reductions. This analysis highlights the need to continually validate and evaluate dogma as the field continues to advance.

BACKGROUND: Recent literature has highlighted the problem of missed nursing care, but little is known about how nurses' time use patterns are associated with reports of missed care.
METHODS: In 15 nursing units at 2 hospitals, we assessed registered nurse (RN) perceptions of missed care, observed time use by RNs, and examined the relationship between time spent and degree of missed care at the nursing unit level.
RESULTS: Patterns of time use were similar across hospitals, with 25% of time spent on documentation. For 6 different categories of nursing tasks, no association was detected between time use, including time spent on documentation, and the degree of missed care at the nursing unit level.
CONCLUSIONS: Nursing time use cannot fully explain variation in missed care across nursing units. Further work is needed to account for patterns of missed care."
27557551,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27557551/,"BACKGROUND: Ghana introduced capitation payment for primary care in 2012 with the view to containing escalating claims expenditure. This shift in provider payment method raised issues about its potential impact on patient-provider trust relationship and insured-patients' trust in the Ghana National Health Insurance Scheme. This paper presents findings of a study that explored insured-patients' perception about, and attitude towards capitation payment in Ghana; and determined whether capitation payment affect insured-patients' trust in their preferred primary care provider and the National Health Insurance Scheme in general.
METHODS: We adopted a survey design for the study. We administered closed-ended questionnaires to collect data from insurance card-bearing members aged 18 years and above. We performed both descriptive statistics to determine proportions of observations relating to the variables of interest and chi-square test statistics to determine differences within gender and setting.
RESULTS: Sixty-nine per cent (69 %) out of 344 of respondents selected hospital level of care as their primary care provider. The two most important motivations for the choice of a provider were proximity in terms of geographical access (40 %) and perceived quality of care (38 %). Eighty-eight per cent (88 %) rated their trust in their provider as (very) high. Eighty-two per cent (82 %) actively selected their providers. Eighty-eight per cent (88 %) had no intention to switch provider. A majority (91 %) would renew their membership when it expires. Female respondents (91 %; n = 281) were more likely to renew their membership than males (87 %; n = 63). Notwithstanding capitation payment experience, 81 % of respondents would recommend to their peers to enrol with the NHIS with rural dwellers (87 %; n = 156) being more likely to do so than urban dwellers (76 %; n = 188). Almost all respondents (92 %) rated the NHIS as (very) good.
CONCLUSION: Health Insurance subscribers in Ghana have high trust in their primary care provider giving them quality care under capitation payment despite their negative attitude towards capitation payment. They are guided by proximity and quality of care considerations in their choice of provider. The NHIA would, however, have to address itself to the negative perceptions about the capitation payment policy."
27557655,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27557655/,"BACKGROUND: High red meat consumption is associated with a shorter survival and higher risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, and all-cause mortality. Fruit and vegetable (FV) consumption is associated with a longer survival and lower mortality risk. Whether high FV consumption can counterbalance the negative impact of high red meat consumption is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: We evaluated 2 large prospective cohorts of Swedish men and women (the Swedish Mammography Cohort and the Cohort of Swedish Men) to determine whether the association between red meat consumption and the risk of all-cause, CVD, and cancer-specific mortality differs across amounts of FV intake.
DESIGN: The study population included 74,645 Swedish men and women. Red meat and FV consumption were assessed through a self-administered questionnaire. We estimated HRs of all-cause, CVD, and cancer mortality according to quintiles of total red meat consumption. We next investigated possible interactions between red meat and FV consumption and evaluated the dose-response associations at low, medium, and high FV intake.
RESULTS: Compared with participants in the lowest quintile of total red meat consumption, those in the highest quintile had a 21% increased risk of all-cause mortality (HR: 1.21; 95% CI: 1.13, 1.29), a 29% increased risk of CVD mortality (HR: 1.29; 95% CI: 1.14, 1.46), and no increase in the risk of cancer mortality (HR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.88, 1.43). Results were remarkably similar across amounts of FV consumption, and no interaction between red meat and FV consumption was detected.
CONCLUSION: High intakes of red meat were associated with a higher risk of all-cause and CVD mortality. The increased risks were consistently observed in participants with low, medium, and high FV consumption. The Swedish Mammography Cohort and the Cohort of Swedish Men were registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01127698 and NCT01127711, respectively."
27557850,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27557850/,"BACKGROUND: Several bleeding risk scores have been validated in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). The ORBIT score has been recently proposed as a simple score with the best ability to predict major bleeding. The present study aimed to test the hypothesis that the ORBIT score was superior to the HAS-BLED score for predicting major bleeding and death in ""real world"" anticoagulated AF patients.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed the predictive performance for bleeding and death of 406 AF patients who underwent 571 electrical cardioversion procedures and 1,276 patients with permanent/persistent AF from the FANTASIIA registry. In the cardioversion population, 21 patients had major bleeding events and 26 patients died. The predictive performance for major bleeding of HAS-BLED and ORBIT were not significantly different (c-statistics 0.77 (95% CI 0.66-0.88) and 0.82 (95% CI 0.77-0.93), respectively; P=0.080). For the FANTASIIA population, 46 patients had major bleeding events and 50 patients died. The predictive performances for major bleeding of HAS-BLED and ORBIT were not significantly different (c-statistics 0.63 (95% CI 0.56-0.71) and 0.70 (95% CI 0.62-0.77), respectively; P=0.116). For death, the predictive performances of HAS-BLED and ORBIT were not significantly different in both populations. The ORBIT score categorized most patients as ""low risk"".

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study.
SETTINGS: A tertiary referral center.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight patients with VM, 28 patients with definite unilateral MD, and 28 age-matched controls were included. Cervical VEMPs to 500 Hz ACS (cVEMPs-air) and 500 Hz BCV (cVEMPs-bone), oVEMPs to 500 Hz ACS (oVEMPs-air) and 500 Hz BCV (oVEMPs-bone), and caloric tests were performed. Results of these vestibular function tests were compared between the groups.
RESULTS: The prevalence of abnormality was significantly higher in VM than in controls only for the caloric test (P < .05). Asymmetry ratios (ARs) for cVEMPs-air and oVEMPs-air were significantly larger in VM than in controls (P < .05). Between VM and MD, the prevalence of abnormality was significantly different only for oVEMPs-air. The ARs for oVEMPs-air and caloric test asymmetries were significantly smaller in VM than in MD (P < .05).

Hence, the aim of our study was to evaluate the association of body weight dissatisfaction (BWD) with depression in different sub-groups.
METHODS: We analyzed data of 15,975 individuals from the cross-sectional 2012 Swiss Health Survey. Participants were asked about their body weight satisfaction. The validated Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used to ascertain depression. Age was stratified into three groups (18-29, 30-59, and ≥60 years). The body mass index (BMI) was calculated from self-reported body height and weight and categorized into underweight (BMI <18.5 kg/m(2)), normal weight (BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m(2)), overweight (BMI 25.0-29.9 kg/m(2)), and obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m(2)). The association between body weight dissatisfaction (BWD) and depression was assessed with logistic regression analyses and odds ratios (OR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were computed.
RESULTS: BWD was associated with depression in the overall group (OR 2.04, 95 % CI 1.66-2.50) as well as in men (OR 1.85, 95 % CI 1.34-2.56) and women (OR 2.25, 95 % CI 1.71-2.96) independent of BMI.

27558398,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27558398/,"BACKGROUND: In rheumatoid arthritis, prediction of response to TNF-alpha inhibitor (TNFi) treatment would be of clinical value. This study aims to discover miRNAs that predict response and aims to replicate results of two previous studies addressing this topic.
METHODS: From the observational BiOCURA cohort, 40 adalimumab- (ADA) and 40 etanercept- (ETN) treated patients were selected to enter the discovery cohort and baseline serum profiling on 758 miRNAs was performed. The added value of univariately selected miRNAs (p < 0.05) over clinical parameters in prediction of response was determined by means of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). Validation was performed by TaqMan single qPCR assays in 40 new patients.
RESULTS: Expression of miR-99a and miR-143 predicted response to ADA, and miR-23a and miR-197 predicted response to ETN. The addition of miRNAs increased the AUC-ROC of a model containing only clinical parameters for ADA (0.75 to 0.97) and ETN (0.68 to 0.78). In validation, none of the selected miRNAs significantly predicted response. miR-23a was the only overlapping miRNA compared to the two previous studies, however inversely related with response in one of these studies. The reasons for the inability to replicate previously proposed miRNAs predicting response to TNFi and replicate those from the discovery cohort were investigated and discussed.
CONCLUSIONS: To date, no miRNA consistently predicting response to TNFi therapy in RA has been identified. Future studies on this topic should meet a minimum of standards in design that are addressed in this study, in order to increase the reproducibility."
27558509,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27558509/,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the training provisions in practical safe prescribing for foundation doctors in NHS hospitals located in the South Thames region.
METHODS: A web-based questionnaire was distributed by e-mail to all 1762 foundation doctors in the South Thames Foundation School (STFS) region. In addition, a separate questionnaire was distributed to prescribing training Leads at 15 NHS Hospital Trusts. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis was performed on qualitative data.
RESULTS: Trainers: 10 Prescribing Leads (67 %) responded. Of the 9 NHS Trusts that offered safe prescribing training in their induction programme, 5 included a practical prescribing session. By the end of the foundation year, 6 NHS Trusts had provided at least one dedicated practical prescribing session for F1s compared with 2 NHS Trusts for F2s. Trainees: A total of 124 foundation trainees (7.2 %) responded (69 F1s and 55 F2s). 87 % of F1s received dedicated training in safe prescribing at their Trust induction (n = 60) in comparison to 49 % of F2s (n = 27). 80 % of F1s (n = 55) had a practical prescribing session during induction versus 27 % of F2s (n = 15). The difference was significant, X (2) (1, N = 124) = 34.23, p <0.0001. Emerging themes from qualitative data included, recognition of medical education as a continuum, importance of working relationships with pharmacists and neglect of F2s.

27558784,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27558784/,"PURPOSE: The assessment of quality of life (QOL) is key within pediatric oncology and requires a clearly defined construct of QOL. The purpose of our study was: (1) to conduct a qualitative study to inform the theoretical underpinnings of QOL and (2) to determine the appropriateness of patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments to assess and evaluate QOL in pediatric cancer patients and survivors.
METHODS: The study used an interpretative description approach. Children diagnosed with childhood cancer, aged 8-18 years, were recruited from four Canadian hospitals. Semi-structured interviews were completed, transcribed verbatim and coded through methods of constant comparison. In-depth analysis facilitated a comparison between emerging themes and the content of commonly used PRO instruments.
RESULTS: Thirty-seven children (19 females; 51 %) participated. The mean age was 13 years, and 19 (51 %) participants were post-treatment. Participant experiences reflected notions of positive and negative duality, including: maintaining physical functioning but longing for the ability to participate in activities; experiencing a new level of intimacy with family and friends amidst isolation; and developing positivity amidst anger, sadness and lingering worry. Analysis showed that existing PRO instruments are missing concerns specific to this population and contain content not reflective of the QOL experiences of childhood cancer patients and survivors.
CONCLUSIONS: Our research highlights important problems with content validity of existing PRO scales, indicating that the tools we have to date have limited utility in research and clinical practice. The development of a new PRO instrument should be considered to ensure that content validity is achieved."
27559023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27559023/,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Rupture of the anterior and middle deltoid muscle associated with rotator cuff tear arthropathy (RCA) could result in a definitive loss of shoulder function. The purpose of this study was to evaluate clinical outcomes after a concomitant reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) and deltoid repair under these circumstances.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2006 and 2012, 18 consecutive patients with a mean age of 69.7 years, affected by massive irreparable rotator cuff tear and associated dehiscence or rupture of anterior and middle deltoid muscle underwent this operation through a modified anterosuperior approach. Four patients referred a previous shoulder surgery and deltoid tear was iatrogenic. The other 14 cases had an attritional deltoid tears. The average follow-up was 64 months (range 25-121 months).
RESULTS: The mean active anterior elevation passed from a preoperative mean of 53 ± 9.1 (range 45-70) to 132.7 ± 11.6° (85-155°), active external rotation passed from a preoperative mean value of 22.4 ± 3.6° (range 18-26) to an average of 33.7 ± 4.7° (range 30-40°). Mean Constant score increased from 42 ± 6.1 (range 31-51) pre-operatively to 72.3 ± 8.2 (range 57-82) post-operatively. At final review, deltoid contour subjectively was satisfactory to all patients with no palpable defects.
CONCLUSION: RSA associated with a repair of deltoid tear could be a viable surgical option in cases of tear involving the anterior and middle deltoid associated with a RCA. Patient with a preoperative chronic axillary nerve neuropathy associated with a deltoid muscle tear should be cautioned about the possibility of lower functional outcomes."

Although psychological interventions are being developed and used for these patients, there is uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of these interventions. The purpose of this meta-analysis is to evaluate the effects of psychological interventions on depression treatment in hemodialysis patients.
METHODS: All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) relevant to the depression treatment of hemodialysis patients through psychological interventions were retrieved from the following databases: Embase, Pubmed, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. The reference lists of identified RCTs were also screened. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to evaluate the quality of the studies, RevMan (5.3) was used to analyze the data, and the evidence quality of the combined results was evaluated using GRADE (3.6.1).
RESULTS: Eight RCTs were included. The combined results showed that psychological interventions significantly reduced the scores of the Beck Depression Inventory (P<0.001) and interdialysis weight gain (P<0.001). However, due to the high heterogeneity, effect size combinations of sleep quality and quality of life were not performed.
CONCLUSION: Psychological interventions may reduce the degree of depression and improve fluid intake restriction adherence. More rigorously designed research is needed."

METHODS: H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic intermediate echo time data of 5 patients with histologically proven gliosarcomas were compared with data of 17 metastases and 54 glioblastomas. Specialized H-NMR spectroscopy analysis software was used offline. Lipid and macromolecular resonances between 0.9 ppm and 1.4 ppm were compared besides the main metabolites using the Mann-Whitney U test.
RESULTS: Gliosarcomas showed higher lipid and macromolecule resonances and a higher lipid-choline ratio compared with glioblastomas (P < 0.024 and P < 0.036). Glioblastomas showed higher creatine concentrations compared with metastases (P < 0.007) but not compared with gliosarcomas. We found no significant differences between metastases and gliosarcomas.
CONCLUSIONS: Gliosarcomas may mimic metastases on H NMR spectroscopy showing high signal intensities from lipid and macromolecule resonances. This tumor type should be suspected if conventional imaging suggests an intra-axial brain neoplasm in combination with high lipids in solid tumor parts."

METHODS: Ninety-two patients who underwent coronary CTA and catheterization on March 2007 to December 2012 were retrospectively identified. Clinical coronary CTA interpretation and reinterpretation by a review panel was compared with catheterization results.
RESULTS: Severe stenosis was present on catheterization in 65% (60/92). Clinical coronary CTA was concordant with catheterization for severe stenosis in 78% (72/92), whereas panel interpretation was concordant in 77% (70/91). Sensitivity and specificity of clinical and panel coronary CTA interpretations were 92% (55/60) and 53% (17/32) versus 82% (48/59) and 68% (22/32), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Both coronary CTA interpretations were concordant with catheterization for severe stenosis in three quarters of patients. However, the diagnostic profile of the 2 interpretations differed, with higher sensitivity for the clinical report. This supports the clinical practice, which favored overestimation of difficult to quantify stenoses."
27560134,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27560134/,"BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies have identified variants within the FTO (fat mass and obesity associated) locus as the strongest predictors of obesity amongst all obesity-associated gene loci. Recent evidence suggests that variants in FTO directly affect human adipocyte function through targeting IRX3 and IRX5 and thermogenesis regulation.
AIM: We addressed the relevance of this proposed FTO-IRX pathway in adipose tissue (AT) of children.
RESULTS: Expression of IRX3 was higher in adipocytes compared to SVF. We found increased adipocyte-specific expression of IRX3 and IRX5 with the presence of the FTO risk haplotype in lean children, whereas it was unaffected by risk variants in obese peers. We further show that IRX3 expression was elevated in isolated adipocytes and AT of lean compared to obese children, particularly in UCP1-negative adipocytes, and inversely correlated with BMI SDS. Independent of BMI, IRX3 expression in adipocytes was significantly related to adipocyte hypertrophy, and subsequent associations with AT inflammation and HOMA-IR in the children.
CONCLUSION: One interpretation of our observation of FTO risk variants linked to IRX3 expression and adipocyte size restricted to lean children, along with the decreased IRX3 expression in obese compared to lean peers, may reflect a defense mechanism for protecting body-weight, which is pertinent for lean children."
27560720,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27560720/,"INTRODUCTION: Reducing racial health disparities is often stated as a population health goal, but specific targets for such improvement are seldom set. It is often assumed that improving overall health outcomes will be linked to disparity reduction, but this is not necessarily the case.
METHODS: We compared the annual change from 1999 through 2013 in combined-race (black and white) mortality with the annual change in absolute and relative racial mortality disparities for US states.
RESULTS: Median annual improvement in combined-race mortality was 1.08% per year. Annual overall mortality rate reductions ranged from 0.24% per year in Oklahoma to 1.83% per year in Maryland. For disparities, the median for the black-white absolute gap was 3.60% per year, and the median for the relative black-to-white ratio was 1.19% per year. There was no significant correlation between the combined-race measure and either the absolute (0.03) or relative disparity measure reductions (-0.17).
CONCLUSION: For mortality in US states over a recent period, improvement in the population mean and disparity reduction do not usually occur together. The disparity reduction rates observed may provide realistic guidance for public and private policy makers in setting goals for reducing population health disparity and creating investment priorities. As a starting point for discussion, the observed national median annual percentage improvement of 1.1 per year combined, 3.6% per year absolute gap reduction, and 1.2% per year relative gap reduction would be modest and reasonable goals."
27561167,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27561167/,"BACKGROUND: Few clinical trials have focused on populations with a history of distant myocardial infarction (MI). The PEGASUS trial assessed the impact of dual antiplatelet therapy in such patients, selected by enrichment criteria of high cardiovascular risk. Whether the PEGASUS population reflects the risk of a broader post-MI population is questionable. We analyzed whether 4-year mortality of a routine-practice population would differ according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria used in PEGASUS.
METHODS: FAST-MI is a nationwide French registry recruiting acute MI patients in November 2005; 2490 patients alive and without recurrent MI at one year were classified into three groups: Group 1 (""PEGASUS-like"" population; n=1395; 56%), Group 2 (population having ≥1 exclusion criterion for the trial; n=677; 27%), and group 3 (population meeting neither the PEGASUS inclusion nor exclusion criteria; n=418, 17%).
RESULTS: Group 1 patients were older than Group 3 patients, with higher GRACE scores, more comorbidity, and less STEMI, but were younger than the PEGASUS trial population. Enrichment criteria successfully defined a population at higher risk: 4-year survival 83% in Group 1, 97% in Group 2, and 68% in Group 3 (P<0.001). Among risk-enrichment criteria, age alone was highly discriminant: in PEGASUS-like patients, survival was 78% in those ≥65 versus 94% in those <65years.
CONCLUSIONS: Enrichment criteria used in PEGAGUS succeed in defining a population at increased risk in patients with prior MI, age being the most discriminant factor. The trial population, however, was notably younger and more masculine than the corresponding real-life population in France. Clinicaltrials.govnumber:NCT00673036."
27561210,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27561210/,"BACKGROUND: Although various methods for quantifying outcomes following total knee replacement (TKR) are used, there are few studies of the relationships between patient reported scores and functional tests. This paper aims to assess the relationships between commonly used outcome scores after TKR through a prospective cohort study.
METHODS: Twenty-four patients who had undergone unilateral TKR were assessed using four patient-reported outcome scores as well as objective measurements of knee laxity, quadriceps muscle strength and the Timed Up and Go Test. All scores and measures were correlated using the Pearson product moment correlation coefficient using the lower one-sided 95% confidence interval. A level of significance of P < 0.05 was selected.
RESULTS: The Timed Up and Go Test was the only objective measure to demonstrate a statistically significant correlation (r = -0.557 to -0.770, P = 0.0001-0.005) with patient-reported scores.
CONCLUSION: A comprehensive assessment of outcomes after TKR requires both subjective and objective assessments. Walking ability and speed are important to the TKR patient and are representative of their pain and function."
27561331,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27561331/,"BACKGROUND: Bacterial meningitis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality despite advances in medical care. The main objective of this study was to assess the association of adjunctive dexamethasone treatment with discharge outcome of patients treated as bacterial meningitis in low income setting.
METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted at four teaching hospitals across Ethiopia. Patients of age 14 years and older treated as cases of bacterial meningitis between January 1, 2011 and April 30, 2015 were included in this study. Information regarding sociodemographic data, clinical presentations, laboratory data, treatments given and status at hospital discharge were retrieved from patients' medical records using a structured questionnaire. Predefined outcome variables at discharge were analysed using descriptive statistics. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors independently associated with poor outcome.
RESULTS: A total of 425 patients treated with the presumptive clinical diagnosis of bacterial meningitis were included in this study (lumbar puncture done in 56 %; only 19 % had CSF findings compatible with bacterial meningitis, and only 3 % had proven etiology). The overall in hospital mortality rate was 20.2 %. Impaired consciousness, aspiration pneumonia, and cranial nerve palsy at admission were independently associated with increased mortality. Adjuvant dexamethasone, which was used in 50.4 % of patients, was associated with increased in-hospital mortality (AOR = 3.38; 95 % CI 1.87-6.12, p < 0.001) and low Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) at discharge (AOR = 4.46 (95 % CI 1.98-10.08). This association between dexamethasone and unfavorable outcome was found to be more pronounced in suspected but unproven cases and in those without CSF alterations compatible with bacterial meningitis.
CONCLUSION: Most patients treated for suspected bacterial meningitis did not receive proper diagnostic workup. Adjuvant dexamethasone use in clinically suspected but unproven cases of bacterial meningitis was associated with an increased mortality and poor discharge GOS. These findings show that there are potential deleterious effects in unconfirmed cases in this setting. Physicians practising under such circumstances should thus abide with the current recommendation and defer the use of adjuvant corticosteroid in suspected cases of bacterial meningitis."
27561640,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27561640/,"PURPOSE: Interleukin-6 is a mainly proinflammatory interleukin and an indicator for the magnitude of surgery. The IL-6 serum concentration correlates with injury severity, the extent of tissue trauma and has negative impact on prognosis. To date it is unclear whether the immunologic changes assessed are age dependent. The aim of this study is to compare the surgical inflammatory response in different age groups.
METHODS: Data were collected at a level-1 university trauma center in a prospective, consecutive cohort study. IL-6 levels were analyzed via ELISA from venous blood samples of cohorts of injuries with typical peak incidence: patients with unstable fractures of the spine (SP) for a middle-aged group and patients with fractures of the proximal femur (PF) for a geriatric group. Surgical treatment was performed using minimal-invasive instrumentation.
RESULTS: 25 patients in group SP (age: 51 years ± 20) and 16 patients in the group PF (age: 73 years ± 16) were analysed. Group PF showed higher baseline IL-6 concentrations. Surgical treatment was followed by a significant increase of IL-6 levels in both groups 4 and 24 h postoperatively. Concentration profiles were similar, but increase was significantly higher in the PF group 4 h after surgery.
CONCLUSION: Both the operative treatment of fractures in a middle-aged (SP) and a geriatric group (PF) lead to significant increasing of IL-6 levels. In view of a comparative surgical burden, these data suggest that age may be a confounding factor for a surgery induced pro-inflammatory response in the early postoperative stage."
27561821,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27561821/,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Hyponatremia associated with high urinary fractional excretion of uric acid which persists after serum sodium is corrected is the cardinal feature of salt losing nephropathy (SLN). We hypothesize that low grade proximal tubular injury is present in SLN because the proximal tubule is the main site of uric acid and sodium transport.
METHODS: Five subjects with SLN were compared to four subjects with recurrent hyponatremia and three healthy individuals. Urinary NGAL (neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin, a marker of tubular injury) and fasting urinary fructose levels (a marker of proximal tubular injury) were measured.
RESULTS: Subjects with SLN (n=5) showed elevated fractional uric acid excretion (22 ± 6 vs 4 ± 2 percent, p<0.0001), elevated urinary NGAL levels (62 ± 37 vs 9 ± 7 ng/mg creatinine, p=0.001) and fasting urinary fructose levels compared with the 7 controls (383 ± 465 vs 60 ± 34µmole/µg creatinine, p <0.001). A strong correlation between urinary NGAL levels and urinary fructose levels was observed (r =0.87, p‹0.001).
CONCLUSION: High urinary fractional excretion of uric acid in SLN is associated with elevated NGAL and fasting urinary fructose levels suggesting that SLN may involve tubular injury."
27562683,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27562683/,"BACKGROUND: Loss of olfaction has been considered inevitable in endoscopic endonasal resection of olfactory groove meningiomas. Olfaction preservation may be feasible through an endonasal unilateral transcribriform approach, with the option for expansion using septal transposition and contralateral preservation of the olfactory apparatus.
METHODS: An expanded unilateral endonasal transcribriform approach with septal transposition was performed in five cadaver heads. The approach was applied in a surgical case of a 24 × 26-mm olfactory groove meningioma originating from the right cribriform plate with partially intact olfaction.
RESULTS: The surgical approach offered adequate exposure to the anterior skull base bilaterally. The nasal/septal mucosa was preserved on the contralateral side. Gross total resection of the meningioma was achieved with the successful preservation of the contralateral olfactory apparatus and preoperative olfaction. Six months later, the left nasal cavity showed no disruption of the mucosal lining and the right side was at the appropriate stage of healing for a harvested nasoseptal flap. One year later, the preoperative olfactory function was intact and favorably viewed by the patient. Objective testing of olfaction showed microsomia.
CONCLUSIONS: Olfaction preservation may be feasible in the endoscopic endonasal resection of a unilateral olfactory groove meningioma through a unilateral transcribriform approach with septal transposition and preservation of the contralateral olfactory apparatus."
27562974,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27562974/,"OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the difference and agreement between ultrasonography (US) and computed tomography (CT) for identifying calcifications in thyroid nodules.
METHODS: Data from the medical records of 20,248 patients were reviewed for preoperative diagnostic investigations and postoperative pathologic diagnoses. In total, 5247 records were selected for analysis based on the presence of calcifications reported in any of the following 3 modes: US, CT, and pathologic analysis. All 5247 patients underwent US examinations, whereas 3827 underwent cervical CT examinations. All patients had a postoperative pathologic diagnosis serving as a reference. The value of US for identification of calcifications and prediction of malignancy was analyzed on the basis of the entire cohort of 5247 records, whereas that of CT was based on 3827 records. The agreement between US and CT was analyzed on the basis of the 3827 common records.
RESULTS: Of the 5247 patients who underwent US, 4855 (92.5%) were found to have calcifications, whereas of the 3827 patients who underwent CT, 2040 (53.3%) were found to have calcifications (P < .0005). Among the 404 cases with calcifications reported by pathologic analysis, the agreement rate between US and pathologic findings was significantly higher than that between CT and pathologic findings (87.9% versus 81.9%, respectively; P = .018).
CONCLUSIONS: US is more sensitive and accurate than CT for detecting calcifications in thyroid nodules. Hence, US is recommended as the preferred imaging modality for calcification detection in thyroid nodules."
27564280,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27564280/,"INTRODUCTION: Despite the well-known findings related to malignity in DRE such as nodule and induration, asymmetry of prostatic lobes, seen relatively, were investigated in a few studies as a predictor of prostate cancer so that there is no universally expected conclusion about asymmetry. We aimed to compare cancer detection rate of normal, asymmetric or suspicious findings in DRE by using biopsy results.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data of 1495 patients underwent prostate biopsy between 2006-2014 were searched retrospectively. Biopsy indications were abnormal DRE and or elevated PSA level( >4ng/mL). DRE findings were recorded as Group 1: Benign DRE, Group 2: Asymmetry and Group 3: Nodule/induration. Age, prostatic volume , biopsy results and PSA levels were recorded.
RESULTS: Mean age, prostate volume and PSA level were 66.72, 55.98 cc and 18.61ng/ mL respectively. Overall cancer detection rate was 38.66 % (575 of 1495). PSA levels were similar in group 1 and 2 but significantly higher in group 3. Prostatic volume was similar in group 1 and 2 and significantly lower in Group 3. Malignity detection rate of group 1,2 and 3 were 28.93%, 34.89% and 55.99% respectively. Group 1 and 2 were similar (p=0.105) but 3 had more chance for cancer detection.
CONCLUSION: Nodule is the most important finding in DRE for cancer detection. Only na asymmetric prostate itself does not mean malignity."
27564284,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27564284/,"PURPOSE: To identify perioperative predictors of immediate pain after ureteroscopy, specifically evaluating the impact of hydrodistention from irrigation on pain.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively identified patients who underwent ureteroscopy for the treatment of calculi. Data recorded for these patients included their maximum pain score in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), average flow rate of irrigant used during the procedure, patient and stone characteristics, operative procedure, and details of patients' immediate, post-operative course. Spearman's rho was used to determine the relationship between non-parametric, continuous variables. Then, a linear regression was performed to assess which variables could predict the peak pain score.
RESULTS: A total of 131 patients were included in the study. A non-parametric correlation analysis revealed that maximum pain score was negatively correlated with being male (r = -0.18, p=0.04), age (r = -0.34, p<0.001), and post-op foley placement (r = -0.20, p=0.02) but positively correlated with the preoperative pain score (r = 0.41, p<0.001), time in the PACU (r = 0.19, p = 0.03), and the morphine equivalent dose (MED) of narcotics administered in the PACU (r = 0.67, p<0.001). On linear regression, the significant variables were age, preoperative pain score, and stent placement. For every ten-year increase in age post-operative pain score decreased by 4/10 of a point (p = 0.03). For every 1 point increase in preoperative pain score there was a 3/10 of a point increase in the maximum pain score (p = 0.01), and leaving a stent in place post-operatively was associated with a 1.6 point increase in the maximum pain score.
CONCLUSIONS: Hydrodistention does not play a role in post-ureteroscopy pain. Patients who are younger, have higher preoperative pain scores, or who are stented will experience more post-operative pain after ureteroscopy."
27564294,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27564294/,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the incidence of anatomical anomalies in patients with retractile testis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied prospectively 20 patients (28 testes) with truly retractile testis and compared them with 25 human fetuses (50 testes) with testis in scrotal position. We analyzed the relations among the testis, epididymis and patency of the processus vaginalis (PV). To analyze the relations between the testis and epididymis, we used a previous classification according to epididymis attachment to the testis and the presence of epididymis atresia. To analyze the structure of the PV, we considered two situations: obliteration of the PV and patency of the PV. We used the Chi-square test for contingency analysis of the populations under study (p<0.05).
RESULTS: The fetuses ranged in age from 26 to 35 weeks post-conception (WPC) and the 20 patients with retractile testis ranged in ages from 1 to 12 years (average of 5.8). Of the 50 fetal testes, we observed complete patency of the PV in 2 cases (4%) and epididymal anomalies (EAs) in 1 testis (2%). Of the 28 retractile testes, we observed patency of the PV in 6 cases (21.4%) and EA in 4 (14.28%). When we compared the incidence of EAs and PV patency we observed a significantly higher prevalence of these anomalies in retractile testes (p=0.0116).
CONCLUSIONS: Retractile testis is not a normal variant with a significant risk of patent processos vaginalis and epididymal anomalies."
27564322,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27564322/,"AIMS: To quantify to what extent patients are willing to trade their chance of cure of stress urinary incontinence (SUI) against less postoperative groin pain. Randomized, controlled trials show less postoperative pain following single-incision mini-sling (SIMS), but slightly higher cure rates following a transobturator standard midurethral sling (SMUS).
METHODS: A multi-center, interview-based trade-off experiment for treatment preference among 100 women with predominant SUI and undergoing SIMS. A hypothetical cure rate of SIMS was systematically varied from 10% to 70%, while keeping the cure rate of SMUS constant at 70%. The trade-off was assessed for two hypothetical durations of substantial postoperative pain after SMUS-2 days or 2 weeks-while simultaneously assuming the absence of substantial postoperative pain after SIMS.
RESULTS: To prevent 2 days of substantial postoperative pain with SMUS, patients were willing to accept a 4.3% mean decrease in cure rate of SIMS, while a 7.1% mean decrease was acceptable to forego 2 weeks of substantial pain. Younger women (P = 0.04) and single women (P = 0.04) were associated with the trade-off limit for 2 days, respectively, 2 weeks of substantial postoperative pain. Single women were willing to accept lower cure rates. No correlations with trade-off limits were found for patients' actual severity, duration, and frequency of SUI.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients are willing to accept a slightly lower probability of cure to prevent substantial post-operative pain by undergoing a less invasive procedure. These results are relevant for counselling of patients indicated for SUI surgery."

AIM: This study assesses childhood trauma history, dissociative symptoms, and dissociative disorder comorbidity in patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD).
METHOD: The 94 psychotropic drug-naive patients participating in the study had to meet DSM-IV criteria for SAD. Participants were assessed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Dissociative Disorders (SCID-D), the Dissociation Questionnaire (DIS-Q), the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS), and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). Patients were divided into two groups using the DIS-Q, and the two groups were compared.
RESULTS: The evaluation found evidence of at least one dissociative disorder in 31.91% of participating patients. The most prevalent disorders were dissociative disorder not otherwise specified (DDNOS), dissociative amnesia, and depersonalization disorders. Average scores on LSAS and fear and avoidance sub-scale averages were significantly higher among the high DIS-Q group (p < .05). In a logistic regression taking average LSAS scores as the dependent variable, the five independent variables DIS-Q, CTQ-53 total score, emotional abuse, sexual abuse, and emotional neglect were associated with average LSAS scores among patients with SAD (p < .05).
CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that, on detecting SAD symptoms during hospitalization, the clinician should not neglect underlying dissociative processes and traumatic experiences among these patients."

27565083,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27565083/,"BACKGROUND: Secondary overtriage (SO) refers to the interfacility transfer of trauma patients who are rapidly discharged home without surgical intervention by the receiving institution. SO imposes a financial hardship on patients and strains trauma center resources. Most studies on SO have been conducted from the perspective of the receiving hospital, which is usually a level 1 trauma center. Having previously studied SO from the referring rural hospital's perspective, we sought to identify variables contributing to SO at the national level.
METHODS: Using data from the 2008-2012 National Trauma Data Bank, we isolated patients transferred to level 1 trauma centers who were: (1) discharged home within 48 h and (2) did not undergo any surgical procedure. This population was subsequently compared with similar patients treated at and discharged directly from level 3 and 4 centers. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to isolate variables that independently influenced a patient's risk of undergoing SO. Injury patterns were characterized by use of subspecialty consultants.
RESULTS: A total of 99,114 patients met inclusion criteria, of which 13.2% were discharged directly from level 3 or 4 trauma centers, and 86.8% of them were transferred to a level 1 trauma center before discharge. The mean Injury Severity Score of the nontransfer and transfer groups was 5.4 ± 4.5 and 7.3 ± 5.7, respectively. Multivariate regression analysis showed that Injury Severity Score > 15, alcoholism, smoking, drug use, and certain injury patterns involving the head, vertebra, and face were associated with being transferred. In this minimally injured population, factors protective against transfers were: age > 65 y, female gender, systolic blood pressure <80, a head computed tomography scan and orthopedic injuries.
CONCLUSIONS: SO results from the complex interplay of variables including patient demographics, facility characteristics, and injury type. The inability to exclude a potentially devastating neurologic injury seems to drive SO."
27565466,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27565466/,"OBJECTIVE: For older patients (>65 years) who undergo surgical treatment of vestibular schwannoma (VS), the reported rates of facial nerve preservation, hearing preservation, and complications are inconsistent. Many surgeons believe that older patients have worse outcomes than their younger counterparts and advise against surgical treatment. We analyzed a consecutive series of patients with VS treated with surgery to determine whether age was a factor in outcome.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all patients treated for VS at our institution from January 1, 2000, to July 1, 2012. We examined how sex, age (≥65 years and <65 years), race, tumor size, tumor laterality, body mass index, Charlson Comorbidity Index, smoking status, surgical approach, and preoperative hearing and symptoms were associated with outcomes.
RESULTS: Two-hundred forty-three patients underwent resection of VS, including 23 patients ≥65 years (mean 68 ± 4 years) and 220 patients <65 years (mean 47 ± 11 years). The average tumor size was 16.5 mm. Older patients had a significantly lower body mass index of 26.6 vs. 29.8 (P = 0.03) and were more likely to have a CCI ≥2 (52.2% vs. 18.2%, P ≤ 0.00, preoperative facial numbness (34.8% vs. 10.1%, P = 0.03), and dizziness (78.3% vs. 49.3%, P = 0.03). There were no significant differences after surgery in facial nerve outcome, hearing preservation outcome, or general surgical complications between the 2 cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS: With no difference in surgical complications, facial nerve outcome, or hearing preservation rates between older and younger patients in our series, age alone may not be an absolute contraindication to surgical management of VS."

We aimed in estimating the positive rate of extraction of CBDS who had treated by endoscopic sphincterotomy/endoscopic papillary balloon dilation (EST/EPBD) with negative ERC finding.
METHODS: One hundred forty-one patients with clinically suspicious of CBDS but negative ERC, who had received EST/EPBD treatments was enrolled. Potential factors for predicting CBDS, as well as the treatment-related complications were analyzed.
RESULTS: Nearly half of the patients with negative ERC, had a positive stone extraction. Only patients with high probability of CBDS were significantly associated with positive stone extraction. Moreover, patients with intermediate probability of CBDS had higher rates of overall complications, including post-ERCP pancreatitis. In addition, no significant difference of post-ERCP pancreatitis was found between EST and EPBD groups in any one group of patients with the same probability of CBDS.
CONCLUSIONS: Regarding patients with negative ERC, therapeutic ERCP is beneficial and safe for patients present with high probability of CBDS. Moreover, under the same probability of CBDS, there was no significance difference in post-ERCP pancreatitis between EST and EPBD."

PATIENTS: We retrospectively analyzed a consecutive series of patients operated after being diagnosed with stage III-C/IV serous epithelial ovarian carcinoma. Patients included in the study were treated between January 2008 and March 2015. After cytoreduction, Paclitaxel (doses of 60 mg/m(2)O or Cisplatin (doses of 75 mg/m(2)) were used.
RESULTS: A total of 111 patients were included. Median age was 61 years. In 60 of them (54%) Paclitaxel was used during HIPEC treatment and 51 patients (46%) were treated with Cisplatin. PCI was similar between groups (PCI = 11 in both cases). Median follow up was 34 months (12-96 months). The median disease free survival in Paclitaxel Group was 27 months and 33 months in Cisplatin Group (p = 0.551). In patients treated with Paclitaxel disease free survival rates at 1, 2, and 3 years were 79%, 60% and 46%. In patients treated with Cisplatin disease free survival at 1, 2, and 3 years were 64%, 50% and 40% respectively. After a multivariate analysis, incomplete cytoreduction (HR: 6.54, 95% CI 2.98-10.17, p < 0.01) and PCI >11 (HR: 2.15, 95% CI 1.42-6.68, p < 0.05) were identified as independent factors associated with a reduced disease-free survival.

Our objective was to develop a score for predicting the feasibility of complete cytoreductive surgery in patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Using data from a retrospective cohort of 123 patients with advanced ovarian cancer, we developed a score for predicting complete cytoreductive surgery, by performing multiple logistic regression after a jackknife procedure.
RESULTS: Three criteria were independently associated with incomplete cytoreductive surgery confirmed by surgery: age >60 years (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 6.37; 95% confidence interval [95%CI], 1.9-21.3), diaphragmatic carcinomatosis by computed tomography (aOR, 3.34; 95%CI, 1.1-9.9), and a Peritoneal Cancer Index >10 by diagnostic laparoscopy (aOR, 3.8; 95%CI, 1.4-10.2). A 10-point score was developed based on these three criteria. The area-under-the-curve of the score was 0.76 (95%CI, 0.67-0.86). The score discriminated between groups with low and high risks of incomplete cytoreductive surgery (4.4% [95% CI, 0-10.5] and 42.9% [95% CI, 26.3-59.4], respectively). Using a cutoff of 4, sensitivity of the score was 92.8% (95%CI, 83.2-100) and specificity was 77% (95%CI, 67.1-84.9) for predicting incomplete cytoreductive surgery.

27566057,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27566057/,"INTRODUCTION: Urolithiasis is among the top 10 causes of Emergency Department (ED) visits in the United States. Approximately 50% of these patients undergo abdominopelvic CT scan, many more than once. We hypothesized that chronic pain conditions may contribute to frequent CT scans in patients who are evaluated in ED for urolithiasis.
METHODS: A retrospective review of patients presenting to our tertiary care and the associated satellite EDs for urolithiasis, during the period 12/2012-05/2013, was performed. Patients with multiple ED visits and two or more abdominopelvic CT scans in any 6-month period were labeled as the frequent CT group. Control group consisted of similar patients who had no more than one CT scan in any 6-month period. Background information, number of CT scans for urolithiasis and other reasons, and the presence of chronic pain (established pain clinic visits, chronic pain medication, known chronic pain syndromes) were captured from charts. Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Fisher's exact test were used to compare variables. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify predictors associated with frequent CT scans.
RESULTS: We identified 185 patients with frequent CTs and 139 patients in the control arm. Frequent CT scans were independently associated with chronic pain (odds ratio [OR]: 2.67, confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.55, 4.50), age (OR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.60, 0.89), history of prior urolithiasis (OR: 2.15, 95% CI: 1.11, 4.15), and Medicaid insurance status (OR: 3.94, 95% CI: 1.66, 9.35).

Significant positive correlation between disease duration and IMT and negative between vitamin D levels and increased Sjögren syndrome disease activity index (SSDAI) and syndrome disease damage index (SSDDI) were also found in pSS.
CONCLUSION: IMT of pSS with long disease duration is significantly increased with respect to that of OCp. Vitamin D deficiency does not play a role on IMT of pSS, whereas it plays a role in disease damage and activity. A long disease duration is associated with subclinical atherosclerosis in pSS."
27566594,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27566594/,"BACKGROUND: The Cohort Multiple Randomised Controlled Trial (cmRCT) is a newly proposed pragmatic trial design; recently several cmRCT have been initiated. This study tests the unresolved question of whether differential refusal in the intervention arm leads to bias or loss of statistical power and how to deal with this.
METHODS: We conduct simulations evaluating a hypothetical cluster cmRCT in patients at risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). To deal with refusal, we compare the analysis methods intention to treat (ITT), per protocol (PP) and two instrumental variable (IV) methods: two stage predictor substitution (2SPS) and two stage residual inclusion (2SRI) with respect to their bias and power. We vary the correlation between treatment refusal probability and the probability of experiencing the outcome to create different scenarios.
RESULTS: We found ITT to be biased in all scenarios, PP the most biased when correlation is strong and 2SRI the least biased on average. Trials suffer a drop in power unless the refusal rate is factored into the power calculation.
CONCLUSIONS: The ITT effect in routine practice is likely to lie somewhere between the ITT and IV estimates from the trial which differ significantly depending on refusal rates. More research is needed on how refusal rates of experimental interventions correlate with refusal rates in routine practice to help answer the question of which analysis more relevant. We also recommend updating the required sample size during the trial as more information about the refusal rate is gained."
27567308,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27567308/,"PURPOSE: Adrenocortical tumors (ACTs) are rare in pediatric age group. Pediatric ACTs behave differently from their histologically similar adult counterparts and Weiss criteria often cannot accurately predict their clinical behavior. Wieneke et al. proposed a set of 9 macroscopic and microscopic criteria for diagnosis of malignancy in pediatric ACTs. The aim of the present study was to validate the Wieneke criteria in pediatric ACTs and to correlate Ki-67 labeling index and p53 expression with the Wieneke score.
METHODS: Our study comprised 17 cases of pediatric ACTs more than 11years, from January 2005 to December 2015. Relevant clinical features were obtained from records. Comprehensive analysis of gross and microscopic features was performed, according to the criteria proposed by Wieneke et al. Each tumor was categorized as benign, intermediate for malignancy or malignant. Ki-67 and p53 immunostaining was done in all cases. The patients were followed-up over a period of 6months to 60months.
RESULTS: Applying Wieneke criteria, there were 9 benign and 7 malignant cases, and 1 case was assigned as intermediate for malignancy. The most significant markers in favor of malignancy were capsular and venous invasion, followed by the presence of mitotic figures >15/20 HPF. p53 was over-expressed in 86% of the carcinomas. We found a significant correlation between Ki-67 index and Wieneke scoring system. All cases of adenoma achieved complete remission, while 3 patients with carcinoma died.
CONCLUSION: Our study validates the utility of Wieneke criteria in differentiating adrenocortical carcinomas from adenomas in pediatric age group. Moreover, Ki-67 index and p53 status can be used as supplementary tools in distinguishing adrenocortical carcinomas from adenomas."
27567358,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27567358/,"UNLABELLED: Cone beam CT and/or panoramic images are often required for a successful diagnosis in oral and maxillofacial surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate if 3D diagnostic imaging information had a significant impact on the decision process in six different classes of surgical indications.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Records of all patients who had undergone both panoramic X-ray and CBCT imaging due to surgical indications between January 2008 and December 2012 were examined retrospectively. In February 2013, all surgically relevant diagnoses of both conventional panoramic radiographs and CBCT scans were retrieved from the patient's charts. It was recorded whether (1) 3D imaging presented additional surgically relevant information and (2) if the final decision of surgical therapy had been based on 2D or 3D imaging.
RESULTS: A total of 253 consecutive patients with both panoramic radiographs and CBCT analysis were eligible for the study. 3D imaging provided significantly more surgically relevant information in cases of implant dentistry, maxillary sinus diagnosis and in oral and maxillofacial traumatology. However, surgical strategies had not been influenced to any significant extent by 3D imaging.
CONCLUSION: Within the limitations of this study it may be concluded that CBCT imaging results in significantly more surgically relevant information in implant dentistry, maxillary sinus diagnosis and in cases of oral and maxillofacial trauma. However, 3D imaging information did not alter significantly the surgical plan that was based on 2D panoramic radiography. Further studies are necessary to define indications for CBCT in detail."
27567375,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27567375/,"INTRODUCTION: The association between ambient temperature that the mother is exposed to during pregnancy and hypospadias has not been investigated by the studies, although the recent studies showed the correlation between some congenital malformations (congenital heart disease, neural tube defect, etc.) and ambient temperature.
OBJECTIVE: The aim was to investigate the relation between hypospadias and the ambient temperatures that the mother is exposed to during her pregnancy.
METHODS: The data of patients with hypospadias that had their gestational periods in Ankara and Istanbul regions, and had other urological treatments (circumcision, urinary tract infection, pyeloplasty, nephrolithotomy, etc.) between January 2000 and November 2015 were analyzed retrospectively. The ambient temperature at 8-14 weeks of gestation was investigated for each patient by reviewing the data of the General Directorate of Meteorology, since this period was risky for development of hypospadias. The data including ambient temperature that the pregnant mother was exposed to, maternal age, parity, economical status, gestational age at birth, and birth weight were compared between two groups. The retrospective nature of the study may be a potential source for selection bias.
RESULTS: The data of 1,709 children that had hypospadias repair and 4,946 children that had other urological treatments between 2000 and 2015 were retrospectively analyzed. There were no differences between the groups for maternal age, parity, economical status, gestational age at birth, and birth weight (Table). Analysis of exposed maximum and average ambient temperatures at 8-14 weeks of gestation revealed that July and August, hot periods in summer time, were more prevalent in the hypospadias group (p = 0.01). The average and maximum monthly ambient temperatures during summer increased the risk for hypospadias (OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.08-1.52; and OR, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.99-1.54, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: In this paper, we evaluated the relation between hypospadias and the ambient temperatures that the mother is exposed during her pregnancy. The results of this study indicated that the high ambient temperatures the mother and fetus are exposed to at 8-14 weeks of gestation increased the risk of hypospadias in the offspring."
27567573,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27567573/,"BACKGROUND: Therapeutic decompressive craniectomy (TDC) controls increased intracranial pressure (ICP). Its role was controversial until its successful introduction to treat malignant middle cerebral artery ischemia. However, standardization of size and site of TDC remains controversial. This study was designed to evaluate whether size and site matter in TDC.
METHODS: A replica skull of a patient with refractory increased ICP and successful TDC was used. ICP was increased using an intracranial balloon modified to monitor ICP and permit progressive incremental increases in ICP. When a desired increased ICP was reached, segments of TDC were removed sequentially to increase its size until the ICP normalized. We also measured the volume of air required to raise the ICP back to the increased ICP value.
RESULTS: The most effective TDC size to lower increased ICP was 8.3 cm in diameter (P < 0.001). However, a 7.5-cm TDC was sufficient to control increased ICP of 25-30 mm Hg (P < 0.01). There was strong correlation between TDC size and potential volume created to accommodate brain swelling postoperatively (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.95928). The location of TDC did not matter when size was ≤3.5 cm or ≥7.5 cm; location mattered when size was 4.5 cm or 5.5 cm, where anteriorly located flaps were more effective in lowering increased ICP and increasing cranial volume (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The size of a TDC is very important in reducing increased ICP. The size should be tailored to the level of increased ICP and the likelihood of further brain swelling postoperatively. A smaller TDC should be located more anteriorly to control increased ICP. Although location is not as important when increased ICP is >30 mm Hg and TDC size ≥8.3 cm is required."
27567610,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27567610/,"BACKGROUND: The relationship of pain relief from a recently presented CT-guided indirect cervical nerve root injection with local anesthetics and steroids to surgical decompression as a treatment for single-level cervical radiculopathy is not clear. This retrospective study aimed to compare the immediate and 6-week post-injection effects to the short- and long-term outcomes after surgical decompression, specifically in regard to pain relief.
METHODS: Patients (n = 39, age 47 ± 10 years) who had undergone CT-guided indirect injection with local anesthetics and steroids as an initial treatment for single cervical nerve root radiculopathy and who subsequently needed surgical decompression were included retrospectively. Pain levels (VAS scores) were monitored before, immediately after, and 6 weeks after injection (n = 34), as well as 6 weeks (n = 38) and a mean of 25 months (SD ± 12) after surgical decompression (n = 36). Correlation analysis was performed to find potential associations of pain relief after injection and after surgery to investigate the predictive value of post-injection pain relief.
RESULTS: There was no correlation between immediate pain relief after injection (-32 ± 27 %) and 6 weeks later (-7 ± 19 %), (r = -0.023, p = 0.900). There was an association by tendency between immediate pain relief after injection and post-surgical pain relief at 6 weeks (-82 ± 27 %), (r = 0.28, p = 0.08). Pain relief at follow-up remained high at -70 ± 21 % and was correlated with the immediate pain amelioration effect of the injection (r = 0.37, p = 0.032). Five out of seven patients who reported no pain relief from injection had a pain relief from surgery in excess of 50 %.
CONCLUSIONS: The amount of immediate radiculopathic pain relief after indirect cervical nerve root injection is associated with the amount of pain relief achieved at long-term follow-up after surgical decompression of single-level cervical radiculopathy. Patients can still expect sufficient pain relief from surgery even if they did not respond to the cervical infiltration."
27567989,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27567989/,"OBJECTIVES: Patients with NSCLC with M1a disease regardless of lymph node status were categorized as stage IV. This study aims to investigate whether the N descriptors in M1a patients could provide clinical information.
METHODS: Overall, 39,731 patients with NSCLC with M1a disease were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database during 2005-2012. Lung cancer-specific survival (LCSS) was compared among M1a patients stratified by N stage. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was applied to evaluate the prognostic factors. Statistical analyses were performed in all subgroups.
RESULTS: M1a patients without lymph node involvement had the best LCSS, followed by patients with N1 disease; no difference in LCSS was observed between N2 and N3 disease (N0 versus N1, p < 0.001; N1 versus N2, p < 0.001; and N2 versus N3, p = 0.478). Similarly, this trend was observed when patients were subdivided into two temporal cohorts (2005-2008 and 2009-2012) and also when M1a disease was subdivided into contralateral pulmonary nodules and pleural dissemination (malignant pleural effusion [or pericardial effusion] and pleural nodules). In addition, a difference in LCSS between N2 and N3 disease was observed in patients with malignant pleural nodules (p = 0.003). Multivariate analysis showed that lymph node involvement was an independent prognostic factor for M1a patients, and this result was also noticed in all subgroups.
CONCLUSIONS: These results provide preliminary evidence that lymph node stage may have clinical significance among patients with NSCLC with M1a disease, adding prognostic information."

The project allowed international students to work with Danish speaking students in a clinical setting. Using semi-quantitative questionnaires to 89 clinicians about use of English and need for training, this paper considers if Danish clinical doctors are prepared to teach in English.
RESULTS: The majority self-assessed their English proficiency between seven and eight on a 10 unit visual analogue scale, with 10 equivalent to working in Danish, while 15 % rated five or less. However, one-fourth found teaching and writing in English to be twice as difficult than in Danish, and 12 % rated all teaching tasks in English at four or less compared to Danish. The self-assessed need for additional English skills was perceived low.
CONCLUSION: Teaching in English was rated as 30 % more difficult than in Danish, and a significant subgroup of doctors had difficulties in all forms of communication in English, resulting in challenges when introducing international students in non-native English speaking medical departments."
27568019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27568019/,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most frequent arrhythmia of the elderly, and electrical cardioversion (ECV) is a common procedure, although incidence of recurrences remains high. We evaluated the possible association between arterial stiffness (AS) and the persistence or recurrence of AF in elderly patients after ECV.
METHODS: We enrolled all subjects undergoing ECV over a 9-month period. AS was evaluated with the cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI). Patients were then visited at follow-up (on average at 6 months).
RESULTS: Thirty-one patients (age 78 ± 7 years; men 67.7 %; CHADS-VASc 4.1 ± 1.6; AF length >2 months 51.6 %; CAVI 9.9 ± 1.6) underwent ECV. At follow-up, sinus rhythm was recorded in 16 (51.6 %) patients. At multivariate analysis, the presence of AF was directly associated with CHADS-VASc score and CAVI. Amiodarone therapy reduced the risk of relapsed AF.
CONCLUSIONS: In elderly AF patients treated with ECV, AS at baseline seems to predict AF at follow-up."

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of preoperative weight gain on postoperative weight loss outcomes after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG).
METHODS: Ninety-two morbidly obese patients undergoing SG from January 2014 to April 2016 were separated into two groups according to whether they gained weight or not during the waiting time prior to surgery.
RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients (42.4 %) gained weight during the waiting time and 53 patients (57.6 %) did not. The median body mass index (BMI; kg/m) at surgery was significantly higher in weight-gained patients (47.8 (min-max, 40-62)) compared to patients who had not gained weight (45.10 (min-max, 41-67)), (P = 0.034). No significant difference was found between the two groups regarding the distribution of age, gender, family history of obesity, existence of comorbidity, smoking, weight gain during childhood or adulthood, preoperative Beck depression and Beck anxiety scores, waiting time period, and body weight at the initial visit (P > 0.05). The ASA I score was higher in weight-gained patients whereas ASA II score was higher in those who did not gain, and the difference was significant (P = 0.046). Postoperative % BMI loss and % weight loss were not significantly different between the two groups at the first, third, sixth months, and the end of the first year (P > 0.05).

27568119,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27568119/,"OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine the effect of adding computed tomography-derived fractional flow reserve (FFR) data to computed tomography angiographic (CTA) data alone for assessment of lesion severity and patient management in 200 patients with chest pain.
BACKGROUND: Invasive and noninvasive tests used in the assessment of patients with angina all have disadvantages. The ideal screening test for patients presenting for the first time with chest pain would describe both coronary anatomy and the presence of ischemia and would be readily accessible, low cost, and noninvasive.
METHODS: Two hundred patients with stable chest pain underwent CTA for clinical reasons, and FFR was calculated. Three experienced interventional cardiologists assessed the CTA result for each patient and by consensus developed a management plan (optimal medical therapy, percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass graft surgery, or more information required). FFR data for each vessel were then revealed, and the interventional cardiologists made a second plan by consensus, using the same 4 options. The primary endpoint for the study was the difference between the 2 strategies.
RESULTS: Overall, after disclosure of FFR data there was a change in the allocated management category on the basis of CTA alone in 72 cases (36%). This difference is explained by a discordance between the CTA- and FFR-derived assessments of lesion severity. For example, FFR was >0.80 in 13 of 44 vessels (29.5%) graded as having a stenosis >90%. In contrast, FFR was ≤0.80 in 17 of 366 vessels (4.6%) graded as having stenosis ≤50%.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates proof of concept that the availability of FFR results has a substantial effect on the labeling of significant coronary artery disease and therefore on the management of patients compared to CTA alone. Further studies are needed to determine whether FFR has potential as a noninvasive diagnostic and management screening tool for patients with stable chest pain."
27568185,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27568185/,"BACKGROUND: Premature luteinization of one or more developing follicles complicates 1-2 % of controlled ovarian stimulation cycles for assisted reproduction. The management of this complication is controversial, with cycle cancellation likely representing the most commonly used strategy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the ""freeze-all"" policy-where the entire cohort of blastocysts is cryopreserved for subsequent frozen-thawed embryo transfer-in treating cases of premature luteinization.
METHODS: Patients experiencing premature luteinization during controlled ovarian stimulation-identified by extremely high progesterone levels at induction (P levels ≥3.0 ng/ml and/or P/estradiol ratio ≥1, n = 42)-were included in a ""freeze-all"" program and compared to controls undergoing a ""freeze-all"" program with normal progesterone levels at induction (P < 1.5 ng/ml, n = 67).
RESULTS: Blastulation rate was comparable between patients with premature luteinization and controls (48.1 ± 20.5 % in Cases vs. 52.3 ± 24.9 % in Controls, p = 0.36). Ongoing pregnancy rates after the first frozen-thawed embryo transfer (38.1 % in Cases and 41.0 % in Controls, p = 0.83) and cumulative ongoing pregnancy rates after three frozen-thawed embryo transfer cycles (40.5 % in Cases vs. 47.8 % in Controls, p = 0.55) were also similar.
CONCLUSIONS: These results show that extremely marked progesterone elevation throughout controlled ovarian stimulation does not impair blastocyst development and implantation potential in the context of a ""freeze-all"" strategy. Based on this, adoption of the ""freeze-all"" strategy represents a valuable tool in treating premature luteinization. In contrast, cycle cancellation-likely the most frequently used method for management of this complication-currently represents a misconduct."
27568845,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27568845/,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the utility of perfusion CT (PCT) in differentiating pancreatic adenocarcinoma from mass forming chronic pancreatitis (MFCP).
METHODS: In this ethically approved study, PCT was performed in 122 patients with pancreatic masses of which 42 patients had pancreatic adenocarcinoma and 13 had MFCP on histopathology. Perfusion parameters studied included blood flow (BF), blood volume (BV), permeability surface area product (PS), time to peak (TTP), peak enhancement intensity (PEI) and mean transit time (MTT). Twenty five controls with no pancreatic pathology were also studied.
RESULTS: Amongst the perfusion parameters BF and BV were found to be the most reliable for differentiating between adenocarcinoma and mass forming pancreatitis. Although they were reduced in both pancreatic adenocarcinoma (BF- 16.6 ± 13.1 ml/100 ml/min and BV- 5 ± 3.5 ml/100 ml) and MFCP (BF- 30.4 ± 8.7 ml/100 ml/min and BV- 8.9 ± 3.1 ml/100 ml) as compared to normal controls (BF- 94.1 ± 24 ml/100 ml/min and BV- 36 ± 10.7 ml/100 ml) but the extent of reduction was greater in pancreatic adenocarcinoma than in MFCP. Based on ROC analysis cut off values of 19.1 ml/100 ml/min for BF and 5 ml/100 ml for BV yielded optimal sensitivity and specificity for differentiating pancreatic adenocarcinoma from MFCP.
CONCLUSIONS: PCT may serve as an additional paradigm for differentiating pancreatic adenocarcinoma from mass forming chronic pancreatitis and a useful tool for detecting masses which are isodense on conventional CT."
27568851,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27568851/,"BACKGROUND: Noncompaction cardiomyopathy (NCCM) is considered to be the result of an arrest in the normal myocardial embryogenesis. The histological, developmental, and electrophysiological explanation of ventricular arrhythmias in NCCM is still unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the origin of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) in NCCM and to identify any predominant arrhythmic foci.
METHODS: Retrospective data from our NCCM registry including 101 patients were analyzed. A total number of 2069 electrocardiograms (ECGs) were studied to determine the origin of PVCs. Echocardiographic data were analyzed in patients with PVCs in all 12 leads. Segments affected by noncompaction (NC) were compared with the origin of PVCs.
RESULTS: PVCs were documented in 250 ECGs from 55 (54%) patients. Thirty-five ECGs recorded PVCs on all 12 leads and the origin of 20 types of PVCs could be determined. Ninety-five percent of PVCs did not originate from left ventricular NC myocardial areas and two PVCs (10%) had a true myocardial origin. All other PVCs originated from structures such as the outflow tracts (8/20), the fascicles (7/20), especially the posteromedial fascicle (6/20), and the mitral and tricuspid annulus (3/20).
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that PVCs in NCCM mainly originate from the conduction system and related myocardium."
27568869,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27568869/,"AIMS: Candida albicans is an important opportunistic pathogen, responsible for the majority of yeast infections in humans. Essential oils, extracted from aromatic plants, are well-known antimicrobial agents, characterized by a broad spectrum of activities, including antifungal properties. The aim of this work was to assess the sensitivity of 30 different vaginal isolated strains of C. albicans to 12 essential oils, compared to the three main used drugs (clotrimazole, fluconazole and itraconazole).
METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty strains of C. albicans were isolated from vaginal swab on CHROMagar Candida. The agar disc diffusion method was employed to determine the sensitivity to the essential oils. The antifungal activity of the essential oils and antifungal drugs (clotrimazole, itraconazole and fluconazole) were investigated using a microdilution method. Transmission and scanning electron microscopy analyses were performed to get a deep inside on cellular damages. Mint, basil, lavender, tea tree oil, winter savory and oregano essential oils inhibited both the growth and the activity of C. albicans more efficiently than clotrimazole. Damages induced by essential oils at the cellular level were stronger than those caused by clotrimazole.
CONCLUSIONS: Candida albicans is more sensitive to different essential oils compared to the main used drugs. Moreover, the essential oil affected mainly the cell wall and the membranes of the yeast.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results of this work support the research for new alternatives or complementary therapies against vaginal candidiasis."
27569594,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27569594/,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: To examine the surgical indications and pathologic findings in patients undergoing a second surgery after placement of the Essure permanent birth control system to determine the role of Essure in developing new-onset pelvic pain.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort (Canadian Task Force classification II-2).
SETTING: Tertiary-level hospital.
PATIENTS: Women who have had Essure placement and subsequent second surgery.
INTERVENTION: Charts from women undergoing pelvic surgery after Essure placement from June 2002 to June 2013 were reviewed and the indication for the procedure, surgical and pathologic findings noted.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 1430 patients, 62 (4.3%) had a second surgery after Essure placement, and 24 of these (1.6%) had a surgical indication not related to pain. The remaining 38 patients (2.7%) had either new-onset (n = 27) or worsening pre-existing pain (n = 11). In the new-onset pain group, 15 (1%) had surgical findings or pathology consistent with a painful gynecologic condition. In the remaining 12, 8 (0.5%) seemed to be related to some perforation or migration of the Essure device. In 4 patients (0.3%) with no other obvious cause for the new-onset pain, it was thus attributed to the Essure microinsert.
CONCLUSION: Essure sterilization can be associated with new-onset pain or a worsening of a pre-existing painful gynecologic condition, although both are very rare. A careful and complete consent before placement and a thorough examination if pain does occur usually show some etiology for the pain other than the Essure insert."
27569921,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27569921/,"INTRODUCTION: Previous studies suggest that large signature size is associated with narcissistic characteristics. By contrast, organ donation is an indicator of altruism. Because altruism and narcissism may be viewed as opposites, we sought to determine if smaller signature size is associated with willingness to be an organ donor.
METHODS: Using a cross-sectional study design, we reviewed the health records of 571 randomly selected primary care patients at a large urban safety-net medical system to obtain their demographic and medical characteristics. We also examined driver's licenses that were scanned into electronic health records as part of the patient registration process. We measured signature sizes and obtained the organ donor designation from these driver's licenses.
RESULTS: Overall, 256 (45%) patients were designated as donors on their driver's licenses. Signature size averaged 113.3 mm(2) but varied greatly across patients (10th percentile 49.1 mm(2), 90th percentile 226.1 mm(2)). On multivariate analysis, donor designation was positively associated with age 18-34 years, non-black race, having private insurance, and not having any comorbid conditions. However, signature size was not associated with organ donor designation.
CONCLUSIONS: Signature size is not associated with verified organ donor designation. Further work is needed to understand the relationship between personality types and willingness to be an organ donor."
27569933,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27569933/,"BACKGROUND: Currently, transplant patients have limited metrics available to understand transplant center quality. Graft and patient survival do not capture the patient experience, and patients may use more general consumer assessments of hospital care to help select transplant centers. We evaluated whether consumer assessments of hospital quality correlate with short- and long-term kidney transplant center performance.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: CMS uses the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) to publicly report patients' perspectives on hospital care. We merged 2012 SRTR kidney transplant (n = 200 centers), HCAHPS and American Hospital Association survey data. Center performance was determined by variation in observed-to-expected (O/E) ratios for 1-month and 1-year graft failure. We used multivariate regression to determine whether HCAHPS measures correlate with center performance, after risk-adjusting for structural characteristics and volume.
RESULTS: Center-specific graft failure varied significantly (30 day O/E range: 0-4.1). At 30 days, compared to average centers, cleanliness (OR = 1.26, P = .001), patient recommendation (OR = 1.18, P = .005), and high overall ratings (OR = 1.11, P = .036) predicted high performance. Poor nursing-patient communication (OR = 0.70, P = .030), lower cleanliness (OR = 0.67, P < .001), poor overall ratings (OR = 0.79, P = .038), and no recommendation (OR = 0.68, P = .019) correlated with average/low performance. There was no significant correlation between HCAHPS measures and 1-year outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: The association between hospital consumer assessments of hospital care and center performance after kidney transplantation is limited. More specific metrics oriented to capturing transplant patient perspectives may be valuable in further defining transplant quality."
27569953,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27569953/,"BACKGROUND: Oral tacrolimus (Tac) is currently the pillar of maintenance immunosuppression after solid organ transplantation. Recent studies proposed sublingual (SL) administration as an alternative; however, data regarding its use in adult liver transplant (LT) recipients are limited.
METHODS: Three LT recipients were included. Two (patients 1 and 2) were transitioned from oral to SL Tac owing to persistently erratic serum concentrations and 1 (patient 3) because of severe oral intolerance. SL Tac was started in a 1:2 dose-conversion rate.
RESULTS: All patients tolerated the SL Tac well without any side effects requiring dose reduction or discontinuation. In patients 1 and 2, the therapeutic trough concentrations improved significantly after switching to SL Tac: 20% (10/50) on oral Tac to 50% (7/14) on SL Tac in patient 1 (P = .04), and from 0% (0/15) oral Tac vs 40% (4/10) on SL Tac in patient 2 (P = .02). Patient 2, who had consistently subtherapeutic trough levels on oral Tac (mean trough of 2.6 ± 0.7 ng/mL), achieved a stable therapeutic level on SL Tac (mean trough 8.1 ± 2.7 ng/mL; P < .001). In patients 1 and 3, the mean trough levels remained unchanged: 5.1 ± 1.9 ng/mL on oral Tac versus 5.3 ± 1.6 ng/mL on SL Tac (P = .76), and 4.3 ± 1.3 ng/mL on oral Tac versus 4.2 ± 1.9 ng/mL on SL Tac (P = .76), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Oral administration of Tac is the criterion standard route for drug delivery; however SL administration should be considered as a safe alternative when the oral method is not an option."

METHODS: Ages at dissection were examined, including 51 sporadic dissectors (one dissection in family) and 39 familial dissectors (two or more dissections in family) from 16 families. Differences between sporadic and familial dissectors and relationships between ages at dissection in family members were analyzed by linear regression and clustering analysis.
RESULTS: Age at dissection was significantly younger in familial versus sporadic dissectors (54.1 ± 15.2 years versus 63.1±12.4 years, p = 0.002). Regression analysis of pairs of family member ages at dissection found a moderately close linear fit (R = 0.35). Cluster analysis indicated that age at onset of family dissectors increases as age of proband dissector increases. More than 50% of familial dissections occurred within 10 years of the median onset age for any given age decade. For familial dissectors with onset age of 30 to 49 years, 71% of other family member dissections also occurred at age 30 to 49 years, and no dissections occurred above the age of 63 years. For familial dissectors with onset age of 60 to 79 years, 80% of other family member dissections occurred beyond the age of 50 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Familial dissections occur earlier than sporadic dissections. Dissections cluster by age in families, and age at onset can predict the age of other dissectors. This finding argues for consideration of prophylactic resection of an aneurysm in family members approaching the age at onset of prior thoracic aortic dissection."

METHOD: This is a cross-sectional study conducted in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia during June and July 2015. The study targeted well-known market chains in the city of Riyadh. The selection of food items was purposive to include healthy and less healthy food items in each category. Price, caloric value, salt, fat, sugar, and fiber contents for each food item were collected. To test for the correlation between nutritional contents and average price, Spearman's correlation coefficients were calculated. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to test for the presence of average price difference between healthy and less healthy food items.
RESULTS: A total of 162 food items were collected. Sixty-six food items were classified as healthy compared with 96 less healthier options. The calculated correlation coefficients indicate an association between increased cost of food with increased caloric values (0.649 p=0.0000001), increased fat content (0.610 p=0.0000003), and increased salt contents (0.273 p=0.001). Prices of food items with higher fiber contents showed a weaker association (0.191 p=0.015). The overall average cost of healthy food was approximately 10 Saudi riyals cheaper than less healthy food (p=0.000001).
CONCLUSION: The findings of the study suggest that the cost of healthy food is lower than that of less healthy items in the Saudi market."
27570912,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27570912/,"OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to characterize the relative strength of associations of learning environment perception with academic performance and with personal growth.
METHODS: In 2012-2014 second and third year students at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine completed a learning environment survey and personal growth scale. Hierarchical linear regression analysis was employed to determine if the proportion of variance in learning environment scores accounted for by personal growth was significantly larger than the proportion accounted for by academic performance (course/clerkship grades).
RESULTS: The proportion of variance in learning environment scores accounted for by personal growth was larger than the proportion accounted for by academic performance in year 2 [R(2)Δ of 0.09, F(1,175) = 14.99,  p < .001] and year 3 [R(2)Δ of 0.28, F(1,169) = 76.80, p < .001]. Learning environment scores shared a small amount of variance with academic performance in years 2 and 3.  The amount of variance between learning environment scores and personal growth was small in year 2 and large in year 3.
CONCLUSIONS: Since supportive learning environments are essential for medical education, future work must determine if enhancing personal growth prior to and during the clerkship year will increase learning environment perception."

METHOD: An observational descriptive study in oncohematologic patients under ambulatory oncoespecific treatment. A protocol for the rational use of PPI targeted to oncohematologic patients based on the PPI protocol of our hospital was designed. Patients under active treatment with PPIs were quantified and the appropriateness of their indications evaluated.
RESULTS: 111 patients (71 oncologic and 40 hematologic) were included. 56% of all oncologic patients and 63% of all hematologic patients were under active treatment with PPIs. After reviewing the indications for PPI in all patients, 72% of oncologic and 12% of hematologic patients did not present evidence justifying treatment with these drugs.
CONCLUSION: It is important the pharmacist to detect unappropriated prescriptions of PPIs, especially among oncologic patients, and to promote a deprescription of these drugs."
27571312,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27571312/,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To examine lay-professional nursing boundaries, using challenges to the New Zealand nursing profession following the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic as the example.
BACKGROUND: The influenza pandemic of 1918-1919 had an overwhelming international impact on communities and the nursing profession. After the pandemic, the expectation for communities to be able to nurse the sick reflects today's increasing reliance on families to care for people at home. It similarly raised questions about the profession's role and professional boundaries in relation to volunteer or lay nursing. In New Zealand, the postpandemic challenge to build community lay nursing capacity tested these boundaries.
DESIGN: Historical research.
METHODS: Analysis of historical primary sources of official reports, newspaper accounts, articles in New Zealand's professional nursing journal Kai Tiaki and the memoir of Hester Maclean, the country's chief nurse. Interpretation of findings in relation to secondary sources examining similar historical tensions between professional and lay nursing, and to the more recent notion of professional resilience.
RESULTS: Maclean guarded nursing's professional boundaries by maintaining considerable control over community instruction in nursing and by strenuously resisting the suggestion that this should be done in hospitals where professional nurses trained.
CONCLUSIONS: This historical example shows how the nursing profession faced the perceived threat to its professional boundaries. It also shows how competing goals of building community lay nursing capacity and protecting professional boundaries can be effectively managed.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: In the context of a global nursing shortage, limited healthcare budgets and a consequently increasing reliance on households to provide care for family members, this historical research shows nurses today that similar issues have been faced and effectively managed in the past."
27572676,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27572676/,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate of the efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen therapy as a salvage treatment after unsuccessful oral corticosteroid therapy.
METHODS: Case notes of patients who were followed up because of idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss between 2005 and 2011 in a tertiary care centre were examined retrospectively. Audiograms from before and after hyperbaric oxygen therapy were examined in terms of mean gains in pure tone average and at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 8 kHz. In addition, recovery according to Siegel's criteria was noted.
RESULTS: Mean gain in pure tone average was 10.55 ± 13.56 dB. Mean gains at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 8 kHz were 16.66 ± 18.43 dB, 16.94 ± 19.93 dB, 12.63 ± 16.71 dB, 7.36 ± 15.28 dB, 5.27 ± 11.58 dB and 2.91 ± 12.44 dB, respectively. Three patients had complete recovery, 1 had partial recovery, 5 had slight recovery and 25 had no improvement.
CONCLUSION: Hyperbaric oxygen utilised as a salvage therapy after failed corticosteroid therapy may be beneficial in some patients. Studies with more patients are needed."

METHODS: Panamanian parents (n = 25) were interviewed after participation in an Australian parenting intervention. A thematic analysis was conducted to interpret qualitative data.
RESULTS: Three themes emerged; cultural context, appropriateness of the intervention, and development of support networks. In terms of cultural context, parents described economic difficulties, living in a dangerous world, struggling to balance parenting and work, and using aggressive communication patterns. In terms of appropriateness of the intervention, they rated materials as appropriate, although suggested modifications to its delivery by including children and teachers in the training. Finally, parents commented that the intervention prompted the development of social networks within their communities.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, parents considered a transported parenting intervention as appropriate to their local needs. This study might be useful to local governments and international funders in charge of deciding whether transporting parenting interventions North to South as a strategy for violence prevention would be respectful of local needs. Our findings cannot be generalized beyond Panama, but the methodology can be replicated to answer this question in other settings."
27573531,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27573531/,"PURPOSE: Medical education increasingly includes patient perspectives, but few studies look at the impact on students' proficiency in standard examinations. We explored students' exam performance after viewing video of patients' experiences.
METHODS: Eighty-eight medical students were randomized to one of two e-learning modules. The experimental group saw video clips of patients describing their colposcopy, while the control group viewed a clinician describing the procedure. Students then completed a Multiple Choice Questionnaire (MCQ) and were assessed by a blinded clinical examiner in an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) with a blinded simulated patient (SP). The SP scored students using the Doctors' Interpersonal Skills Questionnaire (DISQ). Students rated the module's effect on their skills and confidence. Regression analyses were used to compare the effect of the two modules on these outcomes, adjusting for gender and graduate entry.
RESULTS: The experimental group performed better in the OSCE than the control group (odds ratio 2.7 [95%CI 1.2-6.1]; p = 0.016). They also reported significantly more confidence in key areas, including comfort with patients' emotions (odds ratio 6.4 [95%CI 2.7-14.9]; p < 0.0005). There were no other significant differences.
CONCLUSION: Teaching that included recorded elements of real patient experience significantly improved students' examination performance and confidence."
27576210,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27576210/,"INTRODUCTION: This clinical study evaluates the effect of ultrasonic root-end preparations on dentinal defect creation and propagation.
METHODS: Eighty-four teeth were treated with periapical microsurgery using a modern microsurgical protocol in a private practice setting. The root apices were resected and inspected for dentinal defects with a surgical operating microscope and a 0.8-mm diameter light-emitting diode microscope diagnostic probe light, both before and after ultrasonic root-end preparations. A 3-grade scale (none, partial, and full dentinal defect) was used to assess the status of the roots before and after ultrasonic root-end preparation.
RESULTS: Of the 84 treated teeth, 3 had a vertical root fracture, leaving a total of 81 teeth for assessment. Fifty-one teeth were intact upon resection and remained intact after root-end preparation. Twenty-six teeth had partial dentinal defects, and 14 (54%) of these propagated into full dentinal defects after root-end preparation.
CONCLUSIONS: This periapical microsurgery study showed that ultrasonic root-end preparations are safe to use on intact roots. Preexisting dentinal defects can be propagated by ultrasonic root-end preparations. Through the use of light-emitting diodes, dentinal defects can be detected, special root-end management can be implemented, and more predictable outcomes may be achieved."
27576456,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27576456/,"BACKGROUND: In 2005, the World Health Assembly (WHA) of the World Health Organization (WHO) urged member states to aim at achieving affordable universal coverage and access to key promotive, preventive, curative, rehabilitative and palliative health interventions for all their citizens on the basis of equity and solidarity. Since then, some African countries, including Ghana, have taken steps to introduce national health insurance reforms as one of the key strategies towards achieving universal health coverage (UHC). The aim of this study was to get a better understanding of how Ghana's health insurance institutions interact with stakeholders and other health sector programmes in promoting primary health care (PHC). Specifically, the study identified the key areas of misalignment between the operations of the NHIS and that of PHC.
METHODS: Using qualitative and survey methods, this study involved interviews with various stakeholders in six selected districts in the Upper East region of Ghana. The key stakeholders included the National Health Insurance Authority (NHIA), district coordinators of the National Health Insurance Schemes (NHIS), the Ghana Health Service (GHS) and District Health Management Teams (DHMTs) who supervise the district hospitals, health centers/clinics and the Community-based Health and Planning Services (CHPS) compounds as well as other public and private PHC providers. A stakeholders' workshop was organized to validate the preliminary results which provided a platform for stakeholders to deliberate on the key areas of misalignment especially, and to elicit additional information, ideas and responses, comments and recommendations from participants for the achievement of the goals of UHC and PHC.
RESULTS: The key areas of misalignments identified during this pilot study included: delays in reimbursements of claims for services provided by health care providers, which serves as a disincentive for service providers to support the NHIS, inadequate coordination among stakeholders in PHC delivery; and inadequate funding for PHC, particularly on preventive and promotive services. Other areas are: the bypassing of PHC facilities due to lack of basic services at the PHC level such as laboratory services, as well as proximity to the district hospitals; and finally the lack of clear understanding of the national policy on PHC.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that despite the progress that has been made since the establishment of the NHIS in Ghana, there are still huge gaps that need urgent attention to ensure that the goals of UHC and PHC are met. The key areas of misalignment identified in this study, particularly on the delays in reimbursements need to be taken seriously. It is also important for more dialogue between the NHIA and service providers to address key concerns in the implementation of the NHIS which is key to achieving UHC."
27576466,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27576466/,"OBJECTIVE: To assess whether identifying (or ignoring) learned alarm sounds interferes with performance on a task involving working memory.
BACKGROUND: A number of researchers have suggested that auditory alarms could interfere with working memory in complex task environments, and this could serve as a caution against their use. Changing auditory information has been shown to interfere with serial recall, even when the auditory information is to be ignored. However, previous researchers have not examined well-learned patterns, such as familiar alarms.
METHOD: One group of participants learned a set of alarms (either a melody, a rhythmic pulse, or a spoken nonword phrase) and subsequently undertook a digits-forward task in three conditions (no alarms, identify the alarm, or ignore the alarm). A comparison group undertook the baseline and ignore conditions but had no prior exposure to the alarms.
RESULTS: All alarms interfered with serial recall when participants were asked to identify them; however, only the nonword phrase interfered with recall when ignored. Moreover, there was no difference between trained and untrained participants in terms of recall performance when ignoring the alarms, suggesting that previous training does not make alarms less ignorable.
CONCLUSION: Identifying any alarm sound may interfere with immediate working memory; however, spoken alarms may interfere even when ignored.
APPLICATION: It is worth considering the importance of alarms in environments requiring high working memory performance and in particular avoiding spoken alarms in such environments."
27576886,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27576886/,"PURPOSE: To compare clinical and urodynamic study (UDS) findings in Iranian women with mixed or stress UI (Urinary Incontinence).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 132 patients with either stress or mixed type of UI were enrolled. After accurate examination, data regarding age, parity, mode of delivery and menopausal state were recorded. Furthermore the presence and severity of UI was evaluated with empty bladder supine stress test (ESST) and cough test in supine and standing positions in all patients. Eligible cases underwent UDS evaluation by an expert urologist using a standardized protocol.
RESULTS: Stress and mixed UI were found in 33 (25%) and 99 (75%) patients respectively. By considering clinical evaluation as gold standard, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of urodynamic study were 83.4%, 30.4%, 43.4% and 80% for detecting stress UI and 96.1%, 35.6%, 34.7%, 96.2% for detecting mixed UI respectively. No correlation was noted between ESST or cough test results and Valsalva leak point pressure (VLPP) values in patients with stress UI, however ESST was correlated with VLPP values in patients with mixed UI.
CONCLUSION: Despite a relatively high sensitivity, the specificity was low and urodynamic evaluation seems to be of limited value in the assessment of UI in female patients.&nbsp."
27576929,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27576929/,"OBJECTIVE: Bone changes are increasingly described after burn. How bone markers could help to detect early bone changes or to screen burn patients at higher risk of demineralization is still not made clear. We performed an observational study assessing the changes in serum bone markers after moderate burn.
METHODS: Adults admitted in the first 24h following burn extended on >10% body surface area were included. Serum levels of collagen type 1 cross-linked C-telopeptide (CTX), tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRAP), type 1 procollagen N-terminal (P1NP) and bone alkaline phosphatase (b-ALP) were measured at admission and every week during the first month. Data are expressed as median [min-max].
RESULTS: Bone markers were measured in 20 patients: 18 men, 2 women (including one post-menopausal). Age was 46 [19-86] years old, burn surface area reached 15 [7-85] %. Twelve patients completed the study. All biomarkers mainly remained into normal ranges during evolution. A huge variability was observed regarding biomarkers evolution. Patient's evolution was not linear and could fluctuate from a decrease to an increase of blood concentrations. There was not necessarily a consistency between the two formation or the two resorption markers. Variations observed between two consecutive measurements were lesser than the accepted critical difference in almost one third of the cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Considering available data, role and interest of bone markers in management of burn related bone disease remain unclear."
27577028,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27577028/,"BACKGROUND: Total artificial heart (TAH) device is sometimes necessary to treat end stage heart failure (HF). After surgery, renal impairment can occur with the need of renal replacement therapy.
METHOD: We report the case of a 51-year-old man who was treated with conventional hemodialysis (HD) while on support with TAH.
RESULTS: The patient underwent HD while on TAH support during 14 months. He benefited from conventional HD, 6 sessions per week. HD sessions were well tolerated, and patient's condition and quality of life improved significantly. The main difficulty was to maintain red blood cell level because of chronic hemolysis due to TAH, which required repetitive blood transfusions, resulting in a high rate of human leukocyte antigen sensitization. Unfortunately, the patient died of mesenteric ischemia due to anticoagulation under dosing.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that HD treatment is possible despite TAH and should be considered in patients with both end stage renal and HF."
27577067,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27577067/,"BACKGROUND: Patellofemoral malalignment associated with patella alta may cause pain and arthritis; because of this, the condition sometimes is treated surgically. Two common procedures are tibial tubercle distalization with or without patellar tendon tenodesis. However, the biomechanical consequences of these interventions for patella alta are not clearly understood.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We evaluated changes in patellofemoral joint contact mechanics after tibial tubercle distalization and tibial tubercle distalization combined with patella tendon tenodesis. Specifically, we asked: (1) Are there biomechanical differences between these two types of procedures? (2) Is there an ideal range to distalize the patella?
METHODS: Subject-specific finite-element models were created for 10 individuals with patella alta (mean Insall-Salvati ratio of 1.34 ± 0.05). Input parameters for the finite-element models included subject-specific joint geometry, quadriceps muscle forces, and weightbearing patellofemoral joint kinematics. Virtual operations were conducted to simulate the two procedures. For distalization, the tibial tubercle and patella were displaced distally 4 mm to 20 mm in 4-mm increments based on the original model. At each level of distalization, the patella tendon was attached back to its original insertion to simulate the additional tenodesis procedure. Cartilage stress, contact area, and contact forces were quantified and compared between procedures and distalization levels.
RESULTS: Distalization and distalization + tenodesis reduced patellofemoral joint stress compared with the baseline of 1.02 ± 0.11 MPa. Distalization led to lower cartilage stress than distalization + tenodesis, and the effect size was relatively large (0.88 ± 0.10 MPa vs 0.92 ± 0.10 MPa; mean difference, 0.04 MPa [95% CI, 0.02 MPa-0.05 MPa], p < 0.01; effect size of 1.64 [Cohen's d], with Insall-Salvati ratio decreased to 0.95). For both procedures, the trend of stress reduction plateaued when the Install-Salvati ratio approached 0.95.
CONCLUSIONS: Cartilage stress appears lower using distalization as opposed to distalization + tenodesis in this finite-element analysis simulation. An Insall-Salvati ratio of 0.95 may be an ideal level for distalization; further distalization does not show additional benefits.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study suggests that distalization may result in less stress than distalization + tenodesis, therefore future clinical research might be preferentially directed toward evaluating isolated distalization procedures."
27577521,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27577521/,"BACKGROUND: A significant proportion of general surgery emergency procedures are conducted after-hours in regional centres. The acute surgical unit (ASU) model reduces the number of after-hours operations performed. We review the burden of emergency surgery in a regional centre and assess what components of the ASU model would benefit regional hospitals.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis was performed on data for all emergency cases performed at Latrobe Regional Hospital (LRH) over a 1-year period. Time into and out of theatre was used to determine total theatre usage and if the operation occurred after-hours. ED triage time to theatre and start time for appendicectomy was compared to data from our metropolitan referral hospital, Monash Medical Centre (MMC), which has employed an ASU.
RESULTS: General surgery emergency cases in regional areas are regular and predictable with a median of two emergency cases performed, and a mean theatre time of 156 min per day at LRH. On weekdays, 43.1% (n = 503) of emergency cases were done in the evening (18.00-24.00 hours), compared to 20.3% (n = 217) on weekends when an emergency theatre is available during the day. LRH performed more appendicectomies after-hours than MMC over a 1-year period.
CONCLUSION: Regional centres have a significant burden of general surgery emergency procedures; of which the number performed after-hours is comparable to metropolitan centres. The number of procedures and theatre time required by these cases justify a dedicated emergency theatre in-hours similar to metropolitan ASU models and this would reduce emergency operating after-hours."
27577590,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27577590/,"PURPOSE: Increasing evidence shows the detrimental impact of high physical work demands for cardiovascular health and mortality. The aim of this study was to investigate the buffering effects of social support at work and job control in the relation between physical work demands and incidence of coronary events.
METHODS: The study included 14,337 middle-aged men free from coronary heart disease (CHD) at baseline. The sample consisted of a mixed occupational group recruited within 18 organizations from the manufacturing, service, and public sector. Data were collected through standardized questionnaires and clinical examinations. The incidence of clinical coronary events was monitored during a mean follow-up time of 3.15 years. Multilevel Cox proportional hazard regression modeling was used, adjusting for socio-demographic and classical coronary risk factors.
RESULTS: Social support at work buffered the impact of physical work demands on CHD risk: Only among workers with low social support at work did physical work demands significantly increase the risk for CHD incidence (fully adjusted HR 2.50: 95 % CI 1.13-5.50), while this harmful effect completely disappeared in case of high level of workplace social support (fully adjusted HR 0.40; 95 % CI 0.09-1.70). No interaction or buffering effect with job control was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study suggest that supportive relationships at work may be a useful resource for reducing the cardiovascular risk associated with physical work demands in men. Future studies are needed to confirm this moderating role of workplace social support and to unravel the underlying mechanisms."
27577883,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27577883/,"BACKGROUND: Gas pressure balance is essential for maintaining normal middle ear function. The mucosal surfaces of the middle ear, the mastoid air cell system (MACS), and the Eustachian tube (ET) play a critical role in this process; however, the extent that each of these factors contributes to overall middle ear ventilation is unknown. The objective of this study was to determine if the ET alone can maintain normal middle ear pressure without the MACS. To do this, we reviewed subjects who had their MACS completely removed with translabyrinthine (TL) surgery for vestibular schwannoma.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review was done to collect pre and postoperative tympanometry data from patients who underwent resection of vestibular schwannoma. Data from the operative side was compared to the non-operative side at 2 years post-op.
RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were included in this study. Of these, 63 % achieved a type A tympanogram at 2 years post-op in the TL resection group, implying an ability to maintain middle ear pressure in the absence of a mastoid cavity. Because some had negative pressures post TL resection, the average change in pre and postoperative pressure was -37.5 daPa for the operative side and 7.8 daPa for the non-operative side. This was significantly different.
DISCUSSION: The difference for change in pre and postoperative pressure and compliance between operative and non-operative side might be expected from the ET plugging during TL resection. However, more interesting are those patients in whom the ET presumably reopens, and in these subjects, despite having no mastoid compartment at all, and the space obliterated with fat, they were still able to maintain normal ventilation of the middle ear space.
CONCLUSION: Our findings imply that the ET alone is adequate to ventilate at least the reduced middle ear space following TL surgery in most subjects, and perhaps in 100 % if the ET hadn't been plugged during surgery. Hence, the mastoid air cell system, even when healthy, is not needed to maintain air in the middle year cleft."
27578559,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27578559/,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To evaluate whether formalized research training is associated with higher researcher productivity, academic rank, and acquisition of National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants within academic otolaryngology departments.
METHODS: Each of the 100 civilian otolaryngology program's departmental websites were analyzed to obtain a comprehensive list of faculty members credentials and characteristics, including academic rank, completion of a clinical fellowship, completion of a formal research fellowship, and attainment of a doctorate in philosophy (PhD) degree. We also recorded measures of scholarly impact and successful acquisition of NIH funding.
RESULTS: A total of 1,495 academic physicians were included in our study. Of these, 14.1% had formal research training. Bivariate associations showed that formal research training was associated with a greater h-index, increased probability of acquiring NIH funding, and higher academic rank. Using a linear regression model, we found that otolaryngologists possessing a PhD had an associated h-index of 1.8 points higher, and those who completed a formal research fellowship had an h-index of 1.6 points higher. A PhD degree or completion of a research fellowship was not associated with a higher academic rank; however, a higher h-index and previous acquisition of an NIH grant were associated with a higher academic rank. The attainment of NIH funding was three times more likely for those with a formal research fellowship and 8.6 times more likely for otolaryngologists with a PhD degree.
CONCLUSION: Formalized research training is associated with academic success in otolaryngology. Such dedicated research training accompanies greater scholarly impact, acquisition of NIH funding, and a higher academic rank.

STUDY DESIGN: In a population-based study a cohort of 754 reproductive-aged women including 704 eumenorrheic non-hirsute subjects and 50 PCOS women selected according to the national institutes of health's (NIH) criteria. The ability of ABSI and WHtR for the prediction of IR was estimated by the homeostasis model and metabolic syndrome according to the joint interim statement criteria.
RESULTS: Age and BMI adjusted prevalence of IR and MetS in PCOS women vs. healthy controls were 34% vs. 26%, P=0.041 and 15% vs. 14%, P=0.917, respectively. Mean (SD) of ABSI in PCOS women and healthy women were 0.76 (0.05) and 0.76 (0.053), respectively (P=0.363). The area under curve (CI 95%) of WHtR for predicting IR and MetS among PCOS women vs. healthy women were 0.751 (0.60-0.89) vs. 0.69 (0.65-0.73) and 0.902 (0.81-0.98) vs. 0.802 (0.76-0.83), respectively. As such, the area under curve (CI 95%) of ABSI for ROC curve analysis for predicting IR and MetS among PCOS women vs. healthy women were 0.482 (0.31-0.64) vs. 0.537 (0.49-0.58) and 0.538 (0.35-0.72) vs. 0.584 (0.60-0.69), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggested that WHtR but not ABSI were a good predictor of IR and MetS among PCOS and healthy women. WHtR may be proposed as a screening tool for IR and MetS risk assessment among PCOS women as a sensitive, inexpensive, noninvasive, simple to assess and easy to calculate measurement tools."

There were no statistical differences between the average surgical times for the endoscopic and microscopic approaches (p >0.05) in the last 4-month period of surgery. Through the endoscopic approach the percentage of ears with a postoperative air-bone gap ≤20 dB was 95%. No difference from the percentage of the microscopic group (90%) (p >0.05) was reported. No difference regarding the incidence of intraoperative findings and postoperative complications between endoscopic and microscopic approaches was found.
CONCLUSION: Audiological outcomes achieved by endoscopic surgery are similar to the results obtained through a microscopic approach. Longer initial operative times and a learning curve are the principal grounds that might discourage most ear-surgeons from commencing endoscopic stapes surgery."
27580157,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27580157/,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to determine the clinical utility of biomechanical head impact indicators by measuring the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PV+), and negative predictive value (PV-) of multiple thresholds.
METHODS: Head impact biomechanics (n = 283,348) from 185 football players in one Division I program were collected. A multidisciplinary clinical team independently made concussion diagnoses (n = 24). We dichotomized each impact using diagnosis (yes = 24, no = 283,324) and across a range of plausible impact indicator thresholds (10g increments beginning with a resultant linear head acceleration of 50g and ending with 120g).
RESULTS: Some thresholds had adequate sensitivity, specificity, and PV-. All thresholds had low PV+, with the best recorded PV+ less than 0.4% when accounting for all head impacts sustained by our sample. Even when conservatively adjusting the frequency of diagnosed concussions by a factor of 5 to account for unreported/undiagnosed injuries, the PV+ of head impact indicators at any threshold was no greater than 1.94%.
CONCLUSIONS: Although specificity and PV- appear high, the low PV+ would generate many unnecessary evaluations if these indicators were the sole diagnostic criteria. The clinical diagnostic value of head impact indicators is considerably questioned by these data. Notwithstanding, valid sensor technologies continue to offer objective data that have been used to improve player safety and reduce injury risk."
27581162,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27581162/,"OBJECTIVE: To examine whether physical activity (PA) moderates the association between alcohol intake and all-cause mortality, cancer mortality and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) mortality.
DESIGN: Prospective study using 8 British population-based surveys, each linked to cause-specific mortality: Health Survey for England (1994, 1998, 1999, 2003, 2004 and 2006) and Scottish Health Survey (1998 and 2003).
PARTICIPANTS: 36 370 men and women aged 40 years and over were included with a corresponding 5735 deaths and a mean of 353 049 person-years of follow-up.
EXPOSURES: 6 sex-specific categories of alcohol intake (UK units/week) were defined: (1) never drunk; (2) ex-drinkers; (3) occasional drinkers; (4) within guidelines (<14 (women); <21 (men)); (5) hazardous (14-35 (women); 21-49 (men)) and (6) harmful (>35 (women) >49 (men)). PA was categorised as inactive (≤7 MET-hour/week), active at the lower (>7.5 MET-hour/week) and upper (>15 MET-hour/week) of recommended levels.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cox proportional-hazard models were used to examine associations between alcohol consumption and all-cause, cancer and CVD mortality risk after adjusting for several confounders. Stratified analyses were performed to evaluate mortality risks within each PA stratum.
RESULTS: We found a direct association between alcohol consumption and cancer mortality risk starting from drinking within guidelines (HR (95% CI) hazardous drinking: 1.40 (1.11 to 1.78)). Stratified analyses showed that the association between alcohol intake and mortality risk was attenuated (all-cause) or nearly nullified (cancer) among individuals who met the PA recommendations (HR (95% CI)).
CONCLUSIONS: Meeting the current PA public health recommendations offsets some of the cancer and all-cause mortality risk associated with alcohol drinking."
27581474,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27581474/,"BACKGROUND: Some previous studies have indicated that a low basal metabolic rate (BMR) is an independent predictor of future weight gain, but low rates of follow-up and highly select populations may limit the ability to generalize the results.
OBJECTIVE: We assessed whether adults with a low BMR gain more weight than do adults with a high BMR who are living in a typical Western environment.
DESIGN: We extracted BMR, body-composition, demographic, and laboratory data from electronic databases of 757 volunteers who were participating in our research protocols at the Mayo Clinic between 1995 and 2012. Research study volunteers were always weight stable, had no acute illnesses and no confounding medication use, and were nonsmokers. The top and bottom 15th percentiles of BMR, adjusted for fat-free mass (FFM), fat mass, age, and sex, were identified. Follow-up electronic medical record system data were available for 163 subjects, which allowed us to determine their subsequent weight changes for ≥3 y (mean: ∼9.7 y).
RESULTS: By definition, the BMR was different in the high-BMR group (2001 ± 317 kcal/d; n = 86) than in the low-BMR group (1510 ± 222 kcal/d; n = 77), but they were comparable with respect to age, body mass index, FFM, and fat mass. Rates of weight gain were not greater in the bottom BMR group (0.3 ± 1.0 kg/y) than in the top BMR group (0.5 ± 1.5 kg/y) (P = 0.17).
CONCLUSION: Adults with low BMRs did not gain more weight than did adults with high BMRs, implying that habitual differences in food intake or activity counterbalance variations in BMR as a risk factor for weight gain in a typical Western population."
27581500,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27581500/,"OBJECTIVE: The use of thyrotropin (TSH) in the initial assessment of thyroid nodules is inefficient and leads to unnecessary assessment costs. We compared the total costs of thyroid nodule assessment with or without the use of TSH in the initial assessment.
METHODS: A total of 1808 patients with thyroid nodules received TSH, fine-needle aspiration (FNA) and thyroid scintigraphy (TS) assessment, including 83 autonomously functioning thyroid nodule (AFTN) cases and 1725 non-AFTN cases. The total costs of the TSH strategy and non-TSH strategies were compared. The ratio of single-use costs of FNA to TS (C ) was used as the main outcome measure.
RESULTS: Only when 6·03 ≤ C ≤ 27·17, the lowest total costs were associated with using the conventional TSH strategy. When C <6·03 or C >27·17, the lowest costs were found with FNA and TS, respectively.
CONCLUSION: From the perspective of cost economics, in iodine-sufficient areas, we recommend that the decision on the use of TSH for the initial assessment of thyroid nodules should be based on the testing costs of FNA and TS in that medical unit."
27581549,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27581549/,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Despite guidelines suggesting a 25-50 % reduction in induction doses of intravenous anesthetic agents in the elderly (≥65 years), we hypothesized that practitioners were not sufficiently correcting drug administration for age, contributing to an increased incidence of hypotension in older patients undergoing general anesthesia.
STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective, observational study in a tertiary-care academic hospital. The study included 768 female patients undergoing gynecologic surgeries who received propofol-based induction of general anesthesia.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Weight-adjusted anesthetic induction dosing, age-associated differences in dosing by ASA-PS (American Society of Anesthesiology-Physical Status), and hemodynamic outcomes between younger (18-64 years, n = 537) and older (≥65 years, n = 231) female patients were analyzed.
RESULTS: Older patients received lower doses of propofol and midazolam than younger patients (propofol: 2.037 ± 0.783 vs 2.322 ± 0.834 mg/kg, p < 0.001; midazolam: 0.013 ± 0.014 vs 0.023 ± 0.042 mg/kg, p < 0.001). However, practitioners still consistently exceeded the FDA recommended dose (1-1.5 mg/kg) of propofol for elderly patients. There was no significant difference in the doses of fentanyl administered between the two age groups (1.343 ± 0.744 vs 1.363 ± 0.763 μg/kg, p = 0.744), and doses of fentanyl in older patients exceeded the recommended dose (0.5-1.0 μg/kg). Corresponding to observed overdosing of induction agents, older patients experienced larger decreases in post-induction blood pressure and were more likely to receive vasopressor therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Anesthetic induction doses of fentanyl and propofol were not sufficiently corrected in older patients in accordance with recommendations. Significantly greater frequency of post-induction hypotension occurred amongst older patients. Quality improvement efforts may lead to improved outcomes in this vulnerable population."
27582090,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27582090/,"BACKGROUND: There have been many changes in number and place of trocars that have been described, since the first laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC), but, in fact, all authors agree that laparoscopic procedure is accepted as gold standard. However, four trocars use in standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy, it has been argued that the fourth port is not necessary for grasping fundus of gallbladder so as to expose Calot's triangle. The aim of this study is to establish the safety of three-trocar LC in symptomatic gallbladder disease and also to determine the ratio of technical requirements of the fourth trocar.
METHODS: Between August 2010 and January 2016, 291 cases were operated in Kocaeli Derince Education and Research Hospital, department of general surgery for symptomatic gallbladder disease with three-port LC, and their records were examined retrospectively.
RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty patients were female (75.6 %) and seventy one (24.4 %) were male. Two hundred and eighteen of two hundred and ninety-one cases (74.92 %) were operated with three- port LC in a secure way. In seventy-three cases (25.08 %), one more port was needed to use. Mean operative time was 33.76 ± 11:18 min. (15-90 min). In these cases, major complications, such as main bile duct injury or bile leakage, that may increase the mortality and morbidity, did not occur. Only in one case (0.34 %) postoperative bleeding was seen from the liver bed, which was required exploration.
CONCLUSION: We concluded that in experienced hand, LC with three ports is safe and feasible technique if it is not endanger the course of the surgery."
27583107,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27583107/,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine the shape of the distal femur of Korean women compared with the prostheses currently available in Korea.
METHODS: Morphometric data (5 parameters) were measured in 356 resected femurs of Korean women undergoing primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) utilizing the LCS knee implant (DePuy). The data were then compared with 5 additional contemporary TKA implant systems.
RESULTS: Implant designs based on Caucasian population data do not ideally match the distal femoral morphology of Korean women. Overhang at the anterior mediolateral width was observed in 84.8% for the LCS while a gender-specific implant resulted in undercoverage of the bone in 86%. Posterior overhang was observed in up to 51.2%. Most implant designs have a narrower intercondylar notch than the morphologic data of Korean women.
CONCLUSIONS: Since there is some difference between the shape of distal femur of Korean women and that of the implants, surgeons should have this in mind when selecting an implant for a patient. These data may also be used as a guideline for future prosthetic design options for Korean women population."
27583461,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27583461/,"OBJECTIVE: Pituitary adenomas (PA), especially invasive ones, are often not completely resectable. Usage of 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) for fluorescence guided surgery could improve the rate of total resection and, additionally, open the doors for photodynamic therapy (PDT) in case of unresectable or partially resected PAs. The aim of this study was to investigate the uptake of 5-ALA and the effect of 5-ALA based PDT in cell lines.
METHODS: GH3 and AtT-20 cell lines were incubated with different concentrations of 5-ALA, protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry and fluorescencespectrometry. WST-1 assays were performed to determine the surviving fraction of cells after PDT. PPIX fluorescence intensities and PDT effect of the pituitary adenoma cells were compared to U373MG, a well-known glioblastoma cell line.
RESULTS: Both cell lines showed a 5-ALA dependent intracellular PPIX fluorescence. Significant differences after 24hrs of incubation were observed in AtT-20 cells in comparison to GH3. Regardless of the incubation or metabolism time, there was a proliferation inhibiting effect after PDT, with no statistical significance.
CONCLUSION: Since GH3 cells showed a heterogenous uptake of 5-ALA in the flow cytometry profile, but not constantly high concentrations they might have a 5-ALA efflux mechanism, which still needs to be determined. In the case of AtT-20, the cells might need a longer time for the uptake due to their size or slow metabolism. We showed that the different cell lines have different uptake and metabolism mechanisms, which needs to be further investigated. The general uptake of 5-ALA allows the possibility of resection control and PDT for pituitary adenomas. But, the role of PDT for unresectable pituitary adenomas deserves further investigations."
27585197,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27585197/,"BACKGROUND: Deficiency of vitamin D is known to be effective in the development of hypertension, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Deficiency of vitamin D was also shown to be associated with new onset atrial fibrillation (AF) by activating the renin-angiotensin system. This study investigated whether or not levels of vitamin D are effective in the development of AF after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery.
METHODS: A total of 283 patients undergoing CABG were included in this study. Clinical information, history of medication use, serum 25 hydroxy(OH) vitamin D, and calcium levels of all patients were evaluated preoperatively.
RESULTS: AF developed postoperatively in 72 (25%) of patients. Serum 25(OH) vitamin D levels of patients in whom AF developed after CABG were significantly lower than patients in whom AF did not occur (15.6 ± 7.4 versus 19.1 ± 9.1; P = .004). Independent variables which were predictors of AF development in multivariate logistic regression analysis were ejection fraction (odds ratio [OR]: 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.89-0.97; P = .003), left atrial dimensions (OR: 1.47; 95% CI 1.26-1.71; P &lt; .001), and serum 25(OH) vitamin D levels (OR: 0.95; 95% CI 0.91-0.99; P = .035).
CONCLUSION: This study has shown that deficiency of vitamin D is associated with new onset AF post-CABG surgery."
27585422,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27585422/,"OBJECTIVE: Seropositive arthralgia patients (SAP) are at high risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This prospective study aimed to determine whether altered peripheral regulatory T-cells (Tregs) and defined subsets, besides a broadened anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA) response, may qualify as biomarkers for RA development in SAP.
METHODS: Thirty-four consecutive SAP were prospectively assessed every 6 months for minimally 2 years. At inclusion, peripheral Treg (CD4+CD25+FoxP3+) numbers and subsets, defined as CD45RA+FoxP3low naive Tregs (Fr I), CD45RA-FoxP3high activated Tregs (Fr II) and CD45RA-FoxP3low non-Tregs (Fr III), were compared to age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC, n = 16) and treatment-naive RA patients (n = 12). SAP that developed RA were compared to non-switchers and analyzed for Treg numbers and Treg subsets at inclusion. Also, Treg numbers and subsets were compared in switched SAP before and at diagnosis. To assess the ACPA repertoire, IgG and IgA reactivity was measured against citrullinated peptides from fibrinogen, α-enolase and vimentin.
RESULTS: Treg numbers were similar between HC, SAP and RA patients. Although the bonafide Treg subsets Fr I and Fr II were comparable between groups, Fr III was increased in SAP compared to HC (p = 0.01). Fourteen (41%) SAP developed RA during follow-up. Their Treg numbers and subsets were comparable to non-switched SAP. At RA diagnosis, Treg numbers in switched SAP were similar to 6 months before. Switched SAP displayed a more diverse IgG ACPA repertoire compared to non-switched SAP (p = 0.046) and showed more IgA reactivity than non-switched SAP reaching significance for Fib1 only (p = 0.047).
CONCLUSION: Numbers of Total Treg and bonafide Treg subsets are not indicative for RA development in SAP, opposed to the ACPA repertoire."
27585493,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27585493/,"BACKGROUND: Residency programs have utilized Individualized Learning Plans (ILPs) to customize resident education while undergraduate medical education has not done so in a meaningful way. We discuss the use of ILPs within a fourth year medical school course to facilitate self-directed learning (SDL).
METHODS: At Stony Brook University School of Medicine, an ILP component was added to the Advanced Clinical Experience (ACE) course for fourth year students. Each completed an ILP outlining personal learning goals and strategies to achieve them. An adaptation of the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ) (Duncan T and McKeachie W, Educ Psych 40(2):117-128, 2005 and Cook DA et al., Med Ed 45:1230-1240, 2011) was used to measure success of ILPs in improving SDL. Qualitative data analysis was conducted on the ILPs and self-reflections.
RESULTS: Forty-eight students participated. Two of the four SDL sub-domains identified on the MSLQ showed improvement; self-efficacy (p = .001) and self-regulation (p = .002). 'Medical Knowledge' was the competency most frequently identified as an area of concentration (90 %) and professionalism was selected least frequently (4 %). A higher percentage (83 %) of students who reported complete achievement of their ILP goals also reported feeling better prepared for entering residency.
CONCLUSIONS: ILPs improve SDL strategies among medical students and may serve as useful tools to help shape future learning goals as they transition to residency training."

METHODS: A prospective, single-centre study that evaluated 40 patients with suspicious calcifications at mammography and indication for percutaneous or surgical biopsy, with mean age of 56.4 years (range: 28-81 years). Patients who agreed to participate in the study underwent PEM with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose before the final histological evaluation. PEM findings were compared with mammography and histological findings.
RESULTS: Most calcifications (n = 34; 85.0 %) were classified as BIRADS 4. On histology, there were 25 (62.5 %) benign and 15 (37.5 %) malignant lesions, including 11 (27.5 %) ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and 4 (10 %) invasive carcinomas. On subjective analysis, PEM was positive in 15 cases (37.5 %) and most of these cases (n = 14; 93.3 %) were confirmed as malignant on histology. There was one false-positive result, which corresponded to a fibroadenoma, and one false negative, which corresponded to an intermediate-grade DCIS. PEM had a sensitivity of 93.3 %, specificity of 96.0 % and accuracy of 95 %.
CONCLUSION: PEM was able to identify all invasive carcinomas and high-grade DCIS (nuclear grade 3) in the presented sample, suggesting that this method may be useful for further evaluation of patients with suspected microcalcifications.
KEY POINTS: • Many patients with suspicious microcalcifications at mammography have benign results at biopsy. • PEM may help to identify invasive carcinomas and high-grade DCIS. • Management of patients with suspicious calcifications can be improved."
27585769,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27585769/,"INTRODUCTION: The aims of the study were to determine how a panel of orthodontists, dentists, and laypersons rated the esthetic appeal of dentitions after orthodontic space closure by canine substitution compared with space opening and replacement of missing maxillary lateral incisors by implant-borne crowns and to compare the outcome with the results of a study in the United States in 2005.
METHODS: A series of 9 posttreatment intraoral frontal photographs was presented to 87 orthodontists, 100 general dentists, and 100 laypersons. The photographs represented dentitions with either single-tooth implants or canine substitutions for missing maxillary lateral incisors and dentitions with no missing teeth. Each photograph was rated independently by assigning a number between 1 (best) and 5 (worst) for a series of 7 bipolar adjectives. Two-way analysis of variance and Tukey post hoc tests were performed to assess differences in intragroup and intergroup preferences for the various treatment options. Subsequently, the mean scores were compared with the mean scores in the study from 2005.
RESULTS: Highly significant improvements (P <0.0001) in the esthetic outcome for implants were found in all respondent groups when compared with the study from 2005. To date, orthodontists and dentists rank implants and canine substitution as equally pleasing, but laypersons prefer space closure.
CONCLUSIONS: Perceptions of dental esthetics can vary between dental professionals and laypersons. Investigating each patient's esthetic expectations is thus important, but in the patient's best interest, esthetic and functional aspects should be carefully weighed during comprehensive treatment planning."

We also sought to establish how many and which learning activities HOs achieve and the effect on their surgical experience.
METHODOLOGY: A questionnaire listing 20 learning activities and questions regarding satisfaction with an overall experience was disseminated to HOs in the UK and Ireland who had completed ≥3 months of surgical rotations. Satisfaction with surgical experience was dichotomised in order to perform logistic regression using R Studio software v0.98.
RESULTS: The survey was completed by 150 respondents, with 26 % completing at least 10 basic surgical learning activities during their surgical rotation. On multivariate analysis, the completion of these learning activities was significantly associated with a satisfactory rotation experience (p < 0.001). Furthermore, the use of a checklist of surgical activities provided to HOs was associated with a significant increase in the performance of learning activities (p = 0.003).
CONCLUSION: Surgical HOs who were informed about potential basic surgical learning activities that can be performed during their rotations performed significantly more of these activities. And these activities were associated with a significantly greater satisfaction with surgical rotations. Therefore, we recommend facilitating HOs completion of these activities as this will ensure that basic surgical competencies are achieved and that HOs will be more satisfied with their surgical experience."
27586037,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27586037/,"OBJECTIVES: In Quebec, various actors fund activities aimed at increasing physical activity, improving eating habits and reducing smoking. The objective was to evaluate how effective does the healthy lifestyle habits promotion (HLHP) strategy need to be to make to offset its costs.
METHODS: First, we built the logic model of the HLHP strategy. We then assessed the strategy's total cost as well as the direct health care expenditures associated with lifestyle-related risk factors (smoking, physical inactivity, insufficient intake of fruits and vegetables, obesity and overweight). Finally, we estimated the break-even point beyond which the economic benefits of the HLHP strategy would outweigh its costs.
RESULTS: The HLHP strategy cost for 2010-2011 was estimated at $110 million. Direct healthcare expenditures associated with lifestyle-related risk factors were estimated at $4.161 billion. We estimated that 47 % of these expenditures were attributable to these risk factors.
CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that the HLHP strategy cost corresponded to 5.6 % of the annual healthcare expenditures attributable to these risk factors. This study compared the economic value of HLHP activities against healthcare expenditures associated with targeted risk factors."

METHODS: The study sample included 61 patients with a diagnosis of RA. Major depression and other psychiatric disorders were screened with the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition. Blood sample for the determination of serum TNF-α level was obtained before the psychiatric interview.
RESULTS: The prevalence rates of any depressive disorder and any anxiety disorder were 40.3% (n=25) and 22.6% (n=14), respectively. Fifteen (24.2%) patients had major depression alone, whereas 27 (43.5%) patients were not diagnosed with any psychiatric disorder. We could not determine any significant differences between the patients with major depression alone and patients without any psychiatric diagnosis with regard to the serum levels of TNF-α.
CONCLUSIONS: The existence of major depression in RA patients does not seem to be associated with serum levels of TNF-α."
26494694,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26494694/,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Iron-mediated oxidative stress plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This study aimed to assess iron deposition qualitatively and quantitatively by using SWI and microstructural changes in the corticospinal tract by using DTI in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventeen patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and 15 age- and sex-matched controls underwent brain MR imaging with SWI and DTI. SWI was analyzed for both signal-intensity scoring and quantitative estimation of iron deposition in the anterior and posterior banks of the motor and sensory cortices and deep gray nuclei. The diffusion measurements along the corticospinal tract at the level of pons and medulla were obtained by ROI analysis.
RESULTS: Patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis showed reduced signal-intensity grades in the posterior bank of the motor cortex bilaterally. Quantitative analysis confirmed significantly higher iron content in the posterior bank of the motor cortex in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In contrast, no significant differences were noted for the anterior bank of the motor cortex, anterior and posterior banks of the sensory cortex, and deep nuclei. Receiver operating characteristic comparison showed a cutoff of 35μg Fe/g of tissue with an area under the curve of 0.78 (P = .008) for the posterior bank of the motor cortex in discriminating patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis from controls. Fractional anisotropy was lower in the pyramidal tracts of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis at the pons and medulla on either side, along with higher directionally averaged mean diffusivity values. The combination of SWI and DTI revealed an area under the curve of 0.784 for differentiating patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis from controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Measurements of motor cortex iron deposition and diffusion tensor parameters of the corticospinal tract may be useful biomarkers for the diagnosis of clinically suspected amyotrophic lateral sclerosis."
26495787,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26495787/,"OBJECTIVES: R1 resection rate after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) for cancer is highly variable. The aim of this study was to verify if a standardized histopathological work-up of the specimen affects the rate of R1 resection after PD for cancer.
METHODS: Two groups of specimens were managed with (standardized method [SM] group) or without (non-standardized method [NSM] group) a SM of histopathological work-up. Each group included 50 cases of PD for periampullary cancer. Differences in terms of R1 resection rate between the 2 groups were evaluated. Correlation between R1 status and local recurrence was also evaluated.
RESULTS: The cohort of 100 patients consisted of 66 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, 15 cholangiocarcinoma, and 19 ampullary cancer. The R1 resection rate resulted statistically higher in the SM group (66% vs 10%). Local recurrence was more frequently related to R1 resection in the SM group (34.3% of cases) than in NSM group (20% of cases).
CONCLUSIONS: The use of the SM of pathological evaluation of the specimen after PD for cancer determines a significant increase of R1 resection. This remarkable difference seems to be due to the different definition of minimum clearance. The SM seems to better discriminate patients in terms of risk of local recurrence."
26495941,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26495941/,"OBJECTIVE: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and deadliest primary brain tumor. The value of extent of resection (EOR) in improving survival in patients with GBM has been repeatedly confirmed, with more extensive resections providing added advantages. The authors reviewed the survival of patients with significant EORs and assessed the relative benefit/risk of resecting 100% of the MRI region showing contrast-enhancement with or without additional resection of the surrounding FLAIR abnormality region, and they assessed the relative benefit/risk of performing this additional resection.
METHODS: The study cohort included 1229 patients with histologically verified GBM in whom ≥ 78% resection was achieved at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center between June 1993 and December 2012. Patients with > 1 tumor and those 80 years old or older were excluded. The survival of patients having 100% removal of the contrast-enhancing tumor, with or without additional resection of the surrounding FLAIR abnormality region, was compared with that of patients undergoing 78% to < 100% EOR of the enhancing mass. Within the first subgroup, the survival durations of patients with and without resection of the surrounding FLAIR abnormality were subsequently compared. The data on patients and their tumor characteristics were collected prospectively. The incidence of 30-day postoperative complications (overall and neurological) was noted.
RESULTS: Complete resection of the T1 contrast-enhancing tumor volume was achieved in 876 patients (71%). The median survival time for these patients (15.2 months) was significantly longer than that for patients undergoing less than complete resection (9.8 months; p < 0.001). This survival advantage was achieved without an increase in the risk of overall or neurological postoperative deficits and after correcting for established prognostic factors including age, Karnofsky Performance Scale score, preoperative contrast-enhancing tumor volume, presence of cyst, and prior treatment status (HR 1.53, 95% CI 1.33-1.77, p < 0.001). The effect remained essentially unchanged when data from previously treated and previously untreated groups of patients were analyzed separately. Additional analyses showed that the resection of ≥ 53.21% of the surrounding FLAIR abnormality beyond the 100% contrast-enhancing resection was associated with a significant prolongation of survival compared with that following less extensive resections (median survival times 20.7 and 15.5 months, respectively; p < 0.001). In the multivariate analysis, the previously treated group with < 53.21% resection had significantly shorter survival than the 3 other groups (that is, previously treated patients who underwent FLAIR resection ≥ 53.21%, previously untreated patients who underwent FLAIR resection < 53.21%, and previously untreated patients who underwent FLAIR resection ≥ 53.21%); the previously untreated group with ≥ 53.21% resection had the longest survival.
CONCLUSIONS: What is believed to be the largest single-center series of GBM patients with extensive tumor resections, this study supports the established association between EOR and survival and presents additional data that pushing the boundary of a conventional 100% resection by the additional removal of a significant portion of the FLAIR abnormality region, when safely feasible, may result in the prolongation of survival without significant increases in overall or neurological postoperative morbidity. Additional supportive evidence is warranted."
26495956,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26495956/,"BACKGROUND: Human fetal lung xenografts display an unusual pattern of non-sprouting, plexus-forming angiogenesis that is reminiscent of the dysmorphic angioarchitecture described in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The aim of this study was to determine the clinicopathological correlates, growth characteristics and molecular regulation of this aberrant form of graft angiogenesis.
METHODS: Fetal lung xenografts, derived from 12 previable fetuses (15 to 22 weeks' gestation) and engrafted in the renal subcapsular space of SCID-beige mice, were analyzed 4 weeks posttransplantation for morphology, vascularization, proliferative activity and gene expression.
RESULTS: Focal plexus-forming angiogenesis (PFA) was observed in 60/230 (26%) of xenografts. PFA was characterized by a complex network of tortuous nonsprouting vascular structures with low endothelial proliferative activity, suggestive of intussusceptive-type angiogenesis. There was no correlation between the occurrence of PFA and gestational age or time interval between delivery and engraftment. PFA was preferentially localized in the relatively hypoxic central subcapsular area. Microarray analysis suggested altered expression of 15 genes in graft regions with PFA, of which 7 are known angiogenic/lymphangiogenic regulators and 5 are known hypoxia-inducible genes. qRT-PCR analysis confirmed significant upregulation of SULF2, IGF2, and HMOX1 in graft regions with PFA.
CONCLUSION: These observations in human fetal lungs ex vivo suggest that postcanalicular lungs can switch from sprouting angiogenesis to an aberrant intussusceptive-type of angiogenesis that is highly reminiscent of BPD-associated dysangiogenesis. While circumstantial evidence suggests hypoxia may be implicated, the exact triggering mechanisms, molecular regulation and clinical implications of this angiogenic switch in preterm lungs in vivo remain to be determined."
26495967,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26495967/,"BACKGROUND: Sibling sex ratios have been applied as an indirect test of a hypothesized association between prenatal testosterone levels and risk for autism, a developmental disorder disproportionately affecting males. Differences in sibling sex ratios between those with and without autism would provide evidence of a shared risk factor for autism and offspring sex. Conclusions related to prenatal testosterone, however, require additional assumptions. Here, we used directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to clarify the elements required for a valid test of the hypothesis that sibling sex ratios differ between children with and without autism. We then conducted such a test using a large, population-based sample of children.
METHODS: Over 1.1 million subjects, born in California from 1992-2007, and identified through birth records, were included. The association between autism diagnosis, determined using the administrative database of the California Department of Developmental Services, and the sex of the subsequent sibling was examined using generalized estimating equations. Sources of potential bias identified using DAGs were addressed.
RESULTS: Among male children with autism, 52.2% of next-born siblings were brothers, versus 51.0% for unaffected males. For females with autism, 50.2% of following siblings were brothers versus 51.2% among control females. The relative risk of a subsequent male sibling associated with autism diagnosis was 1.02 (95% confidence interval: 0.99, 1.04).
CONCLUSIONS: In a large, population-based sample we failed to find evidence suggesting an excess of brothers among children with autism while controlling for several threats to validity. This test cannot rule out a role of any given exposure, including prenatal testosterone, in either risk of autism or offspring sex ratio, but suggests against a common cause of both."
26496419,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26496419/,"PURPOSE: Sit-to-stand workstations are becoming common in modern offices and are increasingly being implemented in sedentary behavior interventions. The purpose of this study was to examine whether the introduction of such a workstation among office workers leads to reductions in sitting during working hours, and whether office workers compensate for any reduction in sitting at work by increasing sedentary time and decreasing physical activity (PA) outside work.
METHODS: Office workers (n = 40; 55% female) were given a WorkFit-S, sit-to-stand workstation for 3 months. Participants completed assessments at baseline (before workstation installation), 1 wk and 6 wk after the introduction of the workstation, and again at 3 months (postintervention). Posture and PA were assessed using the activPAL inclinometer and ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometer, which participants wore for 7 d during each measurement phase.
RESULTS: Compared with baseline, the proportion of time spent sitting significantly decreased (75% ± 13% vs 52% ± 16% to 56% ± 13%), and time spent standing and in light activity significantly increased (standing: 19% ± 12% vs 32% ± 12% to 37% ± 15%, light PA: 14% ± 4% vs 16% ± 5%) during working hours at all follow-up assessments. However, compared with baseline, the proportion of time spent sitting significantly increased (60% ± 11% vs 66% ± 12% to 68% ± 12%) and light activity significantly decreased (21% ± 5% vs 19% ± 5%) during nonworking hours across the follow-up measurements. No differences were seen in moderate-to-vigorous activity during nonworking hours throughout the study.
CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that introducing a sit-to-stand workstation can significantly reduce sedentary time and increase light activity levels during working hours. However, these changes were compensated for by reducing activity and increasing sitting outside of working hours. An intervention of a sit-to-stand workstation should be accompanied by an intervention outside of working hours to limit behavior compensation."
26496491,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26496491/,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Contrast induced nephropathy (CIN) has multifactorial etiopatogenesis including oxidative stress and vasoconstriction. Nebivolol is an antioxidant and has vasodilatatory effect via NO release and may prevent CIN development. We have noticed that a few number of studies that have evaluated the effectiveness of nebivolol for the prevention of CIN used serum creatinine (sCr) levels for CIN detection. However, sCr is an insensitive marker for renal damage. Therefore in this study we used serum neutrophil-gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL), a more sensitive marker of renal damage, to evaluate preventive role of nebivolol in CIN.
METHODS: 159 patients undergoing coronary angiography (CAG) who had at least one risk factor for CIN were divided into nebivolol (+) and (-) groups. CIN was defined as a rise in sCr of 0.5mg/dl or a 25% increase from the baseline value. Serum Cr, glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and NGAL levels were assessed before and 48 h after CAG. Mehran risk scores were calculated for both groups.
RESULTS: Both groups were similar in terms of baseline characteristics, Mehran risk scores, and current medications. Clinically, CIN developed at similar rates in both groups. Serum Cr, eGFR and NGAL values were similar in both groups before and after CAG. Serum Cr and NGAL levels increased and eGFR decreased significantly compared to the levels before CAG. Patients who developed CIN were significantly older (p=0.003), and were more likely to have DM (p=0.012), a higher mean contrast agent volume (p<0.001), and a higher Mehran score (p <0.001). We did not observe any favorable effect of Nebivolol in the prevention of CIN in patients undergoing CAG.
CONCLUSION: According to the results of our study Nebivolol does not seem to prevent CIN in patients undergoing CAG. However, further randomised controlled trials with more sensitive renal damage markers are obviously needed to understand the actual effect of nebivolol on CIN especially through oxidative pathways and in high risk patients."
26496658,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26496658/,"BACKGROUND: A transient dysfunction of the endocrine growth axis has been reported in celiac disease (CD). This apparent growth hormone deficiency (GHD) generally normalizes with the institution of a gluten-free diet (GFD). However, in few cases, the dysfunction of the GH axis persists despite a good adherence to the GFD. Aims of this study were to investigate pediatric patients with concurrent CD and GHD and to compare them with patients with isolated CD.
METHODS: Data regarding CD patients with and without associated GHD were retrospectively collected. Inclusion criteria were availability of anthropometric and laboratory data at baseline and regularly at the reference center up to a 2-year follow-up. In case of poor catch-up growth despite a good adherence to the GFD, endocrinological investigation was carried on.
RESULTS: Fifty-three patients with CD were included. Four (7.5%) out of 53 CD patients had a concurrent GHD. In two cases, firstly diagnosed with CD, GHD was suspected because of a poor catch-up growth despite a good adherence to the GFD. In two other cases, firstly diagnosed with GHD, gastrointestinal symptoms revealed the diagnosis of CD. Normalization of height velocity was achieved by GH treatment in all cases. No statistical significant difference between the two groups of patients was found as regard laboratory and histological features of CD. It is to note that 2 out of 4 patients with concomitant CD and GHD had thyroiditis compared to 6% of patients with isolated CD (P=0.004).
CONCLUSIONS: A high prevalence of CD and GHD association was found. CD patients with poor catch-up growth despite a good adherence to the GFD should be carefully investigated for endocrine disorders."
26497607,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26497607/,"PURPOSE: To determine if asymmetry between hips in pain or radiographic osteoarthritis (RHOA) is associated with worse pain and joint space narrowing (JSN) at baseline and longitudinally in knees contralateral to more affected hips.
METHODS: We studied 279 participants in the Osteoarthritis Initiative with baseline asymmetry between hips in pain and 483 with asymmetry in RHOA none of whom had a hip replacement for ≥4 years after baseline. RHOA assessed from pelvis radiographs was categorized as none, possible or definite and hip pain on most days of a month in the past year as present/absent. Knee pain (WOMAC scale) and JSN (fixed flexion radiographs) were categorized as none, mild and moderate-severe. We compared knees contralateral and ipsilateral to more affected hips on baseline knee pain and JSN using clustered multinomial regression and on change in knee pain and JSN over 4-5 years using generalized linear and logistic estimating equations.
RESULTS: Knees contralateral to painful hips had less baseline pain (""moderate-severe"" vs ""none"", relative risk ratio [RRR]: 0.39, 95% CI = 0.27-0.57), but greater baseline JSN (""moderate-severe"" vs ""none"", RRR: 1.62, 95% CI = 1.09-2.38) and greater worsening of pain during follow-up (P = 0.001). Knees contralateral to hips with worse RHOA had nonsignificant trends for greater baseline JSN (P = 0.10) and JSN progression (P = 0.17).
CONCLUSION: These findings provide limited support for the hypothesis that early asymmetry in hip pain and RHOA is associated with worse pain and structural outcomes in knees contralateral to the more affected hip."
26497882,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26497882/,"BACKGROUND: Controversy regarding heterotopic ossification (HO) prophylaxis exists after Kocher-Langenbeck for treatment of acetabular fracture. Prophylaxis options include antiinflammatory oral medications, single-dose radiation therapy, and débridement of gluteus minimus muscle. Prior literature has suggested single-dose radiation therapy as the best prophylaxis to prevent HO formation. However, recent reports have emerged of radiation-induced sarcoma after radiotherapy for HO prophylaxis, which has led many surgeons to reconsider the risks and benefits of single-dose radiation therapy. We set out to determine if radiotherapy, in addition to standard débridement of gluteus minimus muscle, affected postoperative HO formation after a Kocher-Langenbeck approach for acetabular fracture.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) After the Kocher-Langenbeck approach and gluteus minimus débridement, is single-dose radiotherapy associated with a decreased risk of HO? (2) Does addition of single-dose radiotherapy prolong length of stay after a Kocher-Langenbeck approach and gluteus minimus débridement as compared with patients without radiotherapy?
METHODS: After institutional review board approval, all adult patients treated for acetabular fracture by a single surgeon with a Kocher-Langenbeck approach between August 2011 and October 2014 were identified (n = 60). Débridement of gluteus minimus muscle caudal to the superior gluteal bundle was standard in all patients. Radiotherapy was given with a single dose of 700 cGy within 72 hours of surgery from August 2011 until April 2013. Patients treated subsequently did not receive radiotherapy. Patients treated with indomethacin (n = 1) and with fewer than 10 weeks followup were excluded (n = 12) because several studies suggest that most HO that develops is visible by that point in time. Our study group totaled 46 patients with 24 in the radiotherapy and débridement group and 22 in the débridement group. Charts were reviewed to determine length of stay. Attending orthopaedic trauma surgeons who were blinded to the patient's treatment group graded all followup radiographs according to the Brooker system, and Classes III and IV HO were considered clinically important Fisher's exact test was used to analyze clinically significant differences HO between the two groups. Length of stay was compared using a t-test.
RESULTS: Single-dose radiotherapy is associated with a decreased risk of clinically important (Brooker III-IV) HO after a Kocher-Langenbeck approach and gluteus minimus débridement (radiotherapy: one of 24 [4%], no radiotherapy: seven of 22 [32%], relative risk: 0.131 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.018-0.981], p = 0.020). Addition of single-dose radiotherapy did not result in increased length of stay (radiotherapy: 12 ± 7.0 days; no radiotherapy: 11 ± 7.2 days; mean difference: 1.0 [95% CI, -3.2 to 5.2] days, p = 0.635).
CONCLUSIONS: Single-dose radiation in combination with gluteus minimus débridement decreases the risk of clinically important HO compared with gluteus minimus débridement alone after a Kocher-Langenbeck approach for acetabular fracture. No differences in length of stay were seen. Surgeons who chose not to use radiotherapy as a result of concern for future sarcoma may see higher rates of clinically significant HO after a Kocher-Langenbeck approach for acetabular fracture fixation.

26498138,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26498138/,"PURPOSE: We evaluated the current indications and surgical and survival outcomes for cryoablation (CA) using either a percutaneous (PCA) or a laparoscopic approach (LCA). We also investigated the ability of the PADUA score to predict the risk of complications and local recurrence.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed at two European tertiary referral centers. Parameters analyzed included size, location, approach, operative time, hospital stay, complications, and functional and oncologic outcomes. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. An ROC analysis was conducted to evaluate the accuracy of the PADUA score.
RESULTS: Eighty patients were included. Mean tumor size was 2.6 cm. PCA was more often performed in posterior (95 vs. 60 %), inferior (72 vs. 32 %), and lateral (87 vs. 55 %) tumors. The global complication rate was 8.75 %, although proximity to the renal sinus resulted in a higher rate (30 vs. 4 %). Mean follow-up was 34 and 23 months for LCA and PCA, respectively. The 5-year recurrence-free survival was 76 and 90 % for LCA and PCA, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that tumor involvement of the collecting system was predictive of recurrence. Under ROC analysis, PADUA score was a mild predictor for complications (AUC = 0.601) and a good predictor for recurrence (AUC = 0.723); PADUA ≥8 was identified as a cutoff for patients to a higher risk of recurrence.
CONCLUSIONS: The percutaneous approach is confirmed to be the preferred CA technique for posterior and lateral tumors. CA in deeper renal lesions and tumors with PADUA score ≥8 might entail a higher risk of recurrence, and closer follow-up should be considered in these patients."
26498230,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26498230/,"INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to evaluate if there is a significant effect of lunar phases on subjective and objective sleep variables in the general population.
METHODS: A total of 2125 individuals (51.2% women, age 58.8 ± 11.2 years) participating in a population-based cohort study underwent a complete polysomnography (PSG) at home. Subjective sleep quality was evaluated by a self-rating scale. Sleep electroencephalography (EEG) spectral analysis was performed in 759 participants without significant sleep disorders. Salivary cortisol levels were assessed at awakening, 30 min after awakening, at 11 am, and at 8 pm. Lunar phases were grouped into full moon (FM), waxing/waning moon (WM), and new moon (NM).
RESULTS: Overall, there was no significant difference between lunar phases with regard to subjective sleep quality. We found only a nonsignificant (p = 0.08) trend toward a better sleep quality during the NM phase. Objective sleep duration was not different between phases (FM: 398 ± 3 min, WM: 402 ± 3 min, NM: 403 ± 3 min; p = 0.31). No difference was found with regard to other PSG-derived parameters, EEG spectral analysis, or in diurnal cortisol levels. When considering only subjects with apnea/hypopnea index of <15/h and periodic leg movements index of <15/h, we found a trend toward shorter total sleep time during FM (FM: 402 ± 4, WM: 407 ± 4, NM: 415 ± 4 min; p = 0.06) and shorter-stage N2 duration (FM: 178 ± 3, WM: 182 ± 3, NM: 188 ± 3 min; p = 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Our large population-based study provides no evidence of a significant effect of lunar phases on human sleep."
26498374,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26498374/,"BACKGROUND: Abdominal complaints are common reasons for contacting primary care physicians, and it can be challenging for general practitioners (GPs) to identify patients with suspected colorectal cancer (CRC) for referral to secondary care. The immunochemical faecal occult blood test (iFOBT) is used as a diagnostic aid in primary care, but it is unclear how test results are interpreted. Studies show that negative tests are associated with a risk of delayed diagnosis of CRC and that some patients with positive tests are not investigated further. The aim of this study was to explore what makes GPs suspect CRC and to investigate their practices regarding investigation and referral, with special attention on the use of iFOBTs.
METHOD: Semi-structured individual interviews were conducted with eleven purposely selected GPs and registrars in Region Jämtland Härjedalen, Sweden, and subjected to qualitative content analysis.
RESULTS: In the analysis of the interviews four categories were identified that described what made the physicians suspect CRC and their practices. Careful listening-with awareness of the pitfalls: Attentive listening was described as essential, but there was a risk of being misled by, for example, the patient's own explanations. Tests can help-the iFOBT can also complicate the diagnosis: All physicians used iFOBTs to various extents. In the absence of guidelines, all found their own ways to interpret and act on the test results. To refer or not to refer-safety margins are necessary: Uncertainty was described as a part of everyday work and was handled in different ways. Common vague symptoms could be CRC and thus justified referral with safety margins. Growing more confident-but also more humble: With increasing experience, the GPs described becoming more confident in their decisions but they were also more cautious.
CONCLUSIONS: Listening carefully to the patient's history was essential. The iFOBT was frequently used as support, but there were considerable variations in the interpretation and handling of the results. The diagnostic process can be described as navigating uncertain waters with safety margins, while striving to keep the patient's best interests in mind. The iFOBT may be useful as a diagnostic aid in primary care, but more research and evidence-based guidelines are needed."
26498398,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26498398/,"OBJECTIVE: Cerebral vasospasm (CVS) occurs regularly between days 3 and 12 after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Yet, some patients suffering from SAH have long-lasting cerebral vasospasm (LL-CVS, i.e., longer than 14 days). The outcome of these patients with a very long treatment is unknown.
METHODS: Patients with SAH were entered into a prospectively collected database. In unconscious patients, CVS was treated until a reversal of CVS was confirmed by imaging. Outcome was assessed with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS; favorable [mRS 0-2] and unfavorable [mRS 3-6]) 6 months after SAH. Data were compared by matched pair analysis.
RESULTS: Of 1126 patients, 106 had LL-CVS (9.4%). The mean of treatment was until day 20 (range, 15-42). Of these patients, more than 30% needed treatment longer than 21 days after SAH; 29% had a small intracerebral hematoma (ICH; <50 mL). Hydrocephalus that required external ventricular drainage was present in 81%. Outcomes were favorable in 60%, and 8% died. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, risk factors for an unfavorable outcome were elderly patients, poor admission status, and the presence of small ICH. Compared with the matched control group, who had ""regular-lasting"" CVS, patients with LL-CVS had a significant better outcome (60% vs. 49%) and a significant lower mortality rate (8% vs. 27%).
CONCLUSION: Patients with LL-CVS had a significant better outcome than patients with ""regular-lasting"" CVS. Risk factors for worse outcome of patients with LL-CVS were a worse admission status, elderly age, and the presence of small ICH. We recommend using an objective method to validate the reversal of CVS in unconscious patients."
26498747,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26498747/,"BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a public health priority and leading patient safety issue. Globally, antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) has been integral in promoting therapeutic optimization whilst minimizing harmful antimicrobial use. A cross-sectional, observational study was undertaken to investigate the coverage of AMS and antibacterial resistance across clinical scientific conferences in 2014, as a surrogate marker for current awareness and attributed importance.
METHODS: Clinical specialties were identified, and the largest corresponding clinical scientific/research conferences in 2014 determined (i) within the UK and (ii) internationally. Conference characteristics and abstracts were interrogated and analysed to determine those related to AMS and AMR. Inter-specialty variation was assessed using χ(2) or Fisher's exact statistical analysis.
RESULTS: In total, 45 conferences from 23 specialties were analysed representing 59,682 accepted abstracts. The UK had a significantly greater proportion of AMS-AMR-related abstracts compared with international conferences [2.8% (n = 221/7843) compared with 1.8% (n = 942/51,839); P < 0.001]. Infection conferences contained the greatest proportion of AMS-AMR abstracts, representing 20% (732/3669) of all abstracts [UK 66% (80/121) and international 18% (652/3548); P < 0.0001]. AMS-AMR coverage across all general specialties was poor [intensive care 9% (116/1287), surgical 1% (8/757) and medical specialties 0.64% (332/51,497)] despite high usage of antimicrobials across all.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite current AMS-AMR strategies being advocated by infection specialists and discussed by national and international policy makers, AMS-AMR coverage remained limited across clinical specialty scientific conferences in 2014. We call for further intervention to ensure specialty engagement with AMS programmes and promote the AMR agenda across clinical practice."

Of primary concern, however, is the potential of the procedure to mask the presence or delay the diagnosis of endometrial cancer. The aim of this study is to assess the long-term effects of endometrial ablation and its association with the development of endometrial cancer.
METHODS: This is a retrospective observational study that was conducted at Bradford Teaching Hospitals in the United Kingdom. The study included all women who had different types of endometrial ablative procedures in the period of January 1994 to December 2011. Analysis of the data was performed using SPSS for windows (V9) software package.
RESULTS: Over 18 years period, 1521 women had endometrial ablative procedures for dysfunctional uterine bleeding. During their long-term follow-up, none of the women developed endometrial cancer later in life. This incidence is much lower than the lifetime risk of endometrial cancer in the general population (RR 0.0135; 95 % CI 0.0007-0.2801; P = 0.0054).
CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the largest study to examine the long-term incidence of endometrial cancer in women who had endometrial ablative procedures. It shows that the development of endometrial cancer does not seem to be associated with endometrial ablative procedures."
26499104,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26499104/,"OBJECTIVE: Variation in the use of tests and treatments has been demonstrated to be substantial between providers and geographic regions. This study assessed variation between outpatient providers in overriding electronic prescribing warnings.
METHODS: Responses to warnings were prospectively logged. Random effects models were used to calculate provider-to-provider variation in the rates for the decisions to override warnings in 6 different clinical domains: medication allergies, drug-drug interactions, duplicate drugs, renal recommendations, age-based recommendations, and formulary substitutions.
RESULTS: A total of 157 482 responses were logged. Differences between 1717 providers accounted for 11% of the overall variability in override rates, so that while the average override rate was 45.2%, individual provider rates had a wide range with a 95% confidence interval (CI) (13.7%-76.7% ). The highest variations between providers were observed in the categories age-based (25.4% of total variability; average override rate 70.2% [95% CI, 29.1%-100% ]) and renal recommendations (24.2%; average 70% [95% CI, 29.5%-100% ]), and provider responses within these 2 categories were most often clinically inappropriate according to prior work. Among providers who received at least 10 age-based recommendations, 64 of 238 (27%) overrode ≥ 90% of the warnings and 13 of 238 (5%) overrode all of them. Of those who received at least 10 renal recommendations, 36 of 92 (39%) overrode ≥ 90% of the alerts and 9 of 92 (10%) overrode all of them.
CONCLUSIONS: The decision to override prescribing warnings shows variation between providers, and the magnitude of variation differs among the clinical domains of the warnings; more variation was observed in areas with more inappropriate overrides."
26499381,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26499381/,"PURPOSE: There is a conflicting evidence about the association between hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and diabetes mellitus. The objective of this study was to assess this association in Egypt, the country with the highest HCV prevalence in the world.
METHODS: The source of data was from the Egypt Demographic and Health Survey conducted in 2008. Using multivariable logistic regression analyses to account for known confounders, the association was investigated at two levels']: (1) HCV exposure (HCV antibody status) and diabetes mellitus and (2) diabetes mellitus and chronic HCV infection (HCV RNA status) among HCV-exposed individuals.
RESULTS: We found no evidence for an association between HCV antibody status and diabetes (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.63-1.19). However, among HCV-exposed individuals, we found an evidence for an association between diabetes and active HCV infection (adjusted OR = 2.44, 95% CI, 1.30-4.57).
CONCLUSIONS: Although it does not appear that HCV exposure and diabetes are linked, there might be an association between diabetes and chronic HCV infection. The HCV-diabetes relationship may be more complex than previously anticipated. Therefore, a call for an ""amicable divorce"" to the HCV-diabetes relationship could be premature."
26499785,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26499785/,"BACKGROUND: Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are often diagnosed unexpectedly after surgery, and many excisions are incomplete. As histopathological assessments are challenging, patients later referred to comprehensive cancer centers (CCC) often come with an unclear status. This can make treatment planning problematic. We investigated the reliability of primary histopathological assessments, whether revisional surgery improved resection status, and the prognostic value of residual tumor at re-excision.
METHODS: We analyzed the demographic and clinical characteristics of all patients referred to our CCC between 2003 and 2013. We compared patients treated exclusively at our CCC with those who had primary surgery elsewhere, and focused on resection margins, re-excision type, residual tumor, resection status after re-excision, and oncological outcome.
RESULTS: Over half (n = 110) of all patients (n = 204) were referred from elsewhere. Seventy-one had undergone an excision without suspicion of malignancy. Resection status in referred patients was significantly inferior to the CCC group (p < 0.0001), although the latter had significantly more serious tumors and advanced disease stages (p < 0.05). The residual tumor rate was 53.13%, with a significantly higher probability in an upper extremity (p = 0.001). Initial histopathological classification was misleading in 46.9% of cases. Re-excision improved resection status in 69% of cases. Residual tumor presumably leads to higher rates of local recurrence (p = 0.057) and significantly shorter times to recurrence (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Re-excision should always follow unplanned STS excisions. Resection margins and histopathological assessments from referring institutions are often unreliable and unsuitable for treatment planning. Residual tumor is a risk factor for earlier and more likely local recurrence."

METHODS: We performed a single-center, retrospective study of consecutive living kidney donors who underwent laparoscopic nephrectomy for transplantation, with or without simultaneous ipsilateral adrenalectomy, between January 2008 and September 2014.
RESULTS: During the study period, AIs were detected in 18 of 1033 potential living renal donors who underwent computerized tomographic angiography. Application of additional donor selection criteria and of an adrenal mass assessment algorithm resulted in 849 HALDN, of which 13 were combined with simultaneous adrenalectomy. The hospital length of stay (2.4 vs 2.6 days), perioperative (0.025 vs 0.077), early (0.073 vs 0.077), and late (0.014 vs 0.077) postoperative complication rates, and conversion to open donor nephrectomy (0.008 vs 0.00) were not significantly different. Mean operative time was significantly longer in the adrenalectomy group. None of the adrenal masses were malignant.
CONCLUSION: Here, we presented our algorithm to manage the living kidney donors with AIs. Although donor population with AIs was relatively small in number, simultaneous adrenalectomy and ipsilateral nephrectomy seemed to be technically safe and conferred no identifiable increased risk of malignancy for the kidney transplant donor, when the incidentaloma is nonfunctional and less than or equal to 4 cm as assessed by preoperative imaging."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients diagnosed with APL during the period of 2002 to 2014 were included. They received ATRA 25 mg/m(2) plus anthracycline (doxorubicin or mitoxantrone) as induction chemotherapy, followed by 3 consolidations with LD-ATRA and anthracycline and maintenance therapy with intermittent LD-ATRA and oral chemotherapy for 2 years.
RESULTS: Twenty-two patients with a median age of 28 years (range, 18-55 years) were included; 17 (77%) were in the low-risk group. Complete remission occurred in 86%, and the early death rate was 9%. At a median follow-up of 32 months (range, 4-126 months) disease-free survival (DFS) was 75% and overall survival (OS) was 86%, with a relapse rate of 27% for the entire follow-up period.
CONCLUSION: LD-ATRA plus anthracycline is safe and effective in achieving CR of APL. The early death rate is similar to that of treatment with standard doses, but it appears to be inferior in preventing relapses."
26501709,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26501709/,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether liver metastases contribute to metastatic spread of colorectal cancer (CRC) by shedding intact tumor cells.
BACKGROUND: Metastases represent the primary cause of death in CRC. Understanding the metastatic activity of metastases and which patients are at high risk for tumor cell dissemination may, therefore, have significant influence on cancer care in the future.
METHODS: Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) were detected in the hepatic inflow (portal venous blood [PVB]) and outflow compartment (hepatic venous blood [HVB]) of a training (n = 55) and validation (n = 50) set using the CellSearch system. Isolated CTC from the HVB were subjected to gene expression analyses by quantitative polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: CTC detection rate (37.2% vs 19.6%; P = 0.04) and count (mean: 12.7, SEM: ± 5.9 vs 1.9; ± 1.2; P = 0.01) were significantly higher in HVB compared to PVB. The increased CTC detection rate (54% vs 11.4%; P < 0.001) and CTC count (14.7 ± 5.1 vs 1.1 ± 0.6; P < 0.001) in the HVB compared to the PVB compartment was confirmed in the validation cohort. Expression of epithelial markers and genes involved in cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix adhesion was reduced in CTC compared to tumor cells in liver metastases. Metastasis size greater than 5 cm was associated with CTC shedding from established liver metastases in the training and validation cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS: Colorectal liver metastases shed intact tumor cells with an invasive phenotype. Metastasis size serves as a surrogate marker for metastatic activity of colorectal liver metastases."
26501882,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26501882/,"INTRODUCTION: Colonoscopic surveillance guidelines for serrated polyps (SPs) are predicated upon the histologic characteristics of the index polyp. However, discrimination between SP subtypes [hyperplastic polyps vs. sessile serrated adenoma/polyps (SSA/P)] is often unreliable.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied the impact of (1) a novel tissue orientation method, performed in the endoscopy laboratory, whereby polyps are flattened in a small paper envelope immediately after resection (modified protocol); and (2) 2012 consensus-modified criteria (CM-2012). These interventions were compared with conventional tissue-handling protocol (CP) and traditional 2008 World Health Organization criteria (WHO). Twenty blinded community pathologists from around the United States scored 100, independent, 0.5 to 2.0 cm, proximal colonic SPs randomly selected from a 2-site tissue section archive. We compared interobserver agreement and diagnostic grading.
RESULTS: Interobserver agreement was higher using CM-2012 than WHO criteria (absolute agreement: 13% vs. 4%, P<0.01; 75% agreement: 54% vs. 38%, P<0.01). Interobserver agreement was higher with the modified protocol than with CP (WHO absolute agreement: 6% vs. 2%, P>0.05; WHO 75% agreement: 46% vs. 30%, P>0.05, and CM-2012 absolute agreement: 20% vs. 6%, P=0.07; CM-2012 75% agreement: 66% vs. 42%, P=0.03). Compared with WHO, use of CM-2012 criteria resulted in fewer diagnoses of ""indeterminate""; more diagnoses of SSA/P (P<0.01); and ""upgraded"" the diagnosis from hyperplastic polyps to SSA/P in approximately 7% of cases. These observations were independent of polyp size, patient gender, and study site.
CONCLUSIONS: Simple enhancements to postresection SP handling and diagnostic criteria markedly improve interobserver agreement of SP diagnosis among nongastrointestinal community pathologists. This finding, if confirmed, has important implications for SP colonoscopy surveillance guidelines."
26502012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26502012/,"INTRODUCTION: Long-term daily azithromycin therapy reduces the frequency of exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in a randomized controlled clinical trial setting. Concerns exist regarding arrhythmic and auditory toxicities from chronic use in the real-world setting. We hypothesized that risk factors for adverse drug reactions to azithromycin would be more frequent than previously reported, that certain specific subgroups would have different frequencies of these risk factors and that the whispered voice test would be a useful test with which to test for hearing deficits.
METHODS: Following ethical approval, 47 consecutive hospital-based patients with a mean age 69 years ± 8.2, and with physician-diagnosed COPD (mean FEV 45.1 ± 18 % predicted), were screened for subjective hearing impairment (screening questions and whispered voice test) and by electrocardiogram for prolonged QTc. Other potential risk factors and contraindications to long-term daily azithromycin were sought.
RESULTS: In total, 38 patients (80.9 %) had at least one risk factor or contraindication to azithromycin treatment. 19 patients (40.4 % of total) had subjective hearing impairment. 17 (36.1 %) had prolonged QTc intervals. 4 patients (8.51 %) had contraindicating co-morbidities. Those on long-term oxygen therapy were significantly more likely to have at least one risk factors or contraindications to azithromycin (p = 0.0025).
CONCLUSION: In a COPD population who would otherwise potentially be candidates for long-term daily azithromycin therapy, over 80 % had risk factors for complications from long-term daily azithromycin. Preventative treatment with long-term daily azithromycin may be appropriate for fewer COPD patients than previously thought, especially in those on long-term oxygen therapy."
26502182,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26502182/,"PURPOSE: The most suitable treatment conditions and timing for medically unstable patients with severe systemic diseases about to undergo invasive dental treatment are well documented in the literature; however, no medical guides or recommendations identify these conditions for noninvasive dental treatments in such patients. The aim of this clinical study was to determine the effect of impression procedures on arterial oxygen saturation (AOS) and pulse rates (PRs) of edentulous subjects.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 28 Caucasian edentulous participants (15 females, 13 males) were included in the study. Pulse oximetry recordings (150 seconds) were performed for each participant at three stages; recording at rest (CON), during mandibular impressions (MANIs), and maxillary impressions (MAXIs). The mean values of PR, AOS, and event scores (ESs) indicating desaturation were obtained from the records. The comparisons of mean PR and AOS values were performed with the Bonferroni-corrected Wilcoxon-signed ranks test. The ESs were analyzed with the McNemar Test.
RESULTS: The mean AOS values of MANI and MAXI did not display significant changes when compared with CON; however, the ESs obtained in both MANI and MAXI were significantly higher than those of CON (p = 0.008, p = 0.004). In addition, mean PR values obtained in MAXI were significantly higher than CON (p = 0.009).
CONCLUSIONS: According to the results of this clinical study, the impression procedures may affect the PR values and lead to desaturation events in edentulous patients; however, further studies evaluating blood gas levels, which indicate precise AOS values, are necessary to support the results of this study."
26502873,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26502873/,"BACKGROUND: A rapid rise in PubMed citations on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) occurred after 2000, but the relationship of trends in citation to epidemiologic trends for infectious disease is not known.
METHODS: We queried PubMed(R), for citations to the following: MRSA, HIV/AIDS, Staphylococcus aureus, severe acute respiratory syndrome, Lyme disease, avian influenza, West Nile virus, Chikungunya, Ebola virus and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome. Incidence or mortality data were tabulated.
RESULTS: We identified 560,225 citations in 1963-2014. There were two distinct qualitative citation patterns. Type I pathogens showed a decade of initial exponential growth. Type II pathogens showed a sudden spike in citations in a year or two, followed by a relative decline. MRSA most closely resembled a Type I pathogen.
CONCLUSIONS: The Type I pattern pathogens had varied trends in disease incidence in the years following the exponential growth and subsequent decline in the number of citations. Their differing epidemiologic patterns did not correlate with their pattern of citations. We conclude that citation trends on MRSA cannot be used to determine past epidemiologic trends and also that the citation trend for MRSA in 1995-2011 most closely resembled that for HIV in 1981-1998."
26502944,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26502944/,"BACKGROUND: Multiple reports have confirmed that quality of life (QoL) in women after myocardial infarction (MI) is worse compared to men of the same age but some variation depending on QoL dimension was also reported. A less studied issue is coping after MI.
AIM: The present study examined whether gender affected the level and dynamics of QoL and coping over 1 year after MI.
METHODS: This questionnaire-based study included 3 stages, at the beginning and the end of a rehabilitation programme (n = 222, 163 [73%] men) and 1 year later (n = 140, 98 [70%] men). The MacNew questionnaire was used for evaluating cardiac patient-specific QoL in 3 dimensions: physical, emotional and social. Coping was examined using a modified COPE scale that allows assessment of seven coping strategies.
RESULTS: Compared to women, men had higher levels of emotional and physical QoL at the first and second stage of the study. At the third stage, men and women did not differ in any QoL aspect. Significant gender-time interactions were found for physical QoL (F(2.137) = 8.66; p = 0.001, eta2 = 0.07) and for 2 of 7 coping strategies: sense of humour (F(2.137) = 4.10; p = 0.02, eta2 = 0.06) and turning to religion (F(2.137) = 3.55; p = 0.03, eta2 = 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Men demonstrated higher levels of physical and emotional QoL during inpatient rehabilitation but no gender-related differences in any QoL dimension were seen at 1 year. The dynamics of physical QoL changes was related to gender, with improvement seen in women and deterioration seen in men. There were also gender-related differences in the dynamics and levels of certain coping strategies. The observed changes in QoL and coping suggest that some of the beneficial effects of rehabilitation could not be maintained over 1 year. These unfavourable changes are more frequent in men."
26503238,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26503238/,"OBJECTIVE: This study examined associations between drinking motivation, alcohol use, and sexual hookups among college students.
PARTICIPANTS: Participants (n = 755 Midwest college student drinkers; 61% female) ranged in age from 18 to 24.
METHODS: Participants completed online measures of alcohol involvement (use and motives) and sexual activity.
RESULTS: Alcohol use was positively linked to sexual hookups. Social and enhancement motives were positively and indirectly associated with sexual hookups via alcohol use. Drinking to cope had a direct association with sexual hookups. Social drinking was more strongly associated with hookups in men than in women, but both groups exhibited a positive association.
CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to highlight the relationships between distinct drinking motives and sexual risk behavior. The results indicate that specific motives may increase risk of sexual hookups both indirectly via alcohol use, as well as directly, at least among those that drink to cope with negative mood."
26503499,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26503499/,"BACKGROUND: There is limited published evidence about the status of HIV among women who have had abortions or suffered from abortion complications. Understanding this connection is critical for building the evidence base and for guiding strategies to manage the sexual and reproductive health needs of women living with HIV. The purpose of this study is to determine whether women who suffered incomplete abortion complications are more likely to be HIV infected than those without complications. We hypothesized that women with incomplete abortion complications have higher rates of HIV infection than women who attended clinic for other obstetric reasons.
METHODS: The analysis used a secondary dataset from a published case-control study that enrolled 1) 70 women at discharge after receiving in-patient care for complications resulting from induced abortion, and 2) 69 women (the comparison group) who visited the same hospital during the same time period for other obstetric needs. The primary outcome was seeking care for complications of incomplete abortion versus seeking care for other obstetric needs (dichotomous). The primary exposure variable was self-reported HIV status which was categorized into three groups: HIV positive, HIV negative, and HIV unknown. Unadjusted and adjusted associations between being in the abortion complications group, HIV status and other selected population characteristics were estimated using univariate and multivariate logistic regression.
RESULTS: Of 139 women enrolled in this study. Seventy (50.4 %) women had abortion complications and 69 (49.6 %) did not. Of the total study population, 18 (12.9 %) were HIV positive, 50 (36.0 %) were HIV negative, and the HIV status of 71 women (51.1 %) was unknown. Compared to women who were HIV negative, women who were HIV positive had similar odds of being in the abortion complications group in both univariate and multivariate analyses (ρ =0.62 and ρ = 0.76). However, compared to HIV-negative women, those women who did not know their HIV status had greater odds of being in the abortion complications group (OR = 3.8, 95 % CI, 1.88, 8.20) in univariate analysis. After adjusting for potential confounding variables, the odds of being in the abortion complications group remained greater among women who did not know their HIV status compared to HIV-negative women (adjusted OR = 2.8, 95 % CI, 1.20, 6.54).
CONCLUSIONS: This study points to the need for targeted interventions aimed at strengthening the delivery and coverage of HIV-testing programs for pregnant women and post-abortion care. In addition, more research is needed to better understand the relationships between unsafe abortion, abortion complications and unknown HIV status."
26503610,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26503610/,"BACKGROUND: Voluntary moderate deep inspiration breath-hold (vmDIBH) is widely used for left sided breast cancer patients. The purpose of this study was to investigate the usefulness of vmDIBH in local and locoregional radiation therapy (RT) of right-sided breast cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: For fourteen right-sided breast cancer patients, 3D-conformal (3D-CRT) RT plans (i.e., forward IMRT) were calculated on free-breathing (FB) 3D-CRT(FB) and vmDIBHCT-scans, for local- as well as locoregional breast treatment, with and without internal mammary nodes (IMN). Dose volume parameters were compared.
RESULTS: For local breast treatment, no relevant reduction in mean lung dose (MLD) was found. For locoregional breast treatment without IMN, the average MLD reduced from 6.5 to 5.4 Gy (p < 0.005) for the total lung and from 11.2 to 9.7 Gy (p < 0.005) for the ipsilateral lung. For locoregional breast treatment with IMN, the average MLD reduced from 10.8 to 9.1 Gy (p < 0.005) for the total lung and from 18.7 to 16.2 Gy (p < 0.005) for the ipsilateral lung, whilea small reduction in mean heart dose of 0.4 Gy (p = 0.07) was also found.
CONCLUSIONS: Breathing adapted radiation therapy in left-sided breast cancer patients is becoming widely introduced. As a result of the slight reduction in lung dose found for locoregional right-sided breast cancer treatment in this study, a slightly lower risk of pneumonitis and secondary lung cancer (in ever smoking patients) can be expected.In addition, for some patients the heart dose will also be reduced by more than 0.5 up to 2.6 Gy. We therefore suggest to also apply breath-hold for locoregional irradiation of right-sided breast cancer patients."
26503735,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26503735/,"INTRODUCTION: Individuals with lower socioeconomic status (SES) are at increased risk for cigarette smoking. Less research has been conducted characterizing the relationship between SES and risk of using of other tobacco products. The present study examined SES as a risk factor for smokeless tobacco (ST) use in a US nationally representative sample, utilizing data from the 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health.
METHODS: Odds were generated for current cigarette smoking and ST use among adults (≥18 years) based on SES markers (educational attainment, income, blue-collar employment, and unemployment) after controlling for the influence of demographics and other substance dependence.
RESULTS: Odds of current cigarette smoking increased as a graded, inverse function of educational attainment as well as lower income and being unemployed. Odds of current ST use also increased as a function of lower educational attainment, although not in the linear manner seen with cigarette smoking. Odds of ST use but not cigarette smoking also increased with blue-collar employment. In contrast to patterns seen with cigarette smoking, ST use did not change in relation to income or unemployment.
CONCLUSIONS: Markers of SES are significantly associated with odds of cigarette smoking and ST use, but which indicators are predictive and the shape of their relationship to use differs across the two tobacco products."
26505802,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26505802/,"PURPOSE: To investigate the association between age at screening and detection rates for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) separately for different nuclear grades after introduction of a population-based digital mammography screening program.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The retrospective study was approved by the ethics board and did not require informed consent. In 733 905 women aged 50-69 years who participated in a screening program for the first time in 2005-2008 (baseline examinations were performed with digital mammography), DCIS detection rates were determined for 5-year age groups (detection rates per 1000 women screened) to distinguish high-, intermediate-, and low-grade DCIS. Multivariable logistic regression was used to compare detection rates between age groups by adjusting for screening units (P < .05).
RESULTS: There were 989 graded DCIS diagnoses among 733 905 women (detection rate, 1.35‰): 419 diagnoses of high-grade DCIS (detection rate, 0.57‰), 388 diagnoses of intermediate-grade DCIS (detection rate, 0.53‰), and 182 diagnoses of low-grade DCIS (detection rate, 0.25‰). Detection rate for types of DCIS combined increased significantly across age groups (50-54 years, detection rate of 1.15‰ [254 of 220 985 women]; 55-59 years, detection rate of 1.23‰ [218 of 177 782 women]; 60-64 years, detection rate of 1.34‰ [201 of 150 415 women]; and 65-69 years, detection rate of 1.71‰ [316 of 184 723 women]; P < .001). Of note, the detection rate for high-grade DCIS showed a significant increase with age (odds ratio, 1.18 per 5-year age group; P < .0001). The increase was lower for intermediate-grade DCIS (odds ratio, 1.11; P = .016) and not significant for low-grade DCIS (P = .10).
CONCLUSION: Total DCIS detection rates increase with age, mostly because of an increase in high- and intermediate-grade DCIS, which are precursor lesions that carry a higher risk for transition to more aggressive invasive breast cancer than low-grade DCIS."
26505834,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26505834/,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the viability of glomeruli in the peritumor parenchyma of partial nephrectomy specimens removed for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and relate it to kidney function, to better understand the contribution of peritumor parenchyma to renal function.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 53 partial nephrectomies containing RCC was performed. Glomeruli within 0.25-cm increments from the tumor were quantified and histologically assessed for viability. Tumor size, minimum and maximum margin size, and pre- and postoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were obtained.
RESULTS: Glomerular viability positively correlated with distance from tumor with mean viable glomeruli in successive 0.25-cm increments of 0-0.25 cm, 58%; 0.25-0.5 cm, 80%; 0.5-0.75 cm, 90%; and 0.75-1.0 cm, 92%. Glomerular viability near the tumor did not correlate with preoperative eGFR, whereas decreased viability further from the tumor did correlate with worse preoperative eGFR. Tumor size showed a nonstatistically significant positive trend with minimum (median 0.15 cm) and maximum margin (median 0.7 cm) sizes. Percent change of glomerular filtration rate did not correlate with margin size (P = .190).
CONCLUSION: Renal parenchyma immediately adjacent to RCC contains fewer viable glomeruli compared with the parenchyma further from the tumor. Based on this information, attempts to preserve all non-neoplastic renal parenchyma via a surgical margin approaching zero may not necessarily result in clinically relevant differences in the amount of viable glomeruli remaining or the renal function preserved."

DESIGN: A prospective study of all patients (aged 16 or above) listed for elective tonsillectomy from a nurse led tonsil clinic. Patients were given a TOI-14 questionnaire to complete after they had been added to the waiting list for surgery, but before undergoing tonsillectomy. Scores were assessed using SPSS.
SETTING: Outpatient clinic.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged over 16 listed for Tonsillectomy via SIGN Guideline 117.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Scores from TOI-14, completed pre-operatively.
RESULTS: 155 patients were listed from the nurse led clinic from October 2012 to August 2014; 5 questionnaires were excluded for being incomplete. The score range was 55 (15-70), with a calculated mean score of 45.62 and standard deviation of 9.701. Over 95% of results were within 2 standard deviations of the mean. A calculated negative skew also confirms that most patients who have clinical indications for tonsillectomy compliant with the SIGN guidelines show a higher score on the TOI-14.
CONCLUSION: This analysis indicates a trend of pre-intervention scores on the TOI-14 questionnaire for those patients who have a SIGN guideline compliant clinical indication for a tonsillectomy. We therefore propose that this suggests correlation between 'clinically strong' indication for tonsillitis and patient perceived Quality of Life impact."
26506450,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26506450/,"BACKGROUND: Several studies have shown that the waist circumference of children and adolescents has increased over the last 25 years. However, given the strong correlation between waist circumference and BMI, it is uncertain if the secular trends in waist circumference are independent of those in BMI.
METHODS: We analyzed data from 6- to 19-year-olds who participated in the 1988-1994 through 2011-2012 cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to assess whether the trends in waist circumference were independent of changes in BMI, race-ethnicity and age.
RESULTS: Mean, unadjusted levels of waist circumference increased by 3.7 cm (boys) and 6.0 cm (girls) from 1988-94 through 2011-12, while mean BMI levels increased by 1.1 kg/m2 (boys) and 1.6 kg/m2 (girls). Overall, the proportional changes in mean levels of both waist circumference and BMI were fairly similar among boys (5.3%, waist vs. 5.6%, BMI) and girls (8.7%, waist vs. 7.7%, BMI). As assessed by the area under the curve, adjustment for BMI reduced the secular increases in waist circumference by about 75% (boys) and 50% (girls) beyond that attributable to age and race-ethnicity. There was also a race-ethnicity interaction (p < 0.001). Adjustment for BMI reduced the secular trend in waist circumference among non-Hispanic (NH) black children (boys and girls) to a greater extent (about 90%) than among other children.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that among children in the U.S., about 75% (boys) and 50% (girls) of the secular increases in waist circumference since 1988-94 can be accounted for by changes in BMI. The reasons for the larger independent effects among girls and among NH blacks are uncertain."
26506557,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26506557/,"BACKGROUND: Readmission is widely used as a quality metric to assess hospital performance. However, different methods to calculate readmissions may produce various results, leading to differences in classification with respect to hospital performance. This study compared 2 commonly used approaches to measure surgical readmissions: the 30-day all-cause hospital-wide readmissions (HWRs) and the potentially preventable readmissions (PPRs).
METHODS: We examined the correlation between hospitals' risk-adjusted HWR and PPR rates and whether there was agreement in categorizing hospital performance between these measures among 111 hospitals with inpatient surgical programs in the Veterans Health Administration.
RESULTS: We found that hospitals' HWR and PPR rates were highly correlated (r = .85, P < .0001). The overall agreement between these 2 methods in categorizing hospital performance was 82% for all surgeries, 82% for colectomy, 84% for coronary bypass, and 87% for hip/knee replacement, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite differences in methodologies, the HWR and the PPR measures provided relatively consistent perceptions of hospitals' performance on surgical readmissions."

METHODS: A total of 96 patients who underwent resection for stage II, III, or IV gallbladder cancer were enrolled. Patients with lower bile duct involvement, pancreatic or duodenal infiltration, or peripancreatic lymph node metastasis were considered candidates for combined PD. The operative outcomes were compared between the patients treated with PD (PD group, n = 21) and those treated without PD (non-PD group, n = 75), and between those treated with major hepatopancreatoduodenectomy (major HPD group, n = 9) and those treated with major hepatectomy (major hepatectomy group, n = 20).
RESULTS: Overall morbidity in the PD group was greater than that in the non-PD group (81% vs 23%, P < .001), whereas the overall survival (OS) was comparable between the groups (5-year OS; 39.8% vs 46.7%, P = .96). There was no in-hospital mortality in the PD group. A serum albumin <3.0 g/dL (P = .004) and tumor size ≥ 9.0 cm (P = .029) were associated independently with a poor prognosis in the PD group. Overall morbidity in the major HPD group was greater than that in the major hepatectomy group (89% vs 40%, P = .014), whereas the OS was comparable between the groups (5-year OS; 34.6% vs 21.1%, P = .57), and the OS of major HPD group was better than that of unresectable group (n = 18, P = .017).
CONCLUSION: Combined PD, including major HPD, is beneficial for selected patients of advanced gallbladder cancer; however, the indications should be carefully evaluated because of greater morbidity rates."

Little is known about global surgery participation among surgeons in Connecticut. The goal of this pilot survey project was to determine the breadth of global surgery experience in our state.
STUDY DESIGN: An electronic survey was distributed to surgeons in the state of Connecticut via the Connecticut Chapter of the American College of Surgeons (CTACS) and to departments of surgery throughout the state.
RESULTS: Seventy-four surgeons and surgical residents completed the online survey from 17 different hospitals. Nineteen (25.7%) of the respondents had participated in global surgery. Most participated in yearly (56.3%), short-term experiences (94.5%). Nearly half of this group reported no formal record of outcomes (52.9%), but 17/19 (89.5%) respondents reported that accurate outcomes measures are beneficial to surgical care in resource-poor areas. Eighty-nine percent reported a willingness to participate in a surgical quality and outcomes database.
CONCLUSION: A substantial proportion of surgeons in Connecticut participate in global surgery. Most surgeons value qualityin surgical care, yet outcomes are not routinely measured. This discordance may be addressed through the development of a quality improvement collaborative for global surgery."
26506699,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26506699/,"AIM: This is a retrospective study to review the treatment and management of patients presenting with odontogenic infections in a large urban teaching hospital over a four-year period, comparing the number and complexity of odontogenic infections presenting to an acute general hospital in two periods, as follows: Group A (January 2008 to March 2010) versus Group B (April 2010 to December 2011). The background to the study is 'An alteration in patient access to primary dental care instituted by the Department of Health in April 2010'.
OBJECTIVES: a) to identify any alteration in the pattern and complexity of patients' presentation with odontogenic infections following recent changes in access to treatment via the Dental Treatment Services Scheme (DTSS) and the Dental Treatment Benefit Scheme (DTBS) in April 2010; and, b) to evaluate the management of severe odontogenic infections.
METHOD: Data was collated by a combination of a comprehensive chart review and electronic patient record analysis based on the primary discharge diagnosis as recorded in the Hospital In-Patient Enquiry (HIPE) system.
RESULTS: Fifty patients were admitted to the National Maxillofacial Unit, St James's Hospital, under the oral and maxillofacial service over a four-year period, with an odontogenic infection as the primary diagnosis. There was an increased number of patients presenting with odontogenic infections during Group B of the study. These patients showed an increased complexity and severity of infection. Although there was an upward trend in the numbers and complexity of infections, this trending did not reach statistical significance.
CONCLUSIONS: The primary cause of infection was dental caries in all patients. Dental caries is a preventable and treatable disease. Increased resources should be made available to support access to dental care, and thereby lessen the potential for the morbidity and mortality associated with serious odontogenic infections. The study at present continues as a prospective study."

METHODS: This descriptive cross sectional study involved seventeen consenting Oral Hygiene students. An electronic Odontology Theory Test (OTT) and an electronic Objective Structured Practical Test (OSPT), were prepared and introduced as precursor tests prior to scheduled semester tests in the Division of Restorative Dentistry (Department of Odontology). Eleven (65%) of the seventeen students completed the precursor OTT, as well as the precursor OSPT, fourteen days prior to their scheduled semester OTT and semester OSPT and sixty two days prior to their final examinations. The results of the precursor and the semester tests were entered into a Microsoft Excel database for comparative analysis, using a Student's t-test.
RESULTS: For both OTT and OSPT tests there were significant differences between the means of the scores of the students for precursor and semester tests (OTT: p = 0.0009; OSPT: p = 0.0180).
DISCUSSION: The students performed significantly better in their precursor OTT, whilst their performance in the OSPT was significantly better in the semester test.
CONCLUSION: In the context of this investigation, the precursor OTT did not enhance the performance of the students in their semester OTT, whilst the precursor OSPT was associated with an enhanced performance of the students in their semester OSPT."
26506925,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26506925/,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to define groups of women that are at particular risk for postoperative voiding dysfunction (PVD) after surgery for stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and/or pelvic organ prolapse (POP) and to focus on the question if these specific groups would benefit from suprapubic catheter (SPC) insertion. Complications associated with SPC were identified.
METHODS: Between 06/2005 and 01/2013, the medical records of N = 4463 patients who underwent POP and/or SUI surgery were reviewed for suprapubic bladder drainage, duration of suprapubic catheterisation and SPC associated complications. 35 women suffering from vesicovaginal (28) and urethrovaginal (7) fistulas at the same time span were enrolled additionally.
RESULTS: The results obtained revealed that patients after isolated anterior colporrhaphy, isolated anterior colporrhaphy and TVT, isolated cystocele repair using mesh and TVT, as well as patients with concomitant posterior and/or middle compartment prolapse surgery are at increased risk of developing PVD. Thus, postoperative suprapubic bladder drainage is beneficial. Complications occurred in 4.9 % of patients who received an SPC: urinary tract infection (UTI) (35), catheter dislocation (21), infection at the catheter insertion (2) and small bowel perforation (1). For the patients treated for fistulas we noticed a complication rate related to SPC of 11.4 %: UTI (2) and small bowel perforation (2).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients should be counselled about the risk of developing PVD after POP and/or SUI surgery and should be informed about postoperative bladder drainage options related to their surgery."
26506982,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26506982/,"OBJECTIVE: Early diagnosis of gastric cancer may be achieved through surveillance of patients with extensive gastric intestinal metaplasia (eGIM). However, diagnosis of eGIM generally implies histology. We aimed at determining the accuracy of high-resolution endoscopy with light-narrow band imaging (NBI) to assess the presence of eGIM on a per-patient basis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospective cohort of 60 patients divided into two groups: derivation cohort (n = 25) to evaluate the reliability and validity, and a real-time validation group (n = 35). In the derivation group, six endoscopists with two levels of expertise were asked to estimate the grade of GIM based in endoscopic images (white light endoscopy, light-NBI and amplification/near focus). In the real-time validation set, experienced endoscopists were asked to similarly record their real-time optical diagnosis. Histology was then considered as the gold standard.
RESULTS: In the derivation group diagnosis accuracy was 60% with WLE (non-expert 59% vs. 61% experts), increasing to 73% after NBI magnification (non-expert 63% vs. 83% expert, p < 0.05). Moreover, proportion of agreement with histology was 83%, with a correct diagnosis of eGIM in 87% for experienced observers. In the real-time group experts obtained 89% global diagnostic accuracy correctly identifying 91% of the eGIM. The sensitivity, specificity, LR + and LR- of real-time endoscopic diagnosis of eGIM was 0.92 (CI95%:0.67-0.99), 0.96 (0.79-0.99), 21.1 (3.08-144) and 0.09 (0.013-0.57).
CONCLUSION: For the first time the reliability of high-resolution endoscopy with light-NBI for extension of GIM is described. Our results suggest that more than 90% of individuals at risk could be identified without the need for biopsies, simplifying the current recommendations."
26507174,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26507174/,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine whether the latent structure of alcohol misuse is categorical or continuous in male and female adults with and without a history of prior criminal offending.
METHODS: Data from 3452 (1530 male, 1922 female) 27-to-32 year old members of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) were subjected to taxometric analysis using three nonredundant taxometric procedures--mean above minus below a cut (MAMBAC), maximum covariance (MAXCOV), and latent mode factor analysis (L-Mode).
RESULTS: Analyses produced results consistent with categorical latent structure in males with a previous history of criminal offending but not in males without a previous history of criminal offending or females with or without a history of criminal offending. The findings from the other groups were indeterminate for the most part (i.e., neither categorical nor continuous). The presumptive taxon was validated by testing differences in age of onset and frequency of criminal arrest and drunkenness between the putative taxon and the upper portion of the complement. As predicted, all four validation outcomes were significantly worse in the taxon group.
CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of these results it is concluded that alcohol misuse in young adults may have features of both categorical and continuous latent structure and that the categorical aspects are more prominent in males with a history of offending behavior. Additional research is required to determine which aspects and features of alcohol misuse are categorical and which aspects and features are continuous."
26507526,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26507526/,"BACKGROUND: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is associated with substantial blood loss in postoperative period. Tranexamic acid (TXA) is potent antifibrinolytic agent, routinely administered by intravenous (IV) and topical route, which can possibly interrupt cascade of events due to hemostatic irregularities close to source of bleeding. However, scientific evidence of combined administration of TXA in TKA is still meagre. The present study aimed to compare efficacy of combined IV and topical TXA with IV use alone in terms of blood loss, transfusion rate, and incidence of deep vein thrombosis and thromboembolism.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: 119 patients undergoing unilateral TKA were randomized into IV alone and combined group. Patients assigned to IV group were given IV TXA as a preoperative and postoperative dose given 3 and 6 hours after surgery, whereas in combined group, topical TXA solution was applied intraarticularly about 5 minutes before closure of arthrotomy in addition to IV doses.
RESULTS: Combined use of IV and topical TXA provided better results than IV use alone with mean calculated total blood loss (590.69±191.1 vs 385.68±182.5, P<.001), blood transfusion rate (6.6% vs 1.6%, P = .364), hemoglobin drop (1.82±0.6 vs 1.14±0.5, P<.001). No case of DVT or TE was noted among the 2 study groups.
CONCLUSION: Combined use of IV and intraarticular TXA provided significantly better results compared with IV use alone with respect to all variables related to postoperative blood loss in TKA. Moreover, TXA use is safe in terms of incidence of symptomatic DVT and TE."
26509299,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26509299/,"BACKGROUND: Survival of children with pineal region tumors has increased significantly in the last decade; these tumors have an insidious outcome associated with endocrine disorders with high morbidity and mortality, especially after gross resection. The objective was to report the survival, outcome, morbidity and mortality according to type of surgery, histology and treatment in children with pineal region tumors.
METHODS: This retrospective study included all patients of 17 years or less with diagnosis of pineal region tumor, who went over a period of 10 years to a children's hospital. A histopathological review was made, and the extent of resection was determined. The survival was also estimated.
RESULTS: Forty-six patients were included, out of which 36 had complete medical records and adequate pathologic material. Gross resection was performed in 24 (66.6 %), and biopsy in 12 (33.3 %); 23 (88 %) patients died; hydroelectrolytic imbalance was the cause of 14 deaths (60 %) and the other nine (39.1 %) were secondary to tumor progression. Ten-years survivals among patients treated with gross resection and biopsy were 52 and 75 %, respectively (p = 0.7). Endocrine alterations were observed in 13 patients (36.1 %); in 10 of these (76.9 %) the total resection was performed.
CONCLUSIONS: Pineal region tumors in children can be treated with diagnostic biopsy, followed by adjuvant treatment consisting of chemotherapy and radiotherapy."
26509349,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26509349/,"BACKGROUND: Treatment method in patients with coronary artery disease undergoing coronary bypass surgery with accompanying carotid artery disease is still a hot topic among clinicians. This study is designed to investigate if there is an effect on myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular events and mortality during postoperative period of simultaneous carotid endarterectomy with coronary bypass surgery compared to staged carotid artery stenting before coronary bypass surgery.
METHODS: 102 patients (79 male, 23 female) who underwent simultaneous carotid endarterectomy with coronary bypass surgery or staged carotid artery stenting with coronary bypass surgery in the same center with the same surgical team were divided into 2 groups and retrospectively reviewed. Group 1 (n = 71) had coronary artery bypass surgery under general anesthesia with carotid endarterectomy followed by cardiopulmonary bypass with heart team decision. Again with heart team decision, Group 2 (n=31), patients at high-risk for carotid endarterectomy (serious cardiac disease, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, superiorly located lesions), received carotid artery stents in the interventional radiology department and a month later, coronary bypass surgery was performed with cardiopulmonary bypass under elective conditions.
RESULTS: Median of patient age was 67.5 (45-83) years. Twenty-two patients (31%) in Group 1 and 19 patients (56.3%) in Group 2 had neurological symptoms, which was statistically significant (P = .004). During the early postoperative term, three patients (4.2%) in Group 1 and two patients (6.5%) in Group 2 died (P = .64). Five patients (7.0%) in Group 1 and two patients (6.5%) in Group 2 developed neurological symptoms during the early postoperative term (P &gt; .05). Likewise, two patients (2.8%) in Group 1 and five patients (16.1%) in Group 2 developed myocardial infarction following carotid intervention (P = .03).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with significant carotid artery stenosis undergoing coronary bypass surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, in comparison to simultaneous carotid endarterectomy with coronary bypass technique and carotid artery stenting followed with coronary bypass technique showed no difference in combined endpoint (postoperative myocardial infarction, neurological events, and mortality). With proper tools and according to the decisions made by heart teams, both management strategies can be safely performed."
26509871,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26509871/,"CONTEXT: The Chinese were afflicted by great famine between 1959 and 1962. These people then experienced rapid economic development during which the gross domestic product per capita increased from $28 in 1978 to $6807 in 2013. We hypothesize that these two events are associated with the booming rate of diabetes in China.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explore whether exposure to famine in early life and high economic status in adulthood was associated with diabetes in later life.
DESIGN AND SETTING: Our data of 6897 adults were from a cross-sectional Survey on Prevalence in East China for Metabolic Diseases and Risk Factors study in 2014. Among them, 3844 adults experienced famine during different life stages and then lived in areas with different economic statuses in adulthood.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Diabetes was considered as fasting plasma glucose of 7.0 mmol/L or greater, hemoglobin A1c of 6.5% or greater, and/or a previous diagnosis by health care professionals.
RESULTS: Compared with nonexposed subjects, famine exposure during the fetal period (odds ratio [OR]1.53, 95% confidence interval [CI]1.09-2.14) and childhood (OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.21-2.73) was associated with diabetes after adjusting for age and gender. Further adjustments for adiposity, height, the lipid profile, and blood pressure did not significantly attenuate this association. Subjects living in areas with high economic status had a greater diabetes risk in adulthood (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.20-1.78). In gender-specific analyses, fetal-exposed men (OR 1.64, 95% CI, 1.04-2.59) and childhood-exposed women (OR 2.81, 95% CI, 1.59-4.97) had significantly greater risk of diabetes.
CONCLUSIONS: The rapid increase in the prevalence of diabetes in middle-aged and elderly people in China is associated with the combination of exposure to famine during the fetal stage and childhood and high economic status in adulthood. Our findings may partly explain the booming diabetes phenomenon in China."
26510080,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26510080/,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Celiac Disease (CD) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by small intestinal malabsorbtion and diarrhea, triggered by the ingestion of food products containing gluten. There are studies reporting that some nutritional deficiencies and some factors related to immunity may cause a decrease in fertility as well as some problems in sperm parameters. The prevalence of CD in unexplained infertility (UEI) couples is not as high as that mentioned in some reports. There is no accurate knowledge about the prevalence of CD in a UEI couple.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 68 couples with UEI who were admitted at Türk Diyanet Vakfı 29 Mayıs Hospital Center of in vitro fertilization (IVF) between January and June 2014 were included in this prospective pilot study. The diagnosis of UEI was made with basic infertility tests. A history of CD was questioned in the initial evaluation. Anti-gliadin, anti-endomysial, and tissue transglutaminase antibodies as well as total IgA were tested. Gastroscopy was performed in patients with positive serologic tests. Histopathological CD diagnosis was made according to Marsh criteria.
RESULTS: The mean age of the study population was 33.40±4.59 years. Out of the 65 couples who were included into the study group, one of the five couples was positive for the autoantibodies (7.69%). Out of these 65 couples, none of them had autoantibody positivity at the same time in both partners. Anti-gliadin antibodies were found to be positive for two females out of five couples and in three male partners of the same group. Out of these five couples, only one male partner had all the antibodies as positive (1.5%). In the histopathological examination of patients with positive autoantibodies, only the patient in whom all autoantibodies were positive had findings compatible with Marsh IIIa gluten enteropathy. Only one couple had a diagnosis of CD (1.5%).
CONCLUSION: In many studies, CD was shown to affect the reproductive system of women. CD may also cause a decrease in fertility in men by affecting sperm motility and androgen levels. Our study is based on a limited sample size. Our data should be confirmed in a larger cohort of subjects. These results suggest that investigation of both couples with a diagnosis of UEI may be more beneficial in clarifying the etiology."
26510408,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26510408/,"INTRODUCTION: Clear signs of duodenal injury (DI) such as pneumoperitoneum and/or oral contrast extravasation mandate laparotomy. Management when computed tomography (CT) reveals indirect evidence of DI namely duodenal hematoma or periduodenal fluid is unclear. We evaluated the utility of indirect signs to identify DI and the success of expected management, hypothesizing patients with indirect evidence of DI on CT can be safely managed non-operatively.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients with a computed tomography (CT) scan with periduodenal hematoma or periduodenal fluid treated between January 2003 and January 2013 at a level 1 Trauma Center. Demographics, injury characteristics, laboratory values, injury severity scores (ISS), and outcome measures were recorded. Patients having immediate laparotomy were compared to those initially managed nonoperatively.
RESULTS: We identified 74 patients with indirect signs of DI, with 35 patients (47%) undergoing immediate operative exploration and 39 (53%) initially managed non-operatively. Lactate (4.5 mg/dL, standard deviation (SD) 2.1 vs 3.1 mg/dL, SD 1.4, p<0.001), ISS (median (IQR) 34 (27-44) vs. 24 (17-34), p=0.002) and abdominal AIS (3 (3-4) vs 2 (2-3), p<0.001) were higher in those with immediate operation. The incidence of DI requiring operative repair was 11% (8 of 74). Six of 35 (17%) explored urgently had a DI requiring repair while 29 of 35 (83%) had no DI or minor injury not requiring surgical therapy. Of those managed non-operatively, 7 of 39 (18%) failed observation but only two (5%) required duodenal repair. There was no significant difference in intensive care unit (ICU) (10.2 days, standard error [SE] 2.1 vs 9.7 days, SE 4.8, p=0.93) or hospital (22.5 days, SE 3.8 vs 23.6 days, SE 8.5, p=0.91) length of stay between those operated on immediately and those that failed non-operative management when adjusted for age, sex, and ISS. There was no mortality in the non-operative group related to an intra-abdominal injury.
CONCLUSION: Observation of patients with indirect sign of DI fails in about 20% of patients, but failure rate due to DI is low at 5%. Conservative management in appropriately selected patients is reasonable with close observation."
26510563,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26510563/,"BACKGROUND: A recent study suggested a survival benefit in patients with adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) who had undergone lymphadenectomy. The objective of this study was to study the effect of lymphadenectomy on the survival rates of patients with ACC.
METHODS: Data from adult patients with histology-proven ACC from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 18 Registries (1973-2011) were analyzed to assess the impact of lymphadenectomy (≥4 lymph nodes removed) on disease-specific survival (DSS).
RESULTS: Of 1525 patients with ACC, 45% were male. 36, 20, and 44% of patients presented with localized, regional, and distant metastatic diseases, respectively. 8% of patients (n = 67/802) underwent lymphadenectomy. We observed a higher rate of lymphadenectomy performed in patients with regional disease [locally advanced tumors (stage T3 and T4) and/or lymph node metastasis] and distant metastasis than in those with localized tumors (12.4% and 12.0 vs. 5.1, respectively, p < 0.01) and in patients with primary tumor sizes >10 cm (12.4 vs. 4.2 %, p < 0.01). Lymph node metastasis was present in 12.8% (19.2% in locally advanced ACC). A lymphadenectomy was not associated with improved DSS on univariate analysis (p = 0.30), regardless of tumor size or staging. Independent prognostic factors included: ages ≥60 years (p < 0.01, HR 1.70), lymph node metastasis (p < 0.01, HR 1.7), distant metastasis (p < 0.01, HR 5.6), complete resection of tumor (p < 0.01, HR 0.47), and debulking surgery (p < 0.01, HR 0.49).
CONCLUSION: A lymphadenectomy is not commonly performed in patients with ACC in the U.S. Although we found no survival benefit in this cohort with a low rate of lymphadenectomy, a lymphadenectomy may be considered in patients with locally advanced tumors (T3 and T4) due to a higher rate of lymph node metastasis."
26510620,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26510620/,"BACKGROUND: In the Netherlands, about half of the patient contacts with a general practitioner (GP) cooperative are nonurgent from a medical perspective. A part of these problems can wait until office hours or can be managed by the patient himself without further professional care. However, from the patient's perspective, there may be a need to contact a physician immediately. Our objective was to determine whether contacts with out-of-hours primary care made by patients with nonurgent problems are the result of patients' beliefs or of deficiencies in the healthcare system.
METHODS: We performed a survey among 2000 patients with nonurgent health problems in four GP cooperatives in the Netherlands. Two GPs independently judged the medical necessity of the contacts of all patients in this study. We examined characteristics, views and motives of patients with medically necessary contacts and those without medically necessary contacts. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the characteristics, views and reasons of the patients with medically unnecessary contacts and medically necessary contacts. Differences between these groups were tested with chi-square tests.
RESULTS: The response rate was 32.3 % (N = 646). Of the nonurgent contacts 30.4 % were judged as medically necessary (95 % CI 27.0-34.2). Compared to patients with nonurgent but medically necessary contacts, patients with medically unnecessary contacts were younger and were more often frequent attenders. They had longer-existing problems, lower self-assessed urgency, and more often believed GP cooperatives are intended for all help requests. Worry was the most frequently mentioned motive for contacting a GP cooperative for patients with a medically unnecessary contact (45.3 %) and a perceived need to see a GP for patients with a medically necessary contact (44.2 %). Perceived availability (5.8 %) and accessibility (8.3 %) of a patient's own GP played a role for some patients.
CONCLUSION: Motives for contacting a GP cooperative are mostly patient-related, but also deficiencies in access to general practice may partly explain medically unnecessary use. Efforts to change the use of GP cooperatives should focus on education of subgroups with an increased likelihood of contact for medically unnecessary problems. Improvement of access to daytime primary care may also decrease use of the GP cooperative."
26510703,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26510703/,"BACKGROUND: In many European countries, vaccinations are offered to the elderly. Expanding the programme to include routine vaccination against pneumococcal disease, herpes zoster, and pertussis, for example, could reduce disease burden amongst the growing population of persons aged 50 years and older. Since most countries involve general practitioners (GPs) in the programmes, the potential success of such new vaccinations depends on the attitude of GPs towards these vaccinations. This qualitative study explores Dutch GPs' attitudes regarding vaccination in general, and their attitudes regarding the incorporation of additional vaccines in the current Dutch influenza vaccination programme.
METHODS: Interviews were held with ten Dutch GPs (five men and five women) that worked either in an academic hospital, in a practice based in a health center, or in individual practice. All interviews were recorded with a digital voice recorder and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were analysed according to thematic analysis.
RESULTS: GPs perceived prevention as part as their job and believed vaccination to be effective for preventing infectious diseases. However, influenza vaccination was not always perceived as effective. Doubts regarding the usefulness of additional vaccinations were identified. If additional vaccines would be offered, this should be based on scientific evidence and the severity of the infectious disease. Selection of patients for vaccination should not be based solely on age, but more on risk factors. The GP should be the central point of contact for new vaccination campaigns; however, high workload was seen as a concern. Several GPs questioned their ability to refuse to distribute the vaccinations.
CONCLUSIONS: A positive attitude towards implementing additional vaccinations is not apparent. Achieving the most health benefits seems to be the most important consideration of Dutch GPs regarding vaccinating older adults. Questions regarding the usefulness of vaccinating older adults should be taken into consideration. More research is necessary to confirm the results among a wider range of Dutch GPs."
26510711,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26510711/,"BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) patients in China still face a number of barriers in seeking diagnosis and treatment. There is evidence that the economic burden on TB patients and their households discourages treatment compliance.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in three cities of China. Patients were selected using probability proportional to size (PPS) cluster sampling of rural townships or urban streets, followed by list sampling from a patient register. Data were collected using a questionnaire survey, key informant interviews and focus group discussions with TB patients to gain an understanding of the economic burden of TB and implications of this burden for treatment compliance.
RESULTS: A total of 797 TB patients were surveyed, of which 60 were interviewed in-depth following the survey. More than half had catastrophic health expenditure. TB patients with higher household incomes were less likely to report non-compliance (OR 0.355, 95 % CI 0.140-0.830) and patients who felt that the economic burden relating to TB treatment was high more likely to report non-compliance (OR 3.650, 95 % CI 1.278-12.346). Those who had high costs for transportation, lodging and food were also more likely to report non-compliance (OR 4.150, 95 % CI 1.804-21.999). The findings from the qualitative studies supported those from the survey.
CONCLUSION: The economic burden associated with seeking diagnosis and treatment remains a barrier for TB patients in China. Reducing the cost of treatment and giving patients subsidies for transportation, lodging and food is likely to improve treatment compliance. Improving doctors' salary system to cut off the revenue-oriented incentive, and expanding current insurance's coverage can be helpful to reduce patients' actual burden or anticipated burden. Future research on this issue is needed."
26510846,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26510846/,"UNLABELLED: Both men and women who sustain a fracture of the distal forearm run an increased risk of sustaining a subsequent hip fracture. Our study implies that these patients may not necessarily constitute a group in which osteoporosis screening is warranted.
INTRODUCTION: People who sustain a distal radius fracture run an increased risk of sustaining a subsequent hip fracture. However, many institutions only screen for osteoporosis at the time of a hip fracture. We aimed to determine the true incidence of preceding distal radius fractures in an Asian population of patients with a hip fracture aged 60 years or older and whether screening for osteoporosis earlier would be beneficial.
METHODS: We reviewed 22 parameters of 572 patients aged 60 years or older admitted after sustaining a hip fracture over a 3-year period. This included the occurrence or absence of a distal radius fracture in the 10 years preceding their hip fracture.
RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients (5 %) had a fracture of the distal radius in the preceding decade. Univariate analyses suggested that hip fracture patients who had preceding distal radius fractures were older, female, have lower mean haemoglobin levels, and right-sided hip fractures. Of these factors, only age was found to have significant predictive value in a multivariate analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: A number of institutions have started to screen for osteoporosis when a patient presents with a fracture of the distal radius because these patients may have an increased risk of a subsequent hip fracture. Our study implies that this may not be warranted. Implementing such a screening service from both cost and resource utilization point of view must be studied prospectively and in greater detail considering earlier screening may only be beneficial to a very small percentage of patients."
26510922,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26510922/,"INTRODUCTION: Access to ART and health services is guaranteed under universal coverage to improve life expectancy and quality of life for HIV patients. However, it remains unknown whether patients of different socioeconomic background equally use different types of health services.
METHODS: We use one-year (2010-2011) data on individual healthcare utilization and expenditures for the total population (N = 2262698) of the Basque Country. We observe the prevalence of HIV and use OLS regressions to estimate the impact on health utilization of demographic, socioeconomic characteristics, and health status in such patients.
RESULTS: HIV prevalence per 1000 individuals is greater the lower the socioeconomic status (0.784 for highest; 2.135 for lowest), for males (1.616) versus females (0.729), and for middle-age groups (26-45 and 46-65). Health expenditures are 11826€ greater for HIV patients than for others, but with differences by socioeconomic group derived from a different mix of services utilization (total cost of 13058€ for poorest, 14960€ for richest). Controlling for health status and demographic variables, poor HIV patients consume more on pharmaceuticals; rich in specialists and hospital care. Therefore, there is inequity in health services utilization by socioeconomic groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Equity in health provision for HIV patients represents a challenge even if access to treatment is guaranteed. Lack of information in poorer individuals might lead to under-provision while richer individuals might demand over-provision. We recommend establishing accurate clinical guidelines with the appropriate mix of health provision by validated need for all socioeconomic groups; promoting educational programs so that patients demand the appropriate mix of services, and stimulating integrated care for HIV patients with multiple chronic conditions."
26511004,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26511004/,"AIMS: To explore the ability of a physiotherapist, using a standardised musculoskeletal physiotherapy assessment protocol, to accurately identify the structures potentially responsible for shoulder symptoms against a standardised arthroscopic shoulder diagnostic assessment, and to determine the physiotherapists' ability to influence post-test diagnostic accuracy.
STUDY DESIGN: Consecutive case-based cohort study.
SUBJECT SELECTION: All participants were selected by two orthopaedic surgeons for arthroscopic investigation during a 6-month period.
SETTING: Private orthopaedic clinic.
METHOD: All consenting participants selected for arthroscopic investigation were examined by the physiotherapist prior to arthroscopy. Presence and priority of impairments/diagnoses were recorded on a standardised form. Inter and intra-rater reliability and diagnostic accuracy were tabulated.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Proportional agreement on diagnostic incidence (broad) and priority (strict) using 2×2 contingency tables for sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value and positive and negative likelihood ratios were calculated. Post-test probabilities were analysed to determine the influence of a positive or a negative finding.
RESULTS: 211 participants, aged 14-79 years were included. Overall prevalence of subacromial pathology was (77%) and, disorders of the passive restraints (29%). For both negative and positive findings, post-test probabilities were not notably altered; although positive findings yielded greater value in the decision-making modelling. The physiotherapist's ability to identify individual pathology (eg, tendon rupture vs tendinopathy, capsular vs labral) was lower than recognition of pathology within the broader diagnostic category.
CONCLUSIONS: The physiotherapist's ability to diagnose individual pathologies was inconsistent. Indirectly, this raises the issue of whether signs and symptoms identified under arthroscopic surgery are reflective of a lesion/pathology reflective of a specific tissue."
26511117,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26511117/,"BACKGROUND: Basic knowledge of electrosurgery and patient's safety during laparoscopic setup are fundamental, as laparoscopic surgical skills do. The aim of this prospective case-control study was to assess the improvement of such knowledge and skills among gynecologists.
METHODS: Gynecologists attending a training course on laparoscopy at the Centre International de Chirurgie Endoscopique (CICE), Clermont Ferrand (France) (December 2013-March 2014) were asked to answer a questionnaire about their own clinical activity and basic surgical knowledge and skills at the beginning and end of the course. The questionnaire included multiple choice questions about technical (four questions) and safety (five questions) aspects of laparoscopic set up and electrosurgery (five questions).
RESULTS: Sixty-two residents and 68 graduated gynecologists completed pre- and post-course questionnaires (PrQ and PoQ, respectively). Considering 9 as an arbitrary cut-off score indicating an adequate theoretical knowledge, a total of 70 (51.8 %) and 128 (94.8 %) participants had a sufficient score at the PrQ and PoQ, respectively. Only 9.6 % of participants were able to complete PoQ without making any mistakes, with a mean PrQ score of 9.5. At the beginning, the most difficult steps in laparoscopy in participants' opinion were intra-corporeal suture and insufflation of pneumoperitoneum (both 36.1 %). After the course and the practical training, only 20 % of participants still indicated intra-corporeal suture as the most difficult.
CONCLUSION: Education on electro surgery and basic laparoscopic setting and laparoscopic practical training are necessary to improve and maintain laparoscopic surgical skills. The assessment of that knowledge is mandatory to define surgical competence."
26511335,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26511335/,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to compare outcomes following resection of gastric remnant (GRC) and conventional gastric cancer.
METHODS: Patients who underwent resection for gastric cancer in 8 academic institutions from 2000-2012 were evaluated to compare morbidity, mortality, and survival based on history of prior gastrectomy.
RESULTS: Of the 979 patients who underwent gastrectomy with curative-intent during the 12-year study period, 55 patients (5.8%) presented with GRC and 924 patients (94.4%) presented with conventional gastric cancer. Patients with GRC were slightly older (median 69 vs. 66 years). GRC was associated with higher rates of complication (56% vs. 41%, P = 0.028), longer operative times (301 vs. 237 min, P < 0.001), higher intraoperative blood loss (300 vs. 200 ml, P = 0.012), and greater need for blood transfusion (43% vs. 23%, P = 0.001). There were no significant differences in 30-day (3.6% vs. 4%) or 90-day mortality (9% vs. 8%) between the two groups. Overall survival rates were similar between GRC and conventional gastric cancer (5-year 20.3% vs. 38.6%, P = 0.446). Multivariate analysis revealed that history of gastrectomy was not predictive of survival while established predictors (older age, advanced T-stage, nodal involvement, blood transfusion, multivisceral resection, and any complication) were associated with poor survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite higher morbidity, prognosis after resection of gastric remnant cancer is similar to conventional gastric cancer."
26511599,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26511599/,"AIMS: To investigate whether the degree of albuminuria reduction observed in the ALTITUDE trial is associated with renal and cardiovascular protection, and secondly, whether the reduction in albuminuria was too small to afford clinical benefit.
METHODS: In a post hoc analysis of the ALTITUDE trial in 8561 patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease or cardiovascular disease we examined the effect of albuminuria changes at 6 months on renal and cardiovascular outcomes using Cox proportional hazard regression.
RESULTS: The median change in albuminuria in the first 6 months in the aliskiren arm of the trial was -12% (25th to 75th percentile: -48.7_to_ +41.9%) and 0.0% (25th to 75th percentile: -40.2_to_55%) in the placebo arm. Changes in albuminuria in the first 6 months were linearly associated with renal and cardiovascular endpoints: a >30% reduction in albuminuria in the first 6 months was associated with a 62% reduction in renal risk and a 25% reduction in cardiovascular risk compared with an increase in albuminuria. The association between changes at 6 months in albuminuria and renal or cardiovascular endpoints was similar in the two treatment groups (p for interaction >0.1 for both endpoints).
CONCLUSIONS: The addition of aliskiren to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker therapy resulted in albuminuria changes that were associated with renal and cardiovascular risk changes. This did not translate into renal or cardiovascular protection because the overall reduction in albuminuria in the aliskiren arm was too small and nearly similar to that in the placebo arm."
26511631,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26511631/,"PURPOSE: To investigate the impact of a scoring system (Tree) on inter-reader agreement and diagnostic performance in breast MRI reading.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This IRB-approved, single-centre study included 100 patients with 121 consecutive histopathologically verified lesions (52 malignant, 68 benign). Four breast radiologists with different levels of MRI experience and blinded to histopathology retrospectively evaluated all examinations. Readers independently applied two methods to classify breast lesions: BI-RADS and Tree. BI-RADS provides a reporting lexicon that is empirically translated into likelihoods of malignancy; Tree is a scoring system that results in a diagnostic category. Readings were compared by ROC analysis and kappa statistics.
RESULTS: Inter-reader agreement was substantial to almost perfect (kappa: 0.643-0.896) for Tree and moderate (kappa: 0.455-0.657) for BI-RADS. Diagnostic performance using Tree (AUC: 0.889-0.943) was similar to BI-RADS (AUC: 0.872-0.953). Less experienced radiologists achieved AUC: improvements up to 4.7 % using Tree (P-values: 0.042-0.698); an expert's performance did not change (P = 0.526). The least experienced reader improved in specificity using Tree (16 %, P = 0.001). No further sensitivity and specificity differences were found (P > 0.1).
CONCLUSION: The Tree scoring system improves inter-reader agreement and achieves a diagnostic performance similar to that of BI-RADS. Less experienced radiologists, in particular, benefit from Tree.
KEY POINTS: • The Tree scoring system shows high diagnostic accuracy in mass and non-mass lesions. • The Tree scoring system reduces inter-reader variability related to reader experience. • The Tree scoring system improves diagnostic accuracy in non-expert readers."
26511765,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26511765/,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prediction of microcephaly at birth (micB) using established and two new reference ranges for fetal head circumference (HC) and to assess whether integrating additional parameters can improve prediction.
METHODS: Microcephaly in utero was defined as a fetal HC 3SD below the mean for gestational age according to Jeanty et al.'s reference range. The records of cases with fetal microcephaly (Fmic) were evaluated for medical history, imaging findings, biometry and postnatal examination/autopsy findings. Microcephaly was confirmed at birth (micB) by an occipitofrontal circumference (OFC) or a brain weight at autopsy 2SD below the mean for gestational age. The new INTERGROWTH-21(st) Project and a recent Israeli reference for fetal growth were applied for evaluation of the Fmic positive predictive value (PPV) for diagnosis of micB cases. Optimal HC cut-offs were determined for each of the new references with the aim of detecting all micB cases whilst minimizing the number of false positives found to have a normal HC at birth. We also assessed the difference between the Z-scores of the prenatal HC and the corresponding OFC at birth, the frequency of small-for-gestational age (SGA), decreased HC/abdominal circumference (AC) and HC/femur length (FL) ratios, the prevalence of associated malformations and family history.
RESULTS: Forty-two fetuses were diagnosed as having Fmic according to the Jeanty reference, but micB was confirmed in only 24 (PPV, 57.1%). The optimal INTERGROWTH and Israeli reference HC cut-offs for micB diagnosis were mean - 3SD and mean - 2.3SD, resulting in a statistically non-significant improvement in PPV to 61.5% and 66.7%, respectively. The presence of a family history of microcephaly, SGA, associated malformations and application of stricter HC cut-offs resulted in a higher PPV of micB, although not statistically significant and with a concurrent increase in the number of false-negative results. The deviation of the HC from the mean, by all references, was significantly larger compared with the actual deviation of the OFC at birth, with mean differences between the corresponding Z-scores of -1.15, -1.95 and -0.74 for the Jeanty, INTERGROWTH and Israeli references, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The evaluated reference ranges all result in considerable over-diagnosis of fetal microcephaly. The use of the two new HC reference ranges did not significantly improve micB prediction compared with that of Jeanty et al., whilst use of additional characteristics and stricter HC cut-offs could improve the PPV with an increase in false negatives. The postnatal OFC deviates significantly less from the mean compared with the prenatal HC, and we propose that adjustment for this would enable better prediction of the actual OFC deviation at birth.

26512435,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26512435/,"OBJECTIVE: Bladder outlet obstruction may occur after any incontinence surgery and may present as OAB, hesitancy and or the feeling of incomplete emptying. Aim of this study was to analyze the clinical and urodynamical outcome after urethrolysis in patients presenting with various clinical symptoms after Burch colposuspension for stress urinary incontinence.
STUDY DESIGN: Between January 2005 and December 2014, all patients who presented with symptoms and with bladder outlet obstruction were included. All patients had undergone Burch or Cowan colposuspension for stress urinary incontinence previously. Primary endpoint was the visual analogue scale (VAS) as measurement of patient perceived disease impact. Secondary endpoints were the various domains of the King's Health Questionnaire, urodynamic parameters as detrusor pressure at maximum flow, residual urine and sonographic bladder wall thickness before and six months after intervention.
RESULTS: Seventy-two female patients were included in this study whereof 42 suffered from urgency and urge incontinence, 20 from hesitancy and/or slow stream, seven from residual urine of more than 100ml and three from a combination of urgency and residual urine. VAS improved significantly (p<0.0001). Quality of life as determined by the King's Health Questionnaire improved for the domains general health, role limitations, emotions, physical limitations, personal limitations and incontinence impact significantly. Micturition pressure dropped significantly from 43cmH2O (95% CI 19-59cmH2O) to 18cmH2O (95% CI 16-23.5 H2O). Residual urine changed from 110ml (range 20-380ml) to 32ml (20-115ml). Bladder wall thickness decreased from 7mm (95% CI 6.235-7.152) to 5mm (95% CI 5.037-5.607; p<0.01).
CONCLUSION: Urethrolysis may resolve patients' symptoms and lower micturition pressure but irritative symptoms may persist."
26513147,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26513147/,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to explore the potential risk factors associated with the failure of an upper extremity replantation with a focus on cigarette or tobacco use.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cohort of 102 patients with 149 replants (6 extremities, 143 digits) and a mean age of 41 years (range 5 to 72 years) was enrolled in this study. The data collected included age, gender, tobacco/cigarettes use, trauma mechanism, underlying disease (e.g., hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), etc.), and vein graft use. An analysis with a multivariable regression was conducted to identify the risk factors of replant failure and their respective odds ratios (ORs).
RESULTS: Multilevel generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) with a binomial distribution and logit link showed that smoking did not increase the risk of replant failure (p = 0.234). In addition, the survival of replants was not affected by DM or HTN (p = 0.285 and 0.938, respectively). However, the replantation results were significantly affected by the age of the patients and the mechanism of injury. Patients older than 50 years and those with avulsion or crush injuries tended to have a higher risk of replant failure (OR = 2.29, 6.45, and 5.42, respectively; p = 0.047, 0.028, and 0.032, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the use of cigarettes/tobacco did not affect the replantation outcome. The main risks for replant failure included being older than 50 years and the trauma mechanism (avulsion or crush injuries)."
26513149,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26513149/,"PURPOSE: To examine the value of surveillance urethro-cystoscopy in patients with neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD) in regard to the conflicting literature as it is generally agreed that patients with NLUTD are at increased risk for bladder cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, a consecutive series of 129 patients (50 females, 79 males, mean age 51, range 18-88) suffering from NLUTD for at least 5 years was prospectively investigated using urethro-cystoscopy and bladder washing cytology at a single university spinal cord injury (SCI) center.
RESULTS: Due to suspicious urethro-cystoscopy and/or bladder washing cytology findings, 13 (10%) of 129 patients underwent transurethral resection of the bladder lesion and/or random bladder biopsies. Overall, 9 relevant histological findings were found in 5% (7/129) of our patients: bladder melanosis (n = 1), nephrogenic adenoma (n = 3), keratinizing squamous metaplasia (n = 1), intestinal metaplasia (n = 3), and muscle-invasive adenocarcinoma of the bladder (n = 1).
CONCLUSIONS: Using surveillance urethro-cystoscopy, we found relevant histological findings in 5% of our patients suffering from NLUTD for at least 5 years. Thus, surveillance urethro-cystoscopy might be warranted, although the ideal starting point and frequency remain to be determined in further prospective studies."
26513335,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26513335/,"OBJECTIVES: Motorcycle riding is increasing globally and confers a high risk of crash-related injury and death. There is community demand for investment in rider training programs but no high-quality evidence about its effectiveness in preventing crashes. This randomised trial of an on-road rider coaching program aimed to determine its effectiveness in reducing crashes in novice motorcycle riders.
METHODS: Between May 2010 and October 2012, 2399 newly-licensed provisional riders were recruited in Victoria, Australia and completed a telephone interview before randomisation to intervention or control groups. Riders in the intervention group were offered an on-road motorcycle rider coaching program which involved pre-program activities, 4h riding and facilitated discussion in small groups with a riding coach. Outcome measures were collected for all participants via telephone interviews at 3 and 12 months after program delivery (or equivalent for controls), and via linkage to police-recorded crash and offence data. The primary outcome was a composite measure of police-recorded and self-reported crashes; secondary outcomes included traffic offences, near crashes, riding exposure, and riding behaviours and motivations.
RESULTS: Follow-up was 89% at 3 months and 88% at 12 months; 60% of the intervention group completed the program. Intention-to-treat analyses conducted in 2014 indicated no effect on crash risk at 3 months (adjusted OR 0.90, 95% CI: 0.65-1.27) or 12 months (adjusted OR 1.00, 95% CI: 0.78-1.29). Riders in the intervention group reported increased riding exposure, speeding behaviours and rider confidence.
CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence that this on-road motorcycle rider coaching program reduced the risk of crash, and we found an increase in crash-related risk factors."
26513726,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26513726/,"OBJECTIVE: Only a few studies in patients with first-episode psychosis have included gender in the study hypothesis or considered this a primary study variable. The aim of this study was to explore the influence of gender in the pattern of substance use in patients with first-episode psychosis.
METHODS: This is a sub-analysis of a randomized open clinical trial that compared 1-year treatment retention rates of patients with first-episode psychosis randomized to haloperidol, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, or ziprasidone. Our sub-analysis included 85 men and 29 women.
RESULTS: Substance use was relatively high among these patients and differed significantly by gender. Men were more likely to use substances overall than women (89.4% for men vs. 55.2% for women), χ(2) = 16.2, df = 1, p <.001, and were also more likely to use alcohol (χ(2) = 13, df = 1, p <.001), cannabis (χ(2) = 9.9; df = 1, p <.002), and cocaine (χ(2) = 10.3; df = 1, p <.001), compared to women. While there were no gender differences in age at first consumption of alcohol or cocaine, men were significantly younger at first consumption of cannabis (M = 16.08 years, SD = 2.1) than women (M = 18.0 years, SD = 3.8), F(1, 59) = 5, p <.02. When analyzed separately by gender, women showed no significant differences in the influence of number of substances used on age at onset of psychosis, F(3, 29) = 1.2, p =.30. However, there was a significant difference among men, with earlier onset of psychosis noted in men consuming multiple substances; F(4, 85) = 5.8, p <.0001. Regarding prediction of age at onset of psychosis, both male gender and the use of a higher number of substances significantly predicted an earlier age at onset of psychosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides some evidence of gender differences in the pattern of substance use in patients with first-episode psychosis, suggesting the possible need for gender-specific approaches in the interventions performed in these patients.

26513727,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26513727/,"BACKGROUND: Studies that evaluate both body composition and metabolic syndrome (MeS) risk in prepubertal children with premature adrenarche (PA) are limited.
METHODS: Fifty-eight prepubertal children (aged 5-9 years, 33 female and 25 male), 30 with PA and 28 controls, were evaluated for the presence of MeS as defined by age-modified National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III criteria. A subset had dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and bone markers (n = 23/58) to evaluate the effect of hyperandrogenism on metabolic abnormalities and body composition.
RESULTS: There was no difference in the prevalence of MeS between PA and controls (p = 0.138). Children with MeS were obese with an increased waist circumference (WC) and decreased high-density lipoprotein levels. Androgens were not associated with having more than one criterion for MeS (p = 0.08) but were associated with triglycerides and WC (p = 0.029 and p = 0.041, respectively). Lean mass was greater in PA subjects (p = 0.039), and androgens correlated with bone mineral density (p = 0.029) and total body fat (p = 0.008). Subjects with a higher percent of body fat were more likely to have more than one MeS risk factor (p = 0.005).
CONCLUSIONS: MeS was seen only in obese subjects whether or not they had PA. Thus, it appears that obesity drives metabolic risk in the prepubertal population rather than PA. Our findings are important in determining how the prepubertal patient with PA should be evaluated for metabolic risk."
26513883,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26513883/,"OBJECTIVE: Ovarian cancer is the seventh most common cancer in women worldwide, with nearly a quarter of a million women diagnosed every year. The serum tumor markers cancer antigens CA 125, CA 19-9, and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) are potentially of clinical value for the diagnosis of ovarian cancer. A diagnostic tool that is noninvasive, simple to perform, and specific is needed to predict primary ovarian cancer. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic sensivitity and specificity of vaginal-washing tumor markers CA 125, CA 19-9, and CEA for diagnosis of primary ovarian cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the current prospective study, 30 patients with advanced primary ovarian cancer and 30 patients with benign ovarian cysts were enrolled. The vaginal-washing fluid samples were obtained the day before surgery and were immediately centrifuged and stored at -80 degrees C until analysis. Measurements of CA 125, CA 19-9, and CEA were determined using fully-automated chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassays.
RESULTS: The vaginal fluid concentrations of CA 125, CA 19-9, and CEA in patients with primary ovarian carcinoma were significantly higher (p < 0.001) compared to those in patients with benign adnexal masses (p < 0.001). In the ROC curve analysis, the optimal cut-off values for the detection of primary ovarian cancer were >295 for CA 125 (p < 0.001), > 101 for CA 19-9 (p < 0.001), and >135 for CEA (p < 0.001).

26514114,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26514114/,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To determine if axial T2-weighted imaging can serve as screening tool for pediatric brain imaging.
METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated consecutive brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of 161 children (74 girls) with a mean age of 7.44 ± 5.71 years. Standard of reference was the final report of neuroradiology attendings. Three readers with different levels of experience were blinded for clinical diagnoses and study indications. First, readers studied only the axial T2-weighted screening sequence. Second, they studied all available anatomical and functional MRI sequences as performed per standard protocol for each clinical indication. The readings were classified as normal or abnormal. Sensitivity and specificity were measured.
RESULTS: Axial T2 screening yielded a sensitivity of 77-88% and a specificity of 92%. The full studies/data sets had a sensitivity of 89-95% and a specificity of 86-93%. Nineteen of 167 studies were acquired for acute and 148 of 167 studies for nonacute clinical indication. Twenty-five false-negative diagnoses paneled in three groups were made by all readers together. Readers misread four of 19 studies with acute and 21 of 148 studies with nonacute clinical indication. Four of 21 misread studies with nonacute indications harbored unexpected findings needing management.
CONCLUSIONS: Axial T2 screening can detect pediatric brain abnormalities with high sensitivity and specificity and can possibly replace CT as screening tool if the reading physician is aware of possible limitations/pitfalls. The level of experience influences sensitivity and specificity. Adding diffusion-weighted imaging and susceptibility-weighted imaging to a 3-dimensional T2-weighted sequence would most likely further increase sensitivity and specificity."
26514122,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26514122/,"BACKGROUND: Bilateral mastectomies (BM) are traditionally performed by single surgeons (SS); a co-surgeon (CS) technique, where each surgeon concurrently performs a unilateral mastectomy, offers an alternative approach. We examined differences in general surgery time (GST), overall surgery time (OST), and patient complications for BM performed by CS and SS.
METHODS: Patients undergoing BM with tissue expander reconstruction (BMTR) between January 2010 and May 2014 at our center were identified through operative case logs. GST (incision to end of BM procedure), reconstruction duration (RST) (plastic surgery start to end of reconstruction) and OST (OST = GST + RST) was calculated. Patient age, presence/stage of cancer, breast weight, axillary procedure performed, and 30-day postoperative complications were extracted from medical records. Differences in GST and OST between CS and SS cases were assessed with a t test. A multivariate linear regression was fit to identify factors associated with GST.
RESULTS: A total of 116 BMTR cases were performed [CS, n = 67 (57.8 %); SS, n = 49 (42.2 %)]. Demographic characteristics did not differ between groups. GST and OST were significantly shorter for CS cases, 75.8 versus 116.8 min, p < .0001, and 255.2 versus 278.3 min, p = .005, respectively. Presence of a CS significantly reduces BMTR time (β = -38.82, p < .0001). Breast weight (β = 0.0093, p = .03) and axillary dissection (β = 28.69, p = .0003) also impacted GST.
CONCLUSIONS: The CS approach to BMTR reduced both GST and OST; however, the degree of time savings (35.1 and 8.3 %, respectively) was less than hypothesized. A larger study is warranted to better characterize time, cost, and outcomes of the CS-approach for BM."
26514141,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26514141/,"BACKGROUND: Coronal shear fractures of the distal humerus are uncommon injuries and are not exempt from complications. The aim of this research is to evaluate the possible advantages and drawbacks using cannulated compression headless screws.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a prospective study including all the consecutive patients who were treated with cannulated screws for coronal shear fractures of the distal humerus between 2010 and 2013. Following the Dubberley's classification, three patients were type 1A, one patient was 1B, three patients were 2B, and one patient was 3B. The mean follow-up was 30 months. The clinical and radiological evaluation included analysis of passive range of motion, functional outcome, radiological evaluation of fracture healing and reduction maintenance, and the occurrence of possible adverse events.
RESULTS: All fractures healed, and radiographic union was observed at an average of 3 months. The average elbow range of motion was 125°, with 125° of flexion and 20 of extension. According to the Broberg and Morrey score, there were four excellent and four good results. Using the Mayo Elbow Performance Index, five cases achieved excellent scores and three reported good results. Adverse events reported in three cases were as follows: heterotopic ossification, complex regional pain syndrome and delayed lateral collateral ligament disruption.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of cannulated compression headless screws has given satisfactory results, allowing a strong inter-fragmentary compression, early mobilization, with high union rates and good elbow function. However, patients should be counseled about the high proportion of adverse events following these injuries."

METHODS: Twenty-five patients with newly diagnosed GBM were enrolled in this study 3-5 wk after surgical resection. All participants were investigated with (18)F-RGD PET/CT on baseline (T1) and at the third week (T2) after the start of CCRT. Tumor volume, maximal and mean standardized uptake value of the tumor (SUVmax, SUVmean), and tumor-to-nontumor ratios of the tumor volume were obtained. The MRI treatment response was assessed at the 11th week (T3). The change in the lesion volume from T1 to T3 on MRI was used as an endpoint to evaluate the predictive ability of (18)F-RGD PET/CT.
RESULTS: With (18)F-RGD PET/CT imaging, we successfully visualized the residual lesions of GBM. Twenty-five and 23 (18)F-RGD PET/CT scans at baseline and the third week, respectively, were available for analysis. We found that (18)F-RGD PET/CT parameters, both pretreatment SUVmax on baseline (P< 0.05) and intratreatment SUVmax at the third week (SUV(maxT2)) (P< 0.05) and tumor-to-nontumor ratios at the third week (P< 0.05), were predictive of treatment sensitivity to CCRT. Additionally, the change of volume from T1 to T2 on MRI was also predictive (P< 0.05). According to receiver-operating-characteristic curve analysis, the most significant parameter was SUV(maxT2) (area under the curve, 0.846). The threshold of SUV(maxT2) was 1.35, and its sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 84.6%, 90.0% and 87.0%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: (18)F-RGD PET/CT allows for the noninvasive visualization of GBM lesions and the prediction of sensitivity to CCRT as early as 3 wk after treatment initiation."
26514215,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26514215/,"OBJECTIVES: This study aims to investigate whether positioning of the plate fixation plays a role in the stability of the osteosynthesis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used finite element modelling to model an anterior pillar fracture and a T-type fracture of the acetabulum. Fracture fixation was carried out in three different variations: cranially positioned plate, medially positioned plate, and a combination of the two methods. In all cases, 3-3 screws were inserted on both ends of the plate to fix the fracture.
RESULTS: In both fractures, nearly the same amount of displacement was detected in the fracture gap using a cranially positioned or medially positioned plate, and the amount of displacement was not less when using both plates simultaneously.
CONCLUSION: The position of the plate fixation does not affect the stability of the osteosynthesis and in cases of simple fracture patterns, fixation using two plates does not provide more stability than one plate alone."

Patients were separated into three groups. Patients in group 1 and group 2 were administered 2 g intravenous tranexamic acid and 2 g intraarticular tranexamic acid, respectively. Patients in group 3 were not administered tranexamic acid. Pre- and postoperative hemoglobin difference, volume of blood collected in drains, and transfusion rate were analyzed.
RESULTS: Compared with the control group, there was no significant difference between group 1 and group 2 in terms of total blood loss from the drain, pre- and postoperative hemoglobin difference, and the need for blood transfusion.
CONCLUSION: Both intraarticular and intravenous administrations reduce blood loss and need for transfusion and there is no significant difference between the two techniques in terms of safety."

Cancer antigen 15-3 (CA15-3) and carcinoembryogenic antigen (CEA) were measured in all patients.
RESULTS: Histologically 83%, 7% and 10% had infiltrating ductal, lobular and mixed carcinoma respectively. Confirmed bone metastases were present in 86 patients (57.3%) and absent in 64 (42.7%). Mean CA15-3 and CEA values in patients with bone metastases were 74.6ng/mL and 60.4U/mL respectively, compared to 21.3ng/mL and 3.2U/mL without metastases (p<0.001). The sensitivity of FDG-PET/CT for the detection of bone metastases was 97.6% compared to 89.5% with SPECT/CT. In 57 patients, FDG-PET/CT correctly identified additional pulmonary, hepatic, nodal and other soft tissue metastases, not detected by BS.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that FDG-PET/CT is superior to BS with or without SPECT/CT."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Chest CT scans of 2633 participants (mean age 59.2 years; 50% female) of the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) were visually evaluated for the presence of pulmonary cysts and their image characteristics. These findings were correlated with participant demographics and results of pulmonary function tests as well as the presence of emphysema independently detected on CT. The interval change was investigated by comparison with previous CT scans (median interval 6.1 years).
RESULTS: Pulmonary cysts were seen in 7.6% (95% CI 6.6% to 8.7%; 200/2633). They were not observed in participants younger than 40 years old, and the prevalence increased with age. Multiple cysts (at least five) were seen in 0.9% of all participants. Participants with pulmonary cysts showed significantly lower body mass index (BMI) (p<0.001). Pulmonary cysts were most likely to appear solitary in the peripheral area of the lower lobes and remain unchanged or slightly increase in size over time. Pulmonary cysts showed no significant influence on pulmonary functions (p=0.07-0.6) except for diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) (p=0.03) and no association with cigarette smoking (p=0.1-0.9) or emphysema (p=0.7).
CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary cysts identified on chest CT may be a part of the aging changes of the lungs, occurring in asymptomatic individuals older than 40 years, and are associated with decreased BMI and DLCO. Multiple pulmonary cysts may need to be evaluated for the possibility of cystic lung diseases."
26514488,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26514488/,"BACKGROUND: Mean platelet volume (MPV) is a marker which has been investigated in many cancers but data for head and neck lesions are limited. We aimed to study the MPV levels in head and neck cancers as a diagnostic marker.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 96 head and neck cancer patients and 31 control patients who did not meet exclusion criteria were enrolled in the study. The cancer locations, the platelet and MPV levels at the first diagnosis time were collected.
RESULTS: The head and neck cancer location distribution between these patients was 2 (2.1%) buccal, 9 (9.4%) tongue, 6 (6.3) lip, 1 (1%) gingiva, 1 (1%) hypopharynx, 1 (1%) ear, 58 (60.4%) larynx, 2 (2.1%) maxilla, 2 (2.1%) nasal, 1 (1%) nasopharynx, 2 (2.1%) palatal, 3 (3.1%) primary unknown, 1 (1%) retromolar, 1 (1%) thyroid, 2 (2.1%) tonsil, and 4 (4.2%) salivary gland. MPV levels were significantly different between cancer and control group (p=0.002). The cut-off point for MPV predicting head and neck cancer is >10 fL (sensitivity=55.21, specificity=87.10).
CONCLUSIONS: MPV level increase, a readily assessable parameter which does not bring extra costs can warn us regarding head and neck cancer risk."
26514493,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26514493/,"BACKGROUND: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most prevalent malignancy among males in India. While tobacco and alcohol are main aetiological factors, human papilloma virus (HPV) presence has surprisingly increased in head and neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) in the past two decade but its frequency in OSCCS is still uncertain. We aim to explore the frequency of HPV and its major genotypes in North Indian patients and their association with clinicopathological and histopathological features and p16 expression pattern.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study group comprised 250 histologically proven cases of OSCC. HPV was detected by real time PCR in tumor biopsy specimens and confirmed by conventional PCR with PGMY09/ PGMY11 primers. Genotyping for high-risk types 16/ 18 was conducted by type specific PCR. p16 expression was assessed by immunohistochemsitry.
RESULTS: HPV presence was confirmed in 23/250 (9.2%) OSCC cases, of which 30.4% had HPV 16 infection, 17.4%were positive for HPV 18 and 26.1% had co-infections. HPV presence was significantly associated with male gender (p=0.02) and habit of pan masala chewing (p=0.01). HPV positive cases also had a history of tobacco consumption in 91.3% cases. p16 over expression was observed in 39.1% of HPV positive cases but this was not significantly different from negative cases (p=0.54).
CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of HPV in OSCC is low in North-India and majority of cases are associated with a tobacco habit. It appears that tobacco shows a confounding effect in HPV positive cases and use of p16 protein as a reliable marker to assess the potential etiological role of HPV in OSCC in our population is not suggested."
26514717,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26514717/,"CONTEXT: Despite being commonplace in health care systems, little research has described home care nursing's effectiveness to reduce acute care use at the end of life.
OBJECTIVES: To examine the temporal association between home care nursing rate on emergency department (ED) visit rate in the subsequent week during the last six months of life.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of end-of-life cancer decedents in Ontario, Canada, from 2004 to 2009 by linking administrative databases. We examined the association between home care nursing rate of one week with the ED rate in the subsequent week closer to death, controlling for covariates and repeated measures among decedents. Nursing was dichotomized into standard and end-of-life care intent.
RESULTS: Our cohort included 54,576 decedents who used home care nursing services in the last six months before death, where 85% had an ED visit and 68% received end-of-life home care nursing. Patients receiving end-of-life nursing at any week had a significantly reduced ED rate in the subsequent week of 31% (relative rate [RR] 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.68, 0.71) compared with standard nursing. In the last month of life, receiving end-of-life nursing and standard nursing rate of more than five hours/week was associated with a decreased ED rate of 41% (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.58, 0.61) and 32% (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.66, 0.70), respectively, compared with standard nursing of one hour/week.
CONCLUSION: Our study showed a temporal association between receiving end-of-life nursing in a given week during the last six months of life, and of more standard nursing in the last month of life, with a reduced ED rate in the subsequent week."
26514739,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26514739/,"BACKGROUND: Few data are available on the use of capsule endoscopy in the elderly.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective study on 1008 consecutive patients referred to our centre between December 1, 2002 and January 30, 2014 who underwent capsule endoscopy for various indications. Patients were enrolled and divided into 3 sub-groups according to their age (Group A: <50 years; Group B: 50-69 years; Group C: >70 years). The Pillcam diagnostic yield, clinically significant findings and post-treatment outcomes were compared between groups.
RESULTS: Diagnostic yield was significantly higher in Group C vs. Groups A and B (65.2% vs. 42.3% and 47.5%, respectively; p<0.05). The most common diagnosis in the elderly was angiodysplasia (42.5%). In 84.5% of elderly patients (Group C) capsule endoscopy results modified patient management.
CONCLUSIONS: Capsule endoscopy has a high diagnostic yield and positive impact on management in patients aged >70 years."
26514849,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26514849/,"BACKGROUND: The primary objective was to evaluate correlations linking anatomical to functional outcomes after endoscopically assisted repair of acute acromioclavicular joint dislocation (ACJD).
HYPOTHESIS: Combined acromioclavicular and coracoclavicular stabilisation improves radiological outcomes compared to coracoclavicular stabilisation alone.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective multicentre study was performed. Clinical outcome measures were pain intensity on a visual analogue scale (VAS), subjective functional impairment (QuickDASH score), and Constant's score. Anatomical outcomes were assessed on standard radiographs (anteroposterior view of the acromioclavicular girdle and bilateral axillary views) obtained preoperatively and postoperatively and on postoperative dynamic radiographs taken as described by Tauber et al.
RESULTS: Of 116 patients with acute ACJD included in the study, 48% had type III, 30% type IV, and 22% type V ACJD according to the Rockwood classification. Coracoclavicular stabilisation was achieved using a double endobutton in 93% of patients, and concomitant acromioclavicular stabilisation was performed in 50% of patients. The objective functional outcome was good, with an unweighted Constant's score ≥ 85/100 and a subjective QuickDASH functional disability score ≤ 10 in 75% of patients. The radiographic analysis showed significant improvements from the preoperative to the 1-year postoperative values in the vertical plane (decrease in the coracoclavicular ratio from 214 to 128%, p=10(-6)) and in the horizontal plane (decrease in posterior displacement from 4 to 0mm, p=5×10(-5)). The anatomical outcome correlated significantly with the functional outcome (absolute R value=0.19 and p=0.045). We found no statistically significant differences across the various types of constructs used. Intra-operative control of the acromioclavicular joint did not improve the result. Implantation of a biological graft significantly improved both the anatomical outcome in the vertical plane (p=0.04) and acromioclavicular stabilisation in the horizontal plane (p=0.02). The coracoclavicular ratio on the anteroposterior radiograph was adversely affected by a longer time from injury to surgery (p=0.02) and by a higher body mass index (BMI) (p=0.006). High BMI also had a negative effect on the difference in the distance separating the anterior edge of the acromion from the anterior edge of the clavicle between the injured and uninjured sides, as assessed on the axillary views (p=0.009).
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that acute ACJD requires stabilisation in both planes, i.e., at the coracoclavicular junction and at the acromioclavicular joint. Coracoclavicular stabilisation alone is not sufficient, regardless of the type of implant used. Implantation of a biological graft should be considered when the time from injury to surgery is longer than 10days. The weight of the upper limb should be taken into account, with 6weeks of immobilisation to unload the construct in patients who have high BMI values.

26514951,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26514951/,"OBJECTIVES: Genetic alterations explaining the clinical variability of prolactinomas still could not be clarified and dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) polymorphism is a putative candidate for the variable response to dopaminergic treatment. The present study was conducted to investigate the influence of DRD2 TaqI A polymorphism on initial and follow-up characteristics of prolactinoma.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-two patients with prolactinoma and 98 age and gender matched control subjects were recruited to the case-control study. Serum prolactin levels were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and DRD2 polymorphism was determined by polymerase chain reaction and restriction length polymorphism analysis.
RESULTS: Decrease of prolactin levels and the tumor shrinkage after cabergoline treatment were 93.9±5.9% and 58.3±33.1% in microadenomas and 96.1±6.1% and 51.7±29.3 in macroadenomas (P=0.02 and P>0.05, respectively). We observed no significant difference for DRD2 genotypes and the alleles between the patients and healthy group (P>0.05). Prolactin levels before treatment were correlated with tumor diameter before and after treatment and the percentage of prolactin decrease with treatment (P<0.001 r=0.58, P<0.001 r=0.40 and P<0.001 r=0.47, respectively). Tumor diameter before the treatment was also correlated with the tumor diameter after the treatment (P<0.001 r=0.64) and the percentage of prolactin decrease (P=0.01 r=0.30). However, no significant association was found between characteristics of prolactinoma and DRD2 genotypes and alleles (P>0.05).
CONCLUSION: This study revealed that DRD2 TaqI A receptor polymorphism was not associated with the development of prolactinoma and its clinical characteristics. Future studies are needed to clarify the clinical implications of genetic alterations in prolactinoma."
26515202,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26515202/,"BACKGROUND: Better outcomes have been found among hospitals treating higher volumes of patients for specific surgical and medical conditions. We examined hospital ischemic stroke (IS) volume and 30-day mortality to inform regionalization planning.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Using a population-based hospital discharge administrative database (2005/2006 to 2011/2012), average annual IS patient volumes were calculated for 162 Ontario acute hospitals. Hospitals were ranked and classified as small (<126), medium (126-202), and large (>202). Hierarchical multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of death within 7 and 30 days to account for the homogeneity in outcomes for patients treated at the same hospital. Overall, 73 368 patients were hospitalized for IS, and 30-day mortality was 15.3%. The mean (±SD) of annual hospitalizations for IS was 29 (31) for small-volume hospitals, 156 (20) for medium-volume hospitals, and 300 (78) for high-volume hospitals. High-volume hospitals admitted younger patients (mean [±SD] age, 73.0 [13.9] years) compared with medium- and small-volume hospitals (74.0 [13.2] and 75.5 [12.5] years, respectively; P<0.0001). Patients at small-volume hospitals were more likely than patients at high-volume hospitals to die at 30 days after an acute IS (adjusted odds ratio, 1.37; 95% confidence interval, 1.14-1.65).
CONCLUSIONS: Hospital IS volume is associated with 30-day mortality in Ontario. Patients admitted to hospitals with annual IS volumes <126 annually are more likely to die within 30 days than patients admitted to hospitals that see on average 300 patients annually. This finding supports centralizing care in stroke-specialized hospitals."

METHOD: A retrospective cohort study. Data were collected from medical records of 1324 GDM patients including demographic data, family history of diabetes, obstetrical history, laboratory results, treatment modality and level of glycemic control. Patients who were identified as pre-gestational diabetes were excluded.
RESULTS: Overall, 143 (10.8%) GDM patients required pharmacological therapy. Of women who had GDM in their previous pregnancy; only 11.65% achieved desired glycemic control solely by diet treatment. Moreover, 62.5% of patients requiring pharmacological therapy in their previous pregnancy achieved desired level of glycemic control only by diet. Of patients who achieved desired level of glycemic control on diet until the second antenatal visit, 95% continued to maintain desired level glycemic control throughout pregnancy. Pre-pregnancy BMI >30, fasting plasma glucose >95 mg/dL and maternal age above 30 were associated with increase need for pharmacological treatment. One abnormal value in the OGTT and GCT result >2 mg/dL did not predict the need for pharmacological therapy.

CONCLUSION: Using clinical and demographical data can predict the need for pharmacological treatment for GDM."
26515421,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26515421/,"INTRODUCTION: There is increasing evidence that both hyperuricemia and gout increase the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Whether urate crystal precipitation confers a particular risk above what is already inherent in having hyperuricemia is not well established. We conducted this cohort study to establish whether the presence of monosodium urate crystal precipitation per se is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases among hyperuricemic patients.
METHODS: We identified hyperuricemic individuals who had joint fluid examinations for urate crystals. Individuals with intra-articular urate crystals were matched by propensity score to individuals without crystals and compared with respect to a composite cardiovascular endpoint. Included in the propensity score model were potential confounders retrieved from four different health care registries.
RESULTS: We identified 862 hyperuricemic patients having urate crystal examination. After propensity score matching, we could include 317 patients with urate crystals matched 1:1 to patients without urate crystals. We found no difference between the two groups with respect to cardiovascular outcomes (hazard ratios = 0.86; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.52 - 1.43) or death (hazard ratio 0.74; CI 0.45 - 1.21).
CONCLUSION: The presence of urate crystal precipitations does not seem to confer a particular cardiovascular risk in hyperuricemic patients."
26515632,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26515632/,"BACKGROUND: The association between being overweight/obese and deprivation is a serious concern in English schoolchildren.
AIM: To model this association incorporating known confounders and to discover whether physical fitness and physical activity may reduce or eliminate this association.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional data were collected between 2007-2009, from 8053 10-16 year old children from the East-of-England Healthy Heart Study. Weight status was assessed using waist circumference (cm) and body mass (kg). Deprivation was measured using the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD). Confounding variables used in the proportional, allometric models were hip circumference, stature, age and sex. Children's fitness levels were assessed using predicted VO max (20-metre shuttle-run test) and physical activity was estimated using the Physical Activity Questionnaire for Adolescents or Children.
RESULTS: A strong association was found between both waist circumference and body mass and the IMD. These associations persisted after controlling for all confounding variables. When the children's physical activity and fitness levels were added to the models, the association was either greatly reduced or, in the case of body mass, absent.
CONCLUSIONS: To reduce deprivation inequalities in children's weight-status, health practitioners should focus on increasing physical fitness via physical activity in areas of greater deprivation."
26515802,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26515802/,"BACKGROUND: Cutaneous microcirculation has shown to play a key role in wound healing. Although healing disorders are still one of the most common complications in hand surgery, there still exists a lack of scientific research on possible age-related changes in cutaneous microcirculation at the dorsum of hand.
HYPOTHESIS: Cutaneous microcirculation at the dorsum of the hand differs significantly between different age groups.
METHODS: 53 healthy subjects were divided into 2 groups by age (Group A:<40 years, n=31 vs. Group B≥40 years, n=22). All subjects underwent measurement of the microcirculation at the dorsum of the hand with combined laser-Doppler and photo spectrometry.
RESULTS: Cutaneous oxygen saturation was significantly higher in Group A than in Group B (A: 64.7±9.9% vs. B: 58.3±12.6%; p=0,044). In contrast, blood flow velocity was significantly higher in Group B (A: 43±19.6 AU vs. B: 56.7±21.1 AU; p=0.019).
CONCLUSION: The hypothesis of this study was confirmed. This is the first study to show significant differences of cutaneous microcirculation at the dorsum of the hand within different age groups. Further clinical trials are needed in order to examine if delayed wound healing can be correlated to impaired cutaneous microcirculation at the dorsum of the hand."
26515805,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26515805/,"BACKGROUND: Hypovolaemia is generally believed to induce centralization of blood volume. Therefore, we evaluated whether induced hypo- and hypervolaemia result in changes in central blood volumes (pulmonary blood volume (PBV), intrathoracic blood volume (ITBV)) and we explored the effects on the distribution between these central blood volumes and circulating blood volume (Vd circ).
METHODS: Six anaesthetized, spontaneously breathing Foxhound dogs underwent random blood volume alterations in steps of 150 ml (mild) to 450 ml (moderate), either by haemorrhage, retransfusion of blood, or colloid infusion. PBV, ITBV and Vd circ were measured using (transpulmonary) dye dilution. The PBV/Vd circ ratio and the ITBV/Vd circ ratio were used as an assessment of blood volume distribution.
RESULTS: 68 blood volume alterations resulted in changes in Vdcirc ranging from -33 to +31%. PBV and ITBV decreased during mild and moderate haemorrhage, while during retransfusion, PBV and ITBV increased during moderate hypervolaemia only. The PBV/Vd circ ratio remained constant during all stages of hypo- and hypervolaemia (mean values between 0.20-0.22). This was also true for the ITBV/Vd circ ratio, which remained between 0.31 and 0.32, except for moderate hypervolaemia, where it increased slightly to 0.33 (0.02), P<0.05.
CONCLUSIONS: Mild to moderate blood volume alterations result in changes of Vd circ, PBV and ITBV. The ratio between the central blood volumes and Vd circ generally remained unaltered. Therefore, it could be suggested that in anaesthetized spontaneously breathing dogs, the cardiovascular system maintains the distribution of blood between central and circulating blood volume."
26516151,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26516151/,"BACKGROUND: In Mozambique, integrated community case management (iCCM) of diarrhoea, malaria and pneumonia is embedded in the national community health worker (CHW) programme, mainstreaming it into government policy and service delivery. Since its inception in 1978, the CHW programme has functioned unevenly, was suspended in 1989, but relaunched in 2010. To assess the long-term success of iCCM in Mozambique, this article addresses whether the current CHW programme exhibits characteristics that facilitate or impede its sustainability.
METHODOLOGY: We undertook a qualitative case study based on document review (n = 54) and key informant interviews (n = 21) with respondents from the Ministry of Health (MOH), multilateral and bilateral agencies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Maputo in 2012. Interviews were mostly undertaken in Portuguese and all were coded using NVivo. A sustainability framework guided thematic analysis according to nine domains: strategic planning, organizational capacity, programme adaptation, programme monitoring and evaluation, communications, funding stability, political support, partnerships and public health impact.
RESULTS: Government commitment was high, with the MOH leading a consultative process in Maputo and facilitating successful technical coordination. The MOH made strategic decisions to pay CHWs, authorize their prescribing abilities, foster guidance development, support operational planning and incorporate previously excluded 'old' CHWs. Nonetheless, policy negotiations excluded certain key actors and uncertainty remains about CHW integration into the civil service and their long-term retention. In addition, reliance on NGOs and donor funding has led to geographic distortions in scaling up, alongside challenges in harmonization. Finally, dependence on external funding, when both external and government funding are declining, may hamper sustainability.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis represents a nuanced assessment of the various domains that influence CHW programme sustainability, highlighting strategic areas such as CHW payment and programme financing. These organizational and contextual determinants of sustainability are central to CHW programme strengthening and iCCM policy support."
26516674,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26516674/,"BACKGROUND: Organ procurement organizations (OPOs) are currently evaluated on donation rates and number of organs per donor. However, there is significant variability in market characteristics which affect transplant programs' donor organ acceptance practices and OPOs' ability to successfully place higher risk organs. The impact of transplant market characteristics on OPO performance metrics has not been evaluated.
METHODS: The OPO performance measures were correlated annually with the Herfindahl Hirschman Index, a standard measure of market competition for centers within the OPO donor service areas from 2003 to 2011.
RESULTS: More competitive donor service areas were associated with increased number of donors (P = 0.01) and eligible deaths (P < 0.001). Market competition was associated with increased use of high Donor Risk Index for kidney (P = 0.03) and liver (P = 0.01) allografts. The OPOs with increased competition in liver transplant also were noted to have a higher donor conversion rate (P < 0.001), more donors per million population (P < 0.001), and a higher utilization rate for liver allografts (P = 0.007).
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that proposals to increase district size to increase competition among transplant programs could result in improved organ utilization over time by incentivizing the use of marginal donor organs and increasing access to transplantation."
26516733,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26516733/,"PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: The primary objective of the study was to find out in-hospital mortality in patients undergoing surgery for proximal femoral fracture. The secondary objective was to identify independent predictors of in-hospital mortality.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective single-centre observational study PROXIMORT of patients operated on for isolated proximal femoral fracture at the University Hospital (FN) Brno in the years 2011 and 2012. The 30-day and overall one-year mortality in the study group and the impact of observed parameters on mortality were also assessed. The observed parameters were: patient age and sex, ASA score, time from injury to surgery (hr), daily (7-20 hr) or night (20-7 hr) time of surgery, type of anaesthesia (general vs spinal), initial haemoglobin and haematocrit levels, intra-operative administration of blood products and vasopressors, and erudition of the anaesthesiologist and surgeon. To evaluate the relationship of in-hospital mortality to the observed characteristics, we used univariate logistic regression modelling and odds ratio, using SPSS 22 software (IBM, USA).
RESULTS: Data were obtained from 414 patients and 369 patients were included (male, n = 91; female, n = 278). Due to exclusion criteria, 45 patients were excluded (not an isolated injury). In-hospital mortality was 6.5% (n = 24), 30-day mortality was 8.4% (n = 31) and total mortality of the study group was 35.8% (n = 132). Statistically significant effects on in-hospital mortality included: older age of the patient (p = 0.013), ASA score of 3 or more (p = 0.002) and general anaesthesia administration (p = 0.043). For 30-day mortality, this was older age (p = 0.012), ASA score of 3 and more (p < 0.001), general anaesthesia administration (p < 0.001), lower weight (p = 0.028), lower BMI (p = 0.006) and intra-operative administration of vasopressors (p = 0.023). The influence of other observed parameters on post-operative mortality was not statistically significant.
DISCUSSION: In-hospital mortality in the PROXIMORT study was 6.5% (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.2 to 9.5%), which was significantly higher than in-hospital mortality in unselected surgically treated patients in the Czech Republic, as reported in the EuSOS study (2.3% with 95% CI 0.9 to 3.7%). Administration of general anaesthesia was determined as an independent predictor of in-hospital and 30-day mortality, which was concordant with the results of meta-analysis published by Rodgers et al. and Barbosa et al in 2013. Postponing surgery for perioperative optimisation had no effect on mortality according to the PROXIMORT study. Patorn et al. have supported this conclusion by the results of a selected group of patients with surgery delayed for more than 24 hours; the patients mortality, regardless of anaesthesia, was up to 2.5%.
CONCLUSIONS: The PROXIMORT study identified the higher patient age, ASA score of 3 and more and general anaesthesia administration as independent predictors of in-hospital mortality."

OBJECTIVES: (a) to define the prevalence of indeterminate WB among different populations from Argentina; (b) to evaluate if low proviral load (PVL) is associated with indeterminate WB profiles; and (c) to describe mutations in LTR and tax sequence of these cases.
RESULTS: Among 2031 samples, 294 were reactive by screening. Of them, 48 (16.3%) were WB indeterminate and of those 15 (31.3%) were PCR+. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was performed to 52 HTLV-1+ samples, classified as Group 1 (G1): 25 WB+ samples from individuals with pathologies; Group 2 (G2): 18 WB+ samples from asymptomatic carriers (AC); and Group 3 (G3): 9 seroindeterminate samples from AC. Median PVL was 4.78, 2.38, and 0.15 HTLV-1 copies/100 PBMCs, respectively; a significant difference (p=0.003) was observed. Age and sex were associated with PVL in G1 and G2, respectively. Mutations in the distal and central regions of Tax Responsive Elements (TRE) 1 and 2 of G3 were observed, though not associated with PVL.The 8403A>G mutation of the distal region, previously related to high PVL, was absent in G3 but present in 50% of WB+ samples (p = 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: indeterminate WB results confirmed later as HTLV-1 positive may be associated with low PVL levels. Mutations in LTR and tax are described; their functional relevance remains to be determined."

The distance between the neurovascular bundle (posterior tibial nerve, posterior tibial artery) and the plate was measured at two different positions. The distance to the origin of the flexor digitorum longus muscle and the arch of the soleus muscle was measured.
RESULTS: The mean distance between the neurovascular bundle and the plate amounted 1.4 cm (±0,2 cm; 1.0-1.7 cm) at hole number six and 1.1 cm (±0.4 cm; 0.6-2.0 cm) at hole number ten. The nerve was never directly in contact with the plate. The flexor digitorum longus muscle had its origin along the plate and was between the plate and the neurovascular bundle in all cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Dorsal percutaneous plate insertion is a safe and easy method for osteosyntesis of tiba shaft fractures. Especially in case of poor skin and soft tissue conditions this technique offers a good alternative."
26517001,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26517001/,"INTRODUCTION: Cost containment and surgical inefficiencies are major concerns for hospitals in this era of declining resources. The primary aim of this investigation was to understand subjective perceptions of perioperative spine surgical quality across three practice settings and to identify potential factors contributing to these perceptions. Subsequently, we objectively evaluated factors that influence the duration of time in which the patient is in the operating room (OR) prior to the surgical incision and assessed the influence of fluoroscopy technician expertise on radiation dose and imaging efficiency.
METHODS: One hundred and eight medical device representatives with at least 1 year of OR experience were surveyed at a national conference. Three distinct healthcare facilities were identified: university, small volume, and large volume private hospitals. Respondents rated facilities on a five-point scale for staff quality; size and consistency of surgical teams; and overall likelihood of recommending the facility. Separately, 140 posterior lumbar procedures from two institutions were retrospectively reviewed. Two time periods were quantified for each surgical case: patient arrival in the OR to induction of anesthesia (T1) and induction to surgical incision (T2). T1 and T2 were compared between university and large private hospital settings using t tests and multivariate analysis. For 44 separate lumbar spine surgical procedures, practice setting, patient BMI, number of vertebral levels requiring imaging, number of localizing fluoroscopy images taken, total fluoroscopy time, total radiation dose, fluoroscopy machine, and whether the fluoroscopist could correctly state his or her role, which was to obtain a lateral lumbar localizing image, were recorded. T-tests were used to compare cases in which the fluoroscopist could and could not correctly state the task.
RESULTS: Survey ratings for surgeons were not significantly different across university, large private, and small private hospitals. Fewer circulating nurses were rated as excellent or good in university versus private hospitals (p < 0.001). Small volume private hospital surgical teams were more likely to have worked together before than university teams (p < 0.05), and university teams were larger (p < 0.05). Respondents were more likely to recommend a university or large private hospital for complex instrumentation cases (p < 0.001). On objective measures, university patients were older, less obese, and had higher mean ASA scores (2.5 versus 2.2, p < 0.001). Compared to the university setting, private hospital cases had significantly shorter Time 1 (8 versus 37 min, p < 0.001) and Time 2 (23 versus 30 min, p < 0.001), even after adjusting for ASA score, BMI, and age. Cases in which the fluoroscopist knew the imaging purpose were associated with significantly fewer images (mean 1.8 versus 3.4 images, p < 0.0001) and shorter total exposure times (2.3 versus 4.0 sec, p < 0.001). Operations performed in the university setting were associated with significantly more images (2.7 versus 1.8 images, p < 0.001), longer total exposure times (3.2 versus 2.3 sec, p = 0.0027), and total radiation dose (27.8 versus 53.3 rad, p < 0.001) when compared with those performed in the private setting. The university practice setting was associated with significantly more images (2.7 versus 1.8 images, p < 0.001), longer total exposure times (3.2 versus 2.3 sec, p = 0.003), and total radiation dose (27.8 versus 53.3 rad, p < 0.001) when compared with non-university settings.
CONCLUSION: Large private and university hospitals had higher surgeon ratings. The university setting was associated with larger and less consistent surgical teams and lower nurse ratings. Surgical staff awareness of the procedure and attention to preoperative tasks specific to the procedure reduced pre-operative time spent in the OR as well as fluoroscopy radiation. These data suggest that nurses and support staff make substantial contributions to overall quality of care, and that leadership and interpersonal coordination are especially important within large teams at teaching hospitals."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed in 311 subjects: 211 T2DM patients and 100 without diabetes (controls) in Mubarak Hospital, Kuwait. Patients were categorized into 3 groups: T2DM patients not on insulin (G1, n = 99), T2DM patients on insulin (G2, n = 112) and a nondiabetic control group (G3, n = 100). Plain X-ray of both knees was used to assess the changes of knee OA and graded using the Kellegren-Lawrence scale (0-4) and the Osteoarthritis Research Society International Atlas grading scale (0-3). A total of 622 knee X-rays were evaluated. SPSS version 21.0 was used for data analysis.
RESULTS: A highly significant association (p < 0.0001) was observed for joint space narrowing (JSN) as well as for osteophyte formation between the three groups. Comparing G2 and G3, a highly significant association (p < 0.0001) was retained for JSN [201 (89.7%) vs. 199 (99.5%)] and for osteophyte formation [26 (11.7%) vs. 72 (36.0%)]. Comparing G1 and G2, significantly less osteophyte formation was noted in G2 patients compared to G1 patients [26 (11.7%) vs. 39 (19.7%), p = 0.02]. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the G2 group had less chance of osteophyte formation than either the G1 group or G3 control group (OR = 0.294, p = 0.008 and OR = 0.098, p < 0.001, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Our findings show that T2DM patients with OA knees on insulin therapy have less radiographic osteophytes compared to T2DM patients not on insulin."
26517433,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26517433/,"CONTEXT: Although surgery is widely recognized as the best treatment for palmar hyperhidrosis (PH), the decision to perform a sympathicotomy, sympathectomy, or clipping of the thoracic sympathetic chain is based on surgeon preference.
OBJECTIVE: We investigated the outcomes of patients who underwent surgical intervention for PH with regard to method used and level of sympathetic chain interrupted.
DESIGN: This was a retrospective medical chart review. Patients who underwent thoracoscopic intervention for PH were mailed questionnaires regarding their presenting and postoperative symptoms and satisfaction 6 months to 15 years after their procedure. Analyses were performed to investigate whether the surgical method applied affected these outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 635 patients underwent bilateral thoracoscopic procedures for PH between April 1995 and February 2010, and 210 (33%) responded to the questionnaires. Sixteen surgeons performed 108 sympathicotomies, 83 sympathectomies, and 19 ligations with titanium clips for PH. Mean follow-up was 5.5 years. Overall palmar success was 85.4% and was not affected by the surgical method. The rate of compensatory hyperhidrosis was significantly lower if the operative level did not include the R2 ganglion (66.7% vs 80.6%, p = 0.028). Nevertheless, 76.2% of patients were satisfied with the results, and 85.7% would repeat the procedure if given the option to do it again.
CONCLUSION: Most patients reported relief of their PH and were satisfied with surgical intervention, regardless of method used. Although postoperative compensatory hyperhidrosis was common, this did not appear to affect overall patient satisfaction. The inclusion of rib level 2 ganglion resulted in a significantly increased incidence of compensatory hyperhidrosis."
26517541,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26517541/,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of cognitive impairment (CI) among patients recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (RDD) and to identify any relationships between CI and RDD comorbidities.
METHODS: One thousand seven hundred twelve patients with RDD participated in a cross-sectional study. The patients' sociodemographic and clinical data were registered.
RESULTS: The sample population had an average age of 51 ± 11 years, and 63.26% of the patients were female. CI was diagnosed in 38 patients (2.2%) and was more common among both females (2.8% vs. 1.3%, p = 0.063) and the elderly (0% at an age ≤ 30 years vs. 10.4% at an age > 70 years, p = 0.0001). Rheumatoid arthritis (present in 15.8% vs. absent in 2.1%) and asthma (13% vs. 2.1%) correlated significantly with CI based on the results of our logistic regression analysis.
CONCLUSION: Age, female gender, rheumatoid arthritis and asthma are risk factors for CI in the setting of RDD."
26517543,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26517543/,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patients who receive intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) for ischemic stroke are currently monitored in an intensive care unit (ICU) or a comparable stroke unit for at least 24 hours due to the high frequency of neurological exams and vital sign checks. The present study evaluates ICU needs in patients with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) negative MRI after IV tPA.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed for 209 patients who received IV tPA for acute stroke. Data on stroke risk factors, physiologic parameters, stroke severity, MRI characteristics, and final diagnosis were collected. The timing and nature of ICU interventions, if needed, was recorded. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with subsequent ICU needs.
RESULTS: Patients with cerebral infarct on MRI after tPA had over 9 times higher odds of requiring ICU care compared to patients with DWI negative MRI (OR 9.2, 95% CI 2.49-34.15). All DWI negative patients requiring ICU care did so by the end of tPA infusion (p = 0.006). Among patients with DWI negative MRI, need for ICU interventions was associated with higher NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores (p<0.001), uncontrolled hypertension (p<0.001), seizure at onset (p = 0.002), and reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (p = 0.010).
CONCLUSIONS: Only a small number of DWI negative patients required ICU care. In patients without critical care needs by the end of thrombolysis, post-tPA MRI may be considered for triaging DWI negative patients to a less resource intense monitoring environment."
