The lace plant (Aponogeton madagascariensis) produces perforations in its leaves through PCD. The leaves of the plant consist of a latticework of longitudinal and transverse veins enclosing areoles. PCD occurs in the cells at the center of these areoles and progresses outwards, stopping approximately five cells from the vasculature. The role of mitochondria during PCD has been recognized in animals; however, it has been less studied during PCD in plants. The following paper elucidates the role of mitochondrial dynamics during developmentally regulated PCD in vivo in A. madagascariensis. A single areole within a window stage leaf (PCD is occurring) was divided into three areas based on the progression of PCD; cells that will not undergo PCD (NPCD), cells in early stages of PCD (EPCD), and cells in late stages of PCD (LPCD). Window stage leaves were stained with the mitochondrial dye MitoTracker Red CMXRos and examined. Mitochondrial dynamics were delineated into four categories (M1-M4) based on characteristics including distribution, motility, and membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m). A TUNEL assay showed fragmented nDNA in a gradient over these mitochondrial stages. Chloroplasts and transvacuolar strands were also examined using live cell imaging. The possible importance of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) formation during PCD was indirectly examined via in vivo cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment. This treatment resulted in lace plant leaves with a significantly lower number of perforations compared to controls, and that displayed mitochondrial dynamics similar to that of non-PCD cells. Results depicted mitochondrial dynamics in vivo as PCD progresses within the lace plant, and highlight the correlation of this organelle with other organelles during developmental PCD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of mitochondria and chloroplasts moving on transvacuolar strands to form a ring structure surrounding the nucleus during developmental PCD. Also, for the first time, we have shown the feasibility for the use of CsA in a whole plant system. Overall, our findings implicate the mitochondria as playing a critical and early role in developmentally regulated PCD in the lace plant.\n \nThe hypothesis was tested that pectin content and methylation degree participate in regulation of cell wall mechanical properties and in this way may affect tissue growth and freezing resistance over the course of plant cold acclimation and de-acclimation. Experiments were carried on the leaves of two double-haploid lines of winter oil-seed rape (Brassica napus subsp. oleifera), differing in winter survival and resistance to blackleg fungus (Leptosphaeria maculans). Plant acclimation in the cold (2 degrees C) brought about retardation of leaf expansion, concomitant with development of freezing resistance. These effects were associated with the increases in leaf tensile stiffness, cell wall and pectin contents, pectin methylesterase (EC 3.1.1.11) activity and the low-methylated pectin content, independently of the genotype studied. However, the cold-induced modifications in the cell wall properties were more pronounced in the leaves of the more pathogen-resistant genotype. De-acclimation promoted leaf expansion and reversed most of the cold-induced effects, with the exception of pectin methylesterase activity. The results show that the temperature-dependent modifications in pectin content and their methyl esterification degree correlate with changes in tensile strength of a leaf tissue, and in this way affect leaf expansion ability and its resistance to freezing and to fungus pathogens.\n"}]}]}}

The ability to recognize different optotypes differs even if their critical details appear under the same visual angle. Since optotypes are evaluated on individuals with good visual acuity and without eye disorders, differences in the lower visual acuity range cannot be excluded. In this study, visual acuity measured with the Snellen E was compared to the Landolt C acuity. 100 patients (age 8 - 90 years, median 60.5 years) with various eye disorders, among them 39 with amblyopia due to strabismus, and 13 healthy volunteers were tested. Charts with the Snellen E and the Landolt C (Precision Vision) which mimic the ETDRS charts were used to assess visual acuity. Three out of 5 optotypes per line had to be correctly identified, while wrong answers were monitored. In the group of patients, the eyes with the lower visual acuity, and the right eyes of the healthy subjects, were evaluated. Differences between Landolt C acuity (LR) and Snellen E acuity (SE) were small. The mean decimal values for LR and SE were 0.25 and 0.29 in the entire group and 0.14 and 0.16 for the eyes with strabismus amblyopia. The mean difference between LR and SE was 0.55 lines in the entire group and 0.55 lines for the eyes with strabismus amblyopia, with higher values of SE in both groups. The results of the other groups were similar with only small differences between LR and SE. Using the charts described, there was only a slight overestimation of visual acuity by the Snellen E compared to the Landolt C, even in strabismus amblyopia. Small differences in the lower visual acuity range have to be considered.\n \nPrevious studies have indicated that propofol anaesthesia may reduce the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting after strabismus surgery in children. This study was designed to investigate the incidence of vomiting after strabismus surgery at two different levels of propofol anaesthesia compared to thiopental/isoflurane anaesthesia. Ninety ASA class I or II children, aged 5-14 yrs were randomly assigned to one of three groups There were no differences between study groups with respect to age, weight, history of previous anaesthesia or emesis after previous anaesthesia, duration of anaesthesia, surgery or sleep after anaesthesia, or number of muscles operated. The incidence of vomiting was 37%, 29% and 28% in groups T/I, P5 and P10, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences between the three groups in the incidence of vomiting. The median age of patients who vomited was 7.5 (range 5.0-13.7) yrs while the median age of the patients who did not vomit was 9.1 (range 5.0-14.0) yrs (P < 0.01). In the present study, propofol anaesthesia compared to thiopental/isoflurane anaesthesia did not reduce the incidence of vomiting following strabismus surgery in children.\n"}]}]}}

However, few data are available to assess the adequacy of the use of drugs and its influence on the control of asthma in 'real life'. The adequacy of the current use of anti-asthmatic medication according to the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines was assessed in a random sample of 400 asthmatics identified in the frame of the Italian Study on Asthma in Young Adults. Asthma severity was assessed using the GINA criteria; accordingly, a patient was classified as receiving inadequate treatment if his/her current use of drugs was lower than that suggested by the guidelines for the corresponding severity level. The absence of asthma attacks in the last 3 months was used as an indicator of the disease control. Fifty-five percent of the patients had persistent asthma. Overall, 48% (95% CI 41.2-54.8) of persistent asthmatics were receiving inadequate treatment, and 66% (95% CI 59.5-72.4) had not used their medication daily over the past 3 months. Persistent asthmatics who were inadequately treated had a significantly greater frequency of asthma attacks (geometric mean ratio 3.7; 95% CI 2.1-6.6) than those using an adequate dose of medication. Mild and moderate persistent asthmatics using an adequate medication regimen reported a low number of asthma attacks (median 0). At the multivariate analysis, a good control of the disease was positively associated with an adequate dose of anti-inflammatory medication (OR = 2.2; 95% CI 1.1-4.5) and was negatively associated with a later onset of asthma (OR = 0.96; 95% CI 0.93-0.99) and severe asthma (OR = 0.37; 95% CI 0.17-0.81). Despite the increase in the use of inhaled corticosteroids, half of the persistent asthmatics from the general population are using a medication regimen below their severity level. When the use of drugs follows the GINA guideline recommendations, a good control of asthma is also achievable in the daily management of the disease, particularly in the case of mild and moderate asthmatics.\n \nPassive smoking is a major cause of respiratory morbidity in children. However, few studies give accurate estimates of the health effects of passive smoking in children with asthma using an objective measure of exposure. The effects of passive smoking using salivary cotinine levels to measure exposure were investigated. A sample of 438 children aged 2-12 years with asthma who had a parent who smoked were recruited in Tayside and Fife, Scotland. Health service contacts for asthma, assessed from GP case records, were used as a proxy for morbidity. A weak U-shaped relationship was found between the salivary cotinine level and health service contacts for asthma High levels of parental smoking in the home are associated with a reduction in health care contacts for asthma. This could be due to a lack of awareness of asthma symptoms among heavy smokers or a reluctance to visit the GP. Children with asthma who have parents who smoke heavily may not be receiving adequate management.\n"}]}]}}

The medical notes of patients with CP younger than 16 years admitted with airway obstruction to a tertiary referral Pediatric Otolaryngology Center from 2006 to 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. The gender, age of referral, co-morbidities, type of surgical intervention and age this was performed and the time interval between sequential surgeries were documented. Fifteen children with CP and airway obstruction were admitted, eight boys and seven girls with an average age of referral 8 years (range 3-13.3 years). Adenotonsillectomy was performed in 11/15 patients at a mean age of 9.1 years (range 4.5-14 years). Tracheostomy was performed in 8/15 children at an average age of 11.6 years (range 7.5-15 years). Seven out of 11 patients having undergone adenotonsillectomy, required tracheostomy after an average time interval of 1.9 years (range 0.5-3.5 years). Tracheostomy was performed in 80% of referred patients with CP older than 10 years, while surgical intervention was uncommon in children younger than 5 years. There was a statistically significant correlation between the age of the children and the performance of a tracheostomy (Pearson's correlation coefficient 0.68, p = 0.005). The severity of the airway obstruction in children with CP tends to increase with age. We postulate that this increase results from worsening hypotonia of pharyngeal musculature. Children with CP and severe upper airway obstruction are likely to require tracheostomy as they grow older.\n \nThe transanal endorectal pull-through (TERPT) is becoming the most popular procedure in the treatment of Hirschsprung disease (HD), but overstretching of the anal sphincters remains a critical issue that may impact the continence. This study examined the long-term outcome of TERPT versus conventional transabdominal (ABD) pull-through for HD. Records of 41 patients more than 3 years old who underwent a pull-through for HD (TERPT, n = 20; ABD, n = 21) were reviewed, and their families were thoroughly interviewed and scored via a 15-item post-pull-through long-term outcome questionnaire. Patients were operated on between the years 1995 and 2003. During this time, our group transitioned from the ABD to the TERPT technique. Total scoring ranged from 0 to 40 Overall scores were similar. However, continence score was significantly better in the ABD group, and the stool pattern score was better in the TERPT group. A significant difference in age at interview between the 2 groups was noted; we therefore reanalyzed the data controlling for age, and this showed that age did not significantly affect the long-term scoring outcome between groups. Our long-term study showed significantly better (2-fold) results regarding the continence score for the abdominal approach compared with the transanal pull-through. The stool pattern and enterocolitis scores were somewhat better for the TERPT group. These findings raise an important issue about the current surgical management of HD; however, more cases will need to be studied before a definitive conclusion can be drawn.\n"}]}]}}

Relatively little attention has been paid to whether the sex of the physician affects the rates of cancer screening among women. We examined differences between male and female physicians in the frequency of screening mammograms and Pap smears among women patients enrolled in a large Midwestern health plan. We identified claims for mammography and Pap tests submitted by primary care physicians for 97,962 women, 18 to 75 years of age, who were enrolled in the health plan in 1990. The sex of the physician was manually coded, and the physician's age was obtained from the state licensing board. After identifying a principal physician for each woman, we calculated the frequency of mammography and Pap smears for each physician, using the number of women in his or her practice during 1990 as the denominator. Using unconditional logistic regression, we also calculated the odds ratio of having a Pap smear or mammogram for women patients with female physicians as compared with those with male physicians, controlling for the physician's and the patient's age. Crude rates for Pap smears and mammography were higher for the patients of female than male physicians in most age groups of physicians. The largest differences between female and male physicians were in the rates of Pap smears among the youngest physicians. For the subgroup of women enrolled in the health plan for a year who saw only one physician, after adjustment for the patient's age and the physician's age and specialty, the odds ratio for having a Pap smear was 1.99 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.72 to 2.30) for the patients of female physicians as compared with those of male physicians. For women 40 years old and older, the odds ratio for having a mammogram was 1.41 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.22 to 1.63). For both Pap smears and mammography, the differences between female and male physicians in screening rates were much more pronounced in internal medicine and family practice than in obstetrics and gynecology. Women are more likely to undergo screening with Pap smears and mammograms if they see female rather than male physicians, particularly if the physician is an internist or family practitioner.\n \nThe 2 objectives were An evaluation of a nonrandomized practice improvement intervention. Women eligible for mammography (n = 298) who did not respond to 2 reminder letters were contacted via telephone by a navigator who offered scheduling assistance for mammography screening. The patient navigator scheduled appointments, documented the number of calls, and confirmed completed mammograms in the electronic health record, as well as estimated the time for calls and chart review. Of the 188 participants reached by phone, 112 (59%) scheduled appointments using the patient navigator, 35 (19%) scheduled their own appointments independently prior to the call, and 41 (22%) declined. As a result of the telephone intervention, 78 of the 188 women reached (41%) received a mammogram; also, all 35 women who had independently scheduled a mammogram received one. Chart documentation confirmed that 113 (38%) of the cohort of 298 women completed a mammogram. The estimated time burden for the entire project was 55 hours and 33 minutes, including calling patients, scheduling appointments, and chart review. A patient navigator can increase mammography adherence in a previously nonadherent population by making the screening appointment while the patient is on the phone.\n"}]}]}}

Multivariate regression analysis showed that oxLDL independently influences IMT in DM1 patients (\u03b2=0.454, R2=0.35). Further, positive correlations between oxLDL value and LDL-C concentration (r=0.585, p<0.05, n=70) and between oxLDL level and apo-B concentration have been established (r=0.610, p<0.05, n=70). Moreover, patients with chronic microvascular complications showed a higher value of IMT in comparison with patients without them (p=0.003). Our results provide the evidence that oxLDL accelerates atherosclerotic plaque formation and may contribute to the development of microvascular complications in DM1.\n \nThe aim of our study was to explore the changes in common carotid arterial intima-media thickness (CCA IMT) and local arterial stiffness to evaluate, non-invasively, early vascular disease in patients with cardiovascular (CV) risk factors and \"normal\" carotid IMT (<0.9 mm). We studied 50 patients (mean age 42 years\u00b114), with no history of cardio-cerebrovascular events and \"normal\" IMT. We assessed the traditional cardiovascular risk factors, the CCA IMT, and the local stiffness with Quality Arterial Stiffness technology, based on Radio frequency signal (RFQAS-ESAOTE, Italy). CCA distensibility coefficient (DC), compliance coefficient (CC), pulse wave velocity (PWV) and \u03b2 parameter were measured in patients, with and without traditional cardiovascular risk factors. 25 subjects with risk factors (mean age 49\u00b113) were compared with 25 controls (mean age 36\u00b112). We did not find any significant differences in the IMT measurement between subjects with CV risk factors compared to controls (0.530\u00b10.99 mm vs. 0.626\u00b10.127 mm; P=5.68). The mean DC (0.030\u00b10.014 1/kPa vs. 0.0221\u00b10.016 1/kPa; P<0.05) and CC (1.087\u00b10.47 mm\u00b2/kPA vs. 0.864\u00b10.41 mm\u00b2/kPA; P<0.05), were significantly lower, while PWV (6.21\u00b11.74 m/s vs. 7.68\u00b12.07 m/s; P<0.05) and \u03b2 (7.67\u00b14.09 m/s vs. 10.45\u00b15.58 m/s; P<0.05) were significantly higher in subjects with CV risk factors. ROC curves showed that PWV>6.05 m/s better identified, among patients with IMT <0.9 mm, those with cardiovascular risk factors (sensitivity 82.0% specificity 62.0%; AUC 0.73). Increased stiffness is a result of change both in quantity and quality of the arterial wall. Arterial functional changes and distention alterations may herald the onset of vascular disease before manifestation of symptoms or detection of preclinical atherosclerotic lesions.\n"}]}]}}

Fifty patients were recruited from a forensic hospital and 29 from a general psychiatric hospital. In the weeks preceding discharge, structured assessments of the future risk of violent behaviour were completed using the HCR-20. There was little difference in the risk presented by the two groups. Forensic patients presented an elevated risk of violence because of historical factors, while the risk among patients from general psychiatry was due to clinical symptoms. Some criminal offences could be prevented if more time and effort were spent in general psychiatric practice in identifying patients at high risk for violence and in reducing symptoms of psychoses before discharge.\n"}]}]}}

To maintain safe and independent transport, mobility is important for all individuals, but especially for older drivers. The objective of this study was to investigate whether automatic transmission, compared with manual transmission, may improve the driving behavior of older drivers. In total, 31 older drivers (mean age 75.2 years) and 32 younger drivers - used as a control group (mean age 39.2 years) - were assessed twice on the same fixed route; once in a car with manual transmission and once in a car with automatic transmission. The cars were otherwise identical. The driving behavior was assessed with the Ryd On-Road Assessment driving protocol. Time to completion of left turns (right-hand side driving) and the impact of a distraction task were measured. The older group had more driving errors than the younger group, in both the manual and the automatic transmission car. However, and contrary to the younger drivers, automatic transmission improved the older participants' driving behavior as demonstrated by safer speed adjustment in urban areas, greater maneuvering skills, safer lane position and driving in accordance with the speed regulations. Switching to automatic transmission may be recommended for older drivers as a means to maintain safe driving and thereby the quality of their transport mobility.\n \nESC (Electronic Stability Control) is a crash avoidance technology that reduces the likelihood of collisions involving loss of control. Although past and emerging research indicates that ESC is effective in reducing collision rates and saving lives, and its inclusion in all vehicle platforms is encouraged, drivers may demonstrate behavioral adaptation or an overreliance on ESC that could offset or reduce its overall effectiveness. The main objective of the present study was to determine whether behavioral adaptation to ESC is likely to occur upon the widespread introduction of ESC into the Canadian vehicle fleet. Secondary objectives were to confirm the results of a previous ESC public survey and to generate a baseline measure for the future assessment of planned and ongoing ESC promotional activities in Canada. Two separate telephone surveys evaluated drivers' perceptions and awareness of ESC. The first surveyed 500 randomly selected owners/drivers of passenger vehicles. The second surveyed 1017 owners/drivers of 2006-2008 ESC-equipped passenger vehicles from the provinces of Quebec and British Columbia, Canada. Though ESC drivers were much more likely than drivers of other vehicles to be aware of ESC (77% vs. 39%) and that their own vehicle was equipped with it (63% vs. 8%), 23 percent had never heard of it. Ninety percent of drivers who knew that their vehicle was equipped with ESC believed that ESC had made it safer to drive and reported being confident that ESC would work in an emergency. Twenty-three percent of ESC owners who knew their vehicle had ESC reported noticing long-lasting changes in their driving behavior since they began driving the vehicle. Collectively, results suggest that behavioral adaptation to ESC is likely in certain drivers; however, its proven effectiveness in reducing the likelihood of being involved in a serious crash probably outweighs any potential increases in unsafe driving. To fully benefit from ESC, vehicle manufacturers are encouraged to market ESC-equipped vehicles in a realistic, safe manner. Driver training and safety organizations are also encouraged to provide balanced educational information about ESC to their members.\n"}]}]}}

We performed a 6-year (2006 to 2011) retrospective review of all trauma patients with blunt abdominal solid organ injuries. Patients were matched using propensity score matching in a 2:1:1 (early:intermediate:late) for age, gender, systolic blood pressure, Glasgow Coma Scale, Injury Severity Score, and type and grade of organs injured. Our primary outcome measures were A total of 116 patients (58 early, 29 intermediate, and 29 late) were included.

We investigated the role of routine laboratory parameters in distinguishing NASH from ASH. Liver biopsies performed at our hospital over a 10-year period were reviewed, 95 patients with steatohepatitis identified and their data prior to biopsy reevaluated. The diagnosis NASH or ASH was assigned (other liver diseases excluded) on the basis of the biopsy and history of alcohol consumption (< 140 g/week). Logistic regression models were used for analysis. NASH was diagnosed in 58 patients (61%; 30 f) and ASH in 37 (39%; 9 f). High-grade fibrosis (59% vs. 19%, P < 0.0001) and an AST/ALT ratio > 1 (54.1% vs 20.7%, P = 0.0008) were more common in ASH. The MCV was elevated in 53% of ASH patients and normal in all NASH patients (P < 0.0001). Multivariate analysis identified the MCV (P = 0.0013), the AST/ALT ratio (P = 0.011) and sex (P = 0.0029) as relevant regressors (aROC = 0.92). The AST/ALT ratio (P < 0.0001) and age (P = 0.00049) were independent predictors of high-grade fibrosis. Differences in MCV were more marked in high-grade fibrosis. Higher MCVs and AST/ALT ratios in ASH reflect the severity of underlying liver disease and do not differentiate NASH from ASH. Instead, these biomarkers might prove useful in guiding selection of patients for liver biopsy and in targeting therapy.\n \nThyroid hormones play an important role in the regulation of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, both of which are affected in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Anecdotally, we have observed that a number of patients with NASH carried a diagnosis of hypothyroidism. However, it is unknown if thyroid dysfunction plays any role in the pathogenesis of NASH. To further investigate this observation, we conducted a case-control study to determine the association between hypothyroidism and NASH. Cases were defined as patients with well-documented NASH attending hepatology clinics at Indiana University Hospital from January 1, 1995 to December 31, 2000. Age, gender, race, and body-weight matched individuals seen during the same period in the general medical clinics served as controls. Patients with a previous diagnosis of hypothyroidism who are currently on synthetic T4 replacement were considered to be \"hypothyroid\". The strength of association was assessed by logistic regression analysis after controlling for the frequency of diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. One hundred seventy-four patients with NASH (cases) and 442 controls were included. The mean age of cohort was 49 +/- 13 years, 59% were female, and 98% were white. The prevalence of hypothyroidism in patients with NASH was 15% was significantly higher than in the controls (7.2%, P < 0.001). By multivariate analysis, the prevalence of hypothyroidism in the NASH group was significantly higher than in control group (OR These data suggest that hypothyroidism is associated with human NASH.

One of the municipalities was selected for the validation study. The health survey 1984-86 addressed all inhabitants > or = 20 years of age in Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag county, Norway; 76,885 (90.3%) of the eligible population participated in answering the question on diabetes. All inhabitants in the municipality answering \"yes\" to the question on diabetes (n = 169) and the persons with the same sex born closest before and after each diabetic patient and answering \"no\" to the diabetes question (n = 338) were included. A very thorough search was made in the medical files of the general practitioners in the municipality for corresponding information. Compared to the files, diabetes was verified in 163 out of the 169. The commonest cause of discrepancy was renal glycosuria. One out of the 338 registered non-diabetic persons was found to have diabetes. Diabetic patients tended to overestimate diabetes duration significantly. Insulin treatment was verified in 19/20 (95%) and treatment with oral hypoglycaemic agents in all 44 with an affirmative questionnaire answer. A negative answer on insulin and oral hypoglycaemic agents was verified in 100% and 99% respectively.

The aim of this study was to compare quality of life related to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in patients who underwent intra-thoracic stomach repair with and without fundoplication. We proposed that the group without a fundoplication would have poorer quality of life due to continued symptoms. All patients undergoing foregut surgery at the Creighton University Esophageal Center are entered in a prospectively maintained database. The database was queried to identify patients who underwent surgery for a near complete (>75\u00a0% of stomach in chest) intra-thoracic stomach with gastric volvulus between 2004 and 2013. A questionnaire was derived from the Quality of Life in Reflux and Dyspepsia and Frequency Scale for Symptoms of GERD questionnaires to assess for symptoms related to reflux, and this questionnaire was administered by phone. A total of 150 patients underwent repair of ITS\u00a0during the study period. A total of 109 patients had ITS repair with fundoplication, while 41 had only ITS repair. Follow-up was available in 54\u00a0% of patients in the fundoplication group (median follow-up of 5.2\u00a0years) and in 49\u00a0% of patients in the non-fundoplication group (median follow-up of 4\u00a0years). Significantly, more patients woke up at night (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and found themselves coughing around mealtime (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) in the fundoplication group. Patients in the non-fundoplication group had significantly more daytime reflux (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). Despite these symptoms, only one patient in the fundoplication group and no patients in the non-fundoplication group admitted that these symptoms were severe enough to severely affect their quality of life. All other patients contacted felt satisfied, and >80\u00a0% rated their quality of life as either good or excellent.

Basal radial artery diameter, the number of catheters used during TRCAG, and the pain perceived during the procedure seem to be important predictors of vascular functional changes after TRCAG.\n \nIn order to perform euglycaemic clamp studies in Type 2 diabetic patients, plasma glucose must be reduced to normal levels. This can be done either (i) acutely during the clamp study using high-dose insulin infusion, or (ii) slowly overnight preceding the clamp study using a low-dose insulin infusion. We assessed whether the choice of either of these methods to obtain euglycaemia biases subsequent assessment of glucose metabolism and insulin action. We studied seven obese Type 2 diabetic patients twice Basal plasma glucose levels (mean +/- sd) were 5.5 +/- 0.5 and 10.7 +/- 2.9 mmol/l in the + ON and - ON studies, respectively, and were clamped at -5.5 mmol/l. Basal rates of glucose production (GP) were similar in the + ON and - ON studies, 83 +/- 13 vs. 85 +/- 14 mg m-2 min-1 (NS), whereas basal rates of glucose disappearance (Rd) were lower in the + ON than in the - ON study, 84 +/- 8 vs. 91 +/- 11 mg m-2 min-1 (P = 0.02). During insulin infusion in the clamp period, rates of GP, 23 +/- 11 vs. 25 +/- 10 mg m-2 min-1, as well as rates of Rd, 133 +/- 32 vs. 139 +/- 37 mg m-2 min-1, were similar in the + ON and - ON studies, respectively (NS). Apart from basal rates of Rd, assessment of glucose turnover rates in euglycaemic clamp studies of Type 2 diabetic patients is not dependent on the method by which plasma glucose levels are lowered.\n"}]}]}}

Most children who do not undergo transplant are reported to have chronic liver disease and its complications. The aim of this single-center study was to identify children with normal laboratory indices and no clinical evidence of chronic liver disease 10 or more years after Kasai portoenterostomy (KP). A retrospective analysis of the medical notes of all children surgically treated at the authors' center between 1979 and 1991 was undertaken. Criteria for inclusion were absence of surgical complications, unremarkable clinical examination, and normal bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, albumin, international normalized prothrombin ratio, and platelet count. Of 244 children surgically treated during the observation period, the authors identified 28 (11%) adolescents (14 male) who fulfilled the entry criteria. Their median age was 13.4 years (range, 10.2-22.2 years). Twenty-six with type 3 EHBA had conventional KP, whereas 2 underwent modified operations. The corrective surgery was performed at a median age of 58 days (range, 20-99 days). Median time of complete clearance of jaundice from the date of KP was 75 days (range, 21-339 days). Twelve (43%) patients had history of cholangitis at a median age of 3.4 years. The liver histologic findings were suggestive of mild to moderate fibrosis in 54.2% and cirrhosis in 40.7% of the patients who underwent biopsy. No child had gastrointestinal bleeding during follow-up. Thirteen (46%) patients had an elective esophagogastroduodenoscopy, which was normal in all. Twenty-six (93%) patients were in mainstream education, whereas the remaining two (7%) attended special school because of reasons unrelated to liver disease. A sizable proportion of children with EHBA avoid significant chronic liver disease and its complications 10 years or more after conventional surgical correction and have an excellent quality of life. Their good outcome is not hampered by isolated episodes of ascending cholangitis. Whether or not the residual histologic damage will become symptomatic during their lifetime remains to be established.\n \nTo assess and compare the value of split-liver transplantation (SLT) and living-related liver transplantation (LRT). The concept of SLT results from the development of reduced-size transplantation. A further development of SLT, the in situ split technique, is derived from LRT, which itself marks the optimized outcome in terms of postoperative graft function and survival. The combination of SLT and LRT has abolished deaths on the waiting list, thus raising the question whether living donor liver transplantation is still necessary. Outcomes and postoperative liver function of 43 primary LRT patients were compared with those of 49 primary SLT patients (14 ex situ, 35 in situ) with known graft weight performed between April 1996 and December 2000. Survival rates were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. After a median follow-up of 35 months, actual patient survival rates were 82% in the SLT group and 88% in the LRT group. Actual graft survival rates were 76% and 81%, respectively. The incidence of primary nonfunction was 12% in the SLT group and 2.3% in the LRT group. Liver function parameters (prothrombin time, factor V, bilirubin clearance) and surgical complication rates did not differ significantly. In the SLT group, mean cold ischemic time was longer than in the LRT group. Serum values of alanine aminotransferase during the first postoperative week were significantly higher in the SLT group. In the LRT group, there were more grafts with signs of fatty degeneration than in the SLT group. The short- and long-term outcomes after LRT and SLT did not differ significantly. To avoid the risk for the donor in LRT, SLT represents the first-line therapy in pediatric liver transplantation in countries where cadaveric organs are available. LRT provides a solution for urgent cases in which a cadaveric graft cannot be found in time or if the choice of the optimal time point for transplantation is vital.\n"}]}]}}

The roles of attitudes toward contraception, pregnancy and fertility remain relatively unexplored. Knowledge of contraceptive methods and attitudes about contraception, pregnancy, childbearing and fertility were assessed among 602 unmarried women aged 18-29 at risk for unintended pregnancy who participated in the 2009 National Survey of Reproductive and Contraceptive Knowledge. The contribution of attitudes to racial and ethnic disparities in effective method use was assessed via mediation analysis, using a series of regression models. Blacks and Latinas were more likely than whites to believe that the government encourages contraceptive use to limit minority populations (odds ratio, 2.5 for each). Compared with white women, Latinas held more favorable attitudes toward pregnancy (2.5) and childbearing (coefficient, 0.3) and were more fatalistic about the timing of pregnancy (odds ratio, 2.3); blacks were more fatalistic about life in general (2.0). Only one attitude, skepticism that the government ensures contraceptive safety, was associated with contraceptive use (0.7), but this belief did not differ by race or ethnicity. Although blacks and Latinas used less effective methods than whites (0.3 and 0.4, respectively), attitudes did not explain disparities. Lower contraceptive knowledge partially explained Latinas' use of less effective methods. Providing basic information about effective methods might help to decrease ethnic disparities in use. Research should examine other variables that might account for these disparities, including health system characteristics and provider behavior.\n"}]}]}}

In the current study we evaluated the association of direct ipsilateral adrenal invasion with outcome to determine if reclassification of these tumors as pT4 would improve the accuracy of the current tumor classification. We studied 424 patients who underwent nephrectomy and adrenalectomy for unilateral, sporadic, pT3 or pT4 RCC between 1970 and 2000 at the Mayo Clinic. Cancer specific survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cancer specific survival for the 22 patients with pT3a or pT3b tumors that directly invaded the ipsilateral adrenal gland was significantly worse compared with that of patients with pT3a (p <0.001) or pT3b (p = 0.011) disease that did not invade the adrenal gland. There was no significant difference in the 5-year cancer specific survival between the patients with pT3a or pT3b tumors that directly invaded the ipsilateral adrenal gland and patients with pT4 tumors (cancer specific survival rates of 20% and 14%, respectively, p = 0.490). Although rare, RCC with direct ipsilateral adrenal invasion behaves more aggressively than tumors involving perinephric or renal sinus fat. We believe that RCC tumors with direct adrenal invasion should be classified as pT4.\n \nTo determine the value of ipsilateral adrenalectomy with radical nephrectomy, by investigating the clinical aspects of adrenal involvement and adrenocortical function in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The demographic, clinical and pathological data of adrenal involvement were reviewed in 247 patients with RCC. To evaluate adrenocortical function, 14 patients (adrenalectomy in eight, adrenal-sparing in six) had a rapid adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test before and 2 weeks after surgery. There was adrenal involvement with RCC in seven of the 247 (2.8%) patients (a solitary adrenal metastatic tumour in four and direct extension into the adrenal gland in three). All adrenal involvement was detectable on abdominal computed tomography before surgery, and these patients had a large primary renal tumour of > pT2 and/or distant metastasis. Plasma cortisol levels declined significantly more in response to the rapid ACTH stimulation test in those treated by adrenalectomy than in those with spared adrenal glands at 2 weeks after surgery (P < 0.05), while there was no significant difference between the groups before surgery. These results suggest that unconditional ipsilateral adrenalectomy with radical nephrectomy for RCC should be avoidable, and thus preserve the reserve of adrenocortical function, as preoperative imaging, especially thin-slice multidetector helical computed tomography, can detect adrenal involvement with RCC in most cases. Unilateral adrenalectomy might cause an irreversible impairment of the reserve of adrenocortical function.\n"}]}]}}

Data were drawn from the Ghana Demographic and Health Survey, a nationally representative survey collected in 2008. The study used a cross-sectional design to examine the independent effects of NHIS enrolment on two dependent variables (frequency and timing of antenatal visits) among 1610 Ghanaian women. Negative binomial and logit models were fitted given that count and categorical variables were employed as outcome measures, respectively. Regardless of socio-economic and demographic factors, women enrolled in the NHIS make more antenatal visits compared with those not enrolled; however, there was no statistical association with the timing of the crucial first visit. Women who are educated, living in urban areas and are wealthy were more likely to attend antenatal care than those living in rural areas, uneducated and from poorer households. The NHIS should be strengthened and resourced as it may act as an important tool for increasing antenatal care attendance among women in Ghana.\n \nThe burden of maternal mortality in sub-Saharan Africa is very high. In Ghana maternal mortality ratio was 380 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2013. Skilled birth attendance has been shown to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity, yet in 2010 only 68 percent of mothers in Ghana gave birth with the assistance of skilled birth attendants. In 2005, the Ghana Health Service piloted a strategy that involved using the integrated Community-based Health Planning and Services (CHPS) program and training Community Health Officers (CHOs) as midwives to address the gap in skilled attendance in rural Upper East Region (UER). The study assesses the feasibility of and extent to which the skilled delivery program has been implemented as an integrated component of the existing CHPS, and documents the benefits and challenges of the integrated program. We employed an intrinsic case study design with a qualitative methodology. We conducted 41 in-depth interviews with health professionals and community stakeholders. We used a purposive sampling technique to identify and interview our respondents. The CHO-midwives provide integrated services that include skilled delivery in CHPS zones. The midwives collaborate with District Assemblies, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and communities to offer skilled delivery services in rural communities. They refer pregnant women with complications to district hospitals and health centers for care, and there has been observed improvement in the referral system. Stakeholders reported community members' access to skilled attendants at birth, health education, antenatal attendance and postnatal care in rural communities. The CHO-midwives are provided with financial and non-financial incentives to motivate them for optimal work performance. The primary challenges that remain include inadequate numbers of CHO-midwives, insufficient transportation, and infrastructure weaknesses. Our study demonstrates that CHOs can successfully be trained as midwives and deployed to provide skilled delivery services at the doorsteps of rural households. The integration of the skilled delivery program with the CHPS program appears to be an effective model for improving access to skilled birth attendance in rural communities of the UER of Ghana.\n"}]}]}}

These incidents often result in Hospital Multiple Casualty Incidents (HMCI), which are very challenging to hospital teams. 15 years ago the Emergency and Disaster Medicine Division in the Israeli Ministry of Health defined a key of 20 percent of each hospital's bed capacity as its readiness for multiple casualties. Half of those casualties are expected to require immediate medical treatment. This study was performed to evaluate the efficacy of the current readiness guidelines based on the epidemiology of encountered HMCIs. A retrospective study of HMCIs was recorded in the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) home front command and the Israeli National Trauma Registry (ITR) between November 2000 and June 2003. An HMCI is defined by the Emergency and Disaster Medicine Division in the Israeli Ministry of Health as >or=10 casualties or >or=4 suffering from injuries with an ISS>or=16 arriving to a single hospital. The study includes a total of 32 attacks, resulting in 62 HMCIs and 1292 casualties. The mean number of arriving casualties to a single hospital was 20.8+/-13.3 (range 4-56, median 16.5). In 95% of the HMCIs the casualty load was <or=52. Based on severity scores and ED discharges 1022 (79.2%) casualties did not necessitate immediate medical treatment. Hospital preparedness can be better defined by a fixed number of casualties rather than a percentile of its bed capacity. Only 20% of the arriving casualties will require immediate medical treatment. Implementation of this concept may improve the utilisation of national emergency health resources both in the preparation phase and on real time.\n \nBased on comparative analyses of the precision as well as reliability of the diagnostic results on fine-needle vasography (FNV) and transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) in the diagnosis of patients who were suspected of having ejaculatory duct obstruction (EDO), this paper aims to demonstrate whether or not FNV techniques still constitute the backbone of diagnostic imaging used in obstructive azoospermia of EDO. From July 2005 to December 2008, opening fine-needle punctuation and vasography were performed under local anesthesia in 37 infertile male patients in our center, all of whom were suspected of having bilateral EDO. The diagnostic criteria of these infertile males included characteristic changes of TRUS and/or characteristic changes of semen analysis. Comparative analyses were made of the diagnostic results of the two methods. In the 37 male patients, 19 (51.35%) had been confirmed with pathognomonic findings of both semen analyses and TRUS on complete EDO. Of the others, 18 patients (48.65%) testified with only pathognomonic findings of TRUS but not the typical characteristics on semen analyses. When compared with diagnostic results via FNV however, there were only 5 patients (13.51%) who could be confirmed as having bilateral EDO, 16/37 showed obstruction of the epididymis and proximal vas deferens, 7/37 showed bilateral vasal multiple obstruction, 2 showed unilateral EDO and multiple obstruction of the contralateral vas deferens, and the other 6 patients showed unilateral vasal multiple obstruction and obstruction on the contralateral epididymis and proximal vas deferens. Free flow of the contrast medium could be defined into the bladder by vasography in 23 patients. Of the 23 patients, 12 were suspected of having delayed evacuation based on more than 50% contrast medium remaining inside their seminal vesicles after exhaustion of urine. Our analyses suggest that despite its advantages of being non-invasive, the diagnostic effect of TRUS is limited by both accuracy and reliability. In contrast, although an invasive radiographic imaging method, FNV has been proven as being informative when providing preoperative details about obstruction and other symptoms. After 3 years of research we came to the conclusion that opening fine-needle punctuation and vasography have not become outdated, at least recently, and will remain a necessary and effective method to identify diseases and to provide a strictly defined morphology of the seminal vesicle and ductal system for more comprehensive diagnosis of obstructive azoospermia of EDO.\n"}]}]}}

Data were collected as part of The Baby's Breath Project, a hospital-based SHSe intervention trial targeting parents with a high-risk infant in the NICU who reported a smoker in the household (N = 99). Measures of sociodemographics, smoking, home and car smoking bans, and depression were collected. Overall, 26% of all families with a high-risk infant in the NICU reported a household smoker. Almost half of the families with a smoker reported an annual income of less than $25,000. 46.2% of families reported having a total smoking ban in place in both their homes and cars. Only 27.8% families earning less than $25,000 reported having a total smoking ban in place relative to almost 60% of families earning more (p < .01). African American and Caucasian families were less likely to have a smoking ban compared with Hispanics (p < .05).

Prospective, cohort study over one full academic year. One academic Level III neonatal intensive care nursery. Data were collected prospectively on all 785 infants admitted to the neonatal ICU from July 1993 to June 1994. These infants were cared for by 14 different categorical pediatric housestaff. Our neonatal ICU has either a resident or an intern on-call by himself/herself at night, affording us a natural setting to compare intern vs. resident test ordering. The outcomes of interest were number of arterial blood gases, radiographs, and electrolytes ordered per infant by the on-call pediatric houseofficer, as tabulated the morning after the call night. Control variables included the severity-of-illness of the individual infant (using the Neonatal Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System), the workload of the houseofficer (number of patients, number of admissions), and supervision (rounding frequency and on-call attending). Controlling for the severity-of-illness of the infant, the workload on the call night, and supervision with multiple linear regression, we found that interns ordered significantly (p = .02) greater numbers of arterial blood gases per infant than residents, amounting to some 0.33 blood gases per infant per call night (3.22 vs. 2.89 arterial blood gases per infant per night). This increase of 0.33 blood gases per infant amounts to interns ordering $169 more arterial blood gases per call night at our institution. There was no difference between interns and residents in ordering radiographs or electrolytes. Interns order significantly more arterial blood gases per infant than junior and senior residents on-call in the neonatal ICU. Additional study is required to see if the experience of housestaff is associated with a broader array of neonatal outcomes, such as morbidity and mortality.\n"}]}]}}

A total of 50 Endocuff-assisted colonoscopies were analyzed retrospectively with regard to safety, procedural success, and complications. The cecal intubation rate was 98\u200a%, and the mean intubation time was 6.0 minutes (95\u200a% confidence interval 5.3\u200a-\u200a6.6 minutes). The ileal intubation rate was 76\u200a%. In 30\u200a% of patients, the Endocuff caused small, superficial, \"scratch-like\" mucosal lesions. In all other patients, no Endocuff-associated complications were observed. A total of 36 adenomas were detected in 50 patients. The adenoma detection rate was 34\u200a%. Endocuff-assisted colonoscopy showed good procedural success rates in terms of cecal intubation rate and time, and a promising adenoma detection rate. Endocuff seems to improve endoscope tip control, especially during polypectomy. Endocuff may be a useful device for colorectal adenoma screening, and should be investigated in larger trials.\n"}]}]}}

This trial was designed to determine whether the addition of oral flosequinan, a new direct-acting arterial and venous vasodilator with possible dose-dependent positive inotropic effects, improves exercise tolerance and quality of life in such patients. In a randomized, double-blind multicenter trial, 322 patients with predominantly New York Heart Association class II or III congestive heart failure and left ventricular ejection fractions of 35% or less, who were stabilized on a diuretic, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, and digoxin, were treated with 100 mg flosequinan once daily, 75 mg flosequinan twice daily, or matching placebo. Efficacy was evaluated with serial measurements of treadmill exercise time, responses to the Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire (LWHF), and clinical assessments during a baseline phase and a 16-week treatment period. After 16 weeks, 100 mg flosequinan once daily produced a significant increment in median exercise time (64 seconds at 16 weeks) compared with placebo (5 seconds), whereas the higher-dose flosequinan group did not show a statistically significant increase. Flosequinan (100 mg once daily) also improved the overall LWHF score significantly compared with placebo; both active therapies decreased the physical component, but 75 mg flosequinan twice daily was associated with a trend toward worsening of the emotional component. Most clinical assessments tended to improve on active therapy. These results indicate that additional symptomatic benefit can be attained by adding flosequinan to a therapeutic regimen already including a converting enzyme inhibitor. Because in the future most patients will fall into this category, flosequinan is a potential adjunctive agent in the management of severe congestive heart failure. However, because recent evidence indicates that the flosequinan dose studied in the present trial has an adverse effect on survival, the benefit-to-risk ratio must be assessed in individual patients.\n \nPrimary therapeutic approach to lumbar ureteral stones is still contraversial. The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of stone impaction and size on the effectiveness of proximal ureteral stone lithotripsy. A total of 123 patients with proximal ureteral stones were investigated in this prospective study performed in a 10-month period. The patients were divided into the group I--86 patients treated with extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) and the group II--37 patients treated with \"Swiss\" Lithoclast. In the group I, 49 stones (57%) were classified as impacted, while 20 stones (23.3%) were larger than 100 mm2. In the group II, 26 stones (70.3%) were impacted, and 11 stones (29.7%) were larger than 100 mm2. Stones were defined as impacted by the radiographic, echosonographic as well as endoscopic findings in the group II of patients. Stone size was presented in mm2. Chemical composition of stones were almost the same in both groups of the patients. Generally, there was no statistically significant difference in the treatment success between the groups. However, stones larger than 100 mm2 were statistically more successfully treated endoscopically, while there was no statistical difference in the treatment success of impacted stones between these two groups. ESWL can by considered as primary first therapeutic approach in treatment of all proximal ureteral stones except for stones larger than 100 mm2 that should primarily be treated endoscopically.\n"}]}]}}

The records of 465 patients with an established diagnosis of age related macular degeneration who had attended a specialist macular clinic between 1990 and 1998 were scrutinised. A full clinical examination and standardised refraction had been carried out in 189 of these cases on a minimum of two occasions. Cases were looked for where an improvement of one or more lines of either distance or near acuity was recorded in the eye unaffected by macular disease. In each one of these cases the improvement in visual acuity could not be attributed to treatment of other existing pathology. 12 such cases were detected. In nine of these the eye showing improvement of acuity had a history of amblyopia. The mean improvement in distance and near acuity in amblyopic eyes by 12 months was 3.3 and 1.9 lines logMAR respectively. The improvement in acuity generally occurred between 1 and 12 months from baseline and remained stable over the period of follow up. Older people with a history of amblyopia who develop visual loss in the previously normal eye can experience recovery of visual function in the amblyopic eye over a period of time. This recovery in visual function occurs in the wake of visual loss in the fellow eye and the improvement appears to be sustained.\n \nAssessment of visual acuity depends on the optotypes used for measurement. The ability to recognize different optotypes differs even if their critical details appear under the same visual angle. Since optotypes are evaluated on individuals with good visual acuity and without eye disorders, differences in the lower visual acuity range cannot be excluded. In this study, visual acuity measured with the Snellen E was compared to the Landolt C acuity. 100 patients (age 8 - 90 years, median 60.5 years) with various eye disorders, among them 39 with amblyopia due to strabismus, and 13 healthy volunteers were tested. Charts with the Snellen E and the Landolt C (Precision Vision) which mimic the ETDRS charts were used to assess visual acuity. Three out of 5 optotypes per line had to be correctly identified, while wrong answers were monitored. In the group of patients, the eyes with the lower visual acuity, and the right eyes of the healthy subjects, were evaluated. Differences between Landolt C acuity (LR) and Snellen E acuity (SE) were small. The mean decimal values for LR and SE were 0.25 and 0.29 in the entire group and 0.14 and 0.16 for the eyes with strabismus amblyopia. The mean difference between LR and SE was 0.55 lines in the entire group and 0.55 lines for the eyes with strabismus amblyopia, with higher values of SE in both groups. The results of the other groups were similar with only small differences between LR and SE. Using the charts described, there was only a slight overestimation of visual acuity by the Snellen E compared to the Landolt C, even in strabismus amblyopia. Small differences in the lower visual acuity range have to be considered.\n"}]}]}}

In this prospective randomized controlled trial, 48 superobese patients (body mass index of \u2265 50 kg/m(2)) undergoing open bariatric surgery were randomly allocated to three groups of 16 patients each. Postoperatively, all groups received a continuous epidural morphine infusion of 0.2 mg/h with 0.1 % levobupivacaine via PCEA. Group A did not receive intraoperative epidural morphine loading, while groups B and C received an intraoperative 1- and 2-mg morphine bolus, respectively. Levobupivacaine consumption via PCEA (primary outcome), pain scores at rest and on cough, the time to return of bowel function and ambulation, and arterial blood gas levels (secondary outcomes) were recorded. The increase in perioperative morphine administration (groups B and C) led to a significantly prolonged return to normal bowel function and delayed ambulation (P<0.05 to 0.01, respectively), without an improvement in postoperative analgesia or a reduction in local anesthetic consumption. Although the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was high in all groups, no respiratory depression was observed. Thoracic PCEA with 0.1 % levobupivacaine combined with continuous epidural morphine administration of 0.2 mg/h without morphine loading is an effective postoperative analgesic regimen that provides adequate pain control, early ambulation, and early return of bowel function in superobese patients, particularly those with OSA.\n \nTo compare the efficacy and safety of combined spinal-epidural (CSE, with the spinal component using low-dose heavy bupivacaine without opioid) with low-dose epidural analgesia in labor.

The Epidural Group received 10ml of a mixture of 0.1% bupivacaine and 2 \u00b5g/ml fentanyl, followed by a 6 ml first bolus after 10 min if needed (not considered as a top-up). All patients received 8 ml/h continuous background infusion, with patient-controlled top-up bolus of 6 ml with a lock-out interval of 12 min. In the CSE Group, 0.5% (heavy) bupivacaine 2.5 mg was used to produce spinal block (without concomitant use of any opioid), followed by epidural continuous background infusion of 8 ml of 0.1% of bupivacaine and 2 \u00b5g/ml of fentanyl, with a similar top-up provision as in the Epidural Group. Primary outcome was total drug consumption during labor, corrected by the duration of labor (ml/h). Mean total drug consumption during labor was significantly less in the CSE group (9.69 ml/h) than in Epidural group (13.52 ml/h ; P < 0.00 1). CSE also led to significantly faster onset of analgesia and sensory block. There was no significant difference between the two groups with regard to all other variables. Maternal satisfaction was rated as 'excellent' by all subjects. CSE using low-dose heavy bupivacaine without opioid required less drug consumption produced faster onset of pain control and sensory block than low-dose epidural analgesia.

We explored the relationship between the use of metformin and outcome (pathologic response rate, distant metastasis-free and overall survival) in our mono-institutional cohort of patients treated for oesophageal cancer. Between 2008 and 2014, a total of 196 patients with oesophageal cancer (ages ranged from 37 to 82 years) eligible for curative treatment entered the study. Patients were categorized as non-diabetic (n = 172), diabetic not taking metformin (n = 5) or diabetic taking metformin (n = 19). The majority of patients were treated with trimodality therapy (n = 189). Pathologic response was graded according to Mandard's tumour regression score at the time of surgery. Distant metastasis-free and overall survival were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method with log rank comparisons performed to determine significance. The overall pathologic complete response rate for the study population was 26%. It was 25% for patients not using metformin and 39% for diabetics taking metformin (p = 0.260). The two-year overall survival rate for the whole group was 59%. Use of metformin was associated with a significantly better distant metastasis-free survival rate (p = 0.040) or overall survival rate (p = 0.012). Multivariate analysis using Cox regression found that metformin treatment significantly prolonged survival (p = 0.043). In our population-based study, the use of metformin was associated with an improved overall and distant metastasis-free survival rate in patients with oesophageal cancer.

Recent advances in the management and prognosis of these patients suggest that this policy should be reevaluated. To explore the current views of U.S. transplant centers toward transplanting asymptomatic HIV-infected patients with end-stage renal disease, a written survey was mailed to the directors of transplantation at all 248 renal transplant centers in the United States. All 148 responding centers said they require HIV testing of prospective kidney recipients, and 84% of these centers would not transplant an individual who refuses HIV testing. The vast majority of responding centers would not transplant a kidney from a cadaveric (88%) or a living donor (91%) into an asymptomatic HIV-infected patient who is otherwise a good candidate for transplantation. Among the few centers that would consider transplanting an HIV-infected patient, not a single center had performed such a transplant in the year prior to the survey. Most centers fear that transplantation in the face of HIV infection would be harmful to the individual, and some believe that it would be a waste of precious organs. The great majority of U.S. renal transplant centers will not transplant kidneys to HIV-infected patients with end-stage renal disease, even if their infection is asymptomatic. However, advances in the management of HIV infection and a review of relevant ethical issues suggest that this approach should be reconsidered.\n"}]}]}}

High-risk patients were more likely to have a severe complication (10% versus 50%, p=0.0003), multiple severe complications (3% versus 20%, p=0.0278), ICU admission (2% versus 40%, p<0.0001), overall mortality (2% versus 15%, p=0.0417), and death due to neutropenic fever (0% versus 15%, p=0.0124). MASCC had a positive predictive value of 50% and negative predictive value of 90%. The median MASCC score for all patients was 22 (range, 11-26), but the median MASCC score for those with death or a severe complication was 17 (range, 11-24). Based on this pilot data, MASCC score appears promising in determining suitability for outpatient management of NF in gynecologic oncology patients. Prospective study is ongoing to confirm safety and determine impact on cost.\n"}]}]}}

The following variables were analysed There were 7 type I Hawkins fractures, 11 type II, and 4 type III and 1 type IV. Four cases developed avascular necrosis (2 Hawkins type II and 2 type III).

The authors retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 47 consecutive patients with CSA in whom the presence/absence of the pyramidal tract sign was noted. We analyzed whether the age, sex, presence of diabetes mellitus, medication (vitamin B12), type of the most atrophic and impaired muscle, the muscle strength at the presentation, the presence of the pyramidal tract sign, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, including the presence and number of T2 high signal intensity areas (T2 HIA) in the spinal cord and the conversion to surgery were associated with the recovery of muscle strength in the patients. In addition, we also investigated whether the duration of symptoms before surgery and the type of surgery were associated with the recovery of muscle strength in patients who required conversion to surgical treatment. The presence of T2 HIA on MRI (P=0.002), the number of T2 HIA on MRI (P=0.002) and conversion to surgery (P=0.015) were found to be significantly associated with a poorer recovery at the observational final follow-up. Further, the presence of the pyramidal tract sign (P=0.043) was significantly associated with a poor recovery at the final follow-up after surgery. The presence of a high signal intensity change on T2-weighted MRI and the pyramidal tract sign can be used as prognostic factors for patients with CSA.\n"}]}]}}

First, American Board of Surgery In-Training Examination (ABSITE) scores and the passing rate of the ABS certifying examination were recorded for the years 2001, 2002, 2005, and 2006. Second, the changes in the curriculum of surgical education were documented as perceived by program coordinators and directors. In all, 85% (17/20) of surgical programs in New England responded to the survey. The programs began to implement the 80-hour workweek from 2002 to 2004. An equal distribution of community (n = 8) and university programs (n = 9) was sampled. Prior to the initiation of the 80-hour workweek, residency programs emphasized weekly didactic sessions given by attending physicians (88%), mock orals (88%), and conventional journal club (76%). After the 80-hour workweek was implemented, the education curriculum most often consisted of didactic sessions by attending (100%), mock orals (88%), and simulation laboratories (75%). No difference was observed in ABSITE scores and first-time pass rates of the ABS examination before or after the introduction of the 80-hour workweek (20% response). Only 25% of programs felt that surgical education was improved after the implementation of the 80-hour workweek, whereas 31% felt education was worse. Overall, 44% of respondents believed that there was no difference in surgical education. Despite the positive effects the 80-hour workweek has had on resident quality of life and patient care, it does not seem that either significant improvements or detrimental effects have occurred on surgical education within residency programs in New England.\n \nThis study characterizes the progress in and effectiveness of learning geriatric medicine during longitudinal and block phases of a family practice residency program. A structured second-year geriatric block rotation was added to a residency longitudinal curriculum. To assess learning, a Geriatric Assessment Instrument (GAI) consisting of 50 multiple choice questions was administered to three classes offamily practice residents (n=33)five times during training Scores on the GAI improved significantly before and after the rotation but not during any other interval of training during the residency. In-training exam scores improved significantlyfor the classes taught with the block rotation over those without it. Most of the geriatric learning occurred during the 1-month geriatric block rotation during the residency. In-training geriatric exam scores improved significantly with a geriatric block rotation. The use of structured repetitive learning experiences during the rotation to emphasize the common clinical issues and the skewed exposure to geriatric patients in the random nature of residency clinic and inpatient encounters accountfor this result.\n"}]}]}}

The Simplified Acute Physiology Score 3 was calculated using the global equation (customized for South America) and the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score; the scores were calculated within 24 hours of admission. A receiver-operating characteristic curve was generated, and the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve was calculated to identify the patients at the greatest risk of death according to Simplified Acute Physiology Score 3 and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores. The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test was used for statistically significant results and indicated a difference in performance over deciles. The standardized mortality ratio was used to estimate the overall model performance. The ability of both scores to predict hospital mortality was poor in the liver and renal transplant groups and average in the lung transplant group (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve = 0.696 for Simplified Acute Physiology Score 3 and 0.670 for Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II). The calibration of both scores was poor, even after customizing the Simplified Acute Physiology Score 3 score for South America. The low predictive accuracy of the Simplified Acute Physiology Score 3 and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores does not warrant the use of these scores in critically ill transplant patients.\n \nAcute cognitive changes during epileptiform discharges have been studied using computer assisted cognitive tasks. We aimed to demonstrate acute behavioral change (using a simple motor response task MRT) during photoparoxysmal response (PPR) in children below 18 years. Children performed a simple repetitive motor task during intermittent photic stimulation (IPS). All episodes of PPR not associated with obvious clinical change (as observed by the technologist or reported by the patient) were analyzed for this study. The average time interval between two successive motor responses across a PPR (test time) was compared to the average time interval between two successive motor responses during IPS not associated with PPR (control time) using Wilcoxon signed ranks test. 21 children who had PPR successfully completed the MRT. The difference between the mean durations was 0.894 s (p=0.002). More than 50% increase compared to the control time was considered a delay in MRT during PPR. 10 children showed slowing of MRT during PPR. By definition, acute behavioral change during generalized epileptiform discharges represent provoked seizures. Detecting subclinical seizures can have important safety implications in children (skiing, skating and driving) with PPR on EEG, but no clinical seizures. We recommend MRT during IPS.\n"}]}]}}

Forty-nine spontaneous good-grade SAH were included. The first TCD studies were carried out at the Emergency Department. At least one more TCD recording was performed between the 4th and 14th day. Patients were classified according to whether they came to the hospital during the first 72 hours after the haemorrhage (Group 1) or later (Group 2). Thirty three patients were included in Group 1 and sixteen patients in Group 2. Thirteen patients (26.5%) had sonographic vasospasm. In eight of these patients (61 %), the vasospasm was symptomatic. The initial mean velocity (MV) for Group 1 was normal. The increase in MV/24h (MV/24h) within the first 72 hours after SAH was higher (p< 0.007), in those whose developed sonographic vasospasm. In Group 2, the initial MV was greater (p< 0.001)) in patients who suffered sonographic vasospasm, with or without symptoms. The ability of TCD recorded in the first 24 hours of hospital admission to detect high-risk vasospasm patients for SAH with low clinical severity helps decide the most efficient patient destination. During the first three days the MV/24h is of value but not the absolute figure of the MV. In contrast, between the 4th and 14th day after SAH, the absolute figure of MV was useful to predict vasospasm.\n \nRehabilitation protocols after distal biceps repair are highly variable, with many surgeons favoring at least 2 weeks of immobilization. Is this conservative approach necessary to protect the repair? This was a consecutive series of 22 distal biceps tendon repairs in which a cortical button system was used. Patients were encouraged to mobilize their elbow actively from the day of surgery. Physiotherapy commenced at 3 weeks, with strengthening exercises when full range of movement (ROM) was achieved. The primary outcome measured was the clinical integrity of the repaired tendon. Secondary outcomes comprised wound or nerve complication, elbow ROM, and patient-reported outcome measures (the 11-item version of the Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder and Hand, Mayo Elbow Performance Index, and Oxford Elbow Score). All patients were male, and the dominant arm was repaired in 60%. Mean age was 40.6 years (range, 27-62 years), and mean time to surgery was 17 days (range, 5-99 days). Mean follow-up was 16.6 months (range, 3.8-29 months). All tendons were clinically intact at time of review. No wound breakdown occurred. Mean extension was -6\u00b0 (range, -10\u00b0 to 10\u00b0), and flexion was 144\u00b0 (range, 135\u00b0-150\u00b0). All patients achieved full pronosupination. ROM was equivalent to the uninjured arm (P\u2009=\u2009.7). The mean 11-item version of the Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder and Hand score was 2.7 (range, 0-15.9), the Mayo Elbow Performance Index was 97.8 (range, 70-100), and the Oxford Elbow Score was 46.9 (range, 43-48) at the latest follow-up. One-third of patients experienced a transient sensory neurapraxia. Immediate mobilization after biceps tendon repair with a cortical button is possible, and in this series was not associated with failure of the repair, wound breakdown, or patient dissatisfaction. However, this series emphasizes the high incidence of nerve complication that can be associated with the single transverse incision technique.\n"}]}]}}

The current study was performed to determine the knowledge, attitudes, and confidence of PCPs in the safety net at delivering care to survivors of breast cancer. A modified version of the National Cancer Institute's Survey of Physician Attitudes Regarding Care of Cancer Survivors was given to providers at 2 county hospitals and 5 associated clinics (59 providers). Focus groups were held to understand barriers to survivorship care. Although the majority of providers believed PCPs have the skills necessary to provide cancer-related follow-up, the vast majority were not comfortable providing these services themselves. Providers were adherent to American Society of Clinical Oncology recommendations for mammography (98%) and physical examination (87%); less than one-third were guideline-concordant for laboratory testing and only 6 providers (10%) met all recommendations. PCPs universally requested additional training on clinical guidelines and the provision of written survivorship care plans before transfer. Concerns voiced in qualitative sessions included unfamiliarity with the management of endocrine therapy and confusion regarding who would be responsible for certain aspects of care. Safety-net providers currently lack knowledge of and confidence in providing survivorship care to patients with breast cancer. Opportunities exist for additional training in evidence-based guidelines and improved coordination of care between PCPs and oncology specialists.\n \nTo assess trends in the involvement of US physicians with managed care. Comparison of data from 2 consecutive rounds of a national survey. Longitudinal data were obtained from the 1996/1997 (n = 12,528) and the 1998/1999 (n = 12,304) rounds of the Community Tracking Study (CTS) Physician Survey, a large, ongoing nationally representative survey of US physicians involved in patient care. Indicators used to assess involvement with managed care included global measures of managed care participation, risk contracting, exposure to financial incentives, and impact of care management tools. Changes in these measures over the 2 study periods are reported. Analyses were conducted for all physicians, as well as for primary care physicians (PCPs) and specialists separately. The percentage of practice revenue derived from managed care increased only modestly over the study period (from 42% to 45%). Mean numbers of managed care contracts per physician increased minimally (from 12 to 13). Trends in acceptance of capitation and exposure to financial incentives remained stable over the study period. Among PCPs, employment in staff/group health maintenance organizations declined slightly, whereas gatekeeping function increased modestly. Among care management tools, only treatment guidelines had a significantly increased impact on medical practice, primarily among PCPs (from 46% to 52%; P < .001). Many aspects of managed care leveled off between 1996 and 1999 in ways not accurately reflected by plan enrollment patterns. This \"flattening of the curve\" trend appears to hold generally across multiple measures. A stalling of the managed care \"revolution,\" if it is sustained, may portend future escalation in healthcare costs.\n"}]}]}}

Thus, the aim of our study was to determine the prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients undergoing liver transplantation for primary sclerosing cholangitis. The records of the 520 patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation at our institution between 1985 and May 1995 were reviewed. Of the 134 patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis, three (2%) had hepatocellular carcinoma. In the 386 patients without primary sclerosing cholangitis undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation, 22 (6%) had hepatocellular carcinoma. Neither the duration of primary sclerosing cholangitis (range 7-23 years) nor the presence of ulcerative colitis (two of three patients) distinguished those patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis plus hepatocellular carcinoma from those with primary sclerosing cholangitis alone. None of the three patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis plus hepatocellular carcinoma had evidence for hepatitis B or C, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, or hemochromatosis. None of the tumors was of the fibrolamellar variety of hepatocellular carcinoma. The prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation is 2%. These data suggest that patients with advanced cirrhotic-stage primary sclerosing cholangitis are at increased risk for developing hepatocellular carcinoma and should be screened for hepatocellular carcinoma as well as for cholangiocarcinoma prior to orthotopic liver transplantation.\n \nThe present study was conducted to assess the efficacy of contrast-enhanced ultrasound with low mechanical index in evaluating the response of percutaneous radiofrequency ablation treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma by comparing it with 4-row spiral computed tomography. 100 consecutive patients (65 men and 35 women; age range After treatment, contrast-enhanced ultrasound identified persistent signal enhancement in 24 patients (24 %), whereas no intratumoral enhancement was detected in the remaining 76 patients (76 %).

Medical records were located and reviewed for 90 of 107 women referred for colposcopy and 153 of 225 women referred for repeated Pap smears. Routine clinic protocols for follow-up--telephone call, letter, or certified letter--were applied without regard to the type of abnormality seen on a Pap smear or recommended examination. Documented adherence to follow-up within 8 months of an abnormal result. Attempts to contact the patients for follow-up, adherence to follow-up recommendations, and patient characteristics were abstracted from medical records. The probability of adherence to follow-up vs the number of follow-up attempts was modeled with survival analysis. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine multivariate relationships related to adherence. The rate of overall adherence to follow-up recommendations was 56.0% (136/243). Adherence to a second colposcopy was not significantly different from that to a repeated Pap smear (odds ratio, 1.40; 95% confidence interval, 0.80-2.46). The use of as many as 3 patient reminders substantially improved adherence to follow-up.

Adherence to follow-up was low in this family planning clinic population, no matter what type of follow-up was advised. Adherence was improved by the use of up to 3 reminders. Allocating resources to effective methods for improving adherence to follow-up of abnormal results may be more important than which follow-up procedure is recommended.\n \nWomen with disabilities (WWD) face significant barriers accessing healthcare, which may affect rates of routine preventive services. We examined the relationship between disability status and routine breast and cervical cancer screening among middle-aged and older unmarried women and the differences in reported quality of the screening experience. Data were from a 2003-2005 cross-sectional survey of 630 unmarried women in Rhode Island, 40-75 years of age, stratified by marital status (previously vs. never married) and partner gender (women who partner with men exclusively [WPM] vs. women who partner with women exclusively or with both women and men [WPW]). WWD were more likely than those without a disability to be older, have a high school education or less, have household incomes <$30,000, be unemployed, and identify as nonwhite. In addition, WWD were less likely to report having the mammogram or Pap test procedure explained and more likely to report that the procedures were difficult to perform. After adjustment for important demographic characteristics, we found no differences in cancer screening behaviors by disability status. However, the quality of the cancer screening experience was consistently and significantly associated with likelihood of routine cancer screening. Higher quality of cancer screening experience was significantly associated with likelihood of having routine breast and cervical cancer screening. Further studies should explore factors that affect quality of the screening experience, including facility characteristics and interactions with medical staff.\n"}]}]}}

The traditional cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide-based method was modified for DNA isolation from pollen. Taxon-specific DNA sequences were identified via bioinformatics or literature searches and were PCR amplified from the matching allergenic taxa; based on the sequences of PCR products, complementary or degenerate TaqMan probes were developed. The accuracy of the quantitative real-time PCR assay was tested on 3 plant species. The setup of a modified DNA extraction protocol allowed us to achieve good-quality pollen DNA. Taxon-specific nuclear gene fragments were identified and sequenced. Designed primer pairs and probes identified selected pollen taxa, mostly at the required classification level. Pollen was properly identified even when collected on routine aerobiological tape. Preliminary quantification assays on pollen grains were successfully performed on test species and in mixes.

One had been studied in the period of 1975 till 1979, and a second population was evaluated between 1992 and 1995. At both time periods patients with inhalant allergy and visiting our outpatient clinic were included.

In patients suffering from respiratory allergy the frequency of birch pollen sensitisation significantly increased from 13% in the period 1975-1979 to 34% in the period 1992-1995. In contrast, the frequency of house dust mite, timothy grass pollen, and mugwort pollen sensitisation remained almost unchanged. The increase was not associated with an increase in the birch pollen count. Birch pollen hypersensitivity has almost tripled among atopic subjects during the last 2 decades.

We sought to examine updated Pap test screening guidelines and how they may affect the detection of invasive cervical cancer, especially among women <30 years of age. Patients diagnosed at Brigham and Women's Hospital with invasive cervical cancer between 2002 and 2012 were retrospectively identified. Prior screening history was obtained and patients were divided into two groups based on age <30 years or age \u226530 years. The two groups were then compared with respect to demographics, pathological findings, and time to diagnosis. A total of 288 patients with invasive cervical carcinoma were identified. Among these patients, 109 had adequate information on prior screening history. Invasive adenocarcinoma (IAC) was diagnosed in 37 (33.94%) patients, whereas 64 (58.72%) patients were diagnosed with invasive squamous cell carcinoma (ISCC). The remaining eight patients were diagnosed with other types of cancers of the cervix. A total of 13 patients were younger than 30 while 96 patients were 30 or older. The mean time from normal Pap to diagnosis of IAC was 15 months in patients younger than 30 years of age compared to 56 months in patients aged 30 and older (p\u2009<\u20090.001). The mean time from normal Pap to diagnosis of ISCC was 38 months in patients younger than 30 years of age and 82 months in patients aged 30 and older (p\u2009=\u20090.018). In this small retrospective study, updated Pap test screening guidelines would not have missed invasive cancer on average among screened women age 30 and older. However, young patients aged 21-29 years may be at increased risk of developing IAC of the cervix between the recommended screening intervals.\n \nThe aim of this study was to compare qualitative visual analysis with semi-quantitative analysis in the diagnosis of mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) using FDG-PET. This study included 21 patients with histopathological confirmation of MTS. FDG-PET visual analysis data were based on clinical reports generated soon after the completion of the scan. FDG-PET images were semi-quantitatively analyzed using regions of interest (ROIs) in 19 slices perpendicular to the longest axis of the temporal lobe. These ROIs divided each temporal lobe into three regions (lateral, inferior and medial). An asymmetry index was calculated for each region. The visual analysis of the FDG-PET studies demonstrated asymmetric hypometabolism in all patients. All but 1 patient underwent standard lobectomy of the same side described as hypometabolic by the PET report. Using an asymmetry index equal or greater than 9% in at least one of the regions as a threshold, the FDG-PET semi-quantitative analysis showed significant asymmetry in 18 patients. These also matched the side of lobectomy and were confirmed as sclerotic in all but one patient (same patient as above). The semi-quantitative analysis did not provide additional information over visual interpretation in this series of patients.\n"}]}]}}

Histologic, ultrastructural, and cohesive tensile strength evaluations were performed on 25 normal human corneal specimens, 206 uncomplicated LASIK specimens, 17 uncomplicated sub-Bowman's keratomileusis (SBK) specimens, 4 uncomplicated photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) specimens, 2 uncomplicated advanced surface ablation (ASA) specimens, 5 keratoconus specimens, 12 postoperative LASIK ectasia specimens, and 1 postoperative PRK ectasia specimen and compared to previously published studies. Histologic and ultrastructural studies of normal corneas showed significant differences in the direction of collagen fibrils and/or the degree of lamellar interweaving in Bowman's layer, the anterior third of the corneal stroma, the posterior two-thirds of the corneal stroma, and Descemet's membrane. Cohesive tensile strength testing directly supported these morphologic findings as the stronger, more rigid regions of the cornea were located anteriorly and peripherally. This suggests that PRK and ASA, and secondarily SBK, should be biomechanically safer than conventional LASIK with regard to risk for causing keratectasia after surgery. Because adult human corneal stromal wounds heal slowly and incompletely, all excimer laser keratorefractive surgical techniques still have some distinct disadvantages due to inadequate reparative wound healing. Despite reducing some of the risk for corneal haze compared to conventional PRK, ASA cases still can develop corneal haze or breakthrough haze from the hypercellular fibrotic stromal scarring. In contrast, similar to conventional LASIK, SBK still has the short- and long-term potential for interface wound complications from the hypocellular primitive stromal scar. Ophthalmic pathology and basic science research show that SBK and ASA are improvements in excimer laser keratorefractive surgery compared to conventional LASIK or PRK, particularly with regard to maintaining corneal biomechanics and perhaps moderately reducing the risk of corneal haze. However, most of the disadvantages caused by wound healing issues remain.\n \nThis study was designed to investigate the added role of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) to vertebroplasty on the pain management of patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Thirty-six patients (51-82 years) with vertebral localization of MM were randomly divided into two groups Technical success was 100 % in both groups. The VAS score (at 24 h and 6 weeks postprocedure) decreased in equal manner for both groups from a mean of 9.1-3.4 and 2.0 for group A and from a mean of 9.3-3.0 and 2.3 for group B; RMQ mean score was 19.8 for group A and 19.9 for group B and decreased to a mean of 9.6 and 8.2 for group A and 9.5 and 8.7 for group B. The amount of medication was equally decreased in the two groups. No statistically significant difference was noted. No major complication occurred and two patients died from other causes. The use of percutaneous vertebroplasty alone appears to be effective for the pain management of the patients with vertebral involvement of multiple myeloma. The use of RFA that includes cost and time does not offer any clear added benefit on the midterm pain management of such patients.\n"}]}]}}

The purpose of this study was to determine whether operative volume outweighs the advantages of being treated locally by comparing the outcomes of patients with rectal cancer treated at local, low-volume centers versus far, high-volume centers. This was a population-based study. The National Cancer Database was queried for patients with rectal cancer. Patients with stage II or III rectal cancer who underwent surgical resection between 2006 and 2012 were included. The outcomes of interest were margins, lymph node yield, receipt of neoadjuvant chemoradiation, adjuvant chemotherapy, readmission within 30 days, 30-day and 90-day mortality, and 5-year overall survival. A total of 18,605 patients met inclusion criteria; 2067 patients were in the long-distance/high-volume group and 1362 in the short-distance/low-volume group. The median travel distance was 62.6 miles for the long-distance/high-volume group and 2.3 miles for the short-distance/low-volume group. Patients who were younger, white, privately insured, and stage III were more likely to have traveled to a high-volume center. When controlled for patient factors, stage, and hospital factors, patients in the short-distance/low-volume group had lower odds of a lymph node yield \u226512 (OR = 0.51) and neoadjuvant chemoradiation (OR = 0.67) and higher 30-day (OR = 3.38) and 90-day mortality (OR = 2.07) compared with those in the long-distance/high-volume group. The short-distance/low-volume group had a 34% high risk of overall mortality at 5 years compared with the long-distance/high-volume group. We lacked data regarding patient and physician decision making and surgeon-specific factors. Our results indicate that when controlled for patient, tumor, and hospital factors, patients who traveled a long distance to a high-volume center had improved lymph node yield, neoadjuvant chemoradiation receipt, and 30- and 90-day mortality compared with those who traveled a short distance to a low-volume center.

The frequency of rectal cancer in this population, surgical intervention, general outcomes and cancer recurrence are described. Data on 1850 patients undergoing restorative proctocolectomy from 1983 to 2001 were reviewed. Information was gathered from data in the department's pelvic pouch database, as well as pathology and surgical reports. Follow-up questionnaires routinely sent to patients as part of the database were included in the analysis to determine current functional status. Mean follow-up period was 7.5 years after surgery. Seventy patients had coexisting colorectal cancer at time of IPAA. 7 (10%) of cancers were incidental. Pre-operative duration of disease was 18.6 years. Twenty-six of the cancers were rectal cancers. The most common form of anastomosis in the rectal cancers was mucosectomy, especially in pre-operatively known rectal cancer or low lying dysplasia. Preferred surgical technique for rectal cancer in mucosal ulcerative colitis (UC) included high ligation of mesenteric vessels with radical colectomy and taped occlusion of the rectum with irrigation of the rectal stump with Turnbull solution prior to mucosectomy. Patients with Stage 3 cancers received postoperative chemotherapy. Post-operative radiation therapy was not commonly recommended. Five of 70 patients were deceased from metastatic colon cancer; 55 patients were confirmed alive with good to excellent pouch function with a follow-up range of 1-17 years. Restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis is a successful surgical approach for patients with coexisting colorectal cancer in UC. When the appropriate surgical technique is used in patients with colon or rectal cancer, along with adjuvant chemotherapy when appropriate, prognosis and function is very good.\n"}]}]}}

A total of 360 core needle biopsies was obtained from 169 breast lesions in 146 patients. Additional open breast biopsy was performed in 111 women (127/169 breast lesions); the remaining 42 lesions were followed up for at least 24 months. 3D ultrasound visualization of the needle in the postfiring position was used to classify the biopsy as central, marginal or outside the lesion. Based on this classification it was decided whether another sample had to be obtained. A median of two core samples per lesion provided for all the lesions a sensitivity for malignancy of 96.9%, specificity of 100%, false-positive rate of 0% and false-negative rate of 3.1%, and for the excised lesions a sensitivity of 96.5%, specificity of 100%, false-positive rate of 0%, false-negative rate of 3.5% and an underestimation rate of 3.4%. 3D ultrasound validation of the postfiring needle position is an efficient adjunct to ultrasound-guided LCNB.

The dataset from both of these examinations was digitally stored and evaluated. MDCT was performed in nonanesthetized patients; however, in the RT 3D TEE group, general anesthesia was established. The distances from the right coronary artery and the left coronary artery ostium were measured retrospectively. Bland-Altman Plots and linear regression analysis showed excellent correlation between the 2 methodologies; intraobserver and interobserver variance were calculated using analysis of variance. Krippendorff's \u03b1 indicated excellent agreement between the 2 observers (0.96 and 0.98) as well as between RT 3D TEE and MDCT (0.97 and 0.98). The observations showed that RT 3D TEE reliably can measure the coronary ostium distance from the aortic annulus.

Recurrence of groin metastases in vulvar cancer patients is assumed to be lethal. It is unknown if early detection of relapse and multimodal treatment strategies improve the outcome of patients with groin recurrence. Multicenter retrospective cohort study of patients with recurrent vulvar cancer who presented with groin and/or pelvic lymph node metastases between 2000 and 2014 at 3 tertiary referral hospitals. Our primary outcome was to assess survival after groin recurrence of vulvar cancer and the influence of multimodal treatment. All analyses were done using Stata 12 (Stata Corporation, College Station, Tex). Hazard ratios (HRs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals were calculated using a Cox proportional hazards model. We identified 30 patients with a median time from diagnosis to groin recurrence of 10 months. The median follow-up of patients who were alive at the time of analysis was 22 months (range, 9-123 months). A Kaplan-Meier estimate showed an overall survival rate of 50% after 7 years. Patients with multimodal groin relapse treatment performed better than those with single-mode treatment (HR, 0.25; P = 0.037). Lymph node metastases at diagnosis were also associated with lower survival (HR, 6.11; P = 0.020). We observed a trend toward lower survival with a tumor size greater than T1 (HR, 2.55; P = 0.111). The time from diagnosis to groin recurrence had no influence on survival (HR, 0.99; P = 0.561).

Medical records were reviewed of patients with advanced EOC who were clinically free of disease after primary surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy between January 1, 1992, and December 31, 1998. All of them were offered SLL. Measurement outcomes include patient survival and disease-free survival. There were 50 patients with clinically complete remission after chemotherapy. Sixteen patients underwent SLL, and thirty-four patients refused the procedure (NSLL). Seven patients (43.8%) were reported to have positive SLL. After the median follow-up time of 35 months, 12 patients had died, and 5 patients were lost to follow-up. The median survival time for patients with SLL was about 60 months. Five-year survival rates of patients in the SLL, and NSLL groups were 37 per cent (95%CI = 7%-69%), and 88 per cent (95%CI = 65%-96%) respectively (P<0.001). The median time to relapse was about 25 months for patients with negative SLL. Five-year disease-free survival rates of patients in the negative SLL, and NSLL groups were 28 per cent (95%CI = 4%-59%), and 54 per cent (95%CI = 34%-70%) respectively (P=0.251). By Cox regression analysis, tumor grade was the only significant prognostic factor influencing patients' survival (HR = 6, 95%CI of HR = 1.2-34.2).

However, eye movement closely interacts with motion perception. The known eye-tracking difficulties in schizophrenia patients may interact with their motion perception. Two speed discrimination experiments were conducted in a within-subject design. In experiment 1, the stimulus duration was 150 msec to minimize the chance of eye-tracking occurrence. In experiment 2, the duration was increased to 300 msec, increasing the possibility of eye movement intrusion. Regular eye-tracking performance was evaluated in a third experiment. At 150 msec, speed discrimination thresholds did not differ between schizophrenia patients (n = 38) and control subjects (n = 33). At 300 msec, patients had significantly higher thresholds than control subjects (p = .03). Furthermore, frequencies of eye tracking during the 300 msec stimulus were significantly correlated with speed discrimination in control subjects (p = .01) but not in patients, suggesting that eye-tracking initiation may benefit control subjects but not patients. The frequency of eye tracking during speed discrimination was not significantly related to regular eye-tracking performance. Speed discrimination, per se, is not impaired in schizophrenia patients. The observed abnormality appears to be a consequence of impairment in generating or integrating the feedback information from eye movements. This study introduces a novel approach to motion perception studies and highlights the importance of concurrently measuring eye movements to understand interactions between these two systems; the results argue for a conceptual revision regarding motion perception abnormality in schizophrenia.\n \nThis study addresses the question to what extent visual impairment leads to additional disability in adults with intellectual disabilities (ID). In a multi-centre cross-sectional study of 269 adults with mild to profound ID, social and behavioural functioning was assessed with observant-based questionnaires, prior to expert assessment of visual function. With linear regression analysis the percentage of variance, explained by levels of visual function, was calculated for the total population and per ID level. A total of 107/269 participants were visually impaired or blind (WHO criteria). On top of the decrease by ID visual impairment significantly decreased daily living skills, communication & language, recognition/communication. Visual impairment did not cause more self-absorbed and withdrawn behaviour or anxiety. Peculiar looking habits correlated with visual impairment and not with ID. In the groups with moderate and severe ID this effect seems stronger than in the group with profound ID. Although ID alone impairs daily functioning, visual impairment diminishes the daily functioning even more. Timely detection and treatment or rehabilitation of visual impairment may positively influence daily functioning, language development, initiative and persistence, social skills, communication skills and insecure movement.\n"}]}]}}

All animals were fed liquids for 3 days prior to procedure. The procedures were performed under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation. The flexible endoscope was passed per orally into the stomach and puncture of the gastric wall was performed with a needle knife. The puncture was extended to create a 1.5-cm incision using a pull-type sphincterotome, and a double-channel endoscope was advanced into the peritoneal cavity. The peritoneal cavity was insufflated with air through the endoscope. The spleen was visualized. The splenic vessels were ligated with endoscopic loops and clips, and then mesentery was dissected using electrocautery. Endoscopic splenectomy was performed on six pigs. There were no complications during gastric incision and entrance into the peritoneal cavity. Visualization of the spleen and other intraperitoneal organs was very good.

Children referred with symptomatic gallstones complicating HS between April 1999 and April 2009 were prospectively identified and reviewed retrospectively. During this period, the policy was to undertake concomitant splenectomy only if indicated for haematological reasons and not simply because of planned cholecystectomy. A total of 16 patients (mean age 10.4, range 3.7 to 16 years, 11 women) with HS and symptomatic gallstones underwent cholecystectomy. Three patients subsequently required a splenectomy for haematological reasons 0.8-2.5 years after cholecystectomy; all three splenectomies were performed laparoscopically. There were no postoperative complications in the 16 patients; postoperative hospital stay was 1-3 days after either cholecystectomy or splenectomy.

There is little evidence from the literature to recommend the use of medicinal plants when treating FSD. The majority of studies with a strong level of evidence are associated with the treatment of the vasomotor symptoms of menopause. Ferula hermonis, Angelica sinensis, and Gingko biloba may be suggested for arousal disorder studies.

It is generally agreed that PM impairment occurs in patients with prefrontal lobes damage. To evaluate if there is a causal role of a deficit of executive abilities (failures of planning, set-shifting, selective attention, or working memory) over the PM impairment. We report a detailed investigation of PM and executive abilities in two patients with posttraumatic damage to prefrontal lobes who complained from a reduced compliance with appointments and daily routines. Laboratory tests confirmed a difficulty in fulfilling delayed intentions in response to the occurrence of critical events and elapsed time. In one patient, PM impairment was associated with poor performance on tests investigating planning, working memory, and mental shifting. The other patient performed in the normal range on all executive tests. Despite the frequent claim of a dependence of PM deficits from executive dysfunction, the reported cases demonstrate that this is not necessarily the case. The results are discussed in the light of current hypotheses relating PM impairment to other deficits that commonly occur as a result of damage to the prefrontal lobes.\n"}]}]}}

Ninety-one consecutive transplants are studied, carried out in our center with kidneys from cadaver donors older than 60 years implanted in recipients younger than 60 years. The control group is made up of 91 transplants, matched with those from the study group, whose donor and recipient were younger than 60 years. There were no differences between groups with regard to recipient age, sex, cause of death and renal function of the donor, hepatitis C and cytomegalovirus serologies, cold ischemia time, tubular necrosis, immediate diuresis, need for dialysis, human leukocyte antigen incompatibilities, hypersensitized patients, acute rejection, waiting time on dialysis, and days of admission. Survival in both groups at 1, 5, and 10 years was 97.6%, 87.2%, and 76.6% vs. 98.8%, 87.5%, and 69.5% for the patient (P=0.642), 92.9%, 81.3%, and 64.2% vs. 93.9%, 76.4%, and 69.5% for the graft (P=0.980), and 94.4%, 92.6%, and 77.4% vs. 94.3%, 86.7%, and 84.4% for the graft with death censured (P=0.747), respectively.

We conclude that patient and graft survival on transplanting kidneys from elderly donors to young recipients is superimposable on that obtained with young donors. However, renal function is better in the group of young donors.\n \nInfective endocarditis (IE) is a rare but life threatening infection after renal transplantation. In addition, coinfection of CMV and IE has not been reported. Therefore, the current study was initiated to determine whether CMV infection is a risk factor for developing of IE after kidney transplantation. In a retrospectively study, we analyzed the medical records of 3700 kidney recipients at two transplant centers in Iran, between January 2000 and June 2008 for infective endocarditis. During the study, 15 patients with IE hospitalized in our centers were included. The predominant causative microorganisms (60%) were group D non-enterococcal streptococci and enterococci. Patient survival rate in all recipients was 66% at 6 months. Data analysis showed no significant differences in 6 months patient survival from hospitalization between both groups with and without CMV infection (P=0.2). The presentation time of infective endocarditis in recipients with CMV coinfection was more likely to be early when compared to CMV negative coinfection patients (P=0.03). The present study indicates that CMV infection may lead to predispose to infective endocarditis after kidney transplantation. Rapid diagnosis, effective treatment, and prompt recognition of complications in kidney transplant recipients are essential to good patient outcome.\n"}]}]}}

In Ghana maternal mortality ratio was 380 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2013. Skilled birth attendance has been shown to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity, yet in 2010 only 68 percent of mothers in Ghana gave birth with the assistance of skilled birth attendants. In 2005, the Ghana Health Service piloted a strategy that involved using the integrated Community-based Health Planning and Services (CHPS) program and training Community Health Officers (CHOs) as midwives to address the gap in skilled attendance in rural Upper East Region (UER). The study assesses the feasibility of and extent to which the skilled delivery program has been implemented as an integrated component of the existing CHPS, and documents the benefits and challenges of the integrated program. We employed an intrinsic case study design with a qualitative methodology. We conducted 41 in-depth interviews with health professionals and community stakeholders. We used a purposive sampling technique to identify and interview our respondents. The CHO-midwives provide integrated services that include skilled delivery in CHPS zones. The midwives collaborate with District Assemblies, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and communities to offer skilled delivery services in rural communities. They refer pregnant women with complications to district hospitals and health centers for care, and there has been observed improvement in the referral system. Stakeholders reported community members' access to skilled attendants at birth, health education, antenatal attendance and postnatal care in rural communities. The CHO-midwives are provided with financial and non-financial incentives to motivate them for optimal work performance. The primary challenges that remain include inadequate numbers of CHO-midwives, insufficient transportation, and infrastructure weaknesses. Our study demonstrates that CHOs can successfully be trained as midwives and deployed to provide skilled delivery services at the doorsteps of rural households. The integration of the skilled delivery program with the CHPS program appears to be an effective model for improving access to skilled birth attendance in rural communities of the UER of Ghana.\n \nResidents from aged care facilities make up a considerable proportion of ED presentations. There is evidence that many residents transferred from aged care facilities to EDs could be managed by primary care services. The present study aimed to describe the characteristics of residents transferred from residential aged care facilities to EDs, and to evaluate the appropriateness and cost of these presentations. A retrospective review of ED records was undertaken for residents transferred from residential aged care facilities to two EDs in Melbourne, Victoria, in 2012. Data examined included residents' mode and time of arrival to ED, presenting complaint, triage category, procedures within ED, diagnosis, length of stay, and disposition. Data were examined against a previously established tool to identify resident transfers that might be 'potentially avoidable'. There were 2880 resident transfers included in the sample, of which 408 transfers were randomly selected for scrutiny of documentation. Seventy-one residents (17.4%) were identified as being potentially avoidable transfers. Many resident transfers might have been avoided with better primary care services in place. Future strategies to improve resident care might include aged care staff skill mix and the availability of outreach or primary care services.\n"}]}]}}

Although selective and non-selective methods of preoperative carotid screening have been advocated, it remains unclear if this screening is clinically relevant. To test whether selective carotid screening is as effective as non-selective screening in detecting significant carotid disease. The case records of patients consecutively undergoing CAB were reviewed. Patients were stratified retrospectively into high- or low-risk groups according to risk factors for significant carotid stenosis and perioperative stroke Overall, 205 consecutive patients underwent preoperative carotid screening. The prevalence of significant carotid stenosis was 5.8%. Univariate analysis confirmed that PVD (P=0.005), carotid bruit (P=0.003) and diabetes mellitus (P=0.05) were significant risk factors for stenosis. Carotid stenosis was a risk factor for stroke (P=0.03). Prevalence of carotid stenosis was higher in the high-risk group (9.1%) than the low-risk group (1.2%) (P<0.05). All concomitant or staged carotid endarterectomies/CAB (5/205) and all patients who had perioperative strokes (5/205) were in the high-risk group (P=0.01). In our cohort, selective screening of patients aged >70 years, with carotid bruit, a history of cerebrovascular disease, diabetes mellitus or PVD would have reduced the screening load by 40%, with trivial impact on surgical management or neurological outcomes.\n \nTo compare hospital outcomes of on-pump and off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery. From 1997 to 2000, primary coronary artery bypass grafting was performed in 481 patients off pump and in 3231 patients on pump. Hospital outcomes were compared between propensity-matched pairs of 406 on-pump and 406 off-pump patients. The 2 groups were similar in age (P =.9), left ventricular function (P =.7), extent of coronary artery disease (P =.5), carotid artery disease (P =.4), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P =.5). However, off-pump patients had more previous strokes (P =.05) and peripheral vascular disease (P =.02); on-pump patients had a higher preoperative New York Heart Association class (P =.01). In the matched pairs the mean number of bypass grafts was 2.8 +/- 1.0 in off-pump patients and 3.5 +/- 1.1 in on-pump patients (P <.001). Fewer grafts were performed to the circumflex (P <.001) and right coronary (P =.006) artery systems in the off-pump patients. Postoperative mortality, stroke, myocardial infarction, and reoperation for bleeding were similar in the 2 groups. There was more encephalopathy (P =.02), sternal wound infection (P =.04), red blood cell use (P =.002), and renal failure requiring dialysis (P =.03) in the on-pump patients. Both off- and on-pump procedures produced excellent early clinical results with low mortality. An advantage of an off-pump operation was less postoperative morbidity; however, less complete revascularization introduced uncertainty about late results. A disadvantage of on-pump bypass was higher morbidity that seemed attributable to cardiopulmonary bypass.\n"}]}]}}

The purpose of this study was to characterize and classify mesocolon invasion from gastric cancer. We examined 806 patients who underwent surgery for advanced gastric carcinoma from 1992 to 2007 at the Department of Surgery, Gangnam Severance Hospital, Korea. Among these, patients who showed macroscopically direct invasion into the mesocolon were compared to other patients with advanced gastric cancer. The curability, number and extent of nodal metastasis, and the survival of the mesocolon invasion group were significantly worse than these factors in the T3 group. However, the survival of the mesocolon invasion group after curative resection was much better than that of patients who had incurable factors. Mesocolon invasion should be included in T4 for the staging of gastric cancer.\n \nDickkopf-3 (DKK3) may act as a tumor suppressor as it is down-regulated in various types of cancer. This study assessed the DKK3 protein expression in gastric cancer and its potential value as a prognostic marker. DKK3 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 158 gastric cancer samples from patients who underwent gastrectomy from 2002 to 2008. Clinicopathological parameters and survival data were analyzed. Loss of DKK3 expression was found in 64 of 158 (40.5%) samples, and it was associated with advanced T stage (p < 0.001), lymph node metastasis (p < 0.001), UICC TNM stage (p < 0.001), tumor location (p = 0.029), lymphovascular invasion (p = 0.035), and perineural invasion (p = 0.032). Patients without DKK3 expression in tumor cells had a significantly worse disease-free and overall survival than those with DKK3 expression (p < 0.001, and p = 0.001, respectively). TNM stage (p = 0.028 and p < 0.001, respectively) and residual tumor (p < 0.001 and p = 0.003, respectively) were independent predictors of disease-free and overall survival. Based on the preoperative clinical stage assessed by computed tomography (CT), loss of DKK3 expression was predominantly associated with worse prognosis in patients with clinically node-negative advanced gastric cancer (AGC). The combination of DKK3 expression status and CT increased the accuracy of CT staging for predicting lymph node involvement from 71.5 to 80.0% in AGC patients. Loss of DKK3 protein expression was significantly associated with poor survival in patients with gastric cancer and was strongly correlated with the TNM stage. DKK3 might be a potential biomarker of lymph node involvement that can improve the predictive power of CT.\n"}]}]}}

To better evaluate fetal renal function new biochemical (serum and urine) fetal markers have been introduced in the literature. However, they are only available at select centers and always requiring an invasive approach. Furthermore, paucity of normal controls sometimes makes interpretation of results difficult. Owing to this growing interest towards biochemical evaluation of fetal renal function, assessment of amniotic fluid, which is mostly expression of fetal urination, has progressively fallen into disrepute, and studies comparing the amount of amniotic fluid with renal function are scant. In a 3-year period 28 cases of bilateral obstructive uropathy were seen prenatally at the Artemisia Medical Center. All cases were initially reviewed at 17 to 20 weeks of gestation when a distended fetal bladder with thickened wall and enlarged kidneys were visualized. At the same time ultrasonographic assessment of amniotic fluid was performed by calculating the amniotic fluid index. An amniotic fluid index less than the 25th percentile was considered below average and an index less below the 5th percentile was considered oligohydramnios, whereas an index between 50th and 75th percentiles was considered normal. All cases were subsequently evaluated for renal function up to age 1 year. Impaired renal function was defined as a serum creatinine greater than 1.2 mg/dl before age 1 year. Of the 28 cases 18 had an index of oligohydramnios (group 1) and 10 had a normal index (group 2). No significant variations were observed in amniotic fluid index at repeated consultations throughout pregnancy. Two cases in group 1 and 1 case in group 2 were lost to followup while in the other group 1 cases intrauterine death occurred. Bilateral obstructive uropathy was confirmed in all instances after birth as valves in 18 cases and urethral atresia in 3. Of the 12 surviving group 1 cases there were 3 neonatal deaths from severe lung hypoplasia, and in the remaining 9 cases mean serum creatinine at each evaluation before age 1 year was 1.3 +/- 0.2 mg/dl. All patients in group 2 survived with a mean serum creatinine at each evaluation of 0.6 +/- 0.1 mg/dl (p <0.05). Despite widespread use of prenatal biochemistry, evaluation of amniotic fluid by the amniotic fluid index remains a reproducible and inexpensive method to predict renal function in cases of bilateral obstructive uropathy of any origin. It retains its validity not only in severe, but also in milder reductions. Conversely, intact amniotic fluid mostly invariably predicts normal renal function at long-term evaluation. For a better understanding of the disease such information is to be promptly conveyed to the prospective parents at each prenatal consultation.\n \nThe incidence of lung cancer cases among HIV-infected individuals is increasing with time. It is unclear whether HIV-infected individuals receive the same care for lung cancer as immunocompetent patients because of comorbidities, the potential for interaction between antiretroviral agents and cancer chemotherapy, and concerns regarding complications related to treatment or infection. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of HIV infection on receipt of guidance-concordant care, and its impact on overall survival among non-small cell lung cancer Medicare beneficiaries. The study design was a matched case-control design where each HIV patient was matched by age group, sex, race, and lung cancer stage at diagnosis with 20 controls randomly selected among those who were not HIV infected. The patients included in this study were Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer between 1998 and 2007, who qualified for Medicare on the basis of age and were 65 years of age or older at the time of lung cancer diagnosis. HIV infection status was based on Medicare claims data. A total of 174 HIV cases and 3480 controls were included in the analysis. Odds ratios for receiving guidance-concordant care and hazard ratios for overall survival were estimated. HIV infection was not independently associated with the receipt of guidance-concordant care. Among stage I/II patients, median survival times were 26 and 43 months, respectively, for those with and without HIV infection (odds ratio=1.48, P=0.021). HIV infection was not associated with receipt of guidance-concordant care but reduced survival in early-stage patients.\n"}]}]}}

We conducted a population-based case-referent study of 25- to 74-year-old stroke patients with, for each case of a patient who was on statin treatment at the onset of stroke (n=125), 2 referent patients who were not treated with statins but were matched for age, gender, year of onset, and stroke subtype (n=250).

Prognostic factors were, in general, more unfavorable among patients on statins. When this was adjusted for in a logistic regression model, the use of statins was a moderately strong but statistically nonsignificant predictor of discharge to home (multiple-adjusted odds ratio 1.42, 95% CI 0.90 to 2.22).

There were no significant differences in bile duct injury or postoperative complications between the groups. The length of preoperative, postoperative, and total hospital stay was longer before 2008. ELC is a safe and effective therapeutic strategy for AC.

Studies show that women avoid mammogram because of fear of pain, diagnosis, and radiation. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a radiolucent pad (MammoPad; Hologic Inc, Bedford [MA], US) during screening mammogram to reduce pain in Chinese patients and the possibility of glandular dose reduction. This case series was conducted in a private hospital in Hong Kong. Between November 2011 and January 2012, a total of 100 Chinese patients were recruited to our study. Left mammogram was performed without MammoPad and served as a control. Right mammogram was performed with the radiolucent MammoPad. All patients were then requested to complete a simple questionnaire. The degree of pain and discomfort was rated on a 0-10 numeric analogue scale. Significant reduction in discomfort was defined as a decrease of 10% or more. Of the 100 patients enrolled in this study, 66.3% of women reported at least a 10% reduction in the level of discomfort with the use of MammoPad. No statistical differences between age, breast size, and the level of discomfort were found. The use of MammoPad significantly reduced the level of discomfort experienced during mammography. Radiation dose was also reduced.\n \nThis study investigated the level of implementation of and adherence to smoke-free policies in two major sporting venues in Perth. Smoking status and attitude toward the smoke-free policies in the venues were determined in a random sample of spectators as they entered each venue. An observational study of randomly selected non-smoking seated areas in each venue was conducted on the same day to determine compliance with smoke-free policies. A butt-count was conducted to validate these observations. There was a high level of both awareness and agreement with the smoke-free policies, however, this level of agreement was higher in non-smokers than smokers. The results of the observational study and the butt-count indicated that the policies were implemented and there was a high level of adherence with the smoke-free policy at both venues. The results provide further evidence that smoke-free policies in sporting venues are both supported and adhered to by spectators. The implementation of the smoke-free policies at venues is highly effective in protecting non-smokers from the effects of environmental tobacco smoke.\n"}]}]}}

The objective of the current study was to determine whether the survival of women with recurrent breast cancer has improved from 1974 to 2000. The authors analyzed the survival experience of 834 women who developed recurrent breast cancer between November 1974 and December 2000. All patients had been treated previously with adjuvant anthracycline-based protocols. Patients were divided into five consecutive groups based on year of breast cancer recurrence, and survival was compared across the five groups. Because some prognostic variables were divided unevenly divided among the cohorts, a multivariate model was created to determine the association of year of recurrence and survival after accounting for other prognostic factors. In the unadjusted analysis, there was a statistically significant improvement in survival across the five groups, and the more recent cohorts had longer survival (P < 0.001). Other variables that predicted longer survival after breast cancer recurrence included smaller initial tumor size, lower stage of disease, fewer lymph nodes involved, longer disease-free interval, estrogen receptor-positive tumors, and nonvisceral dominant site of disease recurrence. In the multivariate analysis, which adjusted for these prognostic factors, year of recurrence was associated with a trend toward improved survival, with a 1% reduction in risk for each increasing year. For these cohorts of patients, the authors present data suggesting that the prognosis for patients with recurrent breast cancer improved between 1974 and 2000.\n"}]}]}}

To investigate a large sample of pterygia for the presence of HPV in order to clarify the putative association between pterygia and HPV. 100 specimens of pterygium from Danish patients and 20 normal conjunctival biopsy specimens were investigated for the presence of HPV with PCR technique using beta-globin primers to access the quality of the extracted DNA and the HPV primers MY09/11 and GP5+/6+.

Using koilocytosis as a marker, the rate of \"active\" cervical lesions was compared with the rate of \"non active\" cervical lesions in patients with \"active\" versus \"non active\" vaginal lesions. Finally, the rates of mild and severe cervical lesions were compared among each group of VAIN (low-grade, high-grade, with or without koilocytosis).

Angioplasty registries, while suggesting a benefit, are subject to selection bias, and clinical trials have been underpowered to detect early benefits. If an invasive strategy is beneficial in this population, patients admitted to hospitals with onsite coronary revascularization might be expected to have a better prognosis. We sought to determine whether access to cardiovascular resources at the admitting hospital influenced the prognosis of patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock. By use of the Cooperative Cardiovascular Project database (a retrospective medical record review of Medicare patients discharged with acute myocardial infarction), we identified patients aged > or =65 years whose myocardial infarction was complicated by cardiogenic shock. Of the 601 patients with cardiogenic shock, 287 (47.8%) were admitted to hospitals without revascularization services and 314 (52.2%) were admitted to hospitals with coronary angioplasty and coronary artery bypass surgery facilities. Clinical characteristics were similar across the subgroups. Patients admitted to hospitals with revascularization services were more likely to undergo coronary revascularization during the index hospitalization and during the first month after acute myocardial infarction. After adjustment for demographic, clinical, hospital, and treatment strategies, the presence of onsite revascularization services was not associated with a significantly lower 30-day (odds ratio 0.83, 95% CI 0.47, 1.45) or 1-year mortality (odds ratio 0.91, 95% CI 0.49, 1.72). In a community-based cohort, patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock did not have significantly different adjusted 30-day and 1-year mortality, irrespective of the revascularization capabilities of the admitting hospital.\n \nWe addressed the question whether in patients with cardiac chest pain referred for stress myocardial perfusion scintigraphy, Tc-99m MIBI SPECT stress imaging should always be followed by a rest imaging procedure. Using Tc-99m MIBI imaging a stress rest sequence is usually performed implying that the resting study always follows the stress study irrespective of the results of the stress study. As a normal stress study would eliminate a subsequent resting study, it appears desirable to potentially define certain subsets of patients in whom a normal stress study can be expected in order to determine a more selective referral approach to the nuclear medicine department. The consequences of such a more streamlined approach would less impose on the logistics of the department of nuclear medicine, with decrease of investigation time, radiation dose, and costs in a time of retrenchment in the medical sector. A consecutive series of 460 patients (mean age 58.2 years) was studied who were stratified to 269 patients without prior myocardial infarction, and to 191 patients with documented evidence of a previously sustained myocardial infarction. All patients underwent Tc-99m MIBI SPECT imaging according to a two-day stress-rest protocol. Patients with and without a previous myocardial infarction showed suboptimal overall predictive accuracies for the exercise electrocardiograms (58% and 60%, respectively). In the total group of 460 patients, 94 (20%) patients showed a normal stress-rest Tc-99m MIBI SPECT; this occurred in 86/269 (32%) patients without a previous myocardial infarction and in only 8/191 (4%) patients with a previous myocardial infarction. Patients with a stress defect at Tc-99m MIBI SPECT imaging should always undergo a resting SPECT study irrespective of the clinical and stress electrocardiographic findings. As patients without a previous myocardial infarction had a normal stress SPECT study in almost one-third (32%) of patients compared to only 4% in patients with a previously myocardial infarction, it may be useful to employ different referral and imaging strategies i.e., a stress-only versus a stress-rest procedure. To schedule referring patients differently according to the presence or absence of a previously sustained myocardial infarction may be cost-saving, less demanding for the nuclear medicine personnel, and patient-convenient. In addition, a stress-only imaging procedure reduces radiation exposure to the individual patient.\n"}]}]}}

The aim of this study is to identify the factors associated with the use of sphincter-preserving surgery and to quantify the potential for an increase in sphincter preservation. This population-based retrospective cohort study used patient-level data collected through a comprehensive, standardized review of hospital inpatient and outpatient medical records and cancer center charts. This study was conducted in all hospitals providing rectal cancer surgery in a Canadian province. All patients with a new diagnosis of rectal cancer from July 1, 2002 to June 30, 2006 who underwent potentially curative radical surgery were included. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with receiving a permanent colostomy. Patients were categorized as having received an appropriate or potentially inappropriate colostomy based on a priori determined patient, tumor, operative, and pathologic criteria. Of 466 patients who underwent radical surgery, 48% received a permanent colostomy. There was significant variation in the rate of sphincter-preserving surgery among the 10 hospitals that provided rectal cancer care (12%-73%, p = 0.0001). On multivariate analysis, male sex, low tumor height, and increasing tumor stage were associated with the receipt of a permanent colostomy. Among patients who received a permanent stoma, 65 of 224 (29%) patients received a potentially inappropriate stoma. On multivariate analysis, male sex and treatment in a medium- or low-volume hospital was associated with the receipt of a potentially inappropriate colostomy. This study was limited by its retrospective design. These data suggest that the receipt of a permanent colostomy by many patients with rectal cancer may be inappropriate, and there is potential to increase the use of sphincter-preserving surgery in patients with rectal cancer.\n"}]}]}}

Recipient comorbidities were evaluated for any effect on the SAS and then globally assessed for any relationship with intensive care unit (ICU) admission, need for dialysis, creatinine at discharge, length of stay, incremental, and total cost of transplantation. The hypothesis for this study is that a low SAS will be a statistically significant predictor of postoperative morbidity and associated costs. This was an institutional review board (IRB)-approved retrospective longitudinal cohort study on 204 solitary kidney transplant recipients (2009-2011). Patients were divided into 2 groups Sixty-five percent of patients had an SAS of 7 or lower, while 35% had an SAS of 8 and higher. Recipients with a history of stroke were 88% more likely to be in the low-moderate SAS group (P = .017). Patients with lower SASs trended toward having less extended criteria donors (0.097) but were more likely to be admitted to the ICU (P = .043), leading to significantly higher transplant event hospitalization costs. Higher SASs were more likely to be readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of discharge (P = .027), leading to higher 30-day postdischarge costs (P = .014). Readmission rates, however, and 30-day follow-up costs were similar between SAS groups after controlling for donor characteristics, specifically donor marginality and recipient estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The findings of this study suggest that a history of stroke in the recipient may lend to a lower SAS and that a low SAS is associated with ICU admission following transplant, leading to higher hospital costs.\n"}]}]}}

Time to insertion and first ventilation was 83.2 \u00b1 29 s. No significant difference related to previous BLS training (P = 0.85), technical education (P = 0.07) or gender could be demonstrated (P = 0.25). In manikin laypersons could insert LMAS in the correct direction after onsite instruction by a simple manual with a high success rate. This indicates some basic procedural understanding and intellectual transfer in principle. Operating errors (n = 91) were frequently not recognized and corrected (n = 77). Improvements in labeling and the quality of instructional photographs may reduce individual error and may optimize understanding.\n \nPropofol has been found to depress the laryngeal reflexes. We studied whether this property could be utilized to relieve laryngeal spasm. This study was conducted over a period of 3 years, and included children aged 3-10 years, ASA status I and II. Most of the children were undergoing minor surgical procedures, under general anaesthesia with Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA trade mark ) and caudal epidural analgesia. During this period, 20 patients developed laryngeal spasm on removal of the LMA at the end of surgery. Initially, they all were treated with 100% O2, with gentle positive pressure ventilation. Out of 20 patients, seven responded well with 100% O2 and gentle positive pressure ventilation. The remaining 13 were treated with a small dose of propofol (0.8 mg.kg-1 body weight). Laryngeal spasm was relieved successfully in 10 patients and three patients required intubation to improve their oxygenation. Propofol in a small dose (0.8 mg.kg-1 body weight) was a useful drug to relieve laryngeal spasm in most children (76.9%) following the removal of the LMA. Because it was not found to be effective in all patients, succinylcholine still has a role to play in critical conditions. However, we recommend propofol as a suitable alternative for relieving laryngeal spasm in situations where succinylcholine is contraindicated.\n"}]}]}}

Intraobserver reproducibility Although the SLBM is quite repeatable, it underestimates mesopic pupil size and shows a too wide range of agreement with CIP. SLBM shows low sensitivity in detecting pupils larger than 6\u00a0mm, which may be misleading when planning anterior segment surgery.

The sample comprised of 100 autopsy specimens from South Indian population. INA was measured using software-aided processing of digital photographs. Length of the ISON was measured on each side using Vernier calipers. RAPL of the OC was noted during dissection. These were analysed with statistical methods. RAPL of OC was found to be prefixed in 24\u00a0%, normofixed in 65\u00a0% and postfixed in 11\u00a0%. The INA had an overall mean of 69.9\u00b0 (SD 9.29\u00b0). ANOVA confirmed statistically significant difference in INA among different groups; the corresponding mean value for the group was as follows The INA is wider when OC is prefixed, intermediate when normofixed and narrowed when postfixed. This observation throws light on the possibility of using INA as a marker of RAPL of OC. As INA can be measured in axial MRI sections, it can be used in differentiation of the cases with prefixed OC from others during pre-operative work up for pituitary surgeries and to identify individuals 'at risk' during subfrontal approach for pituitary lesions.\n"}]}]}}

Medical records of 220 patients hospitalized for acute diverticulitis between June 1, 2002 and September 1, 2009 were reviewed. Acute diverticulitis was diagnosed by clinical criteria and characteristic CT findings. Fifteen patients were excluded either because of questionable CT or hematochezia. Mean age was 61.8\u00b114.3 years (61% females). Clinical parameters, laboratory results, imaging, endoscopic and histopathological reports, and long-term patients' outcome were analyzed. One hundred patients (aged 61.8\u00b113.3 y, 54.1% females), underwent an early (4 to 6 wk) colonoscopy after hospital discharge. There were no significant differences in patients' characteristics or survival between those with or without colonoscopy (4\u00b11.9 vs. 4.2\u00b12.1 y, P=0.62). No colonic malignancy was detected. However, in 32 patients (32%) at least 1 polyp was found. Only 1 was determined as an advanced adenoma. No new or different diagnosis was made after colonoscopy. Our results suggest that colonoscopy does not affect the management of patients with acute diverticulitis nor alter the outcome. The current practice of a routine colonoscopy after acute diverticulitis, diagnosed by typical clinical symptoms and CT needs to be reevaluated.\n \nAcute diverticulitis has been traditionally associated with worse outcome in young patients, indicating a more aggressive surgical approach is required for them. The aim of this study was to assess whether acute diverticulitis was more virulent in young patients. A retrospective, cross-sectional study included all patients who were admitted for a first episode of acute diverticulitis between January 2004 and December 2013. The patients were divided into two groups (\u226450 years and >50 years) based on their age. Patients' characteristics, clinical and surgical data were recorded and analyzed. Overall, 636 patients were included in the database, including 177 (27.8%) in the younger group and 459 in the elder group. There were no significant differences between the groups in disease complexity, peritonitis, laboratory work-up, vital signs on presentation, bowel obstruction or the presence of fistula and abscess in need of drainage.

Length of hospital stay (P\u2009=\u20090.0001) was longer and postoperative complications were more common in the elder patients. The clinical presentation of acute diverticulitis does not seem to be worse in the young population. Younger patients tend to have a more severe presentation on CT scan and more readmissions, but this did not translate to a more severe disease course.\n"}]}]}}

Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to investigate the relation between IADLs and dementia. Age, sex, education, depression, and cognitive measures (Mini-Mental State Examination and verbal memory) were included in the model. Five hundred thirty-one participants had baseline and 1-year follow-up assessments; 69 (13.0%) of these had developed dementia at 1-year follow-up. At 2-year follow-up, 481 participants were seen, of whom 100 (20.8%) had developed dementia. Participants with IADL disabilities at baseline had a higher conversion rate (24.4%) than participants without IADL disabilities (16.7%) (chi-square\u00a0=\u00a04.28, degrees of freedom\u00a0=\u00a01, P\u00a0=\u00a0.04).

We examined the ethical implications of cold calling in a study of subjects with defined neurotic disorders followed up 12 years after initial assessment carried out to determine outcome in terms of symptoms, social functioning, and contact with health services. The patients concerned were asked at original assessment if they would agree to be followed up subsequently and although they agreed no time limit was put on this. To decide if cold calling was ethically justifiable and, if so, to set guidelines for researchers. The study was a cohort study of patients with neurotic disorder treated initially for 10 weeks in a randomised controlled trial. At follow up by a research medical practitioner 18 of the 210 patients had died and of the remaining 192 patients 186 (97%) were seen or had a telephone interview. Four patients refused and two others did not have interviews but agreed to some data being obtained. However, only 104 patients (54%) responded to letters inviting them to make an appointment or to refuse contact and the remainder were followed up by cold calling, with most patients agreeing readily to the research interview. The findings illustrate the dilemma of the need to get the maximum possible data from such studies to achieve scientific validity (and thereby justify the ethics of the study) and the protection of subjects' privacy and autonomy. More attention needs to be paid to consent procedures if cold calling is to be defended on ethical grounds but it is unreasonable to expect this to be obtained at the beginning of a research study in a way that satisfies the requirements for informed consent. A suggested way forward is to obtain written consent for the research at the time that cold calling takes place before beginning the research.\n"}]}]}}

To determine whether there are clinical differences between patients with functional dyspepsia and Helicobacter pylori-associated dyspepsia that enable their a priori identification and to know the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection in patients with functional dyspepsia. A total of 578 patients with dyspepsia with no significant lesions detectable through endoscopy were divided into 2 groups according to the presence of Helicobacter pylori. The clinical characteristics, medical history, comorbidities, and use of health resources were compared between the two groups. A sub-analysis pairing the groups by age and sex in a 1:1 ratio was carried out to reduce bias. A total of 336 patients infected with Helicobacter pylori were compared with 242 non-infected patients. The prevalence of infection in the patients with dyspeptic symptoms and no endoscopically detectable lesions was 58%. The initial analysis showed that the cases with dyspepsia and Helicobacter pylori infection were more frequently associated with overweight, obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, and metabolic syndrome, but the paired analysis nullified all these differences.

A specific aim was to describe differences depending on disability pension diagnoses, and how the results were modified by sex and age. The study comprised representative samples of Swedish women and men, who had been interviewed in any of the annual Swedish Surveys of Living Conditions between 1990 and 2007. Information on disability pension and diagnoses was added from the Swedish Social Insurance Agency's database (1991-2011). The mean number of years of follow-up for the 53920 women and men was twelve years (SD 5.5), and the study base was restricted to the ages 20 to 64 years of age. The predictors were related to disability pension by Cox's proportional hazards regression. Social isolation and low societal participation were associated with future disability pension also after control for age, year of interview, socio demographic conditions and self reported longstanding illness. Lone individuals were at increased risk of disability pension, and the effect of living without children was modified by sex and age. An increase in risk was particularly noticeable among younger women who reported that they had sparse contacts with others, and no close friend. Both women and men who reported that they did not participate in political discussions and who could not appeal on a decision by a public authority were also at increased risk. The effects of social isolation were mainly attributed to disability pension with mental diagnoses, and to younger individuals. The study suggests that social isolation and low societal participation are predictors of future disability pension. Social isolation and low societal participation increased particularly the risk of future disability pension in mental diagnoses among younger individuals.\n"}]}]}}

Pain was diagnosed with FM (PFM+) in 17.3% of our MS patients, while 48.9% of them had chronic pain not FM type (PFM-); the prevalence of neuropathic pain in these 2 sub-groups was the same. PFM+ patients were prevalently females and had a higher EDSS than NoP. The PFM+ patients had a more pronounced depression than in the NoP group, and scored the worst in both physical and mental QoL. In our sample of MS patients we found a high prevalence of chronic pain, with those patients displaying a higher disability and a more severe depression. Moreover, FM frequency, significantly higher than that observed in the general population, was detected among the MS patients with chronic pain. FM occurrence was associated with a stronger impact on patients' QoL.\n"}]}]}}

We investigated for the first time whether in vitro combinations of 2ME with various chemotherapeutic compounds may result in an additive inhibitory effect on the proliferation of human ovary cancer cells. As a model two different human ovary cancer cell lines were used. All cell lines were incubated with equimolar concentrations of 2ME (0.8-25 microM) and the chemotherapeutics epirubicine, doxorubicine, paclitaxel, docetaxel, carboplatin, vinorelbine, 5-fluorouracil and mafosfamide. Proliferation was measured after four days using the ATP-chemosensitivity test. For both ovary cancer cell lines a significant additive effect of 2ME with epirubicine and carboplatin was observed at the lower concentration range of these chemotherapeutic substances. 2ME is able to enhance the antiproliferative activity of certain chemotherapeutics at pharmacological relevant concentrations. This estradiol metabolite is currently in a phase II trial in patients with refractary metastatic breast cancer and the tolerability has been shown to be very good. The combination of 2ME with chemotherapeutics may therefore offer a new clinically relevant treatment regimen for hormone-dependent cancer.\n \nThe purpose of this study was to compare clinical results of ICSI for different sperm morphology subgroups divided according to Kruger's classification system. This retrospectively study was conducted at Zeynep Kamil Training and Researching Hospital in Istanbul (Turkey). The study included 332 intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles. The patients were under 37 years of age with primary infertility who were admitted to the Department of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility, from January 2005 to June 2009. The patients were divided in three groups based on Kruger's strict criteria. Normal sperm morphology was less than 4% in group 1, between 4-14% in group 2, and greater than 14% in group 3. All patients underwent ICSI and embryo transfer (ET) following controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH). The groups were compared to the rates of fertilization, implantation, clinical pregnancy, abortion, and live birth. Pregnancy occurred in 132 (39.7%) of all ICSI cycles. There was no statistically significant difference between regarding groups regarding the rates of fertilization, implantation, clinical pregnancy, biochemical pregnancy, abortion, and live birth. The authors concluded that the normal sperm morphology defined by Kruger's strict criteria and sperm motility will not be able to predict prognosis of ICSI cycles.\n"}]}]}}

Assessing joint lines (JLs) by means of bony landmarks is inadvisable because of large variations in human anatomy. Because of the inherent symmetry of the human body, we hypothesised that JLs may be directly assessed by measuring the distances from the bony landmarks to the JL of the contralateral knee by means of radiographic images. Using scaled weight-bearing radiographs in anteroposterior view of both knees, two independent observers measured the distances from the fibular head, the medial and lateral epicondyle, and the adductor tubercle to the JL. A two-sided p value of \u22640.05 was considered statistically significant. Two hundred knees of 100 patients (50 men and 50 women) were examined. For the fibular head, the mean difference between the treated and the control knee was 0.0 mm with narrow confidence limits ranging from -1.1 to 1.1. As a new assessment method, we have suggested to assess the JL by means of radiographs of the contralateral knee. The most precise parameter was found to be the distance between the fibular head and the JL. The level of arthritis, age, gender, visibility of the landmarks, and misalignment did not influence measurement accuracy. This parameter is the first tibia-related landmark for assessing the JL, which advantageously corresponds to the tibia-first technique in revision surgery. Diagnostic Study, Level II.\n \nIn vivo comparative gap measurements were performed in three different patella positions (reduced, subluxated and everted) using offset-type-force-controlled-spreader-system. Prospectively, 50 knees were operated by total knee arthroplasty using a navigation-assisted gap-balancing technique. The offset-type-force-controlled-spreader-system was used for gap measurements. This commercially available instrument allows controllable tension in patella-reduced position. The mediolateral gaps of knee extension (0\u00b0) and flexion (90\u00b0) angle were recorded in three different patella positions; reduced, subluxated and everted. Any gap differences of more than 3 mm were considered as a meaningful difference. Correlation between the difference with the demographic data, preoperative radiologic alignment and intraoperative data was analysed. For statistical analysis, ANOVA and Pearson's correlation test were used. The gaps in patella eversion demonstrated smaller gaps both in knee extension and flexion position compared to the gaps of patella reduction position. The amount of decreased gaps was more definite in knee flexion position. Statistically significant difference was observed for the lateral gap of patella eversion compared to gap of patella reduction in knee flexion position (p < 0.05). There were notable cases of variability in knee flexion position. Significant portion of 12 (24 %) knees of patella subluxation and 33 (66 %) knees of patella evertion demonstrated either increased or decreased gaps in knee flexion position compared to the gaps of patella reduction position. The gaps in patella eversion demonstrated smaller gaps both in knee extension and flexion position compared to the gaps of patella reduction position. The amount of decreased gaps was more definite in knee flexion position. Therefore, the intraoperative patellar positioning has influence on the measurement of the joint gap. Keeping the patella in reduced position is important during gap balancing. I.\n"}]}]}}

These include the magnitude of postoperative alignment and the type of material used. The effect of component design and material on postoperative alignment, however, has not been explored. We retrospectively reviewed 89 patients who underwent UKR with robotic guidance. Patients were divided into two groups, according to whether they had received an all-polyethylene inlay component (Inlay group) or a metal-backed onlay component (Onlay group). We explored the magnitude of mechanical alignment correction obtained in both groups. Mean postoperative mechanical alignment was significantly closer to neutral in the Onlay group (mean=2.8\u00b0; 95% CI=2.4\u00b0, 3.2\u00b0) compared to the Inlay group (mean=3.9\u00b0; 95% CI=3.4\u00b0, 4.4\u00b0) (R2=0.65; P=0.003), adjusting for gender, BMI, age, side and preoperative mechanical alignment (Fig. 2). Further exploration revealed that the thickness of the tibial polyethyelene insert had a significant effect on postoperative alignment when added to the model (R2=0.68; P=0.01). Patients who received a metal-backed Onlay tibial component obtained better postoperative mechanical alignment compared to those who received all-polyethylene Inlay prostheses. The thicker overall construct of Onlay prostheses appears to be an important determinant of postoperative alignment. Considering their higher survivorship rates and improved postoperative mechanical alignment, Onlay prostheses should be the first option when performing medial UKR.\n \nOperative treatment of tibial fractures in children requires implants that do not violate open physes while maintaining tibial length and alignment. Both elastic stable intramedullary nails and external fixation can be utilized. We retrospectively reviewed our experience with these two techniques to determine if one is superior to the other. We retrospectively reviewed the operative records and trauma registries of three institutions within our hospital system and identified thirty-five consecutive patients with open physes who had undergone operative treatment of a tibial fracture between April 1997 and June 2004. Four patients were excluded because they had been managed with locked intramedullary nails or with pins and plaster. Of the thirty-one remaining patients, sixteen had been managed with elastic stable intramedullary nails and fifteen had been managed with unilateral external fixation. The clinical and radiographic outcomes were compared. The functional outcomes were compared with use of the Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument. Complications related to treatment, such as malunion, delayed union, nonunion, infection, and the need for subsequent surgical treatment also were compared. Thirty-one patients with thirty-one operatively treated tibial fractures were available for evaluation. Fifteen patients had been managed with external fixation. Seven of these patients had a closed fracture, and eight had an open fracture. There were seven healing complications in this group, including two delayed unions, three nonunions, and two malunions. Sixteen patients had been managed with elastic stable intramedullary nailing. Eleven patients had a closed fracture, and five had an open fracture. The mean time to union for the intramedullary nailing group (seven weeks) was significantly shorter than that for the external fixation group (eighteen weeks) (p < 0.01). The functional outcomes for the intramedullary nailing group were significantly better than those for the external fixation group in the categories of pain, happiness, sports, and global function (the mean of the mean scores of the first four categories) (p < 0.01 for these comparisons). When surgical stabilization of tibial fractures in children is indicated, we believe that the preferred method of fixation is with elastic stable intramedullary nailing.\n"}]}]}}

All these variables were submitted to univariate and multivariate analysis to establish their impact on survival. Only tumour size appeared to be significantly different between the 3 groups. On univariate analysis, invasion of the perirenal fat, lymph node involvement, distant metastases and VEGF expression were significantly associated with survival (p < 0.01). On multivariate analysis, lymph node involvement, distant metastases and VEGF expression (OR 6.07) were identified as independent predictive factors of survival. Progression of a pT3 tumour into the renal vein and vena cava is not associated with increased tumour expression of VEGF. However, VEGF is an independent prognostic factor in this group of poor prognosis renal tumours.\n \nThe 2002 primary tumor classification for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) does not distinguish between patients with tumor thrombus involving the renal vein only and those with inferior vena cava tumor thrombus below the diaphragm. We evaluated the association of tumor thrombus level and fat invasion with outcome to determine if further subclassification would improve the prognostic accuracy of the current classification. We studied 675 patients treated with radical nephrectomy or nephron sparing surgery for pT3a (206, 30.5%), pT3b (422, 62.5%), pT3c (19, 2.8%) or pT4 (28, 4.2%) RCC at the Mayo Clinic between 1970 and 2000. Associations with outcome were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression. There were 531 deaths from RCC at a median of 1.5 years following nephrectomy. Patients with pT3b RCC and level I, II or III tumor thrombus were significantly more likely to die of RCC compared to patients with pT3b RCC and level 0 tumor thrombus (risk ratio 1.62, p <0.001). Patients with peripheral perinephric or renal sinus fat invasion were also more likely to die of RCC compared to patients without fat invasion (risk ratio 1.87, p <0.001). Therefore, patients with pT3 RCC were reclassified into 4 groups as thrombus level 0 without fat invasion, fat invasion only, thrombus level 0 with fat invasion or thrombus level I, II or III without fat invasion, and thrombus level I, II or III with fat invasion or thrombus level IV. This reclassification significantly improved prediction of death from RCC compared with the current classification (c indexes of 0.61 versus 0.55, respectively). Further subclassification of the primary tumor classification for patients with pT3 RCC improved prognostic accuracy.\n"}]}]}}

We employed a retrospective survey methodology to investigate factors associated with deaths by injury and poisoning among young men aged 15-39 years (n = 268) in Merseyside and Cheshire during 1995. Data were collected from Coroner's inquest notes and General Practitioner records. The most common cause of death was poisoning by alcohol and drugs (29.1%, n = 78). A high proportion of cases were unemployed (39.4%, n = 106). Cases were also more likely to be single compared to the general population (74.2% vs 55.5%). Self-destructive behaviour was evident in 77% of deaths (n = 206). Alcohol and drug use are important contributory factors to injury and poisoning deaths. More research is needed into the effects of unemployment and being single on the health of young men, and to investigate the motivations behind risk taking and self-destructive behaviour.\n \nThe incidence of HIV and STIs increased among men who have sex with men (MSM) visiting our STI clinic in Amsterdam. Interestingly, HIV increased mainly among older (> or =35 years) MSM, whereas infection rates of rectal gonorrhoea increased mainly in younger men. To explore this discrepancy we compared trends in STIs and HIV in a cohort of young HIV negative homosexual men from 1984 until 2002. The study population included 863 men enrolled at < or =30 years of age from 1984 onward in the Amsterdam Cohort Studies (ACS). They had attended at least one of the 6 monthly follow up ACS visits at which they completed a questionnaire (including self reported gonorrhoea and syphilis episodes) and were tested for syphilis and HIV. Yearly trends in HIV and STI incidence and risk factors were analysed using Poisson regression. Mean age at enrollment was 25 years. The median follow up time was 4 years. Until 1995 trends in HIV and STI incidence were concurrent, however since 1995 there was a significant (p<0.05) increase in syphilis (0 to 1.4/100 person years (PY)) and gonorrhoea incidence (1.1 to 6.0/100 PY), but no change in HIV incidence (1.1 and 1.3/100 PY). The incidence of syphilis and gonorrhoea has increased among young homosexual men since 1995, while HIV incidence has remained stable. Increasing STI incidence underscores the potential for HIV spread among young homosexual men. However, several years of increasing STIs without HIV, makes the relation between STI incidence and HIV transmission a subject for debate.\n"}]}]}}

Data were collected by scoring of the obstetric files after the patient had delivered. We ascertained whether the obstetric history, syphilis testing, blood group testing, haemoglobin measurement and uterine growth assessment were performed during antenatal care along with whether appropriate action was taken. For intrapartum care, estimation of fetal weight, the performance of pelvimetry, blood pressure monitoring, urine testing, evaluation of head above pelvis, fetal heart rate monitoring, monitoring of contractions and plotting of cervical dilatation, and whether the appropriate actions were taken, were assessed. Eight of the 13 midwives at the two MOUs completed the PEP and all demonstrated an improvement in knowledge. Case notes of 303 patients from the various clinics were studied. There was no change in the referral patterns of any of the clinics during the study period. The obstetric history was well documented, but in no group was there a satisfactory response to a detected problem; appropriate action was taken in between 0% and 12% of cases. Syphilis testing was performed in 56-82% of cases, with no difference between the groups. The haemoglobin level was measured in only 4-15% of patients, with no difference before or after completion of the PEP. Where a problem in uterine growth was detected, an appropriate response occurred in 0-8% of patients and no difference before or after completion of the PEP was ascertained. In all groups, estimation of fetal weight and pelvimetry were seldom performed, the urine and fetal heart rate documentation were moderately well done and the blood pressure monitoring, assessment of head above pelvis, monitoring of contractions and plotting of cervical dilatation were usually performed. No differences before or after the PEP were detected. Where problems were detected, appropriate actions taken during labour improved, but not significantly. Completion of the obstetric manual of the PEP improved the knowledge of the midwives but no alteration in practice was detected.\n \nCyclosporin is advocated in the treatment of acute severe ulcerative colitis that has failed to respond to high-dose corticosteroid therapy. This approach is controversial, with critics highlighting the temporary nature of remissions and the potential for adverse effects. There have been few reports of the long-term outcome of those patients who do respond. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical outcome of all patients treated with cyclosporin at our institution over the past five years. We conducted a retrospective study of 46 patients who presented to a tertiary referral center. Initial responders were those who avoided colectomy; a sustained response was defined as a remission that lasted while the patient was taking oral cyclosporin and for three months after this therapy was discontinued. Thirty-two (69 percent) of 46 patients had an initial response to therapy, and 50 percent met criteria for a sustained response. Eleven of 23 sustained responders subsequently relapsed. At a mean of 22 months' follow-up, 26 percent of patients remain well and have never relapsed. Serious infective complications occurred in two patients, possibly attributable to therapy. No factors predictive of a likely response were identifiable on retrospective analysis. This study confirms the efficacy of cyclosporin in the management of severe ulcerative colitis. Although many initial responders subsequently relapse, such patients may benefit from having even a short time to adjust to the need for surgery. A substantial minority (26 percent) of all patients treated remain in long-term remission.\n"}]}]}}

The aim of this study was to observe how changes in perioperative and postoperative treatments affect the incidence of pulmonary complications in bariatric patients. This is a retrospective clinical study of 400 consecutive bariatric patients. The patients, who either underwent a sleeve gastrectomy or a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, were divided consecutively into four subgroups with different approaches to perioperative treatment. The first group (patients 0-100) was recovered in the intensive care unit with minimal mobilization (ICU). They had a urinary catheter and a drain. The second group (patients 101-200) was similar to the first group, but the patients used a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device intermittently (ICU-CPAP). The third group (patients 201-300) was recovered on a normal ward without a urinary catheter or a drain and used a CPAP device (ward-slow). The fourth group (patients 301-400) walked to the operating theater and was mobilized in the recovery room during the first 2\u00a0h after the operation (ward-fast). CPAP was also used. Primary endpoints were pulmonary complications, pneumonia, and infection, non-ultra descriptus (NUD). The number of pulmonary complications among the groups was significantly different. A long operation time increased the risk for infection (p\u2009<\u20090.001 95\u00a0% CI from 2.02 to 6.59\u00a0%). Operation time increases the risk for pulmonary complications.

Risks for sonographic short cervical length and recurrent SPTB were compared between women based on the clinical presentation of their prior preterm birth. Log-linear regression was used to control for confounders. Of 522 patients included in this study, 96 (18.4%) had prior ACD, 246 (47.1%) had prior PPROM, and 180 (34.5%) had prior PTL. Recurrent PTB occurred in 55.2% of patients with a history of ACD compared with 27.2% of those with PPROM and 32.2% with PTL (P = .001). The mean gestational age at delivery was significantly lower for those with a history of ACD (34.0 weeks) compared with women with prior PPROM (37.2 weeks) or PTL (37.0 weeks) (P = .001). The lowest mean cervical length prior to 24 weeks was significantly shorter in patients with a history of advanced cervical dilation when compared with the other clinical presentations.

However, this contention is based on small numbers of women. In this analysis of 12,937 women who were screened for bacterial vaginosis as part of a previously conducted clinical trial, the odds ratio of preterm birth (<7 weeks of gestation) for asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis-positive versus bacterial vaginosis-negative women was evaluated among women who were screened from 8 to 22 weeks of gestation. The odds ratio of preterm birth among bacterial vaginosis-positive versus bacterial vaginosis-negative women ranged from 1.1 to 1.6 and did not vary significantly according to the gestational age at which bacterial vaginosis was screened. The odds ratio for preterm birth did not vary significantly by gestational age at diagnosis when bacterial vaginosis was subdivided into Gram stain score 7 to 8 or 9 to 10.

This can be done either (i) acutely during the clamp study using high-dose insulin infusion, or (ii) slowly overnight preceding the clamp study using a low-dose insulin infusion. We assessed whether the choice of either of these methods to obtain euglycaemia biases subsequent assessment of glucose metabolism and insulin action. We studied seven obese Type 2 diabetic patients twice Basal plasma glucose levels (mean +/- sd) were 5.5 +/- 0.5 and 10.7 +/- 2.9 mmol/l in the + ON and - ON studies, respectively, and were clamped at -5.5 mmol/l. Basal rates of glucose production (GP) were similar in the + ON and - ON studies, 83 +/- 13 vs. 85 +/- 14 mg m-2 min-1 (NS), whereas basal rates of glucose disappearance (Rd) were lower in the + ON than in the - ON study, 84 +/- 8 vs. 91 +/- 11 mg m-2 min-1 (P = 0.02). During insulin infusion in the clamp period, rates of GP, 23 +/- 11 vs. 25 +/- 10 mg m-2 min-1, as well as rates of Rd, 133 +/- 32 vs. 139 +/- 37 mg m-2 min-1, were similar in the + ON and - ON studies, respectively (NS). Apart from basal rates of Rd, assessment of glucose turnover rates in euglycaemic clamp studies of Type 2 diabetic patients is not dependent on the method by which plasma glucose levels are lowered.\n"}]}]}}

The frequency of family history of psychiatric disorder was determined for each study as well as the relationship of family history to the presence of poststroke depression.

Because lysosomotropic amines can suppress major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigen presentation, their mechanism of action is potentially different from current immune suppressant drugs used to control GVHD such as cyclosporine. We investigated the use of cyclosporine and the lysosomotropic amines chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in combination for additive or synergistic immunosuppression on T-cell responses in vitro to MiHC and MHC in mice. We found that similar concentrations of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine suppress the T-cell response to MiHC in mice (C57BL/6 anti-BALB.B) and that lysosomotropic amines in combination with cyclosporine result in synergistic suppression of a proliferative response to MiHC. Similar suppression and synergy appear to be present in an alloreactive response (C57BL/6 anti-BALB/c). Direct inhibition by chloroquine of T-cell proliferative responses induced by anti-CD3epsilon in the absence of antigen-presenting cells is present at higher concentrations than that required to suppress responses to MiHC or MHC. Chloroquine appears to induce decreased T-cell viability at high concentrations. This effect does not appear to be due to decreased T-cell production of interleukin-2 or interferon-gamma. At lower concentrations (<25 microg/ml), chloroquine can also decrease the ability of antigen-presenting cells to stimulate an a C57BL/6 anti-BALB/c T-cell response and can inhibit MHC class II expression after activation with lipopolysaccharide. Lysosomotropic amines in combination with cyclosporine appear to be synergistic in the suppression of T-cell proliferation to MiHC and MHC. Use of chloroquine in combination with cyclosporine may result in improved control of GVHD.\n \nAn association between posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) and cyclosporine A (CsA) and OKT3 has often been postulated on the basis of retrospective studies, although a randomized study with PTLD as the endpoint will probably never be performed. Because focus on PTLD coincided with the use of these drugs, a bias could be suspected. In a retrospective, nonrandomized study, we reevaluated all lymphoma-like lesions arising in kidney-transplant patients grafted at our center during 1969 to 1998 and observed up to 2002. Case pathology was reviewed, and an association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection (and latency pattern) was assessed. We did not find any significant difference in the incidence of PTLDs when comparing the prednisolone/azathioprine, and CsA eras (P=0.89), the periods before or after OKT3 (P=0.61), and those before or after antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) (P=0.22). Occurrence time was shorter in the CsA (P=0.059), OKT3 (P=0.007), and ALG (P=0.007) eras. In the OKT3 era, 182 patients received, and 224 did not receive, OKT3; after the same observation time, there had been eight and five PTLDs, respectively (P=0.34). The use of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) was associated with a reduction in the number of PTLDs (P=0.01). EBV was detected in 16 of 21 (76%) cases. We found no evidence to implicate any one drug regime preferentially in the development of PTLDs. The risk of developing PTLD seems to be a result of the whole transplantation process, which includes the antigenicity of the foreign graft, the immunosuppression resulting in inadequate cytotoxic T-cell activity, and the result of EBV infection. An important minority of cases are EBV negative.\n"}]}]}}

Age at presentation, physical examination, ultrasonographic and intraoperative findings were recorded. Patients were followed after initial surgical intervention to determine the likelihood of developing a subsequent hydrocele or hernia. Thirty-seven patients were identified as presenting with neonatal torsion. Age of presentation averaged 3.5 days (range 1-14 days). Left-sided pathology was seen more commonly than the right, with a 25:12 distribution. All torsed testicles were nonviable. Twenty-two patients were noted to have a contralateral hydrocele at presentation. All hydroceles were opened through a scrotal approach at the time of contralateral scrotal fixation. No patient underwent an inguinal exploration to examine for a patent process vaginalis. None of the patients who presented with a hydrocele have developed a clinical hydrocele or hernia after an average 7.5 years (range 4.3-11.2) follow-up. We have demonstrated that approaching a contralateral hydrocele in cases of neonatal testicular torsion solely through a scrotal incision is safe and effective. Inguinal exploration was not performed in our study and our long-term results demonstrate that such an approach would have brought no additional benefit. In avoiding an inguinal approach we did not subject our patients to unnecessary risk of testicular or vasal injury. Contralateral hydrocele is commonly seen in cases of neonatal testicular torsion. In our experience this is a condition of minimal clinical significance and does not warrant formal inguinal exploration for treatment. This conservative management strategy minimizes the potential of contralateral spermatic cord injury in the neonate. The aims of the study were met.\n \nThe absence of a testis occurs for various reasons in children, but testicular prosthesis implantation in children is uncommon. The optimal time for prosthesis placement is still unclear, and its complication rate has been poorly studied in children. The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors of complications in cases of testicular prosthesis implantation in children. A monocentric, retrospective review was performed of children implanted with a testicular prosthesis between 2008 and 2014. All implantations were performed through an inguinal incision with a standardized procedure. Children were divided into two groups depending on the interval after orchiectomy Twenty-six patients (A, 15; B, 11) had a total of 38 testicular prostheses placements. Mean follow-up was 36.2 months. First surgery was performed at the mean age of 11.8 years (range 0-17.9) (A, 14.1; B, 8.1; P\u00a0=\u00a00.01) and testicular prosthesis implantation at the mean age of 14.7 years (range 9-18) (A, 14.3; B, 14.6) with a mean delay of 36.1 months (A, 1.3; B, 80.3). Indications were mainly spermatic cord torsion (27%), bilateral anorchia (27%), and testicular atrophy after cryptorchidism surgery (19.2%). Complications (10.5%) included two cases of extrusion, one infection and one migration. Patient 1 had a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia with testicle relapse 2 years after induction therapy. High-dose chemotherapy, total body irradiation and bilateral orchiectomies were performed, and bilateral prostheses were implanted 12 years after the end of chemotherapy. Complications happened 85 days after surgery. Patient 2 was followed-up for a proximal hypospadias. The tunica vaginalis flap, which was used during a redo urethroplasty, lead to testicular atrophy. Thirteen years after the last penile surgery, a testicular prosthesis was placed through an inguinal incision, and extrusion occurred 203 days after surgery. Bacterial cultures of the prostheses were sterile and histological review showed no sign of granuloma or graft rejection. The complication rate was significantly higher if the delay between the two surgeries exceeded 1 year (P\u00a0=\u00a00.01). Indications of orchiectomy, prior scrotal incision, and prosthesis size were not risk factors. Testicular prosthesis implantation was relatively safe in a pediatric cohort. The complication rate was significantly higher if the delay between the orchiectomy and the prosthetic placement exceeded 1 year. These results suggest that reducing the delay between orchiectomy and prosthesis implantation may lead to fewer complications.\n"}]}]}}

Only sphincterotomy up to the dentate line caused a significant change in anal incontinence (P = 0.016). Both groups had significantly lower anal resting pressures at 4 months postoperatively, compared with their corresponding preoperative levels (P = 0.005 and P = 0.007). The postoperative resting pressures did not differ significantly between the two groups (P = 0.273). By 12 months postoperatively, no treatment failures or recurrences were noted in the dentate line group (100 percent healing rate). In the fissure apex group, there was one nonhealing case and four recurrences, resulting in a 13.2 percent rate of treatment failure (P = 0.058). Sphincterotomy up to the dentate line provided a faster and definitive healing within the time limits of this study, but it was associated with a significant alteration in anal continence. In turn, sphincterotomy up to the fissure apex was free of significant disturbance of continence, but its healing effect was slower and it was prone to an insignificantly higher rate of treatment failure.\n \nComparison of characteristic features, radiology, management and recurrence pattern of fungal sinusitis between children and adults. A prospective study conducted in the department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh in which all the cases presenting with the features of allergic fungal sinusitis (AFS) between January 2000 and January 2005 were enrolled. These cases were divided into two groups, group 1 comprised of cases with age less than 15 years and group 2 with age more than 15 years. Detailed history, physical examination and nasal endoscopic examination and computed tomography (CT) scan of the paranasal sinuses was done in all the cases. The cases with prior history of sinonasal surgery were excluded from the study. All patients refractory to medical management were subjected to endoscopic sinus surgery. All the cases were followed up for a period ranging from 6 to 39 months to see for the recurrence. The data of both the groups was analysed statistically using chi square test. The study population comprised of 200 cases, with 68 cases in group 1 and 132 cases in group 2. The most common symptom in both the groups was presence of nasal obstruction. The children had higher incidence of having unilateral disease (46 out of 68) compared with adults, where it was 38 out of 132. The bony erosion was seen more often in group 1. Surgery was done endoscopically in all the cases. The intra orbital or intra cranial extension was seen in 58 cases of group 1 and 47 cases of group 2 (p<0.001). Recurrence was seen in 18 (15 with intraorbital and 3 with intracranial extension) cases in group 1 and 13 cases (11 with intraorbital and 2 with intracranial extension) in group 2 (p<0.005). In our study, we found a higher incidence of facial deformities, proptosis, intraorbital/intracranial extension and a higher rate of recurrence in group 1, therefore, suggesting a more aggressive nature of AFS in children than adults mandating an early diagnosis, proper management and regular follow up in these cases.\n"}]}]}}

A total of 189 patients with chronic hepatitis B and 51 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. The study group contained 120 (63.5%) males and 69 (36.5%) females, and the control group contained 25 males (49.0%) and 26 females (51%). In general, serum BMP-7 values of patients were higher than those of controls (p = 0.001). Serum BMP-7 values of patients with liver fibrosis of stages 1, 2, 3, or 4 were higher than control values (all p values = 0.01), but the serum BMP-7 levels of patients with stage 5 fibrosis were similar to that of controls. Associations between fibrosis stage and the serum levels of BMP-7, ALT, HBVDNA, platelets, and albumin were all statistically significant (p = 0.001). The AUROC for the BMP-7 level in advanced stage fibrosis was found to be 0.23. The data were analyzed using the binary logistic regression analysis (backward stepwise method) and BMP-7, HBVDNA, and platelet levels were found to be risk factors associated with fibrosis (p values 0.031, 0.040, and 0.001, respectively). BMP-7 may play anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrogenic roles in the pathogenesis of chronic hepatitis B infection.\n \nModern examination protocols for computed tomography (CT) often require high injection rates of iodinated contrast media (CM). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the maximum achievable flow rates and stability of different peripheral intravenous catheters (IVC) in vitro and to assess the feasibility of higher injection rates through small IVC in vivo. For in vitro experiments flow measurements followed by high pressure testing of different types of IVC (22, 20, and 18 gauge [G]) were performed. For the in vitro study 91 patients with already inserted 22 or 20G IVC who had been referred for CT received Iopamidol (300 mg iodine/ml) at flow rates between 2 and 5 ml/sec. Complications were documented. The maximal achievable flow rate of the tested IVC in vitro ranged from 5 to 8 ml/sec. No damage was observed during in vitro testing. The initially targeted in vivo flow rate was dropped in 33 of 91 (36 %) patients because the IVC could not be flushed adequately with saline before CM injection. Extravasation of CM occurred in 2 cases. In the remaining 58 patients the standard CT protocol was performed with flow rates of 3 ml/sec through 22G IVC and 5 ml/sec through 20G IVC, respectively. In this group, the extravasation of CM was observed twice (p > 0.05). Even with highly viscous CM, high flow rates can be applied in vitro in 22, 20, and 18G IVC without risking material damage. In vivo power injection of iodinated CM through 22G and 20G IVC seems to be safely achievable in the majority of patients with flow rates of up to 3 ml/sec and 5 ml/sec. Extravasation rates do not differ significantly between patients with high-flow or low-flow injections.\n"}]}]}}

To investigate the effect of a multimodal cervical physical therapy treatment on tinnitus complaints in patients with CST. Randomized controlled trial. Patients with a combination of severe subjective tinnitus (Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) All patients received cervical physical therapy for 6 weeks (12 sessions). Patients were randomized in an immediate-start therapy group (n\u00a0=\u00a019) and a 6-week delayed-start therapy group (n\u00a0=\u00a019). TFI and NBQ-scores were documented at baseline, after the wait-and-see period in the delayed-start group, after treatment and after 6 weeks follow-up. The Global Perceived Effect (GPE) was documented at all measuring moments, except at baseline. In all patients (n\u00a0=\u00a038) TFI and NBQ-scores decreased significantly after treatment (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04 and p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

NCT02016313.\n \nTo study the effectiveness of combined integral somatic and psychiatric treatment in a medical-psychiatric unit (MPU). Retrospective case-note study. The case notes of all patients admitted to the MPU at the VU Medical Center, Amsterdam, in 2011 were analysed. Data on reasons for referral and somatic and psychiatric diagnoses were collected. Using a global clinical assessment scale and the Health of the Nations Outcome Scales (HoNOS), data on psychiatric symptomology and limitations, behavioural problems, social problems and limitations associated with physical health problems were collected on both admission and discharge. In this way the effect of the admission period on various problems was determined. In 2011 there were 139 admissions to the MPU with a wide variation of somatic and psychiatric diagnoses. The average admission period was 9 days. Global clinical evaluation of the treatment goals set for somatic and psychiatric conditions showed that more than 90% and 85% of the treatment goals, respectively, were completely achieved. HoNOS scores showed a reduction in severity of both psychiatric and somatic problems. The total HoNOS-core was significantly reduced by nearly 3.5 points - a large effect size. The MPU has succeeded in its goal to deliver integral care to a very diverse group of patients with somatic and psychiatric co-morbidities. It is able to offer care to a vulnerable patient group in which it can be presumed that treatment on a non-integrated unit could not have been delivered or not delivered adequately, due to the complexity of their somatic and behavioural problems.\n"}]}]}}

There are very few studies which looked at detailed sputum and blood cell counts in a large cohort of asthmatics divided into inflammatory phenotypes. The purpose of this study was to analyze sputum cell counts, blood leukocytes and systemic inflammatory markers in these phenotypes, and investigate how those groups compared with healthy subjects. We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study on 833 asthmatics recruited from the University Asthma Clinic of Liege and compared them with 194 healthy subjects. Asthmatics were classified into inflammatory phenotypes. The total non-squamous cell count per gram of sputum was greater in mixed granulocytic and neutrophilic phenotypes as compared to eosinophilic, paucigranulocytic asthma and healthy subjects (p\u2009<\u20090.005). Sputum eosinophils (in absolute values and percentages) were increased in all asthma phenotypes including paucigranulocytic asthma, compared to healthy subjects (p\u2009<\u20090.005). Eosinophilic asthma showed higher absolute sputum neutrophil and lymphocyte counts than healthy subjects (p\u2009<\u20090.005), while neutrophilic asthmatics had a particularly low number of sputum macrophages and epithelial cells. All asthma phenotypes showed an increased blood leukocyte count compared to healthy subjects (p\u2009<\u20090.005), with paucigranulocytic asthmatics having also increased absolute blood eosinophils compared to healthy subjects (p\u2009<\u20090.005). Neutrophilic asthma had raised CRP and fibrinogen while eosinophilic asthma only showed raised fibrinogen compared to healthy subjects (p\u2009<\u20090.005). This study demonstrates that a significant eosinophilic inflammation is present across all categories of asthma, and that paucigranulocytic asthma may be seen as a low grade inflammatory disease.\n \nThe increasing prevalence and impact of obstructive lung diseases and new insights, reflected in clinical guidelines, have led to concerns about the diagnosis and therapy of asthma and COPD in primary care. In Germany diagnoses written in medical records are used for reimbursement, which may influence physicians' documentation behaviour. For that reason it is unclear to what respect ICD-10 codes reflect the real problems of the patients in general practice. The aim of this study was to assess the appropriateness of the recorded diagnoses and to determine what diagnostic information is used to guide medical treatment. All patients with lower airway symptoms (n = 857) who had attended six general practices between January and June 2003 were included into this cross sectional observational study. Patients were selected from the computerised medical record systems, focusing on ICD-10-codes concerning lower airway diseases (J20-J22, J40-J47, J98 and R05). The performed diagnostic procedures and actual medication for each identified patient were extracted manually. Then we examined the associations between recorded diagnoses, diagnostic procedures and prescribed treatment for asthma and COPD in general practice. Spirometry was used in 30% of the patients with a recorded diagnosis of asthma and in 58% of the patients with a recorded diagnosis of COPD. Logistic regression analysis showed an improved use of spirometry when inhaled corticosteroids were prescribed for asthma (OR = 5.2; CI 2.9-9.2) or COPD (OR = 4.7; CI 2.0-10.6). Spirometry was also used more often when sympathomimetics were prescribed (asthma This study revealed that spirometry was used more often when corticosteroids or sympathomimetics were prescribed. The findings suggest that treatment was based on diagnostic test results rather than on recorded diagnoses. The documented ICD-10 codes may not always reflect the real status of the patients. Thus medical care for asthma and COPD in general practice may be better than initially found on the basis of recorded diagnoses, although further improvement of practice patterns in asthma and COPD is still necessary.\n"}]}]}}

It is associated with hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance which is further aggravated during pregnancy. This mechanism has a pivotal role in the development of various complications during pregnancy. In the past few years, metformin, an insulin sensitizer, has been extensively evaluated for induction of ovulation. Its therapeutic use during pregnancy is, however, a recent strategy and is a debatable issue. At present, evidence is inadequate to support the long-term use of insulin-sensitizing agents during pregnancy. It is a challenge for both clinicians and researchers to provide good evidence of the safety of metformin for long-term use and during pregnancy. This study aimed to evaluate pregnancy outcomes in women with PCOS who conceived while on metformin treatment, and continued the medication for a variable length of time during pregnancy. This case-control study was conducted from January 2005 to December 2006 at the antenatal clinics of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Aga Khan University, Karachi, Pakistan. The sample included 137 infertile women with PCOS; of these, 105 conceived while taking metformin (cases), while 32 conceived spontaneously without metformin (controls). Outcomes were measured in three groups of cases which were formed according to the duration of use of metformin during pregnancy. Comparison was made between these groups and women with PCOS who conceived spontaneously. All 137 women in this study had a confirmed diagnosis of PCOS (Rotterdam criteria). These women were followed up during their course of pregnancy; data forms were completed once they had delivered. Cases were divided into three groups In women with PCOS, continuous use of metformin during pregnancy significantly reduced the rate of miscarriage, gestational diabetes requiring insulin treatment and fetal growth restriction. No congenital anomaly, intrauterine death or stillbirth was reported in this study.\n"}]}]}}

The volume delivered to the patient varies by the physical characteristics of the person and method. This study was designed to compare tidal volumes delivered by the squeezing method, physical characteristics and education and practice levels. 114 individuals trained in basic life support and bag-valve-mask ventilation participated in this study. Individual characteristics were obtained by the observer and the education and practice level were described by the subjects. Ventilation was delivered with a manual resuscitator connected to a microspirometer and volumes were measured. Subjects completed three procedures The mean (standard deviation) volumes for the one-handed method were 592.84 ml (SD 117.39), two-handed 644.24 ml (SD 144.7) and two-handed half-compression 458.31 ml (SD 120.91) (p<0.01). Tidal volume delivered by two hands was significantly greater than that delivered by one hand (r = 0.398, p<0.01). The physical aspects including hand size, volume and grip power had no correlation with the volume delivered. There were slight increases in tidal volume with education and practice, but correlation was weak (r = 0.213, r = 0.281, r = 0.131, p<0.01). The tidal volume delivered by a manual resuscitator shows large variations. There were significant differences in the volume delivered by compression methods, but physical characteristics are not a predictor of tidal volume delivery. The manual resuscitator is not a suitable device for accurate ventilation.\n \nTo predict the inspired concentrations achieved when nitrous oxide (N2O)/oxygen mixtures are administered to patients by way of a nasal cannula. The method used for estimating the FiN2O is based on one employed to calculate the FiO2 obtained with a nasal cannula. We assume a tidal volume of 500 ml, a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, an inspiratory time of 1 second, an expiratory time of 2 seconds, and an anatomic reservoir volume of 50 ml. The reservoir consists of the nose, the nasopharynx, and the oropharynx. Its volume is assumed to be one-third of the anatomic dead space. It is also assumed that during the last 0.5 second of expiration, there is negligible flow of expired respiratory gases. A 6 L/min flow from the cannula will completely fill the reservoir. The FiO2 or FiN2O is then calculated by assuming that during the 1 second inspiratory time period, the gases in the anatomic reservoir that are provided by the nasal cannula and a volume of air such that the sum of the components of the tidal volume equals 500 ml are inspired. Research laboratory of a university-affiliated metropolitan medical center. The calculated FiO2 values for 100% oxygen delivered by nasal cannula agree with those determined by others. The FiN2Os estimated were directly proportional to the cannula flow rate and the fraction of N2O delivered. At the maximum total flow rate considered, 6L/min flow, with 70% N2O (remainder O2) delivered to the nasal cannula, an FiN2O of only 0.21 was estimated due to the large volume of air inspired. The FiO2 under these conditions would only be 0.23. Our analysis shows that the maximum FiN2O achievable by using a nasal cannula is limited to 0.21 even with a 6 L/min flow of 70% N2O for the defined respiratory parameters.\n"}]}]}}

Published government tobacco tax documentation and statistics published by the Chinese STMA are used to analyse the interrelations among industry profits, taxes and retail price of cigarettes in China. The 2009 excise tax increase on cigarettes in China has not translated into higher retail prices because the Chinese STMA used its policy authority to ensure that retail cigarette prices did not change. The government tax increase is being collected at both the producer and wholesale levels. As a result, the 2009 excise tax increase in China has resulted in higher tax revenue for the government and lower profits for the tobacco industry, with no increase in the retail price of cigarettes for consumers. Numerous studies have found that taxation is one of the most effective policy instruments for tobacco control. However, these findings come from countries that have market economies where market forces determine prices and influence how cigarette taxes are passed to the consumers in retail prices. China's tobacco industry is not a market economy; therefore, non-market forces and the current Chinese tobacco monopoly system determine cigarette prices. The result is that tax increases do not necessarily get passed on to the retail price.\n \nCigarette pricing policy is one tool for controlling smoking behavior on a national scale. It is unclear, however, what effects such policy has on adolescents and which characteristic subgroups of adolescents are more or less sensitive to cigarette pricing policy. Our data came from the 2013 Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey. The dependent variable was whether or not a participant was classified as a \"persistent smokers,\" defined as a smoker who would continue smoking despite any price increase. Other variables of interest were smoking days (quantity), previous attempts to stop smoking, and previous education on smoking cessation. The statistical analysis was performed using weighted data and the SURVEYFREQ and SURVEYLOGISTIC procedures in SAS 9.3. Among 7094 adolescent smokers (5349 males and 1745 females), 19.9% of males and 25.1% of females reported as persistent smokers. Compared with light smokers, heavy smokers are more likely to be persistent smokers (male Because heavier smokers with higher risk of health-related consequences were less sensitive to pricing policy than mild smokers, pricing policy alone is not enough to reduce the societal burden caused by smoking. We suggest that additional cessation policy is needed along with pricing policy for adolescents with heavier smoking behavior in Korea. This study shows that heavy smokers are more likely to be persistent smokers despite the cigarette price increase policy, compared with light smokers in Korean adolescents. Because heavier smokers were less sensitive to pricing policy than mild smokers, pricing policy alone is not enough to reduce the societal burden caused by smoking. We suggest that additional tobacco control policies should be evaluated and effective ones implemented in addition to cigarette prices to reduce smoking among regular adolescent smokers.\n"}]}]}}

The procedure reports, available endoscopic photographs, and histology reports were reviewed to establish the endoscopic and histologic appearance of the esophageal mucosa. Intraepithelial cells were counted in a blind review of 42 randomly selected biopsies. The esophageal mucosa had a normal appearance on 160 endoscopic studies (Group 1) and VLEM were the only mucosal abnormalities in 41 endoscopies (Group 2). Histology was normal in 92 of 160 biopsies (57.5%) from Group 1, and 1 of 41 biopsies (2.4%) from Group 2. Most patients in Group 2 had eosinophilic esophagitis (34 of 41, 83%, specificity 0.85, sensitivity 0.5, p > 0.001) which was of moderate to severe intensity (31 of 34, 91.2%, specificity 0.88, sensitivity 0.73, p < 0.001).

Bleeding from esophageal varices may be also derived from gastroesophageal reflux. The circumferential location of the ruptured esophageal varices was evaluated to elucidate the relationship between gastroesophageal reflux and variceal rupture. Between January 2004 and December 2006, 26 patients who had primary bleeding from esophageal varices and 74 patients without evidence of bleeding with positive red color signs on varices were enrolled in this study retrospectively. Locations of bleeding spots and nonbleeding red color signs of esophageal varices were retrospectively evaluated by endoscopic photographs, and the relationship between the location of red color signs and the risk of bleeding was evaluated. Other possible predictors for bleeding were also investigated by multivariate regression analysis. Red color signs were frequently found in the right posterior wall of the lower esophagus. However, bleeding spots of esophageal varices were more frequently seen in the right anterior side (64.0%) than in others. The positive predictor for bleeding from esophageal varices was the presence of red color sign in the right anterior wall of the esophagus, and the administration of proton pomp inhibitor was the negative predictor. Gastroesophageal acid reflex may be a risk factor of bleeding from esophageal varices. Attention should be paid to the circumferential location of red color signs in endoscopic screening of patients with esophageal varices to predict future bleeding.\n"}]}]}}

The case records of patients consecutively undergoing CAB were reviewed. Patients were stratified retrospectively into high- or low-risk groups according to risk factors for significant carotid stenosis and perioperative stroke Overall, 205 consecutive patients underwent preoperative carotid screening. The prevalence of significant carotid stenosis was 5.8%. Univariate analysis confirmed that PVD (P=0.005), carotid bruit (P=0.003) and diabetes mellitus (P=0.05) were significant risk factors for stenosis. Carotid stenosis was a risk factor for stroke (P=0.03). Prevalence of carotid stenosis was higher in the high-risk group (9.1%) than the low-risk group (1.2%) (P<0.05). All concomitant or staged carotid endarterectomies/CAB (5/205) and all patients who had perioperative strokes (5/205) were in the high-risk group (P=0.01). In our cohort, selective screening of patients aged >70 years, with carotid bruit, a history of cerebrovascular disease, diabetes mellitus or PVD would have reduced the screening load by 40%, with trivial impact on surgical management or neurological outcomes.\n \nNon-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and hyperhomocysteinemia are both associated with increased lipid peroxidation (oxidative stress). This may contribute to the accelerated vascular disease associated with these conditions. It is not known whether the coexistence of elevated homocysteine levels will stimulate oxidative stress further than that caused by diabetes alone. Plasma concentrations of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), an index of lipid peroxidation, were measured in patients with NIDDM who had previously had a methionine load test; some of the patients had hyperhomocysteinemia. Plasma TBARS concentrations were elevated in diabetics with vascular disease. The additional presence of hyperhomocysteinemia was not associated with a further increase in plasma TBARS concentrations. Lipid peroxidation is increased in patients with diabetes mellitus and macrovascular disease and is not further elevated by the coexistence of elevated homocysteine levels. It is possible that diabetes maximally stimulates oxidative stress and any further acceleration of vascular disease in patients who have coexistent hyperhomocysteinemia is mediated through mechanisms other than lipid peroxidation.\n"}]}]}}

It has been postulated that patients with OPLL have more complications and worse outcomes than those with degenerative stenosis. The authors sought to compare the surgical results of laminoplasty in the treatment of cervical stenosis with myelopathy due to either degenerative changes or segmental OPLL. The authors conducted a retrospective review of 40 instrumented laminoplasty cases performed at a single institution over a 4-year period to treat cervical myelopathy without kyphosis. Twelve of these patients had degenerative cervical stenotic myelopathy ([CSM]; degenerative group), and the remaining 28 had segmental OPLL (OPLL group). The 2 groups had statistically similar demographic characteristics and number of treated levels (mean 3.9 surgically treated levels; p > 0.05).

The Nurick score improvement was not statistically different between the groups (p > 0.05). The visual analog scale (VAS) neck pain scores were similar between groups pre- and postoperatively (p > 0.05). The complication rates were not statistically different between groups either (p > 0.05). Radiographically, both groups lost extension range of motion (ROM) following laminoplasty, but this change was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Patients with CSM due to either degenerative disease or segmental OPLL have similar perioperative results and neurological outcomes with laminoplasty.

We reviewed the literature to determine if there is sufficient evidence that dexamethasone can be used as an effective alternative in the treatment of pediatric asthma exacerbations in the inpatient setting. A Medline search was conducted on the use of dexamethasone in the treatment of asthma exacerbations in children. The studies selected were clinical trials comparing the efficacy of dexamethasone with prednisone. Meta-analysis was performed examining physician revisitation rates and symptomatic return to baseline. Six completed pediatric clinical trials met the inclusion criteria. All of the pediatric trials found that prednisone is not superior to dexamethasone in treating mild to moderate asthma exacerbations. Meta-analysis demonstrated homogeneity between the dexamethasone and prednisone groups when examining symptomatic return to baseline and unplanned physician revisits after the initial emergency department encounter. Some studies found potential additional benefits of dexamethasone, including improved compliance and less vomiting. The current literature suggests that dexamethasone can be used as an effective alternative to prednisone in the treatment of mild to moderate acute asthma exacerbations in children, with the added benefits of improved compliance, palatability, and cost. However, more research is needed to examine the role of dexamethasone in hospitalized children.\n \nConcern over the safety of influenza vaccination in individuals with obstructive airways disease has contributed to suboptimal rates of vaccine uptake in this group. We investigated the safety of influenza vaccine in older people with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in a cohort from the UK General Practice Research Database (GPRD). A population based cohort study of 12,000 individuals with asthma or COPD from 432 general practices was conducted. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) were calculated for asthma or COPD diagnoses, prescriptions for oral corticosteroids, and acute exacerbations on the day of vaccination and on days 1-2 and 3-14 after vaccination compared with other time periods in the influenza season. The IRRs for asthma or COPD diagnoses and oral corticosteroid prescriptions were increased on the day of vaccination (for example, the IRR for oral corticosteroid prescriptions for subjects with asthma during the 1992-3 influenza season was 8.24 (95% confidence interval 5.54 to 12.26)). However, there was no consistent increase in the IRR of any of the outcomes on days 1-2 or 3-14 after vaccination, and most of these IRRs were close to 1. Rates of exacerbation were low and showed no consistent statistically significant increase during any risk periods. Older people with asthma or COPD commonly have diagnoses recorded or prescriptions for oral corticosteroids given on the day of influenza vaccination, but there is no increased risk of adverse acute outcomes in the first 2 weeks after vaccination. Our findings strongly suggest that influenza vaccination is safe in this population.\n"}]}]}}

This can be done either (i) acutely during the clamp study using high-dose insulin infusion, or (ii) slowly overnight preceding the clamp study using a low-dose insulin infusion. We assessed whether the choice of either of these methods to obtain euglycaemia biases subsequent assessment of glucose metabolism and insulin action. We studied seven obese Type 2 diabetic patients twice Basal plasma glucose levels (mean +/- sd) were 5.5 +/- 0.5 and 10.7 +/- 2.9 mmol/l in the + ON and - ON studies, respectively, and were clamped at -5.5 mmol/l. Basal rates of glucose production (GP) were similar in the + ON and - ON studies, 83 +/- 13 vs. 85 +/- 14 mg m-2 min-1 (NS), whereas basal rates of glucose disappearance (Rd) were lower in the + ON than in the - ON study, 84 +/- 8 vs. 91 +/- 11 mg m-2 min-1 (P = 0.02). During insulin infusion in the clamp period, rates of GP, 23 +/- 11 vs. 25 +/- 10 mg m-2 min-1, as well as rates of Rd, 133 +/- 32 vs. 139 +/- 37 mg m-2 min-1, were similar in the + ON and - ON studies, respectively (NS). Apart from basal rates of Rd, assessment of glucose turnover rates in euglycaemic clamp studies of Type 2 diabetic patients is not dependent on the method by which plasma glucose levels are lowered.\n"}]}]}}

Fourteen reviews were identified; 147 of the 156 primary studies included in these reviews were obtained and assessed. We extracted data on whether the dimensions place of residence, race/ethnicity/culture, occupation, gender, religion, education, socioeconomic status, and social capital and networks (PROGRESS) were reported or analyzed, and whether any interventions were aimed at disadvantaged or low- and middle-income country populations. Among the dimensions of PROGRESS reported at baseline in 147 primary studies, gender (89%) was the most commonly reported, followed by education (25%) and race/ethnicity (18%). Less than 50% of the systematic reviews reported dimensions of PROGRESS even when they had been reported in the primary study. Of 147 primary studies, 6 (5%) were aimed specifically at disadvantaged populations; another 6 reported on effectiveness by at least 1 dimension of PROGRESS.

We wished to establish whether judgements of appropriateness that included patients' perspectives and contextual factors could lead to different conclusions when compared with commonly used instruments. To explore the predictive accuracy of these instruments. The design was interviews of patients, audio recordings of the consultation and interviews of the doctors, in varied primary care practices in England. Participants were patients who were likely to discuss a medication issue. The outcome measures were judgements of appropriateness made by the researchers and by two instruments From 35 cases there was agreement between the judges and the instruments in 22 cases, 16 were appropriate and 6 inappropriate. Of 10 cases classified as inappropriate by the instruments the judges thought four were appropriate. Of 18 cases classified as appropriate by the instruments, two were considered inappropriate by the judges. In seven cases the prescribing decisions could not be classified by the instruments because the decision was to not prescribe. Current measures of appropriateness of prescribing depend predominantly on pharmacological criteria, and so do not represent cases that would be judged appropriate when including the patient's views and contextual factors. If most prescribing is appropriate then use of these measures may lead to more false negatives than real negatives. The instruments should be renamed as measures of 'pharmacological appropriateness' and are useful where the incidence of this type of inappropriate prescribing is relatively high.\n"}]}]}}

This study explores the relationship between pleural fluid appearance and the results of chemical and cytological analyses in a group of patients with recurrent symptomatic pleural effusions and a diagnosis of cancer. Medical records were reviewed from all 390 patients who were diagnosed with cancer, who underwent thoracentesis before placement of an intrapleural catheter (IPC) between April 2000 and January 2006. Adequate information for data analysis was available in 365 patients. The appearance of their pleural fluid was obtained from procedure notes dictated by the pulmonologists who had performed the thoracenteses. The patients were separated into 2 groups based on fluid appearance Pleural fluid cytology was positive on 82.5% of the non-bloody effusions and on 82.4% of the bloody ones. The number of red blood cells (220.5 x 103/microL vs. 12.3 x 103/microL) and LDH values (1914 IU/dl vs. 863 IU/dl) were statistically higher in bloody pleural effusions.

Cycloplegic refraction (from 3 to 4 drops of 1% cyclopentolate to ensure abolition of the light reflex) was measured by both autorefraction and retinoscopy. Refractive errors were defined as followed The mean spherical equivalent refractive error was at least +1.22 D for all ages and both genders. The prevalence of myopia for any definition at any age was at most 2.5%, and lower in most cases. In contrast, the prevalence of hyperopia was generally over 20%, and declined slightly with age. The prevalence of astigmatism was between 6% and 11%. There was very little change in refractive error with age over this age range. Previous reports of less hyperopic mean spherical equivalent refractive error, and more myopia and less hyperopia in children of this age may be due to problems with achieving adequate cycloplegia in children with dark irises. Using up to 4 drops of 1% cyclopentolate may be necessary to accurately measure refractive error in paediatric studies of such children. Our results suggest that children from all ethnic groups may follow a similar pattern of early refractive development, with little myopia and a hyperopic mean spherical equivalent over +1.00 D up to the age of 5-6 years in most conditions.\n \nOur aim was to investigate if patients with suspected myocardial infarction (MI) and a new or presumed new left bundle branch block (nLBBB) were treated according to the ESC reperfusion guidelines and to compare them with patients having a previously known LBBB (oLBBB).

Retrospective data was collected from the Swedeheart registry for patients admitted to the cardiac care unit at \u00d6rebro University Hospital with LBBB and suspected MI during 2009 and 2010. The patients were divided in two age groups; <80 or \u226580 years and analysed for LBBB chronicity (nLBBB or oLBBB), MI, and reperfusion treatment. We also compared our data with the national Swedeheart database for 2009. A total of 99 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. A diagnosis of MI was significantly more common in the group \u226580 years compared to the group <80 years (53.8 vs. 25%, p=0.007). The rate of MI was similar in the groups with nLBBB and oLBBB (33 and 37% respectively, p=0.912). Of the 36 patients with a final diagnosis of MI, only eight (22%) had nLBBB. Reperfusion treatment, defined as an acute coronary angiography with or without intervention, was significantly more often performed in patients with nLBBB compared to patients with oLBBB (42 vs. 8%, p<0.001). The rate of MI and reperfusion treatment did not differ between our institution and the Swedish national data. ST-concordance was present in only two cases, one of which did not suffer an MI. The proportion of patients receiving reperfusion treatment was low, but higher in nLBBB, reflecting a partial adherence to the guidelines. We found no correlation between LBBB chronicity and MI. Furthermore, only a minority of the MIs occurred in patients with nLBBB. ST-concordance was found in only one of 36 MI cases, indicating lack of sensitivity for this test.\n"}]}]}}

The authors assessed the advantages and disadvantages of preoperative TACE by reviewing their experience with the procedure.

The authors investigated the reduction of tumor size and the complications after TACE, as well as the relationship between the interval from TACE to resection and the occurrence of complications. They compared postoperative morbidity and mortality between the TACE and non-TACE groups. They also compared survival and disease-free survival between the two groups, as well as between subgroups, defined by the extent of tumor necrosis achieved with TACE. A distinct reduction of tumor size was observed in approximately half of the TACE group. However, there were 68 appreciable complications of TACE in 56 patients (53.3%), and the interval between TACE and resection was significantly prolonged in the patients with complications. The postoperative morbidity and mortality rates of the TACE group were not different from those of the non-TACE group. Preoperative TACE did not improve the survival or disease-free survival of the whole patient group after hepatectomy. In addition, the survival and disease-free survival rates of the three TACE subgroups were not different from those of the non-TACE group. Preoperative TACE should only be performed to reduce tumor bulk in patients with HCC with borderline resectability. In such patients, increased tumor resectability appears to improve the survival rate. Preoperative TACE does not promote tumor recurrence.\n \nLiver resection offers a chance of cure for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Hepatic pedicle clamping (HPC) is commonly used to reduce blood loss during hepatectomy. Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury has recently been reported to be a major factor in accelerated tumor growth. We therefore evaluated the effect of intermittent HPC on the prognosis of patients after liver resection. The clinicopathological features and serum/tissue samples of 386 HCC patients who underwent curative liver resection were prospectively collected. The patients were divided into the HPC group (over 30 min) and the non-HPC group. Disease-free survival and overall survival were analyzed using multivariate analyses, Kaplan-Meier curves, and log-rank tests. Matrix metalloproteinases and E-selectin were measured to study hepatic I/R injury. The preoperative clinicopathological data were comparable between the HPC group (n = 224) and the non-HPC group (n = 162). During the study period, 257 of the 386 patients (66.6 %) developed tumor recurrence. The overall tumor recurrence and intrahepatic tumor recurrence rates were not significantly different between the two groups. There were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to the 1-, 3-, and 5-year disease-free and overall survival rates. Similarly, subgroup analyses also showed no marked difference in survival rates for patients with cirrhosis in the two groups. The levels of mRNA in liver tissues and serum concentrations of MMP-2, MMP-9, and E-selectin showed no significant differences between the pre- and post-occlusion periods. Intermittent HPC produced no adverse effect on disease-free and overall survival for patients who underwent liver resection for HCC.\n"}]}]}}

The continuous spread of the pest has introduced a new constraint into European maize production. As the damage caused by the invasive species is highly variable and different crop protection (CP) strategies are available, farmers' optimal strategies are not obvious. This study uses a simulation model to assess the competitiveness of different CP strategies in seven Central European countries. Results indicate a high degree of heterogeneity in the profitability of different CP strategies, depending on the production parameters in each country. In general, crop rotation and Bt maize offer the best solutions to farmers, but, in continuous (non-rotated) maize cultivation, chemical CP options may capture part of the market. For Austrian continuous maize production it is found that not deregulating Bt maize implies that farmers forego revenues of up to euro 59 ha(-1). In the presence of WCR, producing maize by an economically sound method requires incorporating country- and farm-specific characteristics into the decision framework. Also, not deregulating Bt maize has direct monetary consequences for many farmers that could influence total maize output and resistance management.\n"}]}]}}

This study used individual level New Zealand Quitline call data from 2005 to 2009, and 2006 New Zealand Census data on smoking to calculate Quitline call rates for smokers. Negative binomial regression examined the relationship between call rates and a sevenfold urban-rural classification, controlling for age, sex, ethnicity and deprivation. We found a significant urban-rural gradient in the rate of smokers calling Quitline. Rates were highest among smokers in main-urban areas [0.09 (95 % confidence interval (CI) = 0.089, 0.091)] decreasing with successive urban-rural classifications to the lowest rate in rural/remote areas [0.036 (95 % CI = 0.03, 0.04)]. This association was not confounded by age, sex, ethnicity or deprivation. Smokers in rural areas are less likely to use the New Zealand Quitline, even after controlling for confounding factors. This suggests that the national quitline is less effective in reaching rural smokers and more attention to the promotion of smoking cessation in rural communities is needed.\n \nTo retrospectively review the performance of a near real-time Emergency Department (ED) Syndromic Surveillance System operating in New South Wales for identifying pneumonia outbreaks of public health importance. Retrospective data was obtained from the NSW Emergency Department data collection for a rural hospital that has experienced a cluster of pneumonia diagnoses among teenage males in August 2006. ED standard reports were examined for signals in the overall count for each respiratory syndrome, and for elevated counts in individual subgroups including; age, sex and admission to hospital status. Using the current thresholds, the ED syndromic surveillance system would have trigged a signal for pneumonia syndrome in children aged 5-16 years four days earlier than the notification by a paediatrician and this signal was maintained for 14 days. If the ED syndromic surveillance system had been operating it could have identified the outbreak earlier than the paediatrician's notification. This may have permitted an earlier public health response. By understanding the behaviour of syndromes during outbreaks of public health importance, response protocols could be developed to facilitate earlier implementation of control measures.\n"}]}]}}

Nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR), which play a central role in lipid and glucose metabolism, had been hypothesized as being involved in colon cancerogenesis. In animal studies the lipid-lowering PPAR ligand bezafibrate suppressed colonic tumors. However, the effect of bezafibrate on colon cancer development in humans is unknown. Therefore, we proposed to investigate a possible preventive effect of bezafibrate on the development of colon cancer in patients with coronary artery disease during a 6-year follow-up. Our population included 3011 patients without any cancer diagnosis who were enrolled in the randomized, double blind Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention (BIP) Study. The patients received either 400 mg of bezafibrate retard (1506 patients) or placebo (1505 patients) once a day. Cancer incidence data were obtained by matching a subject's identification numbers with the National Cancer Registry. Each matched record was checked for correct identification. Development of new cancer (all types) was recorded in 177 patients Our data, derived from patients with coronary artery disease, support the hypothesis regarding a possible preventive effect of bezafibrate on the development of colon cancer.\n \nDietary heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs) are members of a family of chemicals that comprise highly mutagenic compounds related to colon cancer. The polymorphic N-acetyltransferase 2 enzyme (NAT2, E.C. 2.3.1.5) plays a key role in the transformation of HAAs to ultimate carcinogens. NAT2 enzyme activity is expressed in a genotype-dependent manner in colon epithelium. Therefore local activation of HAAs in colon, and hence increased risk to develop colon cancer, is likely to be related to high NAT2 enzyme activity. This study is aimed at analysing the association between genotypes leading to high NAT2 activity and colorectal cancer risk. Genomic DNA from 120 colorectal cancer patients and 258 healthy individuals were analysed for enzyme-inactivating mutations at the coding region of the NAT2 gene by means of a mutation-specific polymerase chain reaction. Among patients with sigmoid colon cancer, a significant excess of individuals with genotypes leading to high NAT2 activity was observed as compared both to controls and to the rest of patients with colorectal cancer (P < 0.05). Our findings, which require independent confirmation, suggest that the NAT2 genotype constitutes a secondary risk factor to develop sigmoid colon cancer.\n"}]}]}}

Although there is evidence for the influential role of transformational leadership on health outcomes, researchers have used either attitude outcomes (e.g. job satisfaction) or softer health measures, such as general well-being. Specific measures of well-being such as sleep quality have not been used, despite its association with working conditions. A longitudinal design was used to collect data from Danish healthcare workers at time 1 in 2005 (n = 447) and 18 months later at time 2 in 2007 (n = 274). Structural equation modelling was used to investigate the relationships between transformational leadership, self-efficacy and sleep quality at both time points independently (cross-sectionally) and longitudinally. For all constructs, time 2 measures were influenced by the baseline level. Direct relationships between transformational leadership and sleep quality were found. This relationship was negative cross-sectionally at both time points, but positive between baseline and follow-up. The relationship between leadership and employees' sleep quality was not mediated by employees' self-efficacy. Our results indicate that training managers in transformational leadership behaviours may have a positive impact on healthcare workers' health over time. However, more research is needed to examine the mechanisms by which transformational leadership brings about improved sleep quality; self-efficacy was not found to be the explanation.\n \nTo compare the effects of 800 mg of valerian with a placebo on sleep quality and symptom severity in people with restless legs syndrome (RLS). A prospective, triple-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel design was used to compare the efficacy of valerian with placebo on sleep quality and symptom severity in patients with RLS. Thirty-seven participants were randomly assigned to receive 800 mg of valerian or placebo for 8 weeks. The primary outcome of sleep was sleep quality with secondary outcomes including sleepiness and RLS symptom severity. Data were collected at baseline and 8 weeks comparing use of valerian and placebo on sleep disturbances (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Epworth Sleepiness Scale) and severity of RLS symptoms (International RLS Symptom Severity Scale) from 37 participants aged 36 to 65 years. Both groups reported improvement in RLS symptom severity and sleep. In a nested analysis comparing sleepy vs nonsleepy participants who received 800 mg ofvalerian (n=17), significant differences before and after treatment were found in sleepiness (P=.01) and RLS symptoms (P=.02). A strong positive association between changes in sleepiness and RLS symptom severity was found (P=.006). The results of this study suggest that the use of 800 mg of valerian for 8 weeks improves symptoms of RLS and decreases daytime sleepiness in patients that report an Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score of 10 or greater. Valerian may be an alternative treatment for the symptom management ofRLS with positive health outcomes and improved quality of life.\n"}]}]}}

Cystic neoplasms of the pancreas present a significant diagnostic dilemma in differentiating benign from premalignant or malignant variants. Since the first description of lymphoepithelial cysts in 1985, 109 cases have been reported in the literature. We describe 6 cases of this rare tumor, the preoperative imaging results, and a review the literature. Five males and one female ranging in age from 47 to 76 years underwent resection for lymphoepithelial cysts. Five patients presented with abdominal pain related to the lesion and in one patient the lesion was discovered incidentally. Four patients had elevated serum CA 19-9 levels. Pre-operative imaging with a CT scan and MRI of the abdomen typically revealed a well defined hypodense mass with Hounsfield units (HU) in the range of 15 to 20. One patient had papillary projections into the lesion. The mean size was 3.3 cm (ranging from 1.8 cm to 4 cm). All lesions were exophytic off the pancreatic parenchyma (1 cyst was located in the head of the pancreas, 2 were in the body, and 3 were in the tail region). Pre-operative EUS-guided/CT-guided needle aspiration, when performed, was not diagnostic. All patients underwent resection (one pancreaticoduodenectomy, five left pancreatectomies) to remove these cystic neoplasms. Pathology revealed a cyst lined by non-dysplastic squamous cells surrounded by sheets of benign lymphocytes. No evidence of malignancy was found. Lymphoepithelial cysts of the pancreas are rare and are characteristically seen in men. While a hypodense mass (less than 20 HU) with papillary projections should be considered suspicious for lymphoepithelial cyst, a definitive diagnosis cannot be made solely based on preoperative imaging. EUS-guided biopsy coupled with biochemical/tumor marker studies are increasingly being used as a diagnostic tool to help differentiate between the various types of cystic pancreatic neoplasms. Imaging findings of lymphoepithelial cysts are non-specific and hence surgical resection is often required to rule out the presence of a malignant or pre-malignant cystic pancreatic lesion. In true lymphoepithelial cysts, malignant transformation is not seen and patients who have these cysts are not at increased risk of developing a pancreatic malignancy.\n"}]}]}}

The study compared the postoperative Ca/PTH kinetics between different preoperative 25-OHD levels. A total of 281 patients who underwent a total thyroidectomy were analyzed. Serum Ca was measured preoperatively within 1 h after surgery (Ca-D0) and on the following morning (Ca-D1). Preoperative 25-OHD was also measured after overnight fasting while postoperative PTH was checked at skin closure on day 0 (PTH-D0) and on the following morning on day 1 (PTH-D1).

The aim of this study was to determine what physicians know about, and their opinions of, hormone treatment in breast cancer patients, and the factors comprising their medical decision-making. A questionnaire was mailed to a random sample of physicians inquiring as to their preferences with respect to adjuvant tamoxifen, and the usual duration of the treatment applied in various clinical scenarios (according to a woman's menopausal status, the oestrogen receptor status and the stage of disease). Of 500 physicians identified, 38% returned the questionnaire. Of the non-responders, a random sample of 60 physicians was interviewed by phone. The total number of available questionnaires was 250 (50%). About 3/4 of the doctors would prescribe tamoxifen in older ER+ women and 30%-40% in post-menopausal ER-patients, but only 2/5 would do so in younger ER+ women. The vast majority of physicians considered five years as standard for ER+ patients. Nevertheless, about 1/4 of the doctors chose a shorter treatment duration for node-negative, pre-menopausal patients. A minority of physicians used tamoxifen for longer than five years. Older clinicians were less likely to prescribe tamoxifen, particularly for low-risk patients. According to the data of the recent EBCTG overview, an additional 20,000 lives could be saved worldwide each year if tamoxifen were given to all early breast cancer patients with hormone-sensitive disease, irrespective of age and disease stage, and for a minimum of five years. Our study, involving a representative sample of physicians practicing in Italy, shows that tamoxifen is not used optimally, with a substantial under-use in younger women and women with node-negative disease.\n \nThe original objective was to determine whether the use of bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) ventilation would reduce the need for endotracheal intubation, the length of hospital stay, and hospital charges in patients with status asthmaticus. The development of physician treatment bias made patient enrollment difficult. The article subsequently describes the use of Bayesian statistics to explain study results when this bias occurs. This study was a prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial conducted over a 34.5-month period at an urban university hospital with an emergency department census of 94,000 annual visits. Patients remaining in status asthmaticus after initial standard treatment with inhaled beta-agonists and steroids were randomized to receive BiPAP ventilation plus standard treatment versus standard treatment alone (non-BiPAP), with intubation for either group as needed. Patients with concurrent cardiac or other pulmonary diseases were excluded. The primary outcome measures were endotracheal intubation rate and length of hospital stay. Secondary outcome measures included vital signs (respiratory rate, pulse rate, blood pressure), changes in expiratory peak flow, changes in pulse oximetry values, and hospital charges. Data were analyzed using Fisher's exact test, Mann-Whitney tests, and Bayesian statistics. For patients enrolled in the study more than once, data analysis was performed on the first enrollment only. Nineteen patients were enrolled in the BiPAP group and 16 patients in the non-BiPAP group. Patients were frequently enrolled more than once and the data from the subsequent enrollments were excluded from the analysis. A marked decrease in enrollment, due to physician treatment bias, led to a premature termination of the study. Demographics showed that the groups were similar in age, sex, initial peak flow rate, and arterial blood gas measurements. There was a 7.3% increase (95% CI = -22 to +45) in the intubation rate in the non-BiPAP group (n = 2) compared with that for the BiPAP group (n = 1). No significant difference was seen in length of hospital stay or hospital charges, although there was a favorable trend toward the BiPAP group. Complications encountered in the BiPAP group included one patient with discomfort associated with the nasal BiPAP mask. Bayesian analysis demonstrated that in order for the collected data to be convincing at the 95% confidence level, the prior conviction among treating physicians that BiPAP was a successful treatment modality would have had to be 98.9%. In this study, BiPAP appeared to have no deleterious effects in patients with status asthmaticus, with a trend toward decreased endotracheal intubation rate, decreased length of hospital stay, and decreased hospital charges. Although further study with more patients is needed to determine the clinical and statistical significance of this intervention, ethical concerns regarding withholding BiPAP treatment from the patients in the control group forced a premature termination of the study in the authors' institution.\n"}]}]}}

Appropriate care requires accurate physician estimates of severity. It is unknown if accuracy of physician estimates differs between black and white patients, and how this relates to asthma care disparities. We hypothesized that We conducted a cross-sectional survey among adult patients with asthma cared for in 15 managed care organizations in the United States. We collected physicians' estimates of their patients' asthma severity. Physicians' estimates of patients' asthma as being less severe than patient-reported symptoms were classified as underestimates of severity. Frequency of underestimation, asthma care, and communication. Three thousand four hundred and ninety-four patients participated (13% were black). Blacks were significantly more likely than white patients to have their asthma severity underestimated (OR = 1.39, 95% CI 1.08-1.79). Among black patients, underestimation was associated with less use of daily inhaled corticosteroids (13% vs 20%, p < .05), less physician instruction on management of asthma flare-ups (33% vs 41%, p < .0001), and lower ratings of asthma care (p = .01) and physician communication (p = .04). Biased estimates of asthma severity may contribute to racially disparate asthma care. Interventions to improve physicians' assessments of asthma severity and patient-physician communication may minimize racial disparities in asthma care.\n \nThe guidelines for asthma recommend that the use of anti-inflammatory therapy should be adapted to the severity of the disease. However, few data are available to assess the adequacy of the use of drugs and its influence on the control of asthma in 'real life'. The adequacy of the current use of anti-asthmatic medication according to the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines was assessed in a random sample of 400 asthmatics identified in the frame of the Italian Study on Asthma in Young Adults. Asthma severity was assessed using the GINA criteria; accordingly, a patient was classified as receiving inadequate treatment if his/her current use of drugs was lower than that suggested by the guidelines for the corresponding severity level. The absence of asthma attacks in the last 3 months was used as an indicator of the disease control. Fifty-five percent of the patients had persistent asthma. Overall, 48% (95% CI 41.2-54.8) of persistent asthmatics were receiving inadequate treatment, and 66% (95% CI 59.5-72.4) had not used their medication daily over the past 3 months. Persistent asthmatics who were inadequately treated had a significantly greater frequency of asthma attacks (geometric mean ratio 3.7; 95% CI 2.1-6.6) than those using an adequate dose of medication. Mild and moderate persistent asthmatics using an adequate medication regimen reported a low number of asthma attacks (median 0). At the multivariate analysis, a good control of the disease was positively associated with an adequate dose of anti-inflammatory medication (OR = 2.2; 95% CI 1.1-4.5) and was negatively associated with a later onset of asthma (OR = 0.96; 95% CI 0.93-0.99) and severe asthma (OR = 0.37; 95% CI 0.17-0.81). Despite the increase in the use of inhaled corticosteroids, half of the persistent asthmatics from the general population are using a medication regimen below their severity level. When the use of drugs follows the GINA guideline recommendations, a good control of asthma is also achievable in the daily management of the disease, particularly in the case of mild and moderate asthmatics.\n"}]}]}}

Minimally invasive techniques in foregut surgery have been suggested to cause less tissue trauma. We examined the factors associated with new-onset atrial fibrillation after foregut surgery at our institution. We retrospectively examined the records of 154 adult patients who underwent major foregut surgery which included esophagectomy, partial or total gastrectomy, redo Heller myotomy, redo or transthoracic fundoplications. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis with standard modeling techniques were performed to determine risk factors for new-onset atrial fibrillation. Of the 154 patients, 14 patients developed new-onset atrial fibrillation with a higher mean age of 67.1 years (+/-8.8 years) versus 56.4 years (+/-14.1 years) (p = 0.006). Laparoscopic (p = 0.004) and nonthoracic surgeries (p = 0.01) were associated with lower risk of atrial fibrillation. Patients with atrial fibrillation had received more fluid (6.5 +/- 2.8 liters versus 5.3 +/- 2.0 liters) and had longer operations (370 +/- 103 min versus 362 +/- 142 min), none of which were statistically significant. The average intensive care length of stay of patients was longer Laparoscopic surgery is associated with lower risk of atrial fibrillation in foregut surgery. Development of atrial fibrillation is associated with increased length of intensive care stay. We recommend a prospective trial to confirm our findings.\n \nLaparoscopic surgery is associated with well-known benefits, one of which is earlier return of bowel function. Since the laparoscopic approach to colon resections was introduced in the early 1990s, it has become the standard of care. Hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery (HALS) is a surgical approach in which dissection is facilitated by the surgeon's hand within the abdominal cavity during laparoscopy. The purpose of this study was to compare the incidence of postoperative ileus and the need for nasogastric tube (NGT) decompression in patients undergoing elective colon resections. Following institutional review board approval, we performed a retrospective review of a prospectively collected database. Included were patients who underwent elective left-sided large bowel resections between 2009 and 2012. Exclusion criteria were urgent operation, stoma creation, ASA IV classification, NGT left in place at the end of surgery, and postoperative anastomotic leakage. Patients were divided into three groups A total of 243 patients were included in this study; 73 patients underwent open surgery, 89 patients underwent HALS, and 81 patients underwent laparoscopic surgery. The proportion of patients who needed postoperative nasogastric decompression was significantly reduced in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery (3.7%) or HALS (4.5%) compared with those who underwent open resection (17.8%). The time from surgery to first flatus and first bowel movement, the time to tolerate solid diet, and the total length of postoperative hospital stay also were all significantly reduced in the laparoscopic and HALS groups compared with the open surgery group. There were no significant differences in any of these measures between the laparoscopic group and the hand-assisted group. Like laparoscopy, HALS is associated with less postoperative ileus and necessitates less NGT decompression than does open surgery.\n"}]}]}}

However, it is not known whether even occasional victimization has similar negative consequences and whether protective factors such as social support may prevent those harmful developments. The present study therefore focuses on the nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) and suicidal behavior (SB) in victims of bullying and the potentially moderating effect of parental monitoring. In all, a cross-sectional sample of 647 adolescents (mean age 12.8 years) were surveyed concerning bullying experiences, NSSI and SB, and parental monitoring. A total of 14.4% of respondents reported being a victim of frequent bullying in the past few months (with verbal and social bullying playing the most important role), which increased the risks of both NSSI (OR\u2009=\u200911.75) and SB (OR\u2009=\u20096.08). This relationship could also be shown for occasional victims of bullying (35.6%), although to a lesser extent. Parental monitoring had a significant protective effect on SB in victims of occasional bullying. However, parental monitoring did not show any protective effect in victims of repetitive bullying. Victims of bullying show a substantial risk for engaging in self-harm behavior. Therefore, the dissemination of anti-bullying programs in schools would probably also prevent such disorders. Parental participation in school-based prevention may increase its effect; this also matches the results of the present study, showing that parental monitoring may be able to buffer the negative effects of bullying victimization, at least to a certain degree.\n"}]}]}}

This study compared recognition of symbolic representation of emotions or movements in music by two groups of children with different communicative characteristics Participants listened to recorded musical excerpts conveying emotions or movements and matched them with labels. Measures relevant to auditory and/or language function were also gathered. There was no significant difference between the ASD and TD-NH groups in identification of musical emotions or movements. However, the CI group was significantly less accurate than the other two groups in identification of both emotions and movements. Mixed effects logistic regression revealed different patterns of accuracy for specific emotions as a function of group.

It is important to continue FA supplementation over the long term in patients on methotrexate and FA in order to prevent them discontinuing treatment because of mouth ulcers or nausea and vomiting.

We hypothesized that reduced nonunion rates could justify the cost of supplementing every orthopaedic trauma patient. Retrospective, economic model. Level 1 trauma center. Adult patients over 3 consecutive years presenting with acute fracture. Operative or nonoperative fracture management. Electronic medical records were queried for ICD-9 code for diagnosis of nonunion and for treatment records of nonunion for fractures initially treated within our institution. In our hospital, a mean of 92 (3.9%) fractures develop nonunion annually. A 5% reduction in nonunion risk from 8 weeks of vitamin D supplementation would result in 4.6 fewer nonunions per year. The mean estimate of cost for nonunion care is $16,941. Thus, the projected reduction in nonunions after supplementation with vitamin D and calcium would save $78,030 in treatment costs per year. The resulting savings outweigh the $12,164 cost of supplementing all fracture patients during the first 8 weeks of fracture healing resulting in a net savings of $65,866 per year. Vitamin D and calcium supplementation of orthopaedic trauma patients for 8 weeks after fracture seems to be cost effective. Supplementation may also reduce the number of subsequent fractures, enhance muscular strength, improve balance in the elderly, elevate mood leading to higher functional outcome scores, and diminish hospital tort liability by reducing the number of nonunions.

Retrograde pyelography was avoided, and no safety guidewire was placed. Whenever required, the ureteric meatus was dilated with a ureteric balloon under direct vision. Double-J stent placement was done with the aid of ureteroscopy. A fluoroscope was kept standby. The patients had a postoperative X-ray of the kidney-ureter-bladder region to document the stone clearance. The mean stone size was 8.7 mm (range 6-15). Complete clearance without the use of fluoroscopy was achieved in 99 patients (94.2%). Fluoroscopy was required in 6 patients (4%) for calcified stricture (n = 1), duplex system (n = 1), narrow and tortuous meatus causing difficulty in passing the 5-Fr balloon dilator (n = 3), and confirmation of spontaneous passage of the stone (n = 1). Of the 13 patients who required balloon dilatation it was successfully achieved without fluoroscopy. Double-J stenting was done due to mucosal ulceration (n = 3), polypoid reaction (n = 2), and perforation (n = 1). All these patients had correct placement of the stent, as confirmed by X-ray of the kidney-ureter-bladder region postoperatively. To uphold the notion for radiation exposure to be as low as reasonably achievable, ureteroscopic stone retrieval can safely be done without the use of fluoroscopy in a significant number of patients.\n"}]}]}}

Coronary blood flow velocity was measured with the Doppler flow wire in 23 patients (age Rate-pressure product decreased after metoprolol from 9.1 to 8.0 x 10(3) mm Hg/min (p < 0.001). Pharmacologic CFVR was 2.1 at rest and increased after metoprolol to 2.7 (p = 0.002). Likewise, postischemic CFVR increased from 2.6 to 3.3 (p < 0.001). Postischemic CFVR was significantly higher than pharmacologic CFVR before as well as after metoprolol. Coronary vascular resistance decreased after metoprolol from 3.4 +/- 2.0 to 2.3 +/- 0.7 mm Hg x s/cm (p < 0.02). The following conclusions were drawn from this study. Metoprolol is associated with a significant increase in postischemic and pharmacologic CFVR. However, postischemic CFVR is significantly higher than pharmacologic CFVR. The increase in CFVR by metoprolol can be explained by a reduction in vascular resistance. The increase in CFVR (= increased supply) and the reduction in oxygen consumption (= decreased demand) after metoprolol explain the beneficial effect of this beta-blocker in patients with CAD.\n \nIn coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), graft flow distal to a mild stenosis can compete with relatively preserved native flow through the stenosis and the competition can result in graft stenosis. In chronic total occlusion (CTO), coronary collateral circulation, which is essential to maintain myocardial viability distal to CTO, varies in extent among patients and the extent can be scored by Rentrop grade in coronary angiography. We investigated whether rich collateral circulation distal to CTO competes with distally anastomosed graft flow in association with Rentrop grade. Of 666 patients who underwent CABG from January 2001 to December 2012, 70 patients whose left internal thoracic artery (ITA) was grafted distal to CTO in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) were divided into three groups The MGF and PI of left ITA grafts differed significantly among the three groups (P = 0.025 and P = 0.046, respectively). Lower Rentrop grade was associated with preferable results of higher MGF and lower PI. The graft flow pattern in Group P showed a significantly higher MGF (P = 0.020) and lower PI (P = 0.041) than those in Group R. All early postoperative coronary angiograms showed patent left ITA grafts. Serial echocardiographic evaluations, survival rates and cardiac event-free rates were comparable with the follow-up of 5.00 \u00b1 3.11 years. Rich collateral circulation distal to CTO in LADs can potentially compete with graft flow, although the competition seems not to affect clinical outcomes probably due to the regression of collaterals surmounted by the graft flow. Rentrop grade is shown to certainly reflect the degree of collateral haemodynamic circulation distal to CTO and especially important to evaluate intraoperative graft flow appropriately, considering the possible phenomenon of graft flow competition.\n"}]}]}}

The patients concerned were asked at original assessment if they would agree to be followed up subsequently and although they agreed no time limit was put on this.

A comprehensive literature search was systematically performed to evaluate all studies included in the literature until July 2015. The specific search terms used were \"fusion knee\" and \"arthrodesis knee,\" which revealed a total of 2206 studies.

Using a random effects model, there was an overall complication rate of 47%, an overall revision rate of 25%, and an overall failure rate of 11%. However, most patients were overall satisfied with the procedure. Fusion takedown is a challenging procedure that should only be performed by experienced surgeons after extensive discussion with the patients.

The coding region and adjacent stretches of the B3AR gene was sequenced in 91 patients. In total, 1015 patients from a single academic hospital were genotyped for the presence of two single nucleotide polymorphisms. Symptom scores and parameters from pressure-flow studies were analyzed relative to genotype in the B3AR gene. No frequent novel polymorphisms were detected in the coding region. Five polymorphisms were found in the non-coding region of the gene but were in complete linkage with the 64Arg allele. Out of 32 parameters including bladder compliance, only prostate size was weakly (44 vs. 39\u2009mL) but significantly associated with the 64Arg allele, but was not mirrored by an association with prostate-specific antigen levels. Our data do not support the hypothesis that polymorphisms in the B3AR gene are associated with alterations of bladder function.\n \nTransient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) is a common cause of early respiratory distress in the neonatal period of term infants. Delayed resorption of foetal lung fluid after birth is considered as the main pathophysiological factor. As resorption of foetal lung fluid is a catecholamine dependent process, we aimed at investigating, whether beta1- and beta2-adrenoreceptor (ADRB1, ADRB2) polymorphisms, known to alter catecholamine activity, are operative in TTN. DNA was collected for genotyping from 73 term newborns suffering from TTN and 55 healthy controls from a Caucasian cohort. TTN infants were more likely to be male (70% vs. 49%; p < 0.05), had a lower mean birthweight (3120 +/- 450 vs. 3396 +/- 504 g; p < 0.001) and gestational age (GA) (38.4 +/- 1.2 vs. 39.4 +/- 1.3 weeks; p < 0.001) and were more often delivered by caesarean section (CS) (71% vs. 26%; p < 0.001). The beta1Ser49Gly polymorphism differed significantly between cases and controls. Multivariate analysis provided beta1Gly49 homozygotes with higher risk for TTN (OR 18.5; 95%CI 1.5-229; p = 0.023) than beta1Ser49 allele carrier. Further analysis showed significant association of T-47C, A46G, C79G and C491T (TACC) haplotype in ADRB2 gene with TTN (p = 0.048). We conclude that beta1Gly49 homozygosity and TACC haplotype of ADRB2 gene, both loss-of-function genetic variations, may predispose to TTN.\n"}]}]}}

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the use of the U-Blade (RC) lag screw is associated with reduced cut-out in patients with OTA/AO 31A1-3 fractures. Between 2009 and 2014, 751 patients with OTA/AO 31A1-3 fractures were treated with a Gamma3 nail at our institution. Out of this sample 199 patients were treated with U-blade (RC) lag screws. A total of 135 patients (117 female, 18 male) with standard lag screw (treatment group A) were matched equally regarding age (\u00b14 years) sex, fracture type and location to 135 patients with U-blade (RC) lag screw (treatment group B). Within a mean follow up of 9.2 months (range 6-18 months) we assessed the cut-out rate, the calTAD, lag screw migration, the Parker's mobility score and the Parker's ratio at postoperatively, six and 12 months following surgery. Furthermore we recorded all complications, ASA-Score, hospital stay and duration of surgery retrospectively. The most common fracture among group B with a cut-out of the lag screw were AO/OTA 2.3 and 3.2 fractures whereas in group A cut-out was most commonly seen in AO/OTA 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 fractures, there was no significant reduction of the cut-out rate in group B 2.2% (n=3) compared to group A 3.7% (n=5). The duration of surgery was significantly shorter in group A (p<0.05). There was no significant difference in lag screw placement, the Parker's ratio and mobilization. In our study the U-Blade (RC) lag screw did not reduce the cut-out in treatment of OTA/AO 31A1-3 fractures at all. Considering the longer duration of surgery and the higher costs of the U-Blade (RC) lag screw, our results do not justify its use. However, further prospective randomized studies will be necessary.\n \nTo evaluate donor-site complications of buccal mucosa urethroplasty and whether there is a difference in morbidity between harvesting the mucosa graft from the inner cheek or the lower lip. Twenty-four consecutive patients with recurrent urethral strictures were treated with buccal mucosa urethroplasty in our department between September 2002 and April 2004. In 12 patients the graft was harvested from the lower lip or cheek and lower lip (group 1), and in 12 patients from the cheek (group 2). The mean (range) age of patients was 51 (26-66) years in group 1 and 53 (32-75) years in group 2. The mean (range) graft length was 6.2 (2-16) cm in group 1 and 5.7 (2-13) cm in group 2. All patients were followed up using a mailed questionnaire that asked about pain, numbness, difficulties in mouth opening or ingestion, and satisfaction, monthly for the first 3 months and then every 6 months. The mean (range) follow-up was 12.5 (6-23) months. There were no bleeding complications or disturbances in wound healing. All of the patients reported numbness in the area of the mental and buccal nerves, and graft-site tenderness after surgery. In group 1, the pain lasted for a mean (range) of 5.9 (0.5-22) months, compared to 1 (0.1-7) months in group 2 (P = 0.022). Perioral numbness lasted for a mean (range) of 10.3 (0.5-23) months in group 1 and 0.85 (0.1-3) months (P = 0.0027) in group 2. There were no statistically significant differences in problems with mouth opening or food intake between the two groups, but the patients in group 1 seemed to be less satisfied (6/12 patients satisfied) than those in group 2 (11/12 patients satisfied). Buccal mucosa graft harvesting from the lower lip and the inner cheek are both feasible, but harvesting from the lower lip resulted in a significantly greater long-term morbidity, which resulted in a lower proportion of satisfied patients. This seems to be due to a long-lasting neuropathy of the mental nerve. We therefore have changed our technique entirely from lower lip to inner cheek graft harvesting, whenever possible.\n"}]}]}}

To determine whether shaving the incision site before spinal surgery causes postsurgical infection. Spine surgeons usually shave the skin of the incision site immediately before surgery is performed. However, evidence from some surgical series suggests that presurgical shaving may increase the postsurgical infection rate. To our knowledge, no previously published studies have addressed this issue. A total of 789 patients scheduled to undergo spinal surgery were randomly allocated into 2 groups The duration of anesthesia did not differ in the 2 groups (P > 0.05). A postoperative infection developed in 4 patients in the shaved group and in 1 patient in the nonshaved group (P < 0.01). The shaving of the incision site immediately before spinal surgery may increase the rate of postoperative infection.\n \nConventionally, dental surgery and cardiac valve replacement surgery (VRS) have been performed separately. Disadvantages of this approach include increased anesthetic and infection risks and increased costs. The authors hypothesized dental surgeries performed immediately before VRS would have similar mortality and morbidity outcomes and significantly decreased costs compared with those performed independently of VRS. An institutional review board-approved retrospective study was completed comparing outcomes for 17 patients undergoing concomitant cardiac VRS and invasive dental procedures with outcomes for 16 patients undergoing similar procedures by a conventional approach. The conventional group had a significant increase in ejection fraction (11% vs 6.7%; P < .05) and no difference in the incidence of prosthetic valve endocarditis or other cardiac complications. The concomitant group had longer overall operating room time (389 vs 328 min) but significantly shorter anesthesia time (428 vs 553 min) than the conventional group. Length of stay in the intensive care unit was similar (6.7 days) and overall hospital stays were shorter in the concomitant group (14.5 vs 18.2 days). Cost analysis showed the concomitant group's overall costs were significantly lower than those for the conventional group. There was no significant difference in cardiac outcomes between the concomitant and conventional groups. In addition, each patient in the concomitant approach saved an average of $6,669. Thus, concomitant dental surgery and cardiac VRS may be considered a safe and cost-effective approach that may lead to decreases in overall health care costs.\n"}]}]}}

Approval of the institutional ethical review committee was not required. This was a retrospective review of 322 computed tomographic angiographic studies that were performed in patients before they underwent elective EVAR for infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. Morphologic parameters evaluated were IMA patency, origin of the IMA in relation to the aneurysm sac, diameter of the IMA, the cross-sectional area of the contrast material-enhanced aortic lumen at the level of the IMA ostium, and the number of additional patent aortic side branches from the aneurysm sac. The association of IMA type II endoleaks with each variable was analyzed by using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models. The diameter of the IMA did not influence the development of IMA type II endoleaks (P = .51). The incidence of these endoleaks was significantly higher in patients with greater cross-sectional area of the aortic lumen at the IMA ostium (P < .001). Patients with an IMA type II endoleak had significantly more patent aortic side branches before EVAR than did patients without an endoleak (3.6 \u00b1 1.7 vs 2.2 \u00b1 1.4; P < .001). According to the final logistic regression model that included cross-sectional area of the aortic lumen at the IMA and the number of aortic side branches as independent predictors, risk for IMA type II endoleaks was determined with a sensitivity of 78% (39 of 50) and a specificity of 79% (92 of 116).

Using a global clinical assessment scale and the Health of the Nations Outcome Scales (HoNOS), data on psychiatric symptomology and limitations, behavioural problems, social problems and limitations associated with physical health problems were collected on both admission and discharge. In this way the effect of the admission period on various problems was determined. In 2011 there were 139 admissions to the MPU with a wide variation of somatic and psychiatric diagnoses.

Global clinical evaluation of the treatment goals set for somatic and psychiatric conditions showed that more than 90% and 85% of the treatment goals, respectively, were completely achieved. HoNOS scores showed a reduction in severity of both psychiatric and somatic problems. The total HoNOS-core was significantly reduced by nearly 3.5 points - a large effect size.

In order for meaningful results to be extrapolated to specific populations, the limitations of the data and linkage methodology need to be investigated and clarified. It is the objective of this study to investigate the differences in ascertainment which may arise between a hospital admission dataset and a dispensing claims dataset, using major depression in pregnancy as an example. The safe use of antidepressants in pregnancy is an ongoing issue for clinicians with around 10% of pregnant women suffer from depression. As the birth admission will be the first admission to hospital during their pregnancy for most women, their use of antidepressants, or their depressive condition, may not be revealed to the attending hospital clinicians. This may result in adverse outcomes for the mother and infant. Population-based de-identified data were provided from the Western Australian Data Linkage System linking the administrative health records of women with a delivery to related records from the Midwives' Notification System, the Hospital Morbidity Data System and the national Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme dataset. The women with depression during their pregnancy were ascertained in two ways From 2002 to 2005, there were 96698 births in WA. At least one antidepressant was dispensed to 4485 (4.6%) pregnant women. There were 3010 (3.1%) women with a comorbidity related to depression recorded on their delivery admission, or other admission to hospital during pregnancy. There were a total of 7495 pregnancies identified by either set of records. Using data linkage, we determined that these records represented 6596 individual pregnancies. Only 899 pregnancies were found in both groups (13.6% of all cases). 80% of women dispensed an antidepressant did not have depression recorded as a comorbidity on their hospital records. A simple capture-recapture calculation suggests the prevalence of depression in this population of pregnant women to be around 16%. No single data source is likely to provide a complete health profile for an individual. For women with depression in pregnancy and dispensed antidepressants, the hospital admission data do not adequately capture all cases.\n \nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) and sociodemographic parameters on depression during pregnancy. Between September 2010 and September 2011, 200 consecutive women with HG were defined as the study group and 200 consecutive pregnant women without any signs and symptoms of HG, and matched for age, parity, and gestational age were defined as the control group. The Beck depression inventory-II (BDI-II) questionnaire and sociodemographic questionnaire evaluating educational level, occupation, economic status, and obstetric history were given to all participants for self-completion. The forms were collected within 6 h of hospital admission. Groups were compared according to the presence of depression and predictors of depression were analyzed by regression analysis. Median BDI-II scores in study and control groups were 15 and 5, respectively. The difference was statistically significant (p < 0.001). In the HG group, 35.1% of patients had mild depression, 26.0% moderate, and 17.8% had severe depression, while only 5% of patients in the control group had mild depression and 95% had no depression. Multivariate analysis showed that HG, age and family relationship were related to depression during pregnancy. Moreover, depression risk was increased 76-fold in patients with HG (odds ratio = 76.000; 95% confidence interval Depression risk is increased in patients with HG, therefore not only medical therapy of HG, but also psychiatric evaluation should be considered for these patients.\n"}]}]}}

This is a cost-utility study from a health care system's perspective comparing coformulated fixed dose (FXD) strategy versus multiple free dose combination (FRC) in antiretroviral therapy. The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) was used to identify HIV/AIDS patients with \u22652 active antiretroviral medications. Patients on FXD were matched in 1:1 ratio with the FRC group using propensity scores. All medical costs excluding those paid by patients and families were included. Utility was measured using SF-6D scores from the SF-12 questionnaire. Incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs) were calculated using the mean annual estimates. A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve was determined using a Monte Carlo probabilistic simulation technique. Nine FXD antiretroviral formulations approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by 2005 was included in this study. One hundred seventy HIV/AIDS patients with \u22652 antiretroviral agents were identified from the MEPS database, of which 53% (n=92) were on FXD formulation. On matching, 70 patients from FXD had a match from the FRC group. No differences in sociodemographic and health status variables were observed between the matched groups. The mean annual cost was $15,766.15 for FXD patients and $11,875.21 for FRC patients. The mean utility gained by using FXD over FRC was 0.085; however, this difference was not statistically significant. The ICUR for the FXD treatment over FRC treatment was $45,540.49/quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed FXD to dominate FRC (>50% probability of being cost-effective) above the $40,000 threshold. Although the cost-effectiveness of a single-pill strategy was within the acceptable willingness-to-pay threshold, the QALY difference were minimal. Further research is recommended to explore the long-term impact of the strategy.\n \nPrimary therapeutic approach to lumbar ureteral stones is still contraversial.

Stones were defined as impacted by the radiographic, echosonographic as well as endoscopic findings in the group II of patients. Stone size was presented in mm2. Chemical composition of stones were almost the same in both groups of the patients. Generally, there was no statistically significant difference in the treatment success between the groups. However, stones larger than 100 mm2 were statistically more successfully treated endoscopically, while there was no statistical difference in the treatment success of impacted stones between these two groups.

The aim of this study is to examine current disparities in dental care by focusing on the receipt of root canal therapy (RCT) versus tooth extraction. This is a retrospective analysis of data contained in the VA's electronic health records. We performed logistic regressions on the independent measures along with a facility-specific random effect, using dependent binary variables that distinguished RCT from tooth extraction procedures.

Other measures are medical record data on medical comorbidities, dental morbidity, prior dental utilization, and demographic characteristics. The overall rate of preferred tooth-preserving RCT was 18.1% during the study period. Black and Asian patients were most dissimilar with respect to dental morbidity, medical and psychological disorders, and black patients had the least amount of eligibility for comprehensive dental care. After adjustment for known confounding factors of RCT, black patients had the lowest RCT rates, whereas Asians had the highest. Current quality improvement efforts and a value to improve the equity of care are not sufficient to address racial/ethnic disparities in VA dental care; rather more targeted efforts will be needed to achieve equity for all.\n"}]}]}}

Results were then correlated with socio-economic status measured by the percentage of habitants living below the poverty level. African-American and Hispanic women generally experience higher mortality than White non-Hispanics, and these differences are especially significant in the southeast metropolitan areas and southwest border of Texas. The proportion and location of significant racial disparities however changed depending on the type of statistic (RR versus RD) and the geographic level. The largest proportion of significant results was observed for the RD statistic and census tract data. Geographic regions with significant racial disparities for African-Americans and Hispanics frequently had a poverty rate above 10.00%. This study investigates both relative and absolute racial disparities in breast cancer mortality between White non-Hispanic and African-American/Hispanic women at the census tract, zip code and county levels. Analysis at the census tract level generally led to a larger proportion of geographical units experiencing significantly higher mortality rates for minority groups, although results varied depending on the use of the relative versus absolute statistics.

Using multiple logistic regression analysis, American Indian race was not independently associated with increased asthma prevalence (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.83-1.33). Obesity, lower household income and lower educational attainment, factors disproportionately affecting American Indians in Montana, were independently associated with increased asthma prevalence. Regional and national surveillance is needed to comprehensively document asthma prevalence in American Indians and other underrepresented minorities in the United States.\n"}]}]}}

The aim of our study was to identify electrophysiological parameters, by means of a transcranial magnetic stimulation approach, which might potentially express the presence of residual networks sustaining fragmentary behavioral patterns, even when no conscious behavior can be observed. We enrolled 25 severe DOC patients, following post-anoxic or traumatic brain injury and 20 healthy individuals (HC) as control group. Baseline electrophysiological evaluation evidenced, in comparison to HC, a partial preservation of cortical effective connectivity and excitability in clinically defined MCS, whereas these components were absent in clinically defined UWS. Then, we applied an anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (a-tDCS) protocol over the orbitofrontal cortex. a-tDCS was able to boost cortical connectivity and excitability in all HC, MCS, and to unmask such excitability/connectivity in some UWS patients. a-tDCS could be useful in identifying residual connectivity markers in clinically-defined UWS, who may lack of purposeful behavior as a result of a motor-output failure.\n \nTo determine the potential prognostic value of using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify patients with disorders of consciousness, who show potential for recovery.

Further course on the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised. Participants performed a mental imagery fMRI paradigm. They were asked to alternately imagine playing tennis and navigating through their home. In 14 of the 22 examined patients (VS, n=5; MCS, n=9), a significant activation of the regions of interest (ROIs) of the mental imagery paradigm could be found. All 5 patients with activation of a significant blood oxygen level dependent signal, who were in a VS at the time of the fMRI examination, reached at least an MCS at the end of the observation period. In contrast, 5 participants in a VS who failed to show activation in ROIs, did not (sensitivity 100%, specificity 100%). Six of 9 patients in an MCS with activation in ROIs emerged from an MCS. Of 3 patients in an MCS who did not show activation, 2 patients stayed in an MCS and 1 patient emerged from the MCS (sensitivity 85%, specificity 40%). The fMRI paradigm mental imagery displays a high concordance with the further clinical course of patients in a VS. All 5 patients in a VS who showed significant activation of ROIs had a favorable further course until the end of the observation period. We therefore propose the term \"functional minimally conscious state\" for these patients. They may benefit from rehabilitation treatment. In cases where no significant activation was seen, the method has no prognostic value. Prediction of the clinical course of patients in an MCS by fMRI was considerably less accurate than in patients in a VS.\n"}]}]}}

Observational correlation. University biomechanics laboratory. 60 Asymptomatic females and 12 females with patellofemoral joint pain. Bilateral and unilateral stance Q angle. Sixty females had their Q angles measured in bilateral and unilateral stance. Linear regressions showed predictive equations and positive correlations for unilateral and bilateral stance Q angles (r=0.81-0.89, p<0.001). The equations generated were used to predict unilateral Q angle from bilateral Q angle measurements in 12 patients with patellofemoral joint pain. The actual unilateral Q angle measurement of the symptomatic knee was significantly greater than that predicted for each individual (p=0.01), whilst the asymptomatic knee showed no significant difference (p=0.16). This study showed a strong positive relationship between bilateral and unilateral stance Q angles which could be represented in a positive linear regression equation. The linear regression equation was then used to predict the effect on the Q angle of moving from a bilateral to a unilateral stance. It has been found previously that patients with patellofemoral joint pain on loading the limb in unilateral stance in activities such as walking and stair descent have increased knee valgus angle. The current study supports those findings indicating that when taking up unilateral stance patients with patellofemoral joint pain demonstrate greater than expected increase in Q angle which could increase loading on the patellofemoral joint.\n \nTo determine whether audiologic characteristics of unilateral hearing loss in children were associated with language, cognitive, or achievement scores. Case-control study Pediatric otolaryngology ambulatory practice Cases (n = 109) were children aged 6 to 12 years with permanent unilateral hearing loss; controls (n = 95) were siblings with normal bilateral hearing. Audiologic characteristics measured included side and severity of hearing loss and word recognition scores in quiet and in noise. Cognitive abilities were measured using the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence; reading, math, and writing achievement was measured with the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test - Second Edition - Abbreviated; and oral language skills were measured with the Oral Written and Language Scales. Children with unilateral hearing loss had worse verbal cognitive and oral language scores than children with normal hearing, but there were no differences in achievement scores. Children with profound unilateral hearing loss tended to have worse cognitive scores and had significantly lower oral language scores. Higher word recognition scores of the normal hearing ear in quiet were associated with higher cognitive, oral language, and reading achievement scores. Higher word recognition scores in noise were slightly correlated with higher oral language scores. As expected, children with unilateral hearing loss had worse language scores than their siblings with normal hearing, with trends toward worse cognitive scores. Children with profound unilateral hearing loss tended to have worse outcomes than children with normal hearing or less severe unilateral loss. However, there were no differences in outcomes between children with right or left unilateral hearing loss.\n"}]}]}}

Appropriate citations were also extracted from a manual search of the bibliographies of selected papers. Twenty-three articles were retrieved. Only 4 presented original data including comparisons to a nonexposed control group and they form the basis for this study. Because the raw data or specific techniques of data analysis were not always explicitly described, indices of risk for exposure were extracted from the data as presented and were analysed without attempting to convert them to a common measure. Articles were assessed according to the criteria of the Evidence-Based Medicine Working Group for evaluating articles on harm. Review of the literature yielded estimates of the risk of adverse fertility outcomes ranging from 1.6 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1 to 2.5) for ectopic pregnancy after an appendectomy to 4.8 (95% CI 1.5 to 14.9) for tubal infertility from perforation of the appendix. Recall bias, and poor adjustment for confounding variables in some reports, weakened the validity of the studies. The methodologic weaknesses of the studies do not permit acceptance of increased risk of tubal pregnancy or infertility as a consequence of perforation of the appendix, so a causal relationship cannot be supported by the data currently available. Only a well-designed case-control study with unbiased ascertainment of exposure and adjustment for confounding variables will provide a definitive answer.\n \nThe aim of this study is to evaluate whether closure of a tympanic membrane perforation with an intact ossicular chain results in a closure of the air-bone gap.

Between 2001 and 2009, overall, 106 patients with a central tympanic membrane perforation and, an intact ossicular chain were further analyzed. All patients underwent myringoplasty using temporalis fascia in an underlay technique. Comparison of the preoperative and postoperative hearing results in patients undergoing myringoplasty for chronic otitis media simplex. The mean postoperative air-bone gap (ABG) was 8.2 dB for the frequencies 0.5 to 4 kHz. Eighty-three patients (78%) showed postoperatively a mean ABG of 10 dB or lower. The ABG difference (improvement) was statistically significant for each single frequency (0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 4 kHz) (p < 0.0001). There is a linear correlation between the preoperative tympanic membrane perforation size and the postoperative ABG (p = 0.0017) for the frequencies 0.5 to 4 kHz. No statistical significant correlation was seen between the state of the middle-ear mucosa, temporal bone pneumatization, tympanometric middle-ear/mastoid volume, and the postoperative ABG. Complete ABG closure by myringoplasty could be achieved in only approximately 20% of the cases. 80% respectively presented with a mean residual ABG of 8 dB. We found a significant linear correlation between the preoperative size of the tympanic membrane perforation and the postoperative ABG, whereas mastoid volume, temporal bone pneumatization, and the condition of the mucosa did not affect the outcome.\n"}]}]}}

We developed a remote examiner OSCE (reOSCE) that was integrated into a traditional OSCE to establish whether remote examination technology may be used to bridge this gap. The purpose of this study was to explore whether remote physician-examiners can replace on-site physician-examiners in an OSCE, and to determine the feasibility of this new examination method. Forty Year 3 medical students were randomised into six reOSCE stations that were incorporated into two tracks of a 10-station traditional OSCE. For the reOSCE stations, student performance was assessed by both a local examiner (LE) in the room and a remote examiner (RE) who viewed the OSCE encounters from a distance. The primary endpoint was the correlation of scores between LEs and REs across all reOSCE stations. The secondary endpoint was a post-OSCE survey of both REs and students. Statistically significant correlations were found between LE and RE checklist scores for history taking (r = 0.64-r = 0.80), physical examination (r = 0.41-r = 0.54), and management stations (r = 0.78). Correlations between LE and RE global ratings were more varied (r = 0.21-r = 0.77). Correlations on three of the six stations reached significance. Qualitative analysis of feedback from REs and students showed high acceptance of the reOSCE despite technological issues. This preliminary study demonstrated that OSCE ratings by LEs and REs were reasonably comparable when using checklists. Remote examination may be a feasible and acceptable way of assessing students' clinical skills, but further validity evidence will be required before it can be recommended for use in high-stakes examinations.\n"}]}]}}

Included among the syndromes are ataques de nervios (ADN), which are reported to be bound to the Hispanic culture and closely resemble panic attacks. However, the cultural distinctiveness and phenomenology of ADN has not been adequately investigated. The current study employed an ethnically diverse study sample (N=342) of undergraduates. Participants completed a number of measures that assessed acculturation, syndrome and anxiety risk factors. In contrast to the DSM-IV's conceptualization of ADN, the rate of ADN did not significantly vary across the three main groups (African American, Caucasian, and Hispanic participants) nor did it vary based on acculturation. More consistent with the DSM-IV, the symptom comparisons indicated some differentiation between ADN and panic attacks. The present report provides data indicating that ADNs, as described by the DSM-IV, are not unique to the Hispanic culture and are experienced by non-Hispanic individuals at similar rates to Hispanic-endorsement.

We reviewed all original articles in Annals of Plastic Surgery, Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive, and Aesthetic Surgery, and Plastic & Reconstructive Surgery from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2013. All scientific articles were analyzed, and several article characteristics were extracted. Disclosed COI were categorized into the following categories A total of 3124 articles were identified of which 1185 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Financial COI were reported in 153 studies (12.9%). The most common type of COI was \"research support\" (7.3%), whereas the least common was \"royalties/stock options\" (1.2%). Rates of different types of COI varied significantly by plastic surgery subspecialty field (P < 0.001). In the multivariable analysis, authors who disclosed COI related to research support, consultant/employee, and royalties/stock options were 1.31, 6.62, and 8.72 times more likely, respectively, to publish positive findings when compared with authors that disclosed no COI after correcting for potential confounding factors. However, consultancy/employee status was the only COI category statistically associated with publication of positive results (P < 0.001). Self-reported COI are uncommon in plastic surgery research. Our results provide evidence that certain types of financial COI are more likely than others to be associated with the presentation of positive findings. This analysis suggests that certain investigators may be more biased, consciously or unconsciously, by the type of financial benefit offered by industry.\n"}]}]}}

Demographic analysis of data published by EUROSTAT and Czech statistical office. Department of Demography and Geodemography Faculty of Science, Charles University Prague. Widespread use of the liberal abortion law in socialist countries contributed to the decline of fertility rates only to the replacement level. In the Czech Republic total fertility rate dropped below 1.3 in 1995 and it did not increase above 1.5 children per woman till 2007. The increased use of modern contraceptive methods that results in a sharp decline in fertility and in a significant decrease of induced abortions can be documented. The total abortion rate fell from 1.54 abortions per a woman in 1990 to 0.34 in 2007. The proportion of women aged 15-49 years who were prescribed oral contraception increased from 4 percent in 1990 to 48 percent in 2007. An induced abortion is still used largely as a way to avoid birth of additional children by women who already have the number of children they want. This is in sharp contrast with the situation in the majority of Western European countries in which abortion is used mainly by teen-age girls whose attempts to avoid pregnancy have failed. In contrast to other demographic characteristics which classify the Czech Republic to Eastern Europe, the level of induced abortion rate is comparable with the levels observed in some Western European countries.\n"}]}]}}

Besides, the relationship between the categorical cIMT values of both the CAD and the normal groups was insignificant (p=0.059) and the correlation between the increasing cIMT values and the presence of detectable CAD was also very weak (r=0.187, p=0.08). cIMT can predict occurrence of cardiovascular events in subjects, but single cIMT measurement during echocardiographic examination does not seem to have potential role on decision making for further investigation in patients with suspected CAD.\n"}]}]}}

Changes were seen in terms of soft tissue compression and in some instances overall angulation of the cervical spine. Interventional MRI can produce images of posteroanterior mobilisation. Dynamic imaging of the procedure produced images of unsuitable quality for analysis. The quasi-static images of suggested that the application of a posteroanterior mobilisation to the cervical spine produces minimal if any intervertebral motion, but significant soft tissue deformation of the overlying structures. RELEVANCE STATEMENT\n \nUnicompartmental replacement can be an alternative to tibial osteotomy in younger, active patients with unicompartmental knee disease. In unicompartmental replacement, the other compartments and knee ligaments are largely untouched. Therefore, it was hypothesized that the knee kinematics after unicompartmental replacement may also be unchanged. To test this hypothesis, knee kinematics and quadriceps tension were recorded before and after replacement with a unicompartmental design and then with a tricompartmental design. Six human cadaver knees were tested before implantation, after implantation with a bicruciate-retaining unicompartmental knee prosthesis, and after implantation with a posterior cruciate-retaining tricompartmental knee prosthesis. The unicompartmental prosthesis was initially implanted, and it was then revised to a total condylar knee replacement. The knee kinematics were measured with use of an electromagnetic tracking device while the knee was put through dynamic simulated stair-climbing under peak flexion moments of approximately 40 N-m. Quadriceps tension was also measured for all three conditions. No significant differences in tibial axial rotation were noted between the intact and unicompartmental conditions. However, tricompartmental replacement significantly affected tibial axial rotation (p = 0.001). Femoral rollback was not significantly affected by either unicompartmental or tricompartmental arthroplasty. Quadriceps tension was also similar among all three conditions. In this in vitro cadaver study, the tricompartmental replacement significantly changed knee kinematics while the unicompartmental replacement preserved normal knee kinematics.\n"}]}]}}

There are 71 previously untreated patients with cytological or histological evidence of primary lung cancer who were admitted to the oncology department between November 2013 and August 2014. Forty-five healthy individuals with age, sex and BMI matching the lung cancer patients, were recruited to take part in the study as a control group. Leptin levels were measured quantitatively by using a microELISA kit. The serum leptin levels at diagnosis were significantly lower in lung cancer patients than those in control subjects (4.75\u00b14.91 ng/ml, 9.67\u00b18.02 ng/ml; p<0.001). We did not find any significant difference in leptin values related to clinicopathological parameters such as ECOG PS, weight loss, histological type, disease stage and TNM classification. Nevertheless, we demonstrated a significant correlation between serum leptin levels and BMI in lung cancer patients (correlation coefficient Our results showed that the serum leptin level has no prognostic indications in advanced lung cancer patients. Leptin is decreased in lung cancer, and there is lack of correlation with tumour\u2011related factors including prognosis. Therefore, leptin is not a useful clinical marker in lung cancer (Tab. 2, Fig. 2, Ref. 22).\n \nThe limited information on serum leptin levels in elderly men suggests the occurrence of an age-related decrease, with disruption of the relationship between fat mass and leptin levels. A relative leptin deficiency might thus be implicated in the increase of fat mass and decrease of serum testosterone levels in elderly men. Therefore, we have reevaluated the age-related changes in serum leptin levels and their relationship with adiposity and androgen levels in a large group of community dwelling men. Serum leptin and androgen levels were measured in 271 healthy, ambulatory elderly men (median age 74 years), as well as in 61 middle-aged (median 43 years) and 40 young (median 25.5 years) controls. Adiposity was assessed by anthropometrical measurements (body mass index; BMI) and by estimation of fat mass by the bio-impedance method. Serum leptin levels, whether or not adjusted for BMI, were found to increase with age, the values tending to level off after the age of 45 years, and were strongly correlated to BMI (r = 0.77) and fat mass assessed by the bio-impedance method (r = 0.81). Linear regression analysis showed a similar slope for the relationship between BMI and serum leptin in the three age groups. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated BMI, age and serum insulin, but not serum testosterone, as significant independent correlates of serum leptin. Serum (free) testosterone levels were negatively correlated with age and serum leptin, also after partialization for BMI Ageing in men is accompanied by a rise of serum leptin levels with a maintained strong association between serum leptin and adiposity in elderly men. Testosterone does not appear to be a major determinant of serum leptin in healthy men, while leptin does emerge as a negative correlate of serum testosterone. Increased fat mass and decreased testosterone production in elderly men cannot be attributed to a relative leptin deficiency.\n"}]}]}}

The study sample included women who delivered a live singleton baby between April 2003 and March 2004. Pregnant women who made at least one ED visit for asthma were counted as cases and the rest of the women as control subjects. We performed a multivariable analysis using logistic regression to model the risk of having an ED visit for asthma, with fetal gender being one of the predictors. In addition, a series of multivariable logistic regressions were also constructed separately for cases and controls for the following adverse delivery outcomes Among 109,173 live singleton deliveries, 530 women had visited ED due to asthma during pregnancy. While having an ED visit for asthma was positively associated with teenage pregnancy, low income, and presence of pregnancy-induced hypertension, it was not associated with fetal gender (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85-1.19). Fetal gender was not a significant predictor of adverse pregnancy outcomes among women who had an asthma ED visit during pregnancy. Fetal gender does not affect the risk of having an ED visit for asthma during pregnancy, and it is not associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes among women who had an asthma-related ED during pregnancy.\n \nThe topic of gender and medical care is receiving increased attention but has not been studied in children. We noticed that several children undergoing laceration repair in emergency department requested to be sutured by a female physician. This study attempted to find gender preferences of children and parents for the physician in the emergency department. We undertook this study to determine whether pediatric patients or their parents have a preference for physicians of a particular gender. We also tried to determine whether they would be willing to wait longer to be seen to accommodate their choice. A total of 200 children aged between 8 and 13 years presenting to our pediatric emergency department for laceration repair were enrolled. With the knowledge and consent of their parents, the enrolled children were given a short questionnaire. They were asked, if they had a choice, would they prefer to have a male or a female doctor or would they prefer the doctor with the most experience. Their parents were also then given the questionnaire. They were also asked if they would be willing to wait longer to be seen by the doctor of their choice. The study sample comprised 200 children, 139 boys and 61 girls. Among boys, 78% (n = 109) said they would prefer a female physician. Only 21% (n = 30) preferred a male physician. Among girls, 80% (n = 49) reported they would prefer a female physician, 20% (n = 12) preferred a male physician. None of the children surveyed wanted the \"best\" physician. When the parents were surveyed, 60% (n = 120) preferred a male physician as compared with 19% (n = 38) who expressed a preference for female physician. Only 21% (n = 42) of parents desired the most experienced physician of either sex to repair the laceration. All the parents who expressed a preference for the \"most experienced\" physician said they were willing to wait (42/42) until that physician was available as compared with less than a third of parents who were willing to wait for the physician of a specific gender (44/158). Most children (79%) preferred a female physician for their sutures, whereas parents overall (60%) appeared to prefer a male physician. The children did not appear to care if the physician was the \"best.\" Surprisingly, many parents also chose physician gender rather than physician experience. One hundred percent of the parents who chose the most experienced physician were willing to wait longer to be seen as compared with 29% who preferred a physician of a particular gender.\n"}]}]}}

Although AF can have a genetic etiology, links between inherited gene defects and acquired factors such as atrial stretch have not been explored. Mutation screening of the KCNQ1, KCNE1, KCNE2, and KCNE3 genes was performed in 50 families with AF. The effects of mutant protein on cardiac I(Ks) activation were evaluated using electrophysiological studies and human atrial action potential modeling. One missense KCNQ1 mutation, R14C, was identified in 1 family with a high prevalence of hypertension. Atrial fibrillation was present only in older individuals who had developed atrial dilation and who were genotype positive. Patch-clamp studies of wild-type or R14C KCNQ1 expressed with KCNE1 in CHO cells showed no statistically significant differences between wild-type and mutant channel kinetics at baseline, or after activation of adenylate cyclase with forskolin. After exposure to hypotonic solution to elicit cell swelling/stretch, mutant channels showed a marked increase in current, a leftward shift in the voltage dependence of activation, altered channel kinetics, and shortening of the modeled atrial action potential duration. These data suggest that the R14C KCNQ1 mutation alone is insufficient to cause AF. Rather, we suggest a model in which a \"second hit\", such as an environmental factor like hypertension, which promotes atrial stretch and thereby unmasks an inherited defect in ion channel kinetics (the \"first hit\"), is required for AF to be manifested. Such a model would also account for the age-related increase in AF development.\n \nRecent studies have demonstrated that statins have pleiotropic effects, including anti-inflammatory effects and atrial fibrillation (AF) preventive effects. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of preoperative statin therapy in preventing AF after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). 221 patients underwent CABG in our hospital from 2004 to 2007. 14 patients with preoperative AF and 4 patients with concomitant valve surgery were excluded from this study. Patients were divided into two groups to examine the influence of statins The overall incidence of postoperative AF was 26%. Postoperative AF was significantly lower in the Statin group compared with the Non-statin group (16% versus 33%, p = 0.005). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that independent predictors of AF development after CABG were preoperative statin therapy (odds ratio [OR] 0.327, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.107 to 0.998, p = 0.05) and age (OR 1.058, 95% CI 1.004 to 1.116, p = 0.035).

Sensitivity and specificity of several different criteria for detecting lymphedema were compared using the academic trial as the standard.

Longitudinal observational study of 36 months duration. A stratified random sample of 2,032 Chinese subjects (990 male, 1,033 female) mean age (s.d.) 80.1 (7.5), interviewed and examined at baseline and after 36 months.

In predicting outcomes using different values of BMI, WC and WHR, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to derive cut-off values with optimal sensitivity and specificity, and the likelihood ratios for mortality, diabetes and hypertension for different anthropometric values were plotted. The waist circumference values corresponding to BMI values of 25 and 30 kg/m(2) were higher in elderly (92 and 103 cm for men; 88 and 99 cm for women) compared with younger subjects (85 and 97 cm for men; 78 and 88 cm for women). BMI and WC are inversely associated with mortality, in both men and women, positively associated with diabetes in men but not in women. WC was positively associated with hypertension in men and women. WHR was not associated with any outcome measures. The anthropometric measurement at the point of intersection of the likelihood curves for mortality and diabetes may be considered the optimum value, being BMI=21 kg/m(2) for men and 25 kg/m(2) for women, WC between 80 and 85 cm, and WHR 0.88-0.90. Waist measurement values for predicting health outcomes in elderly people aged 70 y and over are different compared with younger subjects, and have similar predictive accuracy compared with body mass index.

Electrocardiogram was performed to measure QTcD. LVH was present in 42 patients (42%) of the study group, none among controls. Hypertensive patients had significantly greater indices of LVH and QTcD compared with controls (p <0.001 for all).

Aortic injury was assessed in accordance with the recommendations of the Society of Vascular Surgery. We measured the aortic arch angle and the aortic arch index, based on the initial angio-CT scan, in each of the analyzed cases. The mean aortic arch index and mean aortic arch angle were 6.8\u00a0cm and 58.3\u00b0, respectively, in the type I injury group; 4.4\u00a0cm and 45.9\u00b0 in the type III group; 3.3\u00a0cm and 37\u00b0 in the type IV group.

Fifteen patients underwent aortic arch replacement with additional reconstruction of supra-aortic vessels in 3 patients.

The amount of medication was equally decreased in the two groups. No statistically significant difference was noted. No major complication occurred and two patients died from other causes. The use of percutaneous vertebroplasty alone appears to be effective for the pain management of the patients with vertebral involvement of multiple myeloma.

On the other hand, there was a significant decrease in aortic strain and aortic distensibility (7.41 ? 6.82 vs 18.26 +/- 5.83, P < 0.001; 1.83 +/- 1.71 vs. 5.22 +/- 1.72, P < 0.001, respectively). No difference was observed between the two groups with respect to the left ventricular myocardial performance index (MPI) (0.62 +/- 0.15 vs. 0.61 +/- 0.13, P=0.859). In this study, we demonstrated for the first time in the literature thatthere was impaired aortic elasticity and increased EFT in patients with brucellosis, while the myocardial performance index remained unaffected. We also determined that these effects had a significant correlation with inflammation.\n \nBoard certification has become an accepted measure of physician quality. The effect of both non-curricular and curricular residency program characteristics on certification rates has not been previously studied. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of various program characteristics on first-time American Board of Family Medicine (ABFM) pass rates. Using information from the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), National Resident Matching Program (NRMP), and FREIDA\u00ae, program characteristics were obtained. Three-year and 5-year aggregate ABFM board pass rates were calculated. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data. The relationship between program characteristics, initial Match rates, and non-Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) required activities (NRCA), and first-time Board pass rates were analyzed using chi-square. Significance was defined as P<.05 level of confidence. Fifty-two percent of residency programs have ABFM board pass rates ? 90%. Both 3- and 5-year aggregate Board pass rates were significantly associated with regional location, program size, accreditation cycle length, and any NRCA, specifically including international experiences and curriculum in alternative medicine. Location type (urban, suburban, rural, or inner city), program structure, salary, moonlighting, available tracks, and P4 participation were not associated. The percent of first-time takers successfully completing the ABFM examination is associated with several residency program characteristics, including regional location, program size, accreditation cycle length, opportunities for international experiences, and training in alternative medicine.\n"}]}]}}

The BMD at both sites decreased precipitously within 24 months of stopping treatment, raising the question as to whether bisphosphonates can be stopped in a growing child with skeletal fragility. At age 23 months, a male toddler sustained a low trauma fracture of his right femur. Skeletal radiographs revealed generalised osteopenia with multiple vertebral body fractures. He was diagnosed with type IV osteogenesis imperfecta; however, no mutations were found in COL1A1 or COL1A2 genes. This case report presents bone densitometry data before, during and after bisphosphonate treatment. Axial QCT was main outcome from 2 years of age; DXA and pQCT were taken after age 5. QCT confirmed that he had low spinal trabecular volumetric BMD (Z-score -2.4). After 4 years of treatment his vertebral fractures had been remodelled and all bone densitometry values (QCT, DXA and pQCT) were within normal range and therefore treatment was discontinued. Shortly after this he suffered stress fractures of his left mid tibia and at the sclerotic metaphyseal line corresponding to his first APD treatment. He had marked reduction in spinal trabecular and distal radial vBMD; change in BMAD was less marked. The patient has been restarted on IV APD therapy. This case has led us to consider whether bisphosphonate therapy can be discontinued in a child with fragility fractures before his/her linear growth has ceased?\n \nThe pathogenesis of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ) is not completely understood. The most popular hypothesis has suggested that the bone turnover (BT) in the jawbone is greater than that in other sites and that this turnover will be overly suppressed by bisphosphonates. Using bone scintigraphy, a simple tool for the quantitative evaluation of bone metabolism and blood flow, the goals of the present study were to determine whether the rate of bone remodeling is greater in the jaw and whether the bone BT in the jaw is differentially altered after bisphosphonate intake compared with that in other skeletal sites. The bone scintigraphies of 90 female patients with breast cancer were retrospectively analyzed (n\u00a0= 45 with bisphosphonate intake; n\u00a0= 45 without bisphosphonate intake [control group]). All patients in the study group had undergone bone scintigraphy before therapy and during the treatment (course after 12 and 24\u00a0months). The data were quantitatively analyzed using 6 predetermined regions of interest. The bone BT of the mandible was similar to that of the femur and significantly reduced compared with that of the maxilla (P < .01). None of the investigated bone regions (including the mandible and maxilla) were significantly altered after bisphosphonate administration (P > .05). The finding that the mandible had significantly lower bone BT than that of the maxilla and that two thirds of BRONJ cases occur in the mandible were inconsistent with the investigated hypothesis. Furthermore, the bone BT in the jawbone was not overly suppressed by bisphosphonates. Thus, it is unlikely that over suppression of bone BT is the exclusive causation playing a role in the pathomechanism of BRONJ.\n"}]}]}}

At our institution, a regional anesthesia program was instituted for patients undergoing surgery for hip fracture. This retrospective cohort review examines the effects of regional anesthesia (from mainly after July 2007) vs general anesthesia (mainly prior to July 2007) on morbidity, mortality and hospitalization costs. This retrospective cohort study involved data collection from electronic and paper charts of 308 patients who underwent surgery for hip fracture from September 2006 to December 2008. Data on postoperative morbidity, in-patient mortality, and cost of hospitalization (as estimated from data on hospital charges) were collected and analyzed. Seventy-three patients received regional anesthesia and 235 patients received general anesthesia. During July 2007, approximately halfway through the study period, a regional anesthesia and analgesia program was introduced. The average cost of hospitalization in patients who received surgery for hip fracture was no different between patients who receive regional or general anesthesia ($16,789 + 631 vs $16,815 + 643, respectively, P = 0.9557). Delay in surgery and intensive care unit (ICU) admission resulted in significantly higher hospitalization costs. Age, male gender, African American race and ICU admission were associated with increased in-hospital mortality. In-hospital mortality and rates of readmission are not statistically different between the two anesthesia groups. There is no difference in postoperative morbidity, rates of rehospitalization, in-patient mortality or hospitalization costs in geriatric patients undergoing regional or general anesthesia for repair of hip fracture. Delay in surgery beyond 3 days and ICU admission both increase cost of hospitalization.\n \nConventionally, dental surgery and cardiac valve replacement surgery (VRS) have been performed separately. Disadvantages of this approach include increased anesthetic and infection risks and increased costs. The authors hypothesized dental surgeries performed immediately before VRS would have similar mortality and morbidity outcomes and significantly decreased costs compared with those performed independently of VRS. An institutional review board-approved retrospective study was completed comparing outcomes for 17 patients undergoing concomitant cardiac VRS and invasive dental procedures with outcomes for 16 patients undergoing similar procedures by a conventional approach. The conventional group had a significant increase in ejection fraction (11% vs 6.7%; P < .05) and no difference in the incidence of prosthetic valve endocarditis or other cardiac complications. The concomitant group had longer overall operating room time (389 vs 328 min) but significantly shorter anesthesia time (428 vs 553 min) than the conventional group. Length of stay in the intensive care unit was similar (6.7 days) and overall hospital stays were shorter in the concomitant group (14.5 vs 18.2 days). Cost analysis showed the concomitant group's overall costs were significantly lower than those for the conventional group. There was no significant difference in cardiac outcomes between the concomitant and conventional groups. In addition, each patient in the concomitant approach saved an average of $6,669. Thus, concomitant dental surgery and cardiac VRS may be considered a safe and cost-effective approach that may lead to decreases in overall health care costs.\n"}]}]}}

A cross-sectional design was used for this study. Twenty children who had spina bifida and were ambulatory participated. The (.)Vo(2)peak was measured during a graded treadmill exercise test. The validity of (.)Vo(2)peak measurements was evaluated by use of previously described guidelines for maximum exercise testing in children who are healthy, as well as differences between Vo(2)peak and (.)Vo(2) during a supramaximal protocol ((.)Vo(2)supramaximal). The average values for (.)Vo(2)peak and normalized (.)Vo(2)peak were, respectively, 1.23 L/min (SD=0.6) and 34.1 mL/kg/min (SD=8.3).

In the peeling off (PO) technique, the portal venotomy was placed after adequate vascular control of portal flow. The PVTT was dissected from the portal venous wall and removed through the opening. Macroscopically residual PVTTs intruding into tiny branches were meticulously extracted. This procedure was compared with the en bloc resection of PVTT. Between 1995 and 2006, 49 patients underwent curative hepatic resections for HCC with macroscopic PVTT; these patients were classified according to whether the PO technique (n = 20) or the en bloc technique (n = 29) had been utilized. Both the short- and long-term results were compared between the 2 groups. No mortalities occurred in either group. Both the 5-year overall survival and the recurrence-free survival rates of the PO group were comparable with those of the en bloc group (39% vs 41% [P = .90] and 23% vs 18% [P = .89], respectively). No local recurrences or regrowth of the PVTT occurred in either group. Our procedure is useful for removing PVTT extending beyond the bifurcation or into other sectors that should be preserved in terms of liver function and enables a more conservative resection than an en bloc technique without sacrificing curability.\n"}]}]}}

During 12 months of follow-up, no recurrence was observed. Our results illustrated that the activation potential of Mahaim pathways is not always a fast potential. One-third of Mahaim pathways can be mapped and ablated when the slow type of M-potential was used as a target for ablation.

We speculate that changes in the haemostasis technique or shortening the duration of the shaft wrapping might decrease the rate of infection after Jewish ritual circumcision.\n"}]}]}}

Ninety-six Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 2 (groups E and L). Each group was further subdivided into 6 subgroups (EA1, EA2, EA3, EB1, EB2, EB3, LA1, LA2, LA3, LB1, LB2, LB3), each containing 8 rats. Intestinal anastomosis was performed by polyglactin 910 sutures in A subgroups and with ethyl-2-cyanoacrylate in B subgroups. The anastomosis was end to end in A1 and B1, side to side in A2 and B2, and end to side in A3 and B3. Time for anastomosis performance (AT) was recorded. In group E, bursting pressures and hydroxyproline levels were determined on the second postoperative day, whereas in group L, the same measurements were made on the sixth postoperative day. One-way analysis of variance was used for analyses of variance in the groups. Quantitative data were analyzed with Student's t test. P value was considered significant at less than .05. There was no significant difference between bursting pressures of subgroup pairs on both postoperative days 2 and 6. Hydroxyproline levels and AT were significantly better in B subgroups. Better healing, shorter AT, and equal strength were achieved with ethyl-2-cyanoacrylate compared with polyglactin 910 sutures in intestinal anastomosis in the experimental setting.\n \nAnastomotic complications such as leakage and bleeding remain among the most serious complications of laparoscopic colorectal surgery. No perfect method exists for accurate and reliable avoidance of these catastrophes. This study aimed to study the usefulness of routine intraoperative endoscopy (RIOE) by comparing the surgical outcomes for RIOE patients with those for selective intraoperative endoscopy (SIOE) patients. A retrospective chart review was performed for consecutive patients who underwent elective laparoscopic colorectal resections with distal anastomosis between January 2004 and May 2007. One surgeon performed RIOE, whereas the other three surgeons performed SIOE as necessary. All the abnormalities of IOE patients were managed with a subsequent salvage procedure, and the postoperative outcomes were compared between the RIOE and SIOE groups. The study included 107 patients in the RIOE group and 137 patients in the SIOE group. Abnormalities were detected in 11 RIOE patients (10.3%) (six with staple line bleeding, three with positive air leak test results, and two with additional pathology identified). All but one abnormality was laparoscopically managed without conversion to laparotomy. Whereas one patient experienced postoperative staple line bleeding that required a second operation, the remaining 10 patients recovered uneventfully. The mean hospital stay was 6 days (range, 4-9) days. The RIOE group had overall rates of 0% for anastomotic leakage and 0.9% for staple line bleeding. Intraoperative endoscopies were performed for 30 (21.9%) of the 137 patients in the SIOE group. The postoperative outcomes comparison between the RIOE and SIOE groups showed a tendency toward more overall anastomotic complications (0.9% vs. 5.1%) in the SIOE group, which due to the small sample size did not translate into significant differences in terms of staple line bleeding and anastomotic leakage. There also were no significant differences in other outcomes such as ileus, abdominal or pelvic sepsis, reoperation, positive distal margin, distance from distal margins, length of hospital stay, or mortality. Routine IOE for patients undergoing elective laparoscopic colorectal surgery with distal anastomosis can detect abnormalities at or around the anastomosis. Although the RIOE group had fewer postoperative anastomotic complications, due to the small sample size, the 5.7-fold increase in anastomotic failure did not translate into significantly better postoperative outcomes than the SIOE group experienced. A larger-scale single or multicenter prospective randomized study or a metaanalysis including similar studies is necessary for further investigation of this issue.\n"}]}]}}

We reviewed 390 cases of displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures treated with plate osteosynthesis with or without autologous iliac bone grafting, and compared outcomes and complications related to fracture stabilization. Three hundred ninety patients with displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures that were treated with plate osteosynthesis from December 2002 to December 2010 were reviewed. Two hundred two patients (group A) were treated by osteosynthesis with autologous bone grafting, and 188 patients (group B) were treated by osteosynthesis without bone grafting. One hundred eighty-one patients with an AO type 73-C1 fracture (Sanders type II), 182 patients with an AO type 73-C2 fracture (Sanders type III), and 27 patients with an AO type 73-C3 fracture (Sanders type IV) were included in this study. Bohler's angle, the crucial angle of Gissane, and calcaneal height in the immediate postoperative period and at the 2-year follow-up were compared. Any change in the subtalar joint status was documented and analyzed. The final outcomes of all patients were evaluated by the AOFAS Ankle-Hindfoot Scale and compared in both groups. The mean full weight-bearing time in group A (with bone grafting) was significantly lower (median 6.2 months, range 2.8-9.2 months) than that in group B (without bone grafting; median 9.8 months, range 6.8-12.2 months). The immediate-postoperative Bohler's angle and that at the 2-year follow-up were significantly higher in group A. The loss of Bohler's angle after 2 years was significantly lower in group A (mean 3.5\u00b0; 95 % CI 0.8\u00b0-6.2\u00b0) than in group B (mean 6.2\u00b0; 95 % CI 1.0\u00b0-11.2\u00b0). The average change in the crucial angle and the average change in calcaneal height were not statistically significant for either group. The infection rate in the bone grafting group was higher, though statistically insignificantly so, than in the nongrafting group (8.3 vs. 6.3 %). No significant difference was found between the groups in terms of the rates of good reduction, postoperative osteoarthritis, and subtalar fusion.

Bohler's angle showed improved restoration and the patients returned to full weight-bearing earlier when bone grafting was used in the treatment of intra-articular calcaneal fracture. However, the functional outcomes and complication rates of both groups were similar.\n \nThis study aims to evaluate the efficacy of closed reduction and the effects of timing and fracture types on patient satisfaction. Only patients with isolated nasal fractures were included in the study. Patients with additional maxillofacial fractures and patients whose application time to our clinic was more than 10 days after the trauma were excluded. Patients were classified into 5 types according to their fracture. All patients underwent closed reduction and external fixation under local anesthesia. Patients were asked about their satisfaction in a survey at 28th day and sixth month after the surgery. Patients were divided into groups according to fracture type and intervention time, and the results of the survey were evaluated. Of the 43 patients included in the study, 38 were male, 5 were female, and the average age was 24.9. The average intervention time of the patients was 5.44 days. Twenty-eight (65%) of 43 patients were satisfied with the result, whereas 15 (35%) patients were not happy with their operation. In a comparison of patient satisfaction rates according to fracture type, the mild fracture group had a higher satisfaction rate compared to the severe fracture group. Closed reduction is an easy and sufficient treatment for nasal fractures, especially for mild nasal fractures. Early intervention raises the patient satisfaction rate.\n"}]}]}}

The endpoints measured were postoperative morbidity, length of stay and readmission rates. Both groups were similar in terms of patient demographics, diagnosis, and nature of surgery performed. In the study group, 61% of patients underwent elective surgery compared with 62% in the control group. The incidence of postoperative morbidity in the study group was 20% compared with 33% in the control group (p = 0.003). The rate of readmission as a result of surgical complications was 6% in the study group versus 13% in the control group (p = 0.029).

There has been some evidence supporting the presence of the July effect, including data from surgical specialties. Uniformity of care, regardless of time of year, is required for patients undergoing major cancer surgery. We therefore sought to perform a population-level assessment for the presence of a July effect in this field. We used the Nationwide Inpatient Sample to abstract data on patients undergoing 1 of 8 major cancer surgeries at academic medical centres between Jan. 1, 1999, and Dec. 30, 2009. The primary outcomes examined were postoperative complications and in-hospital mortality. Univariate analyses and subsequently multivariate analyses, controlling for patient and hospital characteristics, were performed to identify whether the time of surgery was an independent predictor of outcome after major cancer surgery. On univariate analysis, the overall postoperative complication rate, as well as genitourinary and hematologic complications specifically, was higher in July than the rest of the year. However, on multivariate analysis, only hematologic complications were significantly higher in July, with no difference in overall postoperative complication rate or in-hospital mortality for all 8 surgeries considered separately or together. On the whole, the data confirm an absence of a July effect in patients undergoing major cancer surgery.\n"}]}]}}

Prospective, randomized study. Tertiary referral center. A total of 104 patients with choledocholithiasis-induced acute cholangitis who underwent primary endoscopic treatment were compared according to insertion of an ENBD tube (51 in the ENBD group and 53 in the no-ENBD group). Insertion of an ENBD tube after clearance of CBD stones. Recurrence of cholangitis and length of hospital stay after clearance of CBD stones.

A routinely inserted ENBD tube did not improve the clinical course, despite patients having to endure increased procedure time and discomfort, and the insertion would therefore be unnecessary.\n \nTo clarify whether or not use of an endoscopic biliary stenting (EBS) is superior to endoscopic nasobiliary drainage (ENBD) in cases of acute cholangitis due to choledocholithiasis. Of 447 patients with choledocholithiasis who were treated in the Department of Gastroenterology, Fukuoka University Chikushi Hospital between January 1994 and September 2006, the subjects were 99 moderate acute cholangitis patients who underwent endoscopic drainage as initial treatment. Clinical efficacy, complications and patient satisfaction (meal intake rete) were investigated in the EBS group (67 patients) and the ENBD group (32 patients). There were no significant differences in the improvement in inflammation, total bilirubin, or biliary enzymes between the EBS and ENBD groups. Catheter occlusion was seen in three patients (4%) in the EBS group, and the catheter was self-extracted by three patients (10%) in the ENBD group. In moderate acute cholangitis due to choledocholithisis, the treatment efficacy and safety of EBS are equal to those of ENBD, and EBS appears to be a better choice in elderly patients in particular.\n"}]}]}}

The probe recorded the temperature level every 10 minutes during four days. We compared the results found with the new storage can with results obtained in the same conditions with the storage can formerly used by our team. We also studied the best position of the probe for temperature monitoring and the influence of the amount of ice within the transport pack on the temperature level. We then monitored the temperature during the conservation of actual human kidney grafts harvested at our institution from August 2007 to May 2008. The temperature levels were the same regardless of the position of the probe within the transport pack. The lowest temperature was maintained during 15 hours, and the temperature level stayed below 5 degrees C for 57 hours with the new storage can. The former storage can maintained the lowest temperature level for 80 minutes, and temperature reached 5 degrees C after 10 hours 40 minutes. Temperature levels were similar when 2 or 4 kg of crushed ice were used. We observed similar results when monitoring the conservation of human grafts.

In fact, data from the era of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) suggest that clinical examination of the axilla is falsely positive in as many as 30% of cases. Here we report the results of SLN biopsy in a selected group of breast cancer patients with palpable axillary nodes classified as either moderately or highly suspicious for metastasis. Among 2,027 consecutive SLN biopsy procedures performed by two experienced surgeons, clinically suspicious axillary nodes were identified in 106, and categorized as group 1 (asymmetric enlargement of the ipsilateral axillary nodes moderately suspicious for metastasis, n = 62) and group 2 (clinically positive axillary nodes highly suspicious for metastasis, n = 44). Clinical examination of the axilla was inaccurate in 41% of patients (43 of 106) overall, and was falsely positive in 53% of patients (33 of 62) with moderately suspicious nodes and 23% of patients (10 of 44) with highly suspicious nodes. False-positive results were less frequent with larger tumor size (p = 0.002) and higher histologic grade (p = 0.002), but were not associated with age, body mass index, or a previous surgical biopsy. Clinical axillary examination in breast cancer is subject to false-positive results, and is by itself insufficient justification for axillary lymph node dissection. If other means of preoperative assessment such as palpation- or image-guided fine needle aspiration are negative or indeterminate, then SLN biopsy deserves wider consideration as an alternative to routine axillary lymph node dissection in the clinically node-positive setting.\n \nAxillary nodal status is one of the most important prognostic factors in breast cancer. In the present study we used it to determine the predictors of axillary lymph node metastases in breast cancer and to determine if there is a group of patients in whom minimal axillary surgery is indicated. This article reports a retrospective study of 953 patients with T1 and T2 invasive breast carcinomas seen in the University Malaya Medical Centre between January 2001 and December 2005, where axillary dissection was done. Of the 953 patients, 283 (29.7%) had breast-conserving surgery, and the rest had mastectomies. In this series, 463 patients (48.6%) were younger than 50 years of age; 365 patients (38.3%) had lymph node involvement. The Malays tend to have more axillary node metastases (45.1%) than the Chinese (36.9%); however, there was no significant relationship between age and race and lymph node involvement. Some 23.9% of grade 1 cancers were node positive, compared to 42.9% of grade 2/3 cancers. Tumor size ranged from 0.2 cm to 5 cm; 55.5% of tumors were T2 (>2-5 cm). There were only 13 (1.4%) T1a tumors (>0.1-0.5 cm). Node involvement was documented in 7.7% of T1a tumors, 12.3% of T1b tumors (>0.5-1 cm), 29.2% of T1c tumors, and 48.2% of T2 tumors. In patients who had no lymphovascular invasion (LVI), 24.4% had axillary node metastases, compared with 52.2% of patients where LVI was reported. On univariate analysis, our study found that tumor diameter>2 cm, presence of lymphovascular invasion, and higher tumor grade (2&3) were factors significantly associated with a higher risk of nodal metastases. On multivariate analysis, however, only lymphovascular invasion and tumor size were independent predictors based on the logistic regression. In T1 tumors, axillary lymph node dissection will overtreat almost 75% of cases; therefore a sentinel lymph node biopsy is justified in these tumors. Sentinel lymph node biopsy has been shown to reduce the complications of formal axillary dissection, such as shoulder stiffness, pain, and lymphedema. In patients with T2 tumors, where almost 45% have lymph node involvement, sentinel node biopsy may not be cost effective.\n"}]}]}}

An ophthalmologist using slit lamp biomicroscopy then examined patients identified with potential STDED. In 357 (88%) patients there was agreement between the two modalities about whether referral to an ophthalmologist was required (kappa 0.62). Retinal photography identified 38 patients for referral to ophthalmology which ophthalmoscopy missed. Of these, the ophthalmologist agreed that STDED was present in 32 (84%) and four patients required early laser. Ophthalmoscopy identified 13 patients for referral who were not identified by photography. Of these, the ophthalmologist agreed with the diabetologist that STDED was present in seven (54%) and one patient required early laser. Ophthalmoscopy may identify the occasional patient with diabetes who has STDED which is missed by retinal photography.

We aimed to evaluate the presence of GER in patients with COPD and its impact on exacerbations. We included 24 patients with stable mild-moderate stage COPD and 19 volunteers as the control group. We conducted a gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptom questionnaire, gastroscopy, manometry, and an ambulatory 24-h pH-impedance study. According to the GERD questionnaire, only 5 (20.8%) patients with COPD had typical GER symptoms. According to the 24-h pH-impedance study, the mean DeMeester score (DMS) was 38.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a034.6 in the COPD group and 13.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a016.8 in the control group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). The acid reflux (DMS\u00a0>\u00a014.7) rate was higher in patients with COPD than in controls (73.9% vs 26.3%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). The symptom association probability positivity rate was 17.4% (n\u00a0=\u00a04) in the COPD group, which was similar to the controls (p\u00a0=\u00a00.11). The mean proximal extension rate of reflux (Z 17\u00a0cm) was 26.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.9% in the COPD group. The proximal extent of reflux was positively correlated with the number of COPD exacerbations per year (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03, r\u00a0=\u00a00.448). In the motility results, only 2 (20%) patients in the control group had a minor motility disorder. Seventeen (70.8%) patients in the COPD group had a minor motility disorder, and 4 (16.7%) had major motility disorders (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). In our study, gastroesophageal reflux was frequent in patients with COPD, but only a quarter had typical reflux symptoms. The proximal extent of reflux may trigger frequent exacerbations of COPD.\n"}]}]}}

This can be done either (i) acutely during the clamp study using high-dose insulin infusion, or (ii) slowly overnight preceding the clamp study using a low-dose insulin infusion. We assessed whether the choice of either of these methods to obtain euglycaemia biases subsequent assessment of glucose metabolism and insulin action. We studied seven obese Type 2 diabetic patients twice Basal plasma glucose levels (mean +/- sd) were 5.5 +/- 0.5 and 10.7 +/- 2.9 mmol/l in the + ON and - ON studies, respectively, and were clamped at -5.5 mmol/l. Basal rates of glucose production (GP) were similar in the + ON and - ON studies, 83 +/- 13 vs. 85 +/- 14 mg m-2 min-1 (NS), whereas basal rates of glucose disappearance (Rd) were lower in the + ON than in the - ON study, 84 +/- 8 vs. 91 +/- 11 mg m-2 min-1 (P = 0.02). During insulin infusion in the clamp period, rates of GP, 23 +/- 11 vs. 25 +/- 10 mg m-2 min-1, as well as rates of Rd, 133 +/- 32 vs. 139 +/- 37 mg m-2 min-1, were similar in the + ON and - ON studies, respectively (NS). Apart from basal rates of Rd, assessment of glucose turnover rates in euglycaemic clamp studies of Type 2 diabetic patients is not dependent on the method by which plasma glucose levels are lowered.\n"}]}]}}

The objective of this study was to assess the effect of HIV infection on receipt of guidance-concordant care, and its impact on overall survival among non-small cell lung cancer Medicare beneficiaries. The study design was a matched case-control design where each HIV patient was matched by age group, sex, race, and lung cancer stage at diagnosis with 20 controls randomly selected among those who were not HIV infected. The patients included in this study were Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer between 1998 and 2007, who qualified for Medicare on the basis of age and were 65 years of age or older at the time of lung cancer diagnosis. HIV infection status was based on Medicare claims data. A total of 174 HIV cases and 3480 controls were included in the analysis. Odds ratios for receiving guidance-concordant care and hazard ratios for overall survival were estimated. HIV infection was not independently associated with the receipt of guidance-concordant care. Among stage I/II patients, median survival times were 26 and 43 months, respectively, for those with and without HIV infection (odds ratio=1.48, P=0.021).

Within a cohort of Japanese men and women aged 40-69 years and free of prior diagnosis of cancer and cardiovascular disease at baseline, data from 4403 patients diagnosed with cancer between 1990 and 2006 and followed up until 2012 were analyzed using survival regression models to assess the presence of an effect of the period of diagnosis (before 1998 versus after 1998) on the risk of dying from cancer. We noted a significant decrease in risk of dying from cancer among individuals diagnosed after 1998 with lung cancer (hazard ratio [HR]=0.676 [0.571-0.800]) or colorectal cancer (HR=0.801 [0.661-0.970]). A decrease in the estimated five-year probability of death from cancer was also noted between the first (before 1998) and the second (after 1998) period of diagnosis for lung and colorectal cancers (e.g., 85.4% vs. 73.3% for lung cancer and 44.6% vs. 37.7% for colorectal cancer, respectively, for stage III in men aged 60 at diagnosis). This study presented the first scientific evidence of improvement in prognosis for lung and colorectal cancer patients in a population-based cohort in Japan.

Invasive cancer was more common in tumors with spiculated appearance than tumors presenting as a distinct mass (adjusted OR, 5.68 [1.81-17.84]). Among invasive tumors, an ill-defined mass was more often large (>20 mm) compared with a distinct mass, (adjusted OR, 3.16 [1.80-5.55]). Tumors presenting as an ill-defined mass or calcifications were more common in dense breasts. Spiculated appearance was related to invasiveness, and ill-defined mass to larger tumor size, regardless of mode of detection and breast density.

A total of 79,582 patients underwent operations at 17 different hospitals (2001 through 2011), including 5.2% (n=4,138) with postoperative cardiac arrest. Failure to rescue was defined as mortality after cardiac arrest. Patient risk, operative features, and outcomes were compared among hospitals. Overall FTR rate was 60% with significant variation among hospitals (range, 50% to 83%; p<0.001). Failure-to-rescue patients were slightly older, presented with increased preoperative risk, and underwent more emergent operations (all p<0.05). After risk adjustment, the variable \"individual hospital\" demonstrated the strongest association with likelihood for FTR (likelihood ratio=39.1; p<0.001). Overall risk-adjusted mortality, cardiac arrest, and FTR rates varied across hospitals and did not correlate. High-performing hospitals with lowest FTR rates accrued longer postoperative and intensive care unit stays after the index operation (2 to 3 days; p<0.001). Significant hospital variation exists in cardiac surgical mortality and FTR rates after cardiac arrest. Institutional factors appear to confer the strongest influence on the likelihood for mortality after cardiac arrest compared with patient and operative factors. Identifying best practice patterns at the highest performing centers may serve to improve surgical outcomes after cardiac arrest and improve patient quality.\n"}]}]}}

This was a prospective observational study conducted between 2002 and 2004. The study was conducted in a tertiary referral menopause clinic at King Edward Memorial Hospital, Western Australia. Patients included 117 postmenopausal women taking combined HT. Outpatient endometrial biopsies were taken during and outside bleeding episodes. The relationship between endometrial uNK cells (CD56+) and bleeding patterns was measured. We also addressed the impact of HT exposure on uNK cell populations, the relationship between endometrial IL-15 expression and uNK cell populations, and killer Ig like receptor genotype in subjects with irregular bleeding. Endometrial CD56+ uNK cells were significantly increased in biopsies obtained during bleeding episodes (P < 0.001), compared with HT users with no bleeding. The highest level of IL-15 expression was also seen in biopsies taken during bleeding. No clear relationship between killer Ig like receptor genotype and bleeding on HT was observed. Little is known about the mechanisms underlying irregular bleeding in HT users.

Since the laparoscopic approach to colon resections was introduced in the early 1990s, it has become the standard of care. Hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery (HALS) is a surgical approach in which dissection is facilitated by the surgeon's hand within the abdominal cavity during laparoscopy. The purpose of this study was to compare the incidence of postoperative ileus and the need for nasogastric tube (NGT) decompression in patients undergoing elective colon resections. Following institutional review board approval, we performed a retrospective review of a prospectively collected database. Included were patients who underwent elective left-sided large bowel resections between 2009 and 2012. Exclusion criteria were urgent operation, stoma creation, ASA IV classification, NGT left in place at the end of surgery, and postoperative anastomotic leakage. Patients were divided into three groups A total of 243 patients were included in this study; 73 patients underwent open surgery, 89 patients underwent HALS, and 81 patients underwent laparoscopic surgery. The proportion of patients who needed postoperative nasogastric decompression was significantly reduced in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery (3.7%) or HALS (4.5%) compared with those who underwent open resection (17.8%). The time from surgery to first flatus and first bowel movement, the time to tolerate solid diet, and the total length of postoperative hospital stay also were all significantly reduced in the laparoscopic and HALS groups compared with the open surgery group. There were no significant differences in any of these measures between the laparoscopic group and the hand-assisted group. Like laparoscopy, HALS is associated with less postoperative ileus and necessitates less NGT decompression than does open surgery.\n"}]}]}}

Percutaneous ethanol injection without aspiration of ethanol-mixed fluid seems to be the preferable method of treatment of benign cystic thyroid nodules from the perspective of both the physician and the patient.\n \nThyroid nodules are common, and of those biopsied by fine-needle aspiration (FNA), the majority will be benign colloid nodules (BCN). Current guidelines suggest these BCN should be followed by ultrasonographic examination (US) every 3 years, with no endpoint specified. This study evaluated if long-term follow-up of benign thyroid nodules was associated with change in treatment or improvement in diagnosing a missed malignancy compared with short-term follow-up. All patients with FNA-based diagnosis of BCN at our institution from 1998 to 2009 were identified. Patients observed after the diagnosis were divided into short-term follow-up (<3 years) and long-term follow-up (\u22653 years). Rates of repeat FNA, thyroidectomy, and malignancy detection were compared. Of 738 patients with BCN, 92 patients underwent thyroid resection after the initial US. Six hundred forty-six patients were observed, of which 366 returned for 1 or more follow-up US Long-term follow-up of patients with BCN is associated with increased repeat FNA and US without improvement in the malignancy detection rate. After 3 years of follow-up, consideration should be given to ceasing long-term routine follow-up of biopsy-proven BCN.\n"}]}]}}

The use of an ultrasonic dissector was not always superior to conventional clamp crushing for performing hepatic parenchymal transections. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of an ultrasonic dissector equipped with electrocautery in hepatic surgery. A prospective study was conducted in 66 consecutive patients who underwent a partial hepatectomy using a new small ultrasonic dissector equipped for electrocautery. To evaluate the effectiveness of using the new instrument, the surgical outcomes were compared with those of historical control. The surgical outcomes of procedures using the new ultrasonic dissector were comparable to those of patients in the conventional ultrasonic dissector group; median blood loss, transection time, transection speed, percentage of tumor exposure at surgical margin, morbidity rate. The number of technical errors and the percentage of patients with an incomplete landmark appearance were lower in the new dissector group, but the differences were not significant. The distribution of hepatectomy grades also did not differ significantly. The surgical outcome of hepatectomies performed using an ultrasonic dissector cannot be significantly improved by the addition of an eletrocautery function to the dissector.\n"}]}]}}

However, the ever present risk of a staple line leak is still a major concern. Since 2005, data from obese patients that undergo bariatric procedures in Germany are prospectively registered in an online database and analyzed at the Institute of Quality Assurance in Surgical Medicine. For the current analysis, all patients that had undergone primary sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity within a 7-year period were considered. Using the GBSR, data from 5.400 LSGs were considered for analysis. Staple line leak rate decreased during the study period from 6.5 to 1.4 %. Male gender, higher BMI, concomitant sleep apnea, conversion to laparotomy, longer operation time, use of both buttresses and oversewing, and the occurrence of intraoperative complications were associated with a significantly higher leakage rate. On multivariate analysis, operation time and year of procedure only had a significant impact on staple line leak rate. The results of the current study demonstrated that there are factors that increase the risk of a leakage which would enable surgeons to define risk groups, to more carefully select patients, and to offer a closer follow-up during the postoperative course with early recognition and adequate treatment.

A 'before-and-after' study design was used to assess any changes in practice, and to monitor whether any changes occurred in the district during the time of the study; data were also collected at the third MOU. Data were collected by scoring of the obstetric files after the patient had delivered. We ascertained whether the obstetric history, syphilis testing, blood group testing, haemoglobin measurement and uterine growth assessment were performed during antenatal care along with whether appropriate action was taken. For intrapartum care, estimation of fetal weight, the performance of pelvimetry, blood pressure monitoring, urine testing, evaluation of head above pelvis, fetal heart rate monitoring, monitoring of contractions and plotting of cervical dilatation, and whether the appropriate actions were taken, were assessed. Eight of the 13 midwives at the two MOUs completed the PEP and all demonstrated an improvement in knowledge. Case notes of 303 patients from the various clinics were studied. There was no change in the referral patterns of any of the clinics during the study period. The obstetric history was well documented, but in no group was there a satisfactory response to a detected problem; appropriate action was taken in between 0% and 12% of cases. Syphilis testing was performed in 56-82% of cases, with no difference between the groups. The haemoglobin level was measured in only 4-15% of patients, with no difference before or after completion of the PEP. Where a problem in uterine growth was detected, an appropriate response occurred in 0-8% of patients and no difference before or after completion of the PEP was ascertained. In all groups, estimation of fetal weight and pelvimetry were seldom performed, the urine and fetal heart rate documentation were moderately well done and the blood pressure monitoring, assessment of head above pelvis, monitoring of contractions and plotting of cervical dilatation were usually performed. No differences before or after the PEP were detected. Where problems were detected, appropriate actions taken during labour improved, but not significantly. Completion of the obstetric manual of the PEP improved the knowledge of the midwives but no alteration in practice was detected.\n \nThe aims of the study were to find out the maternal and perinatal outcome of early onset severe preeclampsia (PE) in a tertiary care center in a developing country like India and to determine whether expectant management in such a setup improves the perinatal outcome. It was a retrospective study. All women with early PE were admitted stabilized and evaluated. Expectant management was given whenever there was no indication for eminent delivery. The perinatal outcome of the expectant group was compared with that of the aggressive group, and appropriate statistical analysis was carried out. A total of 106 women were admitted with severe PE, 61 were treated aggressively, and 45 were stable enough to receive expectant management. The total days gained on expectant management was 7 days. Perinatal mortality was 31.13%. Perinatal outcome of the expectant and aggressive management groups did not differ (P = 0.141); there was no increase in maternal complications on expectant management. There were 2 cases of maternal mortality in the aggressively managed group. Perinatal mortality in severe PE is high. There was no increase in maternal morbidity on expectant management; however, there was no difference in perinatal mortality on expectant management.\n"}]}]}}

Study 1. We recruited 24 patients awaiting standard 12-core TRUS-guided biopsies of the prostate to undergo PHS immediately beforehand. We compared PHS with the TRUS-guided biopsy results in terms of their ability to detect cancer within the whole prostate and to localize it to the correct side and to the correct region of the prostate. Lesions that were suspicious on PHS were biopsied separately. Study 2. We recruited 57 patients awaiting TTB to have PHS beforehand. We compared PHS with the TTB pathology results in terms of their ability to detect prostate cancer within the whole gland and to localize it to the correct side and to the correct sextant of the prostate. Study 3. We recruited 24 patients awaiting radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer to undergo preoperative PHS. We compared PHS with standardized pathological analysis of the whole-mount prostatectomy specimens in terms of their measurement of total tumour volume within the prostate, tumour volume within prostate sextants and volume of index lesions identified by PHS. The PHS-targeted biopsies had an overall cancer detection rate of 38.1%, compared with 62.5% with standard TRUS-guided biopsies. The sensitivity and specificity of PHS for localizing tumour to the correct prostate sextant, compared with standard TRUS-guided biopsies, were 100 and 5.9%, respectively. The PHS-targeted biopsies had an overall cancer detection rate of 13.4% compared with 54.4% for standard TTB. PHS had a sensitivity and specificity for cancer detection in the posterior gland of 100 and 13%, respectively, and for the anterior gland, 6 and 82%, respectively. We found no correlation between total tumour volume estimates from PHS and radical prostatectomy pathology (Pearson correlation coefficient -0.096). Sensitivity and specificity of PHS for detecting tumour foci \u22650.2\u2009mL in volume were 63 and 53%. These three independent studies in 105 patients suggest that PHS does not reliably identify and characterize prostate cancer in the routine clinical setting.\n \nTo determine the effect of prior benign prostate biopsies on the surgical and clinical outcomes of patients treated with radical perineal prostatectomy for prostate cancer. A total of 1369 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer underwent radical prostatectomy by a single surgeon between 1991 and 2001. A subset of 203 patients (14.9%), who had undergone at least one prior benign prostate biopsy for a rising prostate-specific antigen and/or abnormal digital rectal examination, constituted our study population. A total of 1115 patients with no prior biopsy represented our control group. After prostatectomy, patients were evaluated at 6-month intervals for biochemical evidence of recurrence, defined as a prostate-specific antigen level of 0.5 ng/mL or greater. Patients with a prior benign biopsy had more favorable pathologic features with more organ-confined (74% versus 64%; P <0.001) and less margin-positive (9.8% versus 18%) disease. Only 24 patients (12%) in the study group (versus 20% in control group; P = 0.01) had eventual evidence of biochemical failure. Kaplan-Meier analyses suggested that patients with prior benign biopsies have improved biochemical disease-free survival, especially for those with more aggressive disease (Gleason sum 7 or greater; P <0.01). Overall, patients in the study group had lower probability (odds ratio 0.57, P <0.001) of biochemical failure compared with those in the control group. A prior benign prostate biopsy may be independently associated with more favorable surgical and biochemical outcomes after prostatectomy. Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings.\n"}]}]}}

The patients were divided into two groups based on whether capitonnage was carried out (group 1, n = 44) or not (group 2, n = 45). Cystotomy and the closure of the bronchial openings were carried out in both groups. The results were assessed in two groups during a 1 year follow-up period. The groups were comparable with regards to their clinical, operative and demographic characteristics. There was no mortality, and no significant difference in hospitalisation time between the two groups. It was 8.2 +/- 3.2 days for group 1 and 8 +/- 3.1 days for group 2 (P = 0.89). The most serious complications were restricted bronchopleural fistula (only one patient in group 2), empyema (only one patient in group 1 and two patients in group 2), and prolonged air leak (five patients in group 1 and six patients in group 2).

The purpose of this study is to assess whether ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) affects neurologic outcomes in patients with acute cervical spinal cord injury (SCI). There have so far been few reports examining the relationship between OPLL and SCI and there is controversy regarding the deteriorating effects of OPLL-induced canal stenosis on neurologic outcomes. To obtain a relatively uniform background, patients nonsurgically treated for an acute C3-C4 level SCI without any fractures or dislocations of the spinal column were selected, resulting in 129 patients. There were 110 men and 19 women (mean age was 61.1 years), having various neurologic conditions on admission (American Spinal Injury Association [ASIA] impairment scale A, 43; B, 16; C, 58; D, 12). The follow-up period was the duration of their hospital stay and ranged from 50 to 603 days (mean, 233 days). The presence of OPLL, the cause of injury, the degree of canal stenosis (both static and dynamic), and the neurologic outcomes in motor function, including improvement rate, were assessed. Of the 129 patients investigated in this study, OPLL was identified at the site of the injury in 13 patients (10.1%). In this OPLL+ group, the static and dynamic canal diameters at C3 and C4 were significantly smaller than those of the remaining 116 patients (OPLL- group). However, no significant difference was observed between the 2 groups in terms of ASIA motor score both at the time of administration and discharge, and the mean improvement rate in ASIA motor score was 55.5 +/- 9.0% in OPLL+ group, while it was 43.1 +/- 2.8% in the OPLL-group. Furthermore, no significant correlation was observed between the static/dynamic canal diameters and neurologic outcome in all 129 patients. No evidence was found for OPLL to have any effect on the initial neurologic status or recovery in motor function after traumatic cervical cord injury, suggesting that the neurologic outcome is not significantly dependent on canal space.\n"}]}]}}

One mechanism proposed for this association is that green space provides a venue for, and therefore encourages, physical activity. It has also been suggested that socio-economic health inequalities may be narrower in greener areas because of the equalised opportunity for physical activity green spaces provide. However, research exploring associations between the availability of green space and physical activity has produced mixed results. Limits to the assessment of the type and amount of physical activity which occurs specifically in green space may account for these mixed findings. This observational study was therefore concerned with the extent to which green space is a venue for physical activity and whether this could account for narrower socio-economic health inequalities in greener neighbourhoods. Secondary analysis of cross sectional data on 3679 adults (16+) living in urban areas across Scotland matched with a neighbourhood level measure of green space availability. Associations between green space availability and both total physical activity, and activity specifically within green space, were explored using logistic regression models. Interactions between socio-economic position and physical activity were assessed. All models adjusted for age, sex and household income. The availability of green space in a neighbourhood was not associated with total physical activity or that specifically in green space. There was no evidence that income-related inequalities in physical activity within green space were narrower in greener areas of Scotland. Physical activity may not be the main mechanism explaining the association between green space and health in Scotland. The direct effect of perceiving a natural environment on physiological and psychological health may offer an alternative explanation.\n"}]}]}}

There were no significant differences in bile duct injury or postoperative complications between the groups. The length of preoperative, postoperative, and total hospital stay was longer before 2008. ELC is a safe and effective therapeutic strategy for AC. The Tokyo guidelines resulted in a significant increase in the number of ELCs being performed and significantly reduced preoperative and total hospital stay without increasing intra- and postoperative complications.

Using koilocytosis as a marker, the rate of \"active\" cervical lesions was compared with the rate of \"non active\" cervical lesions in patients with \"active\" versus \"non active\" vaginal lesions. Finally, the rates of mild and severe cervical lesions were compared among each group of VAIN (low-grade, high-grade, with or without koilocytosis). In patients with mild vaginal lesions, mild cervical lesions were significantly more frequent than severe cervical lesions. In patients with \"active\" vaginal lesions the rate of \"active\" cervical lesions was significantly higher than \"non active\" cervical lesions. The differences in rates of mild cervical lesions and severe cervical lesions among patients with high-grade VAIN and low-grade VAIN (with and without koilocytosis) were not significant. These data suggest that CIN and VAIN may have some common features in certain cases, i.e., if an HPV infection is proved.\n \nThe aims of this study were to evaluate the efficiency of p16INK4a in showing cervical lesions and to determine any relationship between lesion grade and high-risk human papilloma virus (HR-HPV) infection and p16INK4a staining characteristics. Immunohistochemical analysis of p16INK4a was performed on 13 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL), 22 high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL), 23 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and 25 normal tissue samples. The distribution, staining pattern and intensity of p16INK4a expression were assessed and correlated with HR-HPV positivity determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. All HSIL and SCC cases, but only 46.2% of LSIL cases, were positive for p16INK4a. Although positive staining of p16INK4a in showing HR-HPV-positive lesions was statistically significant (P=0.000), we could not find a significant correlation for distribution (P=0.319), staining pattern (P=0.057) or intensity (P=0.057) of p16INK4a in showing HR-HPV in cervical epithelium. These parameters were correlated only with the increasing grade of the lesion (P=0.000). p16INK4a is a highly sensitive marker of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cervical cancer. There is a good correlation between p16INK4a expression and cervical lesion grade and HR-HPV positivity. The distribution, staining pattern and intensity of this marker are significantly correlated with the increasing grade of cervical lesions, suggesting that diffuse distribution, full thickness staining pattern and strong intensity of this marker are highly supportive of HSIL and cervical cancer, while focal distribution, scattered/basal staining pattern and weak intensity suggest LSIL. However, these parameters are not correlated with HR-HPV status in cervical lesions.\n"}]}]}}

We sought to investigate whether contact with specialist care was associated with lifestyle factors or socioeconomic status. Nationwide population-based prospective cohort study in Denmark, based on a random sample of 51 090 women aged 20 years or older from the general population. A web-based questionnaire regarding gynecological alarm symptoms and lifestyle was distributed to the invited individuals. Data about contact with specialist care were obtained from the National Patient Register and the National Health Insurance Service Registry, whereas information about socioeconomic status was collected from Statistics Denmark. Main outcome measures were percentages of patients having contact with specialist care and odds ratios (ORs) for associations between specialist care contact, lifestyle factors and socioeconomic status. The study included 25 866 nonpregnant women; 2957 reported the onset of at least one gynecological cancer alarm symptom, and 683 of these (23.1%) reported symptoms to their general practitioner. The proportion of individuals having contact with specialist care ranged from 39.3% (pain during intercourse) to 47.8% (bleeding during intercourse). Individuals with higher educational level had significantly higher odds of contact with a specialist (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.17-2.95). Educational level influences contact with specialist care among patients with gynecological cancer alarm symptoms. Future studies should investigate inequalities in access to the secondary healthcare system.\n \nTo determine the frequency and presenting features of infants with delayed diagnosis of anorectal malformations (ARM) referred to an Australian tertiary paediatric institution. Infants referred to our institution with a final diagnosis of ARM were retrospectively reviewed between 2001 and 2009. The first cohort consisted of patients that were referred between November 2001 and November 2006 with the diagnosis of an ARM that had been delayed for more than 48 h. The second cohort was those referred between December 2006 and May 2009 with whom the diagnosis of ARM had not been made within 24 h of birth. Nineteen infants were referred with delayed diagnosis of an ARM over the 7.5 years of the study. Of 44 patients referred to our institution between December 2006 and May 2009, diagnosis of an ARM was delayed more than 24 h in 14 (32%). There was no difference in gender, birth weight, prematurity, type of malformation or presence of associated anomalies between those with timely and delayed diagnosis of their ARM. A significantly greater proportion of those with a delayed diagnosis presented with obstructive symptoms (86% vs. 27%, P < 0.001), including abdominal distension (57%) and delayed passage of meconium or stool (29%). Despite undergoing neonatal examination, the diagnosis of ARM was missed in 12 patients overall. Delayed diagnosis of an ARM appears to be common, occurring in approximately 32% of patients referred to our institution over the last 2.5 years. Current guidelines appear insufficient to ensure prompt diagnosis of ARM.\n"}]}]}}

Previous studies have demonstrated that TEE is superior to transthoracic echocardiography for the detection of potential cardiac sources of embolism. In our institution, this scenario now represents the most frequent reason for requesting TEE. For the most part, these TEE examinations are ordered by a neurologist, and transthoracic echocardiography is not performed beforehand. Over a 2-year period, TEE was requested for 137 patients at our institution for the evaluation of a cerebral ischemic event. The complete hospital chart was available for review in 106 of these patients, and they form the study group. All patients underwent TEE using either a biplane or omniplane transducer, with Doppler color flow imaging and saline contrast administration performed in every case. Studies were reviewed for the presence of possible cardiac or aortic sources of cerebral emboli, and hospital charts were reviewed to collect clinical information. A potential cardiovascular embolic source was detected in 35% of patients. Abnormalities were discovered in 53% (16/30) of patients with atrial fibrillation vs 28% (21/76) of patients in sinus rhythm (P < .001). Both patients who had left atrial thrombus and 12 of 13 with left atrial spontaneous contrast had atrial fibrillation (P < .001). Protruding aortic atherosclerotic debris was the most frequent abnormality among patients in sinus rhythm. It may not be cost-effective to perform TEE as a routine diagnostic procedure in patients presenting with cerebral ischemic events. Most patients with atrial fibrillation are candidates for empiric warfarin sodium therapy, and patients in sinus rhythm usually have findings for which there is no recommended therapy or for which only aspirin is indicated.\n \nThe brain-dead donor supply has become one of the criteria limiting the performance of heart transplantation. Conventional screening criteria are too limiting and exclude suitable heart donors. Echocardiography is now widely available and is a reliable tool to assess left ventricular dysfunction in brain-dead donors. Yet few data are available on the degree of left ventricular dysfunction where a transplantation is possible. Fifty-five potential brain-dead heart donors (age 38 +/- 11 years) were prospectively evaluated by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) before harvesting. Fractional area change (FAC) was used to assess left ventricular function in potential brain-dead donors. Transplanted hearts were evaluated on the fifth postoperative day. The transplantation was considered a success if the recipient was alive, not retransplanted, without an assistance device or an epinephrine infusion of more than 1 mg/h and showed an ejection fraction above 40%. Of the 55 potential heart donors, 20 exhibited an FAC of less than 50%. Forty hearts were harvested, 36 of which were successfully transplanted. Nine patients had an FAC below 50% (group H2) and 27 had an FAC over 50% (group H1). Four patients died TEE is useful to assess left ventricular function in potential brain-dead donors. An FAC less than 50% is present in 36% of potential heart donors. Because left ventricular dysfunction is often reversible shortly after transplantation, an FAC below 50% may not necessarily preclude the use of hearts for transplantation.\n"}]}]}}

Twenty-eight female Sprague Dawley rats were allocated randomly to 4 groups. The sham group (group 1) was only subjected to catheter insertion, not to pneumoperitoneum. Group 2 received a 1 mg/kg dose of 0.9% sodium chloride by the intraperitoneal route for 10 min before pneumoperitoneum. Groups 3 and 4 received 6 and 12 mg/kg edaravone, respectively, by the intraperitoneal route for 10 min before pneumoperitoneum. After 60 min of pneumoperitoneum, the gas was deflated. Immediately after the reperfusion period, both ovaries were excised for histological scoring, caspase-3 immunohistochemistry and biochemical evaluation including glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. Also, total antioxidant capacity (TAC) was measured in plasma samples to evaluate the antioxidant effect of edaravone. Ovarian sections in the saline group revealed higher scores for follicular degeneration and edema (p < 0.0001) when compared with the sham group. Administration of different doses of edaravone in rats significantly prevented degenerative changes in the ovary (p < 0.0001). Caspase-3 expression was only detected in the ovarian surface epithelium in all groups, and there was a significant difference between the treatment groups and the saline group (p < 0.0001). Treatment of rats with edaravone reduced caspase-3 expression in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, biochemical measurements of oxidative stress markers (MDA, GSH and TAC) revealed that prophylactic edaravone treatment attenuated oxidative stress induced by I/R injury. These results indicate that prophylactic treatment with edaravone prevents I/R-induced ovarian damage during pneumoperitoneum in an experimental rat model.\n \nIn several studies, the prolonged exposure to talc has been associated with development of ovarian cancer. However, some studies have advocated contrary views. The present study aims to investigate histopathological changes and whether long-term talc exposure is associated with potential carcinogenic effects on the female genital organs of rats. The present study was conducted at Dumlupinar University Medical Faculty and a total of 28 Sprague-Dawley rats were included. The experimental animals were allocated into four groups having seven rats each. Groups 1 and 2 served as controls, where the rats in Group 1 did not receive any intervention and Group 2 received intravaginal saline. Groups 3 and 4 received intravaginal or perineal talc application, respectively. Talc was applied for 3 months on a daily basis. Histopathological changes in the peritoneum and female genital system were evaluated. For statistical analyses, Fisher's exact test was carried out using SPSS. In both the groups exposed to talc (Groups 3 and 4), evidence of foreign body reaction and infection, along with an increase in inflammatory cells, were found in all the genital tissues. Genital infection was observed in 12 rats in the study group and 2 rats in the control group. Neoplastic change was not found. However, there was an increase in the number of follicles in animals exposed to talc. No peritoneal change was observed. In the groups not exposed to talc, similar infectious findings were found, but there was a statistically significant difference between the groups (Groups 1 and 2 vs. Groups 3 and 4, P > 0.05). Neoplastic change was also not observed in these groups. Four groups were compared in terms of neoplastic effects and infections. In Groups 1, 5 rats were normal, two developed vulvovaginitis and endometritis with overinfection (in both ovaries), and one developed salpingitis (in both fallopian tubes), that is, infection was found in a total of two rats. In Group 2, only one experimental animal had endometritis. All the animals in Groups 3 and 4 developed infections. Talc has unfavorable effects on the female genital system. However, this effect is in the form of foreign body reaction and infection, rather than being neoplastic.\n"}]}]}}

The lace plant (Aponogeton madagascariensis) produces perforations in its leaves through PCD. The leaves of the plant consist of a latticework of longitudinal and transverse veins enclosing areoles. PCD occurs in the cells at the center of these areoles and progresses outwards, stopping approximately five cells from the vasculature. The role of mitochondria during PCD has been recognized in animals; however, it has been less studied during PCD in plants. The following paper elucidates the role of mitochondrial dynamics during developmentally regulated PCD in vivo in A. madagascariensis. A single areole within a window stage leaf (PCD is occurring) was divided into three areas based on the progression of PCD; cells that will not undergo PCD (NPCD), cells in early stages of PCD (EPCD), and cells in late stages of PCD (LPCD). Window stage leaves were stained with the mitochondrial dye MitoTracker Red CMXRos and examined. Mitochondrial dynamics were delineated into four categories (M1-M4) based on characteristics including distribution, motility, and membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m). A TUNEL assay showed fragmented nDNA in a gradient over these mitochondrial stages. Chloroplasts and transvacuolar strands were also examined using live cell imaging. The possible importance of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) formation during PCD was indirectly examined via in vivo cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment. This treatment resulted in lace plant leaves with a significantly lower number of perforations compared to controls, and that displayed mitochondrial dynamics similar to that of non-PCD cells. Results depicted mitochondrial dynamics in vivo as PCD progresses within the lace plant, and highlight the correlation of this organelle with other organelles during developmental PCD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of mitochondria and chloroplasts moving on transvacuolar strands to form a ring structure surrounding the nucleus during developmental PCD. Also, for the first time, we have shown the feasibility for the use of CsA in a whole plant system. Overall, our findings implicate the mitochondria as playing a critical and early role in developmentally regulated PCD in the lace plant.\n \nThe hypothesis was tested that pectin content and methylation degree participate in regulation of cell wall mechanical properties and in this way may affect tissue growth and freezing resistance over the course of plant cold acclimation and de-acclimation. Experiments were carried on the leaves of two double-haploid lines of winter oil-seed rape (Brassica napus subsp. oleifera), differing in winter survival and resistance to blackleg fungus (Leptosphaeria maculans). Plant acclimation in the cold (2 degrees C) brought about retardation of leaf expansion, concomitant with development of freezing resistance. These effects were associated with the increases in leaf tensile stiffness, cell wall and pectin contents, pectin methylesterase (EC 3.1.1.11) activity and the low-methylated pectin content, independently of the genotype studied. However, the cold-induced modifications in the cell wall properties were more pronounced in the leaves of the more pathogen-resistant genotype. De-acclimation promoted leaf expansion and reversed most of the cold-induced effects, with the exception of pectin methylesterase activity. The results show that the temperature-dependent modifications in pectin content and their methyl esterification degree correlate with changes in tensile strength of a leaf tissue, and in this way affect leaf expansion ability and its resistance to freezing and to fungus pathogens.\n"}]}]}}

Since optotypes are evaluated on individuals with good visual acuity and without eye disorders, differences in the lower visual acuity range cannot be excluded. In this study, visual acuity measured with the Snellen E was compared to the Landolt C acuity. 100 patients (age 8 - 90 years, median 60.5 years) with various eye disorders, among them 39 with amblyopia due to strabismus, and 13 healthy volunteers were tested. Charts with the Snellen E and the Landolt C (Precision Vision) which mimic the ETDRS charts were used to assess visual acuity. Three out of 5 optotypes per line had to be correctly identified, while wrong answers were monitored. In the group of patients, the eyes with the lower visual acuity, and the right eyes of the healthy subjects, were evaluated. Differences between Landolt C acuity (LR) and Snellen E acuity (SE) were small. The mean decimal values for LR and SE were 0.25 and 0.29 in the entire group and 0.14 and 0.16 for the eyes with strabismus amblyopia.

Asthma severity was assessed using the GINA criteria; accordingly, a patient was classified as receiving inadequate treatment if his/her current use of drugs was lower than that suggested by the guidelines for the corresponding severity level. The absence of asthma attacks in the last 3 months was used as an indicator of the disease control. Fifty-five percent of the patients had persistent asthma. Overall, 48% (95% CI 41.2-54.8) of persistent asthmatics were receiving inadequate treatment, and 66% (95% CI 59.5-72.4) had not used their medication daily over the past 3 months. Persistent asthmatics who were inadequately treated had a significantly greater frequency of asthma attacks (geometric mean ratio 3.7; 95% CI 2.1-6.6) than those using an adequate dose of medication. Mild and moderate persistent asthmatics using an adequate medication regimen reported a low number of asthma attacks (median 0).

Despite the increase in the use of inhaled corticosteroids, half of the persistent asthmatics from the general population are using a medication regimen below their severity level.

Health service contacts for asthma, assessed from GP case records, were used as a proxy for morbidity. A weak U-shaped relationship was found between the salivary cotinine level and health service contacts for asthma High levels of parental smoking in the home are associated with a reduction in health care contacts for asthma. This could be due to a lack of awareness of asthma symptoms among heavy smokers or a reluctance to visit the GP. Children with asthma who have parents who smoke heavily may not be receiving adequate management.\n"}]}]}}

Records of 41 patients more than 3 years old who underwent a pull-through for HD (TERPT, n = 20; ABD, n = 21) were reviewed, and their families were thoroughly interviewed and scored via a 15-item post-pull-through long-term outcome questionnaire. Patients were operated on between the years 1995 and 2003. During this time, our group transitioned from the ABD to the TERPT technique. Total scoring ranged from 0 to 40 Overall scores were similar. However, continence score was significantly better in the ABD group, and the stool pattern score was better in the TERPT group. A significant difference in age at interview between the 2 groups was noted; we therefore reanalyzed the data controlling for age, and this showed that age did not significantly affect the long-term scoring outcome between groups. Our long-term study showed significantly better (2-fold) results regarding the continence score for the abdominal approach compared with the transanal pull-through.

The medical notes of patients with CP younger than 16 years admitted with airway obstruction to a tertiary referral Pediatric Otolaryngology Center from 2006 to 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. The gender, age of referral, co-morbidities, type of surgical intervention and age this was performed and the time interval between sequential surgeries were documented. Fifteen children with CP and airway obstruction were admitted, eight boys and seven girls with an average age of referral 8 years (range 3-13.3 years). Adenotonsillectomy was performed in 11/15 patients at a mean age of 9.1 years (range 4.5-14 years). Tracheostomy was performed in 8/15 children at an average age of 11.6 years (range 7.5-15 years). Seven out of 11 patients having undergone adenotonsillectomy, required tracheostomy after an average time interval of 1.9 years (range 0.5-3.5 years). Tracheostomy was performed in 80% of referred patients with CP older than 10 years, while surgical intervention was uncommon in children younger than 5 years. There was a statistically significant correlation between the age of the children and the performance of a tracheostomy (Pearson's correlation coefficient 0.68, p = 0.005). The severity of the airway obstruction in children with CP tends to increase with age. We postulate that this increase results from worsening hypotonia of pharyngeal musculature.

Relatively little attention has been paid to whether the sex of the physician affects the rates of cancer screening among women. We examined differences between male and female physicians in the frequency of screening mammograms and Pap smears among women patients enrolled in a large Midwestern health plan. We identified claims for mammography and Pap tests submitted by primary care physicians for 97,962 women, 18 to 75 years of age, who were enrolled in the health plan in 1990. The sex of the physician was manually coded, and the physician's age was obtained from the state licensing board. After identifying a principal physician for each woman, we calculated the frequency of mammography and Pap smears for each physician, using the number of women in his or her practice during 1990 as the denominator. Using unconditional logistic regression, we also calculated the odds ratio of having a Pap smear or mammogram for women patients with female physicians as compared with those with male physicians, controlling for the physician's and the patient's age. Crude rates for Pap smears and mammography were higher for the patients of female than male physicians in most age groups of physicians. The largest differences between female and male physicians were in the rates of Pap smears among the youngest physicians. For the subgroup of women enrolled in the health plan for a year who saw only one physician, after adjustment for the patient's age and the physician's age and specialty, the odds ratio for having a Pap smear was 1.99 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.72 to 2.30) for the patients of female physicians as compared with those of male physicians. For women 40 years old and older, the odds ratio for having a mammogram was 1.41 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.22 to 1.63). For both Pap smears and mammography, the differences between female and male physicians in screening rates were much more pronounced in internal medicine and family practice than in obstetrics and gynecology. Women are more likely to undergo screening with Pap smears and mammograms if they see female rather than male physicians, particularly if the physician is an internist or family practitioner.\n \nFew studies have explored health care market structure and colorectal cancer (CRC) screening test use, and little is known whether market factors contribute to racial/ethnic screening disparities. We investigated whether HMO market level factors, controlling for individual covariates, differentially impact Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) subjects' access to CRC screening compared with white subjects. We used random intercept hierarchical models to predict CRC test use. Individual-level survey data was linked to market data by metropolitan statistical areas from InterStudy. Insured first-degree relatives, ages 40-80, of a random sample of colorectal cancer cases identified from the California Cancer Registry Dependent variables were receipt of (1) annual fecal occult blood test only; (2) sigmoidoscopy in the past 5 years; (3) colonoscopy in the past 10 years; and (4) any of these tests over the recommended time interval. Market characteristics were HMO penetration, HMO competition, and proportion of staff/group/network HMOs. Market characteristics were as important as individual-level characteristics for AAPI but not for white subjects. Among AAPI subjects, a 10% increase in the percent of group/staff/network model HMO was associated with a reduction in colonoscopy use (28.9% to 20.5%) and in receipt of any of the CRC tests (53.2% to 45.4%). The prevailing organizational structure of a health care market confers a penalty on access to CRC test use among high-risk AAPI subjects but not among high-risk white subjects. Identifying the differential effect of market structure on race/ethnicity can potentially reduce the cancer burden among disadvantaged racial groups.\n"}]}]}}

Indications included evaluation anemia/gastrointestinal bleed, small bowel IBD and dilation of strictures. Video-capsule endoscopy (VCE) was used prior to DBE in 43 of the 66 patients prior to DBE evaluation. The mean age was 62 years. Thirty-two patients were female, 15 were African-American; 44 antegrade and 44 retrograde DBEs were performed. The mean time per antegrade DBE was 107.4\u00b130.0 minutes with a distance of 318.4\u00b1152.9 cm reached past the pylorus. The mean time per lower DBE was 100.7\u00b127.3 minutes with 168.9\u00b1109.1 cm meters past the ileocecal valve reached. Endoscopic therapy in the form of electrocautery to ablate bleeding sources was performed in 20 patients (30.3%), biopsy in 17 patients (25.8%) and dilation of Crohn's-related small bowel strictures in 4 (6.1%). 43 VCEs with pathology noted were performed prior to DBE, with findings endoscopically confirmed in 32 cases (74.4%). In 3 cases the DBE showed findings not noted on VCE. DBE appears to be equally safe and effective when performed in the community setting as compared to a tertiary referral center with a comparable yield, efficacy, and complication rate.\n \nThe aim of this study was to analyze the contribution of the double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) for diagnosis of the small bowel disorders. Forty-four patients (20 women, 24 men; mean age 53.5 years-old, range 21-89 years) with chronic gastrointestinal bleeding, diarrhea, polyposis, weight-loss, Roux-en-Y surgery, and other indications underwent DBE. Twenty patients had occult or obscure gastrointestinal bleeding. The source of bleeding was identified in 15/20 (75%) 1.

The aim of this study was to analyse the 30-day mortality, age-related 30-day mortality and 1-year mortality following emergency laparotomy. We hope this will encourage prospective data collection, improvement of care and initiate strategies to establish best practice in this area. This was a retrospective study of patients who underwent emergency laparotomy from June 2010 to May 2012. The primary end point of the study was 30-day mortality, age-related 30-day mortality and 1-year all-cause mortality. 477 laparotomies were performed in 446 patients. 57% were aged <70 and 43% aged >70 years. 30-day mortality was 12, 4% in those aged <70 years and 22% in those >70 years (p < 0.001). 1-year mortality was 25, 15% in those aged under 70 years and 38% in those aged >70 years (p < 0.001). Emergency laparotomy carries a high rate of mortality, especially in those over the age of 70 years, and more needs to be done to improve outcomes, particularly in this group. This could involve increasing acute surgical care manpower, early recognition of patients requiring emergency surgery, development of clear management protocols for such patients or perhaps even considering centralisation of emergency surgical services to specialist centres with multidisciplinary teams involving emergency surgeons and care of the elderly physicians in hospital and related community outreach services for post-discharge care.\n \nHip fractures in the elderly are followed by considerable risk of functional decline and mortality. The purposes of this study were to (1) explore predictive factors of functional level at discharge, (2) evaluate 1-year mortality after hip fracture compared with that of the general population, and (3) evaluate the affect of early functional outcome on 1-year mortality in patients operated on for hip fractures. A total of 228 consecutive patients (average age, 77.6 \u00b1 7.4 years) with hip fractures who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled in an open, prospective, observational cohort study. Functional level at discharge was measured with the motor Functional Independence Measure (FIM) score, which is the most widely accepted functional assessment measure in use in the rehabilitation community. Mortality rates in the study population were calculated in absolute numbers and as the standardized mortality ratio. Multivariate regression analysis was used to explore predictive factors for motor FIM score at discharge and for 1-year mortality adjusted for important baseline variables. Age, health status, cognitive level, preinjury functional level, and pressure sores after hip fracture surgery were independently related to lower discharge motor FIM scores. At 1-year followup, 57 patients (25%; 43 women and 14 men) had died. The 1-year hip fracture mortality rate compared with that of the general population was 31% in our population versus 7% for men and 23% in our population versus 5% for women 65 years or older. The 1-year standardized mortality rate was 341.3 (95% CI, 162.5-520.1) for men and 301.6 (95% CI, 212.4-391.8) for women, respectively. The all-cause mortality rate observed in this group was higher in all age groups and in both sexes when compared with the all-cause age-adjusted mortality of the general population. Motor FIM score at discharge was the only independent predictor of 1-year mortality after hip fracture. Functional level at discharge is the main determinant of long-term mortality in patients with hip fracture. Motor FIM score at discharge is a reliable predictor of mortality and can be recommended for clinical use.\n"}]}]}}

This research uses vignettes to elucidate factors associated with sleep disorders in adult Japanese before and after adjustment for reporting heterogeneity in self-reports. This study also evaluates the need for adjusting for reporting heterogeneity in the management of sleep and energy related problems in Japan. We investigated a dataset of 1002 respondents aged 18 years and over from the Japanese World Health Survey, which collected information through face-to-face interview from 2002 to 2003. The ordered probit model and the Compound Hierarchical Ordered Probit (CHOPIT) model, which incorporated anchoring vignettes, were employed to estimate and compare associations of sleep and energy with socio-demographic and life-style factors before and after adjustment for differences in response category cut-points for each individual. The prevalence of self-reported problems with sleep and energy was 53 %. Without correction of cut-point shifts, age, sex, and the number of comorbidities were significantly associated with a greater severity of sleep-related problems. After correction, age, the number of comorbidities, and regular exercise were significantly associated with a greater severity of sleep-related problems; sex was no longer a significant factor. Compared to the ordered probit model, the CHOPIT model provided two changes with a subtle difference in the magnitude of regression coefficients after correction for reporting heterogeneity. Sleep disorders are common in the general adult population of Japan. Correction for reporting heterogeneity using anchoring vignettes is not a necessary tool for proper management of sleep and energy related problems among Japanese adults. Older age, gender differences in communicating sleep-related problems, the presence of multiple morbidities, and regular exercise should be the focus of policies and clinical practice to improve sleep and energy management in Japan.\n \nThe National Kidney Foundation recommends reporting estimates of glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) rather than timed urine collections. When 2 of the 3 major hospitals in our region began reporting eGFR at different times we recognized a natural experiment. We conducted a retrospective, observational study at the 3 major hospitals in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Data were collected on the frequency of timed urines during a 41/2-year period. Regression analysis was used to study the association of the rate of ordering timed urines adjusted for other factors. There was a marked drop in the rate of ordering of timed urines at all 3 hospitals from a mean of 21.8 per 1000 admissions in the first 4 quarter years of the study to 10.9 in the last 4 (15th-18th) quarter years. The drop began before the reporting of eGFR at any hospital. The reporting of eGFR had a small effect (-1.7 per 1000 hospital admissions) that was not statistically significant (P = 0.15). There has been a marked drop in the ordering of timed urines in our region. The decline began before the reporting of eGFR at 2 of the hospitals and therefore is attributable to other factors.\n"}]}]}}

We studied 50 patients (mean age 42 years\u00b114), with no history of cardio-cerebrovascular events and \"normal\" IMT. We assessed the traditional cardiovascular risk factors, the CCA IMT, and the local stiffness with Quality Arterial Stiffness technology, based on Radio frequency signal (RFQAS-ESAOTE, Italy). CCA distensibility coefficient (DC), compliance coefficient (CC), pulse wave velocity (PWV) and \u03b2 parameter were measured in patients, with and without traditional cardiovascular risk factors. 25 subjects with risk factors (mean age 49\u00b113) were compared with 25 controls (mean age 36\u00b112). We did not find any significant differences in the IMT measurement between subjects with CV risk factors compared to controls (0.530\u00b10.99 mm vs. 0.626\u00b10.127 mm; P=5.68).

Basic clinical and biochemical parameters and oxLDL level were measured in 70 patients at baseline and after 2 years of the study. In addition, an ultrasonographic study was performed to assess the carotid intima media thickness (IMT). Patients did not differ according to basic clinical and biochemical parameters at the beginning and after 2 years of the study. IMT increased (p=0.000001) whereas oxLDL level decreased (p=0.00001) in DM1 patients during 2 years. Multivariate regression analysis showed that oxLDL independently influences IMT in DM1 patients (\u03b2=0.454, R2=0.35). Further, positive correlations between oxLDL value and LDL-C concentration (r=0.585, p<0.05, n=70) and between oxLDL level and apo-B concentration have been established (r=0.610, p<0.05, n=70). Moreover, patients with chronic microvascular complications showed a higher value of IMT in comparison with patients without them (p=0.003). Our results provide the evidence that oxLDL accelerates atherosclerotic plaque formation and may contribute to the development of microvascular complications in DM1.\n"}]}]}}

This is a descriptive comparison of prospectively collected data on all children admitted to the short stay ward at Westmead Hospital (WH) during 1994 and the short stay ward at the New Children's Hospital (NCH) during 1997-98. These hospitals service an identical demographic area with the latter (NCH) a tertiary referral center. The following outcome measures were used The short stay ward accounted for 10.3% (Westmead Hospital) and 14.7% (New Children's Hospital) of admissions, with 56% medical in nature, 30% surgical, and the remainder procedural or psychological. Admission patterns were similar, with asthma, gastroenteritis, convulsion, pneumonia, and simple surgical conditions accounting for most short stay ward admissions. The short stay ward increased hospital efficiency with an average length of stay of 17.5 hours (Westmead Hospital) compared to 20.5 hours (New Children's Hospital). The users of the short stay ward were children of young age less than 2 years, with stay greater than 23 hours reported in only 1% of all admissions to the short stay ward. The rate of patient admission to an in-hospital bed was low, (4% [Westmead Hospital] compared to 6% [New Children's Hospital]), with the number of unscheduled visits within 72 hours of short stay ward discharge less than 1%. There were no adverse events reported at either short stay ward, with parental satisfaction high. The short stay ward was developed through reallocation of resources from within the hospital to the short stay ward. This resulted in estimated savings of $1/2 million (Westmead Hospital) to $2.3 million (New Children's Hospital) to the hospital, due to more efficient bed usage. This data demonstrates the robust nature of the short stay ward. At these two very different institutions we have shown improved bed efficient and patient care in a cost-effective way. We have also reported on greater parental satisfaction and early return of the child with their family to the community.\n"}]}]}}

To maintain safe and independent transport, mobility is important for all individuals, but especially for older drivers. The objective of this study was to investigate whether automatic transmission, compared with manual transmission, may improve the driving behavior of older drivers. In total, 31 older drivers (mean age 75.2 years) and 32 younger drivers - used as a control group (mean age 39.2 years) - were assessed twice on the same fixed route; once in a car with manual transmission and once in a car with automatic transmission. The cars were otherwise identical. The driving behavior was assessed with the Ryd On-Road Assessment driving protocol. Time to completion of left turns (right-hand side driving) and the impact of a distraction task were measured. The older group had more driving errors than the younger group, in both the manual and the automatic transmission car. However, and contrary to the younger drivers, automatic transmission improved the older participants' driving behavior as demonstrated by safer speed adjustment in urban areas, greater maneuvering skills, safer lane position and driving in accordance with the speed regulations. Switching to automatic transmission may be recommended for older drivers as a means to maintain safe driving and thereby the quality of their transport mobility.\n"}]}]}}

We investigated the role of routine laboratory parameters in distinguishing NASH from ASH. Liver biopsies performed at our hospital over a 10-year period were reviewed, 95 patients with steatohepatitis identified and their data prior to biopsy reevaluated. The diagnosis NASH or ASH was assigned (other liver diseases excluded) on the basis of the biopsy and history of alcohol consumption (< 140 g/week). Logistic regression models were used for analysis. NASH was diagnosed in 58 patients (61%; 30 f) and ASH in 37 (39%; 9 f). High-grade fibrosis (59% vs. 19%, P < 0.0001) and an AST/ALT ratio > 1 (54.1% vs 20.7%, P = 0.0008) were more common in ASH. The MCV was elevated in 53% of ASH patients and normal in all NASH patients (P < 0.0001). Multivariate analysis identified the MCV (P = 0.0013), the AST/ALT ratio (P = 0.011) and sex (P = 0.0029) as relevant regressors (aROC = 0.92). The AST/ALT ratio (P < 0.0001) and age (P = 0.00049) were independent predictors of high-grade fibrosis. Differences in MCV were more marked in high-grade fibrosis. Higher MCVs and AST/ALT ratios in ASH reflect the severity of underlying liver disease and do not differentiate NASH from ASH. Instead, these biomarkers might prove useful in guiding selection of patients for liver biopsy and in targeting therapy.\n \nThyroid hormones play an important role in the regulation of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, both of which are affected in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Anecdotally, we have observed that a number of patients with NASH carried a diagnosis of hypothyroidism. However, it is unknown if thyroid dysfunction plays any role in the pathogenesis of NASH. To further investigate this observation, we conducted a case-control study to determine the association between hypothyroidism and NASH. Cases were defined as patients with well-documented NASH attending hepatology clinics at Indiana University Hospital from January 1, 1995 to December 31, 2000. Age, gender, race, and body-weight matched individuals seen during the same period in the general medical clinics served as controls. Patients with a previous diagnosis of hypothyroidism who are currently on synthetic T4 replacement were considered to be \"hypothyroid\". The strength of association was assessed by logistic regression analysis after controlling for the frequency of diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. One hundred seventy-four patients with NASH (cases) and 442 controls were included. The mean age of cohort was 49 +/- 13 years, 59% were female, and 98% were white. The prevalence of hypothyroidism in patients with NASH was 15% was significantly higher than in the controls (7.2%, P < 0.001). By multivariate analysis, the prevalence of hypothyroidism in the NASH group was significantly higher than in control group (OR These data suggest that hypothyroidism is associated with human NASH. Further research is needed to confirm this finding and to understand its implications.\n"}]}]}}

One of the municipalities was selected for the validation study. The health survey 1984-86 addressed all inhabitants > or = 20 years of age in Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag county, Norway; 76,885 (90.3%) of the eligible population participated in answering the question on diabetes. All inhabitants in the municipality answering \"yes\" to the question on diabetes (n = 169) and the persons with the same sex born closest before and after each diabetic patient and answering \"no\" to the diabetes question (n = 338) were included. A very thorough search was made in the medical files of the general practitioners in the municipality for corresponding information. Compared to the files, diabetes was verified in 163 out of the 169. The commonest cause of discrepancy was renal glycosuria. One out of the 338 registered non-diabetic persons was found to have diabetes. Diabetic patients tended to overestimate diabetes duration significantly. Insulin treatment was verified in 19/20 (95%) and treatment with oral hypoglycaemic agents in all 44 with an affirmative questionnaire answer. A negative answer on insulin and oral hypoglycaemic agents was verified in 100% and 99% respectively. The concordance was considerably higher than in a comparable Norwegian study performed 10 years earlier. Patient administered questionnaires may be a very reliable source of information for epidemiological purposes in a well defined chronic disease such as diabetes mellitus.\n \nThe role of fundoplication in addition to hiatal hernia repair has been controversial. The aim of this study was to compare quality of life related to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in patients who underwent intra-thoracic stomach repair with and without fundoplication. We proposed that the group without a fundoplication would have poorer quality of life due to continued symptoms. All patients undergoing foregut surgery at the Creighton University Esophageal Center are entered in a prospectively maintained database. The database was queried to identify patients who underwent surgery for a near complete (>75\u00a0% of stomach in chest) intra-thoracic stomach with gastric volvulus between 2004 and 2013. A questionnaire was derived from the Quality of Life in Reflux and Dyspepsia and Frequency Scale for Symptoms of GERD questionnaires to assess for symptoms related to reflux, and this questionnaire was administered by phone. A total of 150 patients underwent repair of ITS\u00a0during the study period. A total of 109 patients had ITS repair with fundoplication, while 41 had only ITS repair. Follow-up was available in 54\u00a0% of patients in the fundoplication group (median follow-up of 5.2\u00a0years) and in 49\u00a0% of patients in the non-fundoplication group (median follow-up of 4\u00a0years). Significantly, more patients woke up at night (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and found themselves coughing around mealtime (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) in the fundoplication group. Patients in the non-fundoplication group had significantly more daytime reflux (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). Despite these symptoms, only one patient in the fundoplication group and no patients in the non-fundoplication group admitted that these symptoms were severe enough to severely affect their quality of life. All other patients contacted felt satisfied, and >80\u00a0% rated their quality of life as either good or excellent.

A questionnaire on US education and bedside US use was pilot tested and given to EM residents. The primary outcomes included the number of US examinations performed, scope of bedside US applications, barriers to residents' US education, and US use in the emergency department.

Residents in programs with EUS fellowships reported performing more scans than those in programs without fellowships (P = .04). Significant differences were noted in most applications of bedside US between residency programs with and without fellowships (P < .05). There were also significant differences in the barriers to US education between residency programs with and without fellowships (P < .05).

We assessed whether the choice of either of these methods to obtain euglycaemia biases subsequent assessment of glucose metabolism and insulin action. We studied seven obese Type 2 diabetic patients twice Basal plasma glucose levels (mean +/- sd) were 5.5 +/- 0.5 and 10.7 +/- 2.9 mmol/l in the + ON and - ON studies, respectively, and were clamped at -5.5 mmol/l. Basal rates of glucose production (GP) were similar in the + ON and - ON studies, 83 +/- 13 vs. 85 +/- 14 mg m-2 min-1 (NS), whereas basal rates of glucose disappearance (Rd) were lower in the + ON than in the - ON study, 84 +/- 8 vs. 91 +/- 11 mg m-2 min-1 (P = 0.02).

Most children who do not undergo transplant are reported to have chronic liver disease and its complications. The aim of this single-center study was to identify children with normal laboratory indices and no clinical evidence of chronic liver disease 10 or more years after Kasai portoenterostomy (KP). A retrospective analysis of the medical notes of all children surgically treated at the authors' center between 1979 and 1991 was undertaken. Criteria for inclusion were absence of surgical complications, unremarkable clinical examination, and normal bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, albumin, international normalized prothrombin ratio, and platelet count. Of 244 children surgically treated during the observation period, the authors identified 28 (11%) adolescents (14 male) who fulfilled the entry criteria. Their median age was 13.4 years (range, 10.2-22.2 years). Twenty-six with type 3 EHBA had conventional KP, whereas 2 underwent modified operations. The corrective surgery was performed at a median age of 58 days (range, 20-99 days). Median time of complete clearance of jaundice from the date of KP was 75 days (range, 21-339 days). Twelve (43%) patients had history of cholangitis at a median age of 3.4 years. The liver histologic findings were suggestive of mild to moderate fibrosis in 54.2% and cirrhosis in 40.7% of the patients who underwent biopsy. No child had gastrointestinal bleeding during follow-up. Thirteen (46%) patients had an elective esophagogastroduodenoscopy, which was normal in all. Twenty-six (93%) patients were in mainstream education, whereas the remaining two (7%) attended special school because of reasons unrelated to liver disease. A sizable proportion of children with EHBA avoid significant chronic liver disease and its complications 10 years or more after conventional surgical correction and have an excellent quality of life. Their good outcome is not hampered by isolated episodes of ascending cholangitis. Whether or not the residual histologic damage will become symptomatic during their lifetime remains to be established.\n \nTo assess and compare the value of split-liver transplantation (SLT) and living-related liver transplantation (LRT). The concept of SLT results from the development of reduced-size transplantation. A further development of SLT, the in situ split technique, is derived from LRT, which itself marks the optimized outcome in terms of postoperative graft function and survival. The combination of SLT and LRT has abolished deaths on the waiting list, thus raising the question whether living donor liver transplantation is still necessary. Outcomes and postoperative liver function of 43 primary LRT patients were compared with those of 49 primary SLT patients (14 ex situ, 35 in situ) with known graft weight performed between April 1996 and December 2000. Survival rates were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. After a median follow-up of 35 months, actual patient survival rates were 82% in the SLT group and 88% in the LRT group. Actual graft survival rates were 76% and 81%, respectively. The incidence of primary nonfunction was 12% in the SLT group and 2.3% in the LRT group. Liver function parameters (prothrombin time, factor V, bilirubin clearance) and surgical complication rates did not differ significantly. In the SLT group, mean cold ischemic time was longer than in the LRT group. Serum values of alanine aminotransferase during the first postoperative week were significantly higher in the SLT group. In the LRT group, there were more grafts with signs of fatty degeneration than in the SLT group. The short- and long-term outcomes after LRT and SLT did not differ significantly. To avoid the risk for the donor in LRT, SLT represents the first-line therapy in pediatric liver transplantation in countries where cadaveric organs are available. LRT provides a solution for urgent cases in which a cadaveric graft cannot be found in time or if the choice of the optimal time point for transplantation is vital.\n"}]}]}}

The contribution of attitudes to racial and ethnic disparities in effective method use was assessed via mediation analysis, using a series of regression models. Blacks and Latinas were more likely than whites to believe that the government encourages contraceptive use to limit minority populations (odds ratio, 2.5 for each). Compared with white women, Latinas held more favorable attitudes toward pregnancy (2.5) and childbearing (coefficient, 0.3) and were more fatalistic about the timing of pregnancy (odds ratio, 2.3); blacks were more fatalistic about life in general (2.0). Only one attitude, skepticism that the government ensures contraceptive safety, was associated with contraceptive use (0.7), but this belief did not differ by race or ethnicity. Although blacks and Latinas used less effective methods than whites (0.3 and 0.4, respectively), attitudes did not explain disparities. Lower contraceptive knowledge partially explained Latinas' use of less effective methods. Providing basic information about effective methods might help to decrease ethnic disparities in use. Research should examine other variables that might account for these disparities, including health system characteristics and provider behavior.\n"}]}]}}

We studied 424 patients who underwent nephrectomy and adrenalectomy for unilateral, sporadic, pT3 or pT4 RCC between 1970 and 2000 at the Mayo Clinic. Cancer specific survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cancer specific survival for the 22 patients with pT3a or pT3b tumors that directly invaded the ipsilateral adrenal gland was significantly worse compared with that of patients with pT3a (p <0.001) or pT3b (p = 0.011) disease that did not invade the adrenal gland. There was no significant difference in the 5-year cancer specific survival between the patients with pT3a or pT3b tumors that directly invaded the ipsilateral adrenal gland and patients with pT4 tumors (cancer specific survival rates of 20% and 14%, respectively, p = 0.490).

The demographic, clinical and pathological data of adrenal involvement were reviewed in 247 patients with RCC. To evaluate adrenocortical function, 14 patients (adrenalectomy in eight, adrenal-sparing in six) had a rapid adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test before and 2 weeks after surgery. There was adrenal involvement with RCC in seven of the 247 (2.8%) patients (a solitary adrenal metastatic tumour in four and direct extension into the adrenal gland in three). All adrenal involvement was detectable on abdominal computed tomography before surgery, and these patients had a large primary renal tumour of > pT2 and/or distant metastasis. Plasma cortisol levels declined significantly more in response to the rapid ACTH stimulation test in those treated by adrenalectomy than in those with spared adrenal glands at 2 weeks after surgery (P < 0.05), while there was no significant difference between the groups before surgery. These results suggest that unconditional ipsilateral adrenalectomy with radical nephrectomy for RCC should be avoidable, and thus preserve the reserve of adrenocortical function, as preoperative imaging, especially thin-slice multidetector helical computed tomography, can detect adrenal involvement with RCC in most cases. Unilateral adrenalectomy might cause an irreversible impairment of the reserve of adrenocortical function.\n"}]}]}}

This study aimed to investigate the influence rural placement and rural background had on students' intentions to live and work in a rural or remote location after graduation. Between January 2005 and December 2006, 336 students participated in the placement program. Students were requested to complete a survey at the completion of their placement. A response rate of 239 was achieved (71%). The survey measured students' stated rural career intentions and rural background status according to location of primary and secondary school attendance. A demographic analysis of respondents was undertaken and results cross tabulated according to the rural, remote and metropolitan area (RRMA) classification system. Statistical analyses, including paired t-tests and a Wilcoxon signed rank test, were conducted to compare reported mean intention to practise rurally both prior to and after placement. The results from this survey show that rural placements in the undergraduate health science programs have a predominantly positive influence on students' intention to work in a rural community post-graduation. While these findings were significant for the disciplines of nursing, medicine and allied health, the results were not significant for pharmacy students. Students' average intention to practise rurally significantly increased after the placement for students from RRMA classifications 1 and 3-5. The value of rural placements as a method for increasing health science students' intentionality to take up rural practice as a positive and viable career option is considerable.\n \nThe burden of maternal mortality in sub-Saharan Africa is very high. In Ghana maternal mortality ratio was 380 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2013. Skilled birth attendance has been shown to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity, yet in 2010 only 68 percent of mothers in Ghana gave birth with the assistance of skilled birth attendants. In 2005, the Ghana Health Service piloted a strategy that involved using the integrated Community-based Health Planning and Services (CHPS) program and training Community Health Officers (CHOs) as midwives to address the gap in skilled attendance in rural Upper East Region (UER). The study assesses the feasibility of and extent to which the skilled delivery program has been implemented as an integrated component of the existing CHPS, and documents the benefits and challenges of the integrated program. We employed an intrinsic case study design with a qualitative methodology. We conducted 41 in-depth interviews with health professionals and community stakeholders. We used a purposive sampling technique to identify and interview our respondents. The CHO-midwives provide integrated services that include skilled delivery in CHPS zones. The midwives collaborate with District Assemblies, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and communities to offer skilled delivery services in rural communities. They refer pregnant women with complications to district hospitals and health centers for care, and there has been observed improvement in the referral system. Stakeholders reported community members' access to skilled attendants at birth, health education, antenatal attendance and postnatal care in rural communities. The CHO-midwives are provided with financial and non-financial incentives to motivate them for optimal work performance. The primary challenges that remain include inadequate numbers of CHO-midwives, insufficient transportation, and infrastructure weaknesses. Our study demonstrates that CHOs can successfully be trained as midwives and deployed to provide skilled delivery services at the doorsteps of rural households. The integration of the skilled delivery program with the CHPS program appears to be an effective model for improving access to skilled birth attendance in rural communities of the UER of Ghana.\n"}]}]}}

These incidents often result in Hospital Multiple Casualty Incidents (HMCI), which are very challenging to hospital teams. 15 years ago the Emergency and Disaster Medicine Division in the Israeli Ministry of Health defined a key of 20 percent of each hospital's bed capacity as its readiness for multiple casualties. Half of those casualties are expected to require immediate medical treatment. This study was performed to evaluate the efficacy of the current readiness guidelines based on the epidemiology of encountered HMCIs. A retrospective study of HMCIs was recorded in the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) home front command and the Israeli National Trauma Registry (ITR) between November 2000 and June 2003. An HMCI is defined by the Emergency and Disaster Medicine Division in the Israeli Ministry of Health as >or=10 casualties or >or=4 suffering from injuries with an ISS>or=16 arriving to a single hospital. The study includes a total of 32 attacks, resulting in 62 HMCIs and 1292 casualties. The mean number of arriving casualties to a single hospital was 20.8+/-13.3 (range 4-56, median 16.5). In 95% of the HMCIs the casualty load was <or=52. Based on severity scores and ED discharges 1022 (79.2%) casualties did not necessitate immediate medical treatment. Hospital preparedness can be better defined by a fixed number of casualties rather than a percentile of its bed capacity. Only 20% of the arriving casualties will require immediate medical treatment. Implementation of this concept may improve the utilisation of national emergency health resources both in the preparation phase and on real time.\n \nThe Israeli Ministry of Health reported an increased rate of twin pregnancies among all cases locally diagnosed as having open neural tube defects.

They were further subdivided according to mode of conception (spontaneous, in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF-ICSI) pregnancies). Three-hundred and eighty consecutive pregnancies, of which 340 (89%) were singletons, participated in our study. Anencephaly was diagnosed in 26 cases Our case series data suggest a comparatively higher rate of anencephaly in IVF-ICSI pregnancy secondary to twinning and not because of the assisted reproductive technology.

Socioeconomic status, race, and mental health status were hypothesized to be related to SHSe and household smoking bans. Data were collected as part of The Baby's Breath Project, a hospital-based SHSe intervention trial targeting parents with a high-risk infant in the NICU who reported a smoker in the household (N = 99). Measures of sociodemographics, smoking, home and car smoking bans, and depression were collected. Overall, 26% of all families with a high-risk infant in the NICU reported a household smoker. Almost half of the families with a smoker reported an annual income of less than $25,000. 46.2% of families reported having a total smoking ban in place in both their homes and cars. Only 27.8% families earning less than $25,000 reported having a total smoking ban in place relative to almost 60% of families earning more (p < .01). African American and Caucasian families were less likely to have a smoking ban compared with Hispanics (p < .05). Mothers who reported no smoking ban were more depressed than those who had a household smoking ban (p < .02). The most disadvantaged families were least likely to have protective health behaviors in place to reduce SHSe and, consequently, are most at-risk for tobacco exposure and subsequent tobacco-related health disparities. Innovative SHSe interventions for this vulnerable population are sorely needed.\n \nPremature infants are at increased risk for rehospitalization after discharge from the hospital. Racial disparities are known to exist in pediatric health care. To evaluate whether racial disparities exist in the proportion of extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants rehospitalized prior to 18 months corrected age and the causes of rehospitalization. The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neonatal Research Network database was used to identify all ELBW infants (n=2446) who were born between November 1, 1998 and May 31, 2000 at the 14 participating centers and discharged alive (n=1591). Infants were seen at 18-22 months corrected age for followup. Data related to maternal variables, race, socioeconomic status, medical morbidities, insurance, and rehospitalizations were recorded from the medical record and parent interview. Logistic regression analyses were used to examine the relationship of race/ethnicity and rehospitalization while controlling for gestational age, gender, center, maternal education, family income, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), necrotizing enterocolitis, ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) prophylaxis, and insurance type. In all, 1405 (88%) infants were evaluated at followup. The racial distribution of infants admitted, discharged, seen at followup, and rehospitalized were similar. Rehospitalization occurred at least once in 49% of the infants. In the logistic regression analyses, race was not a significant predictor for rehospitalization. The odds of rehospitalization were related to low family income, type of insurance, BPD, VP shunt, RSV prophylaxis, and center. Race was not a predominant variable in the risk of rehospitalization in this cohort of ELBW infants. Medical morbidities and low family income appear to be the major risk factors for rehospitalization.\n"}]}]}}

In a randomized, double-blind multicenter trial, 322 patients with predominantly New York Heart Association class II or III congestive heart failure and left ventricular ejection fractions of 35% or less, who were stabilized on a diuretic, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, and digoxin, were treated with 100 mg flosequinan once daily, 75 mg flosequinan twice daily, or matching placebo. Efficacy was evaluated with serial measurements of treadmill exercise time, responses to the Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire (LWHF), and clinical assessments during a baseline phase and a 16-week treatment period. After 16 weeks, 100 mg flosequinan once daily produced a significant increment in median exercise time (64 seconds at 16 weeks) compared with placebo (5 seconds), whereas the higher-dose flosequinan group did not show a statistically significant increase. Flosequinan (100 mg once daily) also improved the overall LWHF score significantly compared with placebo; both active therapies decreased the physical component, but 75 mg flosequinan twice daily was associated with a trend toward worsening of the emotional component. Most clinical assessments tended to improve on active therapy. These results indicate that additional symptomatic benefit can be attained by adding flosequinan to a therapeutic regimen already including a converting enzyme inhibitor. Because in the future most patients will fall into this category, flosequinan is a potential adjunctive agent in the management of severe congestive heart failure.

The records of 465 patients with an established diagnosis of age related macular degeneration who had attended a specialist macular clinic between 1990 and 1998 were scrutinised. A full clinical examination and standardised refraction had been carried out in 189 of these cases on a minimum of two occasions. Cases were looked for where an improvement of one or more lines of either distance or near acuity was recorded in the eye unaffected by macular disease. In each one of these cases the improvement in visual acuity could not be attributed to treatment of other existing pathology. 12 such cases were detected. In nine of these the eye showing improvement of acuity had a history of amblyopia. The mean improvement in distance and near acuity in amblyopic eyes by 12 months was 3.3 and 1.9 lines logMAR respectively. The improvement in acuity generally occurred between 1 and 12 months from baseline and remained stable over the period of follow up. Older people with a history of amblyopia who develop visual loss in the previously normal eye can experience recovery of visual function in the amblyopic eye over a period of time. This recovery in visual function occurs in the wake of visual loss in the fellow eye and the improvement appears to be sustained.\n \nAssessment of visual acuity depends on the optotypes used for measurement. The ability to recognize different optotypes differs even if their critical details appear under the same visual angle. Since optotypes are evaluated on individuals with good visual acuity and without eye disorders, differences in the lower visual acuity range cannot be excluded. In this study, visual acuity measured with the Snellen E was compared to the Landolt C acuity. 100 patients (age 8 - 90 years, median 60.5 years) with various eye disorders, among them 39 with amblyopia due to strabismus, and 13 healthy volunteers were tested. Charts with the Snellen E and the Landolt C (Precision Vision) which mimic the ETDRS charts were used to assess visual acuity. Three out of 5 optotypes per line had to be correctly identified, while wrong answers were monitored. In the group of patients, the eyes with the lower visual acuity, and the right eyes of the healthy subjects, were evaluated. Differences between Landolt C acuity (LR) and Snellen E acuity (SE) were small. The mean decimal values for LR and SE were 0.25 and 0.29 in the entire group and 0.14 and 0.16 for the eyes with strabismus amblyopia. The mean difference between LR and SE was 0.55 lines in the entire group and 0.55 lines for the eyes with strabismus amblyopia, with higher values of SE in both groups. The results of the other groups were similar with only small differences between LR and SE. Using the charts described, there was only a slight overestimation of visual acuity by the Snellen E compared to the Landolt C, even in strabismus amblyopia. Small differences in the lower visual acuity range have to be considered.\n"}]}]}}

Specifically, we investigated the impact of DM for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients receiving first-line platinum-based doublets chemotherapy. We retrospectively reviewed 442 patients with advanced NSCLC. DM and other potential prognostic variables were chosen for analysis in this study. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify prognostic factors associated with survival. The results of univariate analysis for OS were identified as having prognostic significance In conclusion, DM at the time of diagnosis was associated with the negative prognostic importance for PFS and OS in the advanced stage patients who were receiving first-line platinum-based doublets chemotherapy. In addition poor performance status and advanced stage were identified as negative prognostic factors.\n"}]}]}}

We studied the frequencies of TNF-\u03b1-308 gene polymorphism in 90 male subjects (60 subjects with COPD and 30 healthy smokers) in a Caucasian population. There was no significant difference in the frequency of G/G and G/A gene polymorphisms in the COPD group compared with control subjects (p>0.05). We compared COPD patients as G/A gene polymorphism and G/G gene polymorphism; the PFTs and BMI before and after one year were not statistically significant (p>0.05). Also, the exacerbation and hospitalization data of COPD patients were not significant between these groups. In conclusion, there was no difference between smoking-related COPD and the control group according to TNF \u03b1-308 gene polymorphism in a Caucasian population. In addition, it was shown that important determinants of prognosis of COPD such as FEV1, BMI, COPD exacerbation and hospitalization were not associated with TNF-\u03b1-308 gene polymorphism.\n \nCurrent guidelines recommend spirometry to confirm a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). To investigate whether a self-reported diagnosis of COPD is associated with prior spirometry and whether a correct diagnosis of COPD is more likely when spirometry was performed. We used data from the population-based Austrian Burden of Obstructive Lung Disease (BOLD) study. Participants were aged >40 years and completed post-bronchodilator spirometry. Reported COPD diagnosis and reported prior lung function test were based on questionnaire. Persistent airflow limitation was defined as post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second/forced vital capacity ratio <0.7, corresponding with COPD Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) grade I+, and GOLD grade II+ was also investigated. A correct diagnosis of COPD was defined as a reported physician's diagnosis of COPD and the presence of persistent airflow limitation. 68 (5.4%) of 1,258 participants reported a prior physician's diagnosis of COPD. Of these, only 17 (25.0%) reported a lung function test within the past 12 months and 46 (67.6%) at any time in the past. The likelihood for a correct COPD GOLD grade I+ diagnosis was similar among subjects reporting a lung function test during the last 12 months (likelihood ratio 2.07, 95% CI 0.89 to 5.50) and those not reporting a lung function during the last 12 months (likelihood ratio 2.78, 95% CI 1.58 to 4.87). Similar likelihood ratios were seen when GOLD grade II+ was investigated and when lung function was reported at any time in the past. One-third of subjects with a reported diagnosis of COPD never had a lung function test. When spirometry was reported, this did not increase the likelihood of a correct COPD diagnosis.\n"}]}]}}

In order to compare adipocytes resulting from the differentiation of preadipocytes with those of purified adipose tissue, we implanted them in 10 nude mice. The preadipocytes were implanted using a collagen scaffold as intermediary and the adipose tissue following the plastic surgery protocol described by SR Coleman. After 8 weeks, tissue fragments were explanted and analysed after staining with HPS, Oil Red O and labelling with human anti-vimentin antibodies. The scaffold seeded with preadipocytes had the macroscopic appearance of adipose tissue with peripheral neovascularisation. The preadipocytes had been transformed into mature adipocytes. Purified adipose tissue also presented peripheral neovascularisation. Numerous mature adipocytes were found. There was an abundant murine extracellular matrix since anti-vimentin labelling was negative.

The mortality rate, morbidity criteria, and risk factors for grave prognosis were compared between a group of 25 patients who received HBO as part of their treatment protocol and a group of the remaining 12 patients treated by surgical excision and antibiotics alone. The two groups were found to be similar with regard to age, gender, the incidence of individual risk factors for ominous prognosis, and the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score for disease's severity on presentation.

All rats were sacrificed on postoperative day 7, and liver injury was assessed by measuring alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels. Protein synthetic ability was determined based albumin levels and liver regeneration by the mitotic index (MI). The AST and ALT values of group II rats were significantly higher than those of group I, but not those of group III. Rats treated with doxorubicin and HBO (groups II and III) showed slightly but not significant differences in albumin levels than those subjected to only RPVL or sham-operated. The MI was significantly increased in groups I, II, and III, with the MI of group III rats significantly higher than those of group I rats.

First, American Board of Surgery In-Training Examination (ABSITE) scores and the passing rate of the ABS certifying examination were recorded for the years 2001, 2002, 2005, and 2006. Second, the changes in the curriculum of surgical education were documented as perceived by program coordinators and directors. In all, 85% (17/20) of surgical programs in New England responded to the survey. The programs began to implement the 80-hour workweek from 2002 to 2004. An equal distribution of community (n = 8) and university programs (n = 9) was sampled. Prior to the initiation of the 80-hour workweek, residency programs emphasized weekly didactic sessions given by attending physicians (88%), mock orals (88%), and conventional journal club (76%). After the 80-hour workweek was implemented, the education curriculum most often consisted of didactic sessions by attending (100%), mock orals (88%), and simulation laboratories (75%).

Only 25% of programs felt that surgical education was improved after the implementation of the 80-hour workweek, whereas 31% felt education was worse. Overall, 44% of respondents believed that there was no difference in surgical education. Despite the positive effects the 80-hour workweek has had on resident quality of life and patient care, it does not seem that either significant improvements or detrimental effects have occurred on surgical education within residency programs in New England.\n \nThis study characterizes the progress in and effectiveness of learning geriatric medicine during longitudinal and block phases of a family practice residency program. A structured second-year geriatric block rotation was added to a residency longitudinal curriculum. To assess learning, a Geriatric Assessment Instrument (GAI) consisting of 50 multiple choice questions was administered to three classes offamily practice residents (n=33)five times during training Scores on the GAI improved significantly before and after the rotation but not during any other interval of training during the residency. In-training exam scores improved significantlyfor the classes taught with the block rotation over those without it. Most of the geriatric learning occurred during the 1-month geriatric block rotation during the residency. In-training geriatric exam scores improved significantly with a geriatric block rotation. The use of structured repetitive learning experiences during the rotation to emphasize the common clinical issues and the skewed exposure to geriatric patients in the random nature of residency clinic and inpatient encounters accountfor this result.\n"}]}]}}

The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test was used for statistically significant results and indicated a difference in performance over deciles. The standardized mortality ratio was used to estimate the overall model performance. The ability of both scores to predict hospital mortality was poor in the liver and renal transplant groups and average in the lung transplant group (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve = 0.696 for Simplified Acute Physiology Score 3 and 0.670 for Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II).

All episodes of PPR not associated with obvious clinical change (as observed by the technologist or reported by the patient) were analyzed for this study. The average time interval between two successive motor responses across a PPR (test time) was compared to the average time interval between two successive motor responses during IPS not associated with PPR (control time) using Wilcoxon signed ranks test. 21 children who had PPR successfully completed the MRT. The difference between the mean durations was 0.894 s (p=0.002). More than 50% increase compared to the control time was considered a delay in MRT during PPR. 10 children showed slowing of MRT during PPR. By definition, acute behavioral change during generalized epileptiform discharges represent provoked seizures.

Patients were classified according to whether they came to the hospital during the first 72 hours after the haemorrhage (Group 1) or later (Group 2). Thirty three patients were included in Group 1 and sixteen patients in Group 2. Thirteen patients (26.5%) had sonographic vasospasm. In eight of these patients (61 %), the vasospasm was symptomatic.

The current study was performed to determine the knowledge, attitudes, and confidence of PCPs in the safety net at delivering care to survivors of breast cancer. A modified version of the National Cancer Institute's Survey of Physician Attitudes Regarding Care of Cancer Survivors was given to providers at 2 county hospitals and 5 associated clinics (59 providers). Focus groups were held to understand barriers to survivorship care. Although the majority of providers believed PCPs have the skills necessary to provide cancer-related follow-up, the vast majority were not comfortable providing these services themselves. Providers were adherent to American Society of Clinical Oncology recommendations for mammography (98%) and physical examination (87%); less than one-third were guideline-concordant for laboratory testing and only 6 providers (10%) met all recommendations. PCPs universally requested additional training on clinical guidelines and the provision of written survivorship care plans before transfer. Concerns voiced in qualitative sessions included unfamiliarity with the management of endocrine therapy and confusion regarding who would be responsible for certain aspects of care.

Indicators used to assess involvement with managed care included global measures of managed care participation, risk contracting, exposure to financial incentives, and impact of care management tools. Changes in these measures over the 2 study periods are reported. Analyses were conducted for all physicians, as well as for primary care physicians (PCPs) and specialists separately. The percentage of practice revenue derived from managed care increased only modestly over the study period (from 42% to 45%). Mean numbers of managed care contracts per physician increased minimally (from 12 to 13). Trends in acceptance of capitation and exposure to financial incentives remained stable over the study period. Among PCPs, employment in staff/group health maintenance organizations declined slightly, whereas gatekeeping function increased modestly. Among care management tools, only treatment guidelines had a significantly increased impact on medical practice, primarily among PCPs (from 46% to 52%; P < .001). Many aspects of managed care leveled off between 1996 and 1999 in ways not accurately reflected by plan enrollment patterns. This \"flattening of the curve\" trend appears to hold generally across multiple measures. A stalling of the managed care \"revolution,\" if it is sustained, may portend future escalation in healthcare costs.\n"}]}]}}

Neither the duration of primary sclerosing cholangitis (range 7-23 years) nor the presence of ulcerative colitis (two of three patients) distinguished those patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis plus hepatocellular carcinoma from those with primary sclerosing cholangitis alone. None of the three patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis plus hepatocellular carcinoma had evidence for hepatitis B or C, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, or hemochromatosis. None of the tumors was of the fibrolamellar variety of hepatocellular carcinoma. The prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation is 2%. These data suggest that patients with advanced cirrhotic-stage primary sclerosing cholangitis are at increased risk for developing hepatocellular carcinoma and should be screened for hepatocellular carcinoma as well as for cholangiocarcinoma prior to orthotopic liver transplantation.\n \nThe purpose of this study is to examine whether or not well differentiated (w-d) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is indeed clinically early cancer. Seventy six patients with solitary small HCCs up to 3 cm in diameter, who underwent hepatectomy, were observed for at least 2 years for possible recurrence. These patients were divided into two groups The histological analysis revealed that w-d HCCs had lower incidences of fibrous capsule formation (P<0.01), when compared to l-d HCCs. There were no significant differences in the incidence of intrahepatic metastasis, or portal vein invasion. In a resected specimen of w-d HCC, barium sulfate and gelatin were injected into portal vein and a transparent specimen was made. The transparent specimen showed that the portal vein in the tumor seemed to be intact. Microscopically, cancer cell infiltration into the fibrous frame of the portal tract was present. There were no significant differences in the disease free survival between the two groups. An analysis of tumor volume doubling time in recurrent foci suggested that minute cancerous foci had been present at the time of operation. W-d HCCs were clinically demonstrated not to be early cancer, because there was no significant difference in disease free survival between the patients with w-d and l-d HCCs.\n"}]}]}}

Retrospective cohort study. Three northern California family planning clinics. All women with abnormal Pap smear results referred for initial colposcopy and a random sample of those referred for repeated Pap smear. Medical records were located and reviewed for 90 of 107 women referred for colposcopy and 153 of 225 women referred for repeated Pap smears. Routine clinic protocols for follow-up--telephone call, letter, or certified letter--were applied without regard to the type of abnormality seen on a Pap smear or recommended examination. Documented adherence to follow-up within 8 months of an abnormal result. Attempts to contact the patients for follow-up, adherence to follow-up recommendations, and patient characteristics were abstracted from medical records. The probability of adherence to follow-up vs the number of follow-up attempts was modeled with survival analysis. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine multivariate relationships related to adherence. The rate of overall adherence to follow-up recommendations was 56.0% (136/243). Adherence to a second colposcopy was not significantly different from that to a repeated Pap smear (odds ratio, 1.40; 95% confidence interval, 0.80-2.46). The use of as many as 3 patient reminders substantially improved adherence to follow-up. Women without insurance and women attending 1 of the 3 clinics were less likely to adhere to any follow-up recommendation (hazard ratio for no insurance, 0.43 [95% confidence interval, 0.20-0.93], and for clinic, 0.35 [95% confidence interval, 0.15-0.73]). Adherence to follow-up was low in this family planning clinic population, no matter what type of follow-up was advised. Adherence was improved by the use of up to 3 reminders. Allocating resources to effective methods for improving adherence to follow-up of abnormal results may be more important than which follow-up procedure is recommended.\n \nThe 2001 American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology Consensus Guidelines recommend that women who have Papanicolaou (Pap) smears diagnosed as atypical squamous cells (ASC), cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) (ASC-H) should be referred for immediate colposcopic examination. The objective of this pilot study was to evaluate whether reflex human papillomavirus (HPV)-DNA testing performed on smears diagnosed as ASC-H may obviate the need for immediate colposcopic examination. All ThinPrep Pap smears that were diagnosed as ASC-H or atypical squamous metaplastic cells (ASMT) between 2001-2003 and that had HPV-DNA testing and subsequent histologic and/or cytologic follow-up were evaluated. Those smears that were diagnosed as ASMT were reviewed and reclassified under the 2001 Bethesda System as either ASC of undetermined significance (ASCUS) or ASC-H. Smears that were diagnosed as ASCUS were excluded from the study. The study included of 48 smears that were diagnosed as ASC-H. All patients with biopsy-proven HSIL had positive high-risk (HR)-HPV results (100% negative predictive value). Approximately 80% of patients with ASC-H who had biopsy-proven, low-grade intraepithelial lesion on follow-up had positive HR-HPV results. Among the patients who had ASC-H with negative follow-up, 50% had positive HR-HPV results, and 50% had negative HR-HPV results. Among patients with ASC-H, a negative HR-HPV result was found to be an excellent predictor of the absence of HSIL. The results of this pilot study suggested that HPV-DNA testing may serve as a means to better select which patients with ASC-H on Pap smear should undergo colposcopic examination. This approach potentially may reduce medical costs and eliminate the need for routine colposcopic examination among patients with ASC-H Pap smears.\n"}]}]}}

The traditional cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide-based method was modified for DNA isolation from pollen. Taxon-specific DNA sequences were identified via bioinformatics or literature searches and were PCR amplified from the matching allergenic taxa; based on the sequences of PCR products, complementary or degenerate TaqMan probes were developed. The accuracy of the quantitative real-time PCR assay was tested on 3 plant species. The setup of a modified DNA extraction protocol allowed us to achieve good-quality pollen DNA. Taxon-specific nuclear gene fragments were identified and sequenced. Designed primer pairs and probes identified selected pollen taxa, mostly at the required classification level. Pollen was properly identified even when collected on routine aerobiological tape. Preliminary quantification assays on pollen grains were successfully performed on test species and in mixes. The real-time PCR approach revealed promising results in pollen identification and quantification, even when analyzing pollen mixes. Future perspectives could concern the development of multiplex real-time PCR for the simultaneous detection of different taxa in the same reaction tube and the application of high-throughput molecular methods.\n \nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the relative frequencies of sensitisation to four common inhalant allergens in two atopic populations suffering from asthma and/or rhinitis. One had been studied in the period of 1975 till 1979, and a second population was evaluated between 1992 and 1995. At both time periods patients with inhalant allergy and visiting our outpatient clinic were included. Quantification of IgE to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, birch, timothy grass, and mugwort was performed via the Phadebas RAST technique (Pharmacia, Brussels, Belgium). In patients suffering from respiratory allergy the frequency of birch pollen sensitisation significantly increased from 13% in the period 1975-1979 to 34% in the period 1992-1995. In contrast, the frequency of house dust mite, timothy grass pollen, and mugwort pollen sensitisation remained almost unchanged. The increase was not associated with an increase in the birch pollen count. Birch pollen hypersensitivity has almost tripled among atopic subjects during the last 2 decades. The exact mechanisms for this increase remain to be evaluated.\n"}]}]}}

Histologic and ultrastructural studies of normal corneas showed significant differences in the direction of collagen fibrils and/or the degree of lamellar interweaving in Bowman's layer, the anterior third of the corneal stroma, the posterior two-thirds of the corneal stroma, and Descemet's membrane. Cohesive tensile strength testing directly supported these morphologic findings as the stronger, more rigid regions of the cornea were located anteriorly and peripherally. This suggests that PRK and ASA, and secondarily SBK, should be biomechanically safer than conventional LASIK with regard to risk for causing keratectasia after surgery. Because adult human corneal stromal wounds heal slowly and incompletely, all excimer laser keratorefractive surgical techniques still have some distinct disadvantages due to inadequate reparative wound healing. Despite reducing some of the risk for corneal haze compared to conventional PRK, ASA cases still can develop corneal haze or breakthrough haze from the hypercellular fibrotic stromal scarring. In contrast, similar to conventional LASIK, SBK still has the short- and long-term potential for interface wound complications from the hypocellular primitive stromal scar. Ophthalmic pathology and basic science research show that SBK and ASA are improvements in excimer laser keratorefractive surgery compared to conventional LASIK or PRK, particularly with regard to maintaining corneal biomechanics and perhaps moderately reducing the risk of corneal haze. However, most of the disadvantages caused by wound healing issues remain.\n \nMicrocirculation and oxygen supply in cervical skin were measured with an optical, noninvasive method in patients with or without radiotherapy before neck dissection. The course of wound healing was monitored after the surgical procedure to identify predictive factors for postoperative wound healing disorders. Tissue spectrophotometry and laser Doppler flowmetry were used to determine capillary oxygen saturation, hemoglobin concentration, blood flow, and blood velocity at 2-mm and 8-mm depths in the cervical skin of 91 patients before neck dissection in a maxillofacial unit of a university hospital in Munich, Germany. Parameters were evaluated for differences between patients with irradiation (24) and without (67) and patients with wound healing disorders (25) and without (66) (univariate or multivariate statistical analyses). Velocity at 2 mm was lower in irradiated skin (P = .016). Flow at 2 mm was higher in patients with wound healing disorders (P = .018). High flow values could help to identify patients at risk for cervical wound healing disorders.\n"}]}]}}

The study took place at a quaternary referral center that specializes in pelvic exenteration. Patients referred for pelvic exenteration from October 1994 to November 2012 were reviewed. Patients who did and did not receive radiotherapy as part of their primary rectal cancer treatment were compared. The main outcomes of interest were resection margins, overall survival, disease-free survival, and surgical morbidities. There were 108 patients, of which 87 were eligible for analysis. Patients who received radiotherapy for their primary rectal cancer (n = 41) required more radical exenterations (68% vs 44%; p = 0.020), had lower rates of clear resection margins (63% vs 87%; p = 0.010), had increased rates of surgical complications per patient (p = 0.014), and had a lower disease-free survival (p = 0.022). Overall survival and disease-free survival in patients with clear margins were also lower in the primary irradiated patients (p = 0.049 and p < 0.0001). This difference in survival persisted in multivariate analysis that corrected for T and N stages of the primary tumor. This study is limited by its retrospective nature and heterogeneous radiotherapy regimes among radiotherapy patients. Patients who previously received radiotherapy for primary rectal cancer treatment have worse oncologic outcomes than those who had not received radiotherapy after pelvic exenteration for locally recurrent rectal cancer.\n \nThe aim of this study was to examine the incidence of coexisting colorectal cancer in ulcerative colitis in a population of patients undergoing ileal pouch anal anastomosis. The frequency of rectal cancer in this population, surgical intervention, general outcomes and cancer recurrence are described. Data on 1850 patients undergoing restorative proctocolectomy from 1983 to 2001 were reviewed. Information was gathered from data in the department's pelvic pouch database, as well as pathology and surgical reports. Follow-up questionnaires routinely sent to patients as part of the database were included in the analysis to determine current functional status. Mean follow-up period was 7.5 years after surgery. Seventy patients had coexisting colorectal cancer at time of IPAA. 7 (10%) of cancers were incidental. Pre-operative duration of disease was 18.6 years. Twenty-six of the cancers were rectal cancers. The most common form of anastomosis in the rectal cancers was mucosectomy, especially in pre-operatively known rectal cancer or low lying dysplasia. Preferred surgical technique for rectal cancer in mucosal ulcerative colitis (UC) included high ligation of mesenteric vessels with radical colectomy and taped occlusion of the rectum with irrigation of the rectal stump with Turnbull solution prior to mucosectomy. Patients with Stage 3 cancers received postoperative chemotherapy. Post-operative radiation therapy was not commonly recommended. Five of 70 patients were deceased from metastatic colon cancer; 55 patients were confirmed alive with good to excellent pouch function with a follow-up range of 1-17 years. Restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis is a successful surgical approach for patients with coexisting colorectal cancer in UC. When the appropriate surgical technique is used in patients with colon or rectal cancer, along with adjuvant chemotherapy when appropriate, prognosis and function is very good.\n"}]}]}}

A total of 360 core needle biopsies was obtained from 169 breast lesions in 146 patients. Additional open breast biopsy was performed in 111 women (127/169 breast lesions); the remaining 42 lesions were followed up for at least 24 months. 3D ultrasound visualization of the needle in the postfiring position was used to classify the biopsy as central, marginal or outside the lesion. Based on this classification it was decided whether another sample had to be obtained. A median of two core samples per lesion provided for all the lesions a sensitivity for malignancy of 96.9%, specificity of 100%, false-positive rate of 0% and false-negative rate of 3.1%, and for the excised lesions a sensitivity of 96.5%, specificity of 100%, false-positive rate of 0%, false-negative rate of 3.5% and an underestimation rate of 3.4%. 3D ultrasound validation of the postfiring needle position is an efficient adjunct to ultrasound-guided LCNB.

Retrospective study. University hospital. Fifty patients underwent MDCT the evening before surgery. RT 3D TEE was performed intraoperatively before valve deployment. The dataset from both of these examinations was digitally stored and evaluated. MDCT was performed in nonanesthetized patients; however, in the RT 3D TEE group, general anesthesia was established. The distances from the right coronary artery and the left coronary artery ostium were measured retrospectively. Bland-Altman Plots and linear regression analysis showed excellent correlation between the 2 methodologies; intraobserver and interobserver variance were calculated using analysis of variance. Krippendorff's \u03b1 indicated excellent agreement between the 2 observers (0.96 and 0.98) as well as between RT 3D TEE and MDCT (0.97 and 0.98). The observations showed that RT 3D TEE reliably can measure the coronary ostium distance from the aortic annulus.

Multicenter retrospective cohort study of patients with recurrent vulvar cancer who presented with groin and/or pelvic lymph node metastases between 2000 and 2014 at 3 tertiary referral hospitals. Our primary outcome was to assess survival after groin recurrence of vulvar cancer and the influence of multimodal treatment. All analyses were done using Stata 12 (Stata Corporation, College Station, Tex). Hazard ratios (HRs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals were calculated using a Cox proportional hazards model. We identified 30 patients with a median time from diagnosis to groin recurrence of 10 months. The median follow-up of patients who were alive at the time of analysis was 22 months (range, 9-123 months). A Kaplan-Meier estimate showed an overall survival rate of 50% after 7 years. Patients with multimodal groin relapse treatment performed better than those with single-mode treatment (HR, 0.25; P = 0.037). Lymph node metastases at diagnosis were also associated with lower survival (HR, 6.11; P = 0.020). We observed a trend toward lower survival with a tumor size greater than T1 (HR, 2.55; P = 0.111). The time from diagnosis to groin recurrence had no influence on survival (HR, 0.99; P = 0.561).

Retrospective study of SLM and CRC resections carried out during 01/2000 - 12/2006 by SM or GM, using a combined or delayed strategy. Morphologic characteristics and type of CRC and SLM resection were similar for the GM (n = 45) or SM (n = 66) groups. In patients with delayed liver resection (62 SM, 17 GM), chemotherapy prior to liver surgery was used in 92% and 38% of SM and GM patients (P < 0.0001) and the median delay between procedures was 212 and 182 days, respectively (P = 0.04). First step of liver resection was more often performed during colorectal surgery in the GM group (62 vs. 6% for SM, P < 0.0001) and the mean number of procedures (CRC+SLM) was lower (1.6 vs. 2.3, P = 0.003). Three-month mortality was 3% for GM and 0% for SM (n.s.). Overall survival rates were 67% and 51% for SM and GM at 3 years (n.s.), and 35 and 31% at 5 years (n.s.). Disease-free survival to 5 years was higher in SM patients (14% vs. 11%, P = 0.009). GM of CRC and SLM was associated with fewer procedures but did not influence overall survival. SM was associated with a longer delay and increased use of chemotherapy between procedures, suggesting that more rigorous selection of SM patients for surgery may explain the higher disease-free survival after SLM resection.\n"}]}]}}

Furthermore, frequencies of eye tracking during the 300 msec stimulus were significantly correlated with speed discrimination in control subjects (p = .01) but not in patients, suggesting that eye-tracking initiation may benefit control subjects but not patients. The frequency of eye tracking during speed discrimination was not significantly related to regular eye-tracking performance. Speed discrimination, per se, is not impaired in schizophrenia patients. The observed abnormality appears to be a consequence of impairment in generating or integrating the feedback information from eye movements. This study introduces a novel approach to motion perception studies and highlights the importance of concurrently measuring eye movements to understand interactions between these two systems; the results argue for a conceptual revision regarding motion perception abnormality in schizophrenia.\n \nEpisodic memory is significantly impaired in people with schizophrenia. The precise cause of this impairment has yet to be determined, as the formation of episodic memories is dependent on other processes, some of which also show impairment in schizophrenia. One such process is closure, that is, the filling-in of missing information. Failure to close adequately incomplete stimuli may cause people with schizophrenia to store inadequate or piecemeal representations in memory. Forty people with schizophrenia and 21 healthy comparison subjects participated in the study. The experiment was divided into six blocks, each of which involved both an encoding and a recognition phase. During the encoding phase, 20 figures were presented sequentially and participants had to determine whether each was symmetric or asymmetric. These figures were either complete or fragmented at three different levels. In subsequent recognition phase, 40 abstract figures (20 new and 20 old) were presented. All figures were complete in this phase. Memory performance of both groups was affected similarly by fragmentation, with an additional increase in performance afforded by a slight fragmentation for participants with schizophrenia. Slight fragmentation may have induced a perceptual difficulty that was mild enough to increase visual processing without compromising it. Closure was thus not involved in the episodic memory deficit of people with schizophrenia.\n"}]}]}}

We present results of per-oral transgastric splenectomy in a porcine model. The goal of this study was to determine the technical feasibility of per-oral transgastric splenectomy using a flexible endoscope. We performed acute experiments on 50-kg pigs. All animals were fed liquids for 3 days prior to procedure. The procedures were performed under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation. The flexible endoscope was passed per orally into the stomach and puncture of the gastric wall was performed with a needle knife. The puncture was extended to create a 1.5-cm incision using a pull-type sphincterotome, and a double-channel endoscope was advanced into the peritoneal cavity. The peritoneal cavity was insufflated with air through the endoscope. The spleen was visualized. The splenic vessels were ligated with endoscopic loops and clips, and then mesentery was dissected using electrocautery. Endoscopic splenectomy was performed on six pigs. There were no complications during gastric incision and entrance into the peritoneal cavity. Visualization of the spleen and other intraperitoneal organs was very good. Ligation of the splenic vessels and mobilization of the spleen were achieved using commercially available devices and endoscopic accessories. Transgastric endoscopic splenectomy in a porcine model appears technically feasible. Additional long-term survival experiments are planned.\n \nThe British Committee for Standards in Haematology currently recommends concomitant splenectomy in children with mild hereditary spherocytosis (HS) undergoing cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstones. However, splenectomy is associated with a risk of life-threatening infection, particularly in young children. The aim of this study was to audit the outcome of the practice of uncoupling splenectomy and cholecystectomy in such patients. Children referred with symptomatic gallstones complicating HS between April 1999 and April 2009 were prospectively identified and reviewed retrospectively. During this period, the policy was to undertake concomitant splenectomy only if indicated for haematological reasons and not simply because of planned cholecystectomy. A total of 16 patients (mean age 10.4, range 3.7 to 16 years, 11 women) with HS and symptomatic gallstones underwent cholecystectomy. Three patients subsequently required a splenectomy for haematological reasons 0.8-2.5 years after cholecystectomy; all three splenectomies were performed laparoscopically. There were no postoperative complications in the 16 patients; postoperative hospital stay was 1-3 days after either cholecystectomy or splenectomy. The 13 children with a retained spleen remain under regular review by a haematologist (median follow-up 4.6, range 0.5 to 10.6 years) and are well and transfusion independent. The advice to perform a concomitant splenectomy in children with mild HS undergoing cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstones needs revisiting. In the era of minimal access surgery, the need for splenectomy in such children should be judged on its own merits.\n"}]}]}}

In this context, medicinal plants may be a therapeutic option. To identify and describe the popular and clinical uses of medicinal plants for FSD treatment in climacteric women. We highlighted the majority of the plants commonly involved with the female reproductive system including This study is a narrative review of studies of plants that are possible alternative treatments for FSD. The species described have clinical and popular uses in different cultures as well as medical indications for female reproductive disturbances, mainly in climacteric women. We have also analyzed the evidence level of clinical studies. The main outcome assessed is the efficacy of plants in improving the symptoms of FSD. There is little evidence from the literature to recommend the use of medicinal plants when treating FSD. The majority of studies with a strong level of evidence are associated with the treatment of the vasomotor symptoms of menopause. Ferula hermonis, Angelica sinensis, and Gingko biloba may be suggested for arousal disorder studies. Cimicifuga racemosa, Trifolium pratense, and Vitex agnus-castus may be recommended for several FSD. Humulus lupulus and Tribulus terrestris may help with desire disorder studies. Lepidium meyenii should be studied further. Studies of these plants indicate that they may be useful as a possible alternative and/or complementary approach for studies aimed at the treatment of FSD. At this time, however, this review cannot recommend a plant that has a strong enough level of evidence for treatment of FSD. Thus, there is a need for clinical (double-blinded and randomized) studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of several plants that can exert a positive effect on the management of FSD.\n \nThe prospective memory (PM) construct is aimed at capturing cognitive operations involved in the successful accomplishment of delayed intentions. It is generally agreed that PM impairment occurs in patients with prefrontal lobes damage. To evaluate if there is a causal role of a deficit of executive abilities (failures of planning, set-shifting, selective attention, or working memory) over the PM impairment. We report a detailed investigation of PM and executive abilities in two patients with posttraumatic damage to prefrontal lobes who complained from a reduced compliance with appointments and daily routines. Laboratory tests confirmed a difficulty in fulfilling delayed intentions in response to the occurrence of critical events and elapsed time. In one patient, PM impairment was associated with poor performance on tests investigating planning, working memory, and mental shifting. The other patient performed in the normal range on all executive tests. Despite the frequent claim of a dependence of PM deficits from executive dysfunction, the reported cases demonstrate that this is not necessarily the case. The results are discussed in the light of current hypotheses relating PM impairment to other deficits that commonly occur as a result of damage to the prefrontal lobes.\n"}]}]}}

The control group is made up of 91 transplants, matched with those from the study group, whose donor and recipient were younger than 60 years. There were no differences between groups with regard to recipient age, sex, cause of death and renal function of the donor, hepatitis C and cytomegalovirus serologies, cold ischemia time, tubular necrosis, immediate diuresis, need for dialysis, human leukocyte antigen incompatibilities, hypersensitized patients, acute rejection, waiting time on dialysis, and days of admission. Survival in both groups at 1, 5, and 10 years was 97.6%, 87.2%, and 76.6% vs. 98.8%, 87.5%, and 69.5% for the patient (P=0.642), 92.9%, 81.3%, and 64.2% vs. 93.9%, 76.4%, and 69.5% for the graft (P=0.980), and 94.4%, 92.6%, and 77.4% vs. 94.3%, 86.7%, and 84.4% for the graft with death censured (P=0.747), respectively.

In addition, coinfection of CMV and IE has not been reported. Therefore, the current study was initiated to determine whether CMV infection is a risk factor for developing of IE after kidney transplantation. In a retrospectively study, we analyzed the medical records of 3700 kidney recipients at two transplant centers in Iran, between January 2000 and June 2008 for infective endocarditis. During the study, 15 patients with IE hospitalized in our centers were included. The predominant causative microorganisms (60%) were group D non-enterococcal streptococci and enterococci. Patient survival rate in all recipients was 66% at 6 months. Data analysis showed no significant differences in 6 months patient survival from hospitalization between both groups with and without CMV infection (P=0.2). The presentation time of infective endocarditis in recipients with CMV coinfection was more likely to be early when compared to CMV negative coinfection patients (P=0.03). The present study indicates that CMV infection may lead to predispose to infective endocarditis after kidney transplantation. Rapid diagnosis, effective treatment, and prompt recognition of complications in kidney transplant recipients are essential to good patient outcome.\n"}]}]}}

Skilled birth attendance has been shown to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity, yet in 2010 only 68 percent of mothers in Ghana gave birth with the assistance of skilled birth attendants. In 2005, the Ghana Health Service piloted a strategy that involved using the integrated Community-based Health Planning and Services (CHPS) program and training Community Health Officers (CHOs) as midwives to address the gap in skilled attendance in rural Upper East Region (UER). The study assesses the feasibility of and extent to which the skilled delivery program has been implemented as an integrated component of the existing CHPS, and documents the benefits and challenges of the integrated program. We employed an intrinsic case study design with a qualitative methodology. We conducted 41 in-depth interviews with health professionals and community stakeholders. We used a purposive sampling technique to identify and interview our respondents. The CHO-midwives provide integrated services that include skilled delivery in CHPS zones. The midwives collaborate with District Assemblies, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and communities to offer skilled delivery services in rural communities. They refer pregnant women with complications to district hospitals and health centers for care, and there has been observed improvement in the referral system. Stakeholders reported community members' access to skilled attendants at birth, health education, antenatal attendance and postnatal care in rural communities. The CHO-midwives are provided with financial and non-financial incentives to motivate them for optimal work performance. The primary challenges that remain include inadequate numbers of CHO-midwives, insufficient transportation, and infrastructure weaknesses. Our study demonstrates that CHOs can successfully be trained as midwives and deployed to provide skilled delivery services at the doorsteps of rural households. The integration of the skilled delivery program with the CHPS program appears to be an effective model for improving access to skilled birth attendance in rural communities of the UER of Ghana.\n \nTo determine the impact of Florida's Medicaid Demonstration 4 years post-implementation on per member per month (PMPM) Medicaid expenditures and whether receiving care through HMOs versus provider service networks (PSNs) in the Demonstration was associated with PMPM expenditures. Florida Medicaid claims from two fiscal years prior to implementation of the Demonstration (FY0405, FY0506) and the first four fiscal years after implementation (FY0607-FY0910) from two urban Demonstration counties and two urban non-Demonstration counties. A difference-in-difference approach was used to compare changes in enrollee expenditures before and after implementation of the Demonstration overall and specifically for HMOs and PSNs. Claims data were extracted for enrollees in the Demonstration and non-Demonstration counties and collapsed into monthly amounts (N = 26,819,987 person-months). Among SSI enrollees, the Demonstration resulted in lower increases in PMPM expenditures over time ($40) compared with the non-Demonstration counties ($186), with Demonstration PSNs lowering PMPM expenditures by $7 more than HMOs. Savings were also seen among TANF enrollees but to a lesser extent. The Medicaid Demonstration in Florida appears to result in lower PMPM expenditures. Demonstration PSNs generated slightly greater reductions in expenditures compared to Demonstration HMOs. PSNs appear to be a promising model for delivering care to Medicaid enrollees.\n"}]}]}}

The case records of patients consecutively undergoing CAB were reviewed. Patients were stratified retrospectively into high- or low-risk groups according to risk factors for significant carotid stenosis and perioperative stroke Overall, 205 consecutive patients underwent preoperative carotid screening. The prevalence of significant carotid stenosis was 5.8%. Univariate analysis confirmed that PVD (P=0.005), carotid bruit (P=0.003) and diabetes mellitus (P=0.05) were significant risk factors for stenosis. Carotid stenosis was a risk factor for stroke (P=0.03). Prevalence of carotid stenosis was higher in the high-risk group (9.1%) than the low-risk group (1.2%) (P<0.05). All concomitant or staged carotid endarterectomies/CAB (5/205) and all patients who had perioperative strokes (5/205) were in the high-risk group (P=0.01).

From 1997 to 2000, primary coronary artery bypass grafting was performed in 481 patients off pump and in 3231 patients on pump. Hospital outcomes were compared between propensity-matched pairs of 406 on-pump and 406 off-pump patients. The 2 groups were similar in age (P =.9), left ventricular function (P =.7), extent of coronary artery disease (P =.5), carotid artery disease (P =.4), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P =.5). However, off-pump patients had more previous strokes (P =.05) and peripheral vascular disease (P =.02); on-pump patients had a higher preoperative New York Heart Association class (P =.01). In the matched pairs the mean number of bypass grafts was 2.8 +/- 1.0 in off-pump patients and 3.5 +/- 1.1 in on-pump patients (P <.001). Fewer grafts were performed to the circumflex (P <.001) and right coronary (P =.006) artery systems in the off-pump patients. Postoperative mortality, stroke, myocardial infarction, and reoperation for bleeding were similar in the 2 groups. There was more encephalopathy (P =.02), sternal wound infection (P =.04), red blood cell use (P =.002), and renal failure requiring dialysis (P =.03) in the on-pump patients. Both off- and on-pump procedures produced excellent early clinical results with low mortality. An advantage of an off-pump operation was less postoperative morbidity; however, less complete revascularization introduced uncertainty about late results. A disadvantage of on-pump bypass was higher morbidity that seemed attributable to cardiopulmonary bypass.\n"}]}]}}

Among these, patients who showed macroscopically direct invasion into the mesocolon were compared to other patients with advanced gastric cancer. The curability, number and extent of nodal metastasis, and the survival of the mesocolon invasion group were significantly worse than these factors in the T3 group.

Clinicopathological parameters and survival data were analyzed. Loss of DKK3 expression was found in 64 of 158 (40.5%) samples, and it was associated with advanced T stage (p < 0.001), lymph node metastasis (p < 0.001), UICC TNM stage (p < 0.001), tumor location (p = 0.029), lymphovascular invasion (p = 0.035), and perineural invasion (p = 0.032). Patients without DKK3 expression in tumor cells had a significantly worse disease-free and overall survival than those with DKK3 expression (p < 0.001, and p = 0.001, respectively). TNM stage (p = 0.028 and p < 0.001, respectively) and residual tumor (p < 0.001 and p = 0.003, respectively) were independent predictors of disease-free and overall survival. Based on the preoperative clinical stage assessed by computed tomography (CT), loss of DKK3 expression was predominantly associated with worse prognosis in patients with clinically node-negative advanced gastric cancer (AGC). The combination of DKK3 expression status and CT increased the accuracy of CT staging for predicting lymph node involvement from 71.5 to 80.0% in AGC patients. Loss of DKK3 protein expression was significantly associated with poor survival in patients with gastric cancer and was strongly correlated with the TNM stage. DKK3 might be a potential biomarker of lymph node involvement that can improve the predictive power of CT.\n"}]}]}}

We conducted a population-based case-referent study of 25- to 74-year-old stroke patients with, for each case of a patient who was on statin treatment at the onset of stroke (n=125), 2 referent patients who were not treated with statins but were matched for age, gender, year of onset, and stroke subtype (n=250).

Patients were divided into two groups to examine the influence of statins The overall incidence of postoperative AF was 26%. Postoperative AF was significantly lower in the Statin group compared with the Non-statin group (16% versus 33%, p = 0.005). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that independent predictors of AF development after CABG were preoperative statin therapy (odds ratio [OR] 0.327, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.107 to 0.998, p = 0.05) and age (OR 1.058, 95% CI 1.004 to 1.116, p = 0.035). Our study indicated that preoperative statin therapy seems to reduce AF development after CABG.\n"}]}]}}

Data were drawn from the Ghana Demographic and Health Survey, a nationally representative survey collected in 2008. The study used a cross-sectional design to examine the independent effects of NHIS enrolment on two dependent variables (frequency and timing of antenatal visits) among 1610 Ghanaian women. Negative binomial and logit models were fitted given that count and categorical variables were employed as outcome measures, respectively. Regardless of socio-economic and demographic factors, women enrolled in the NHIS make more antenatal visits compared with those not enrolled; however, there was no statistical association with the timing of the crucial first visit. Women who are educated, living in urban areas and are wealthy were more likely to attend antenatal care than those living in rural areas, uneducated and from poorer households. The NHIS should be strengthened and resourced as it may act as an important tool for increasing antenatal care attendance among women in Ghana.\n \nMedicare beneficiaries who have chronic conditions are responsible for a disproportionate share of Medicare fee-for-service expenditures. The objective of this study was to analyze the change in the health of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Part A (hospital insurance) between 2008 and 2010 by comparing the prevalence of 11 chronic conditions. We conducted descriptive analyses using the 2008 and 2010 Chronic Conditions Public Use Files, which are newly available from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and have administrative (claims) data on 100% of the Medicare fee-for-service population. We examined the data by age, sex, and dual eligibility (eligibility for both Medicare and Medicaid). Medicare Part A beneficiaries had more chronic conditions on average in 2010 than in 2008. The percentage increase in the average number of chronic conditions was larger for dual-eligible beneficiaries (2.8%) than for nondual-eligible beneficiaries (1.2%). The prevalence of some chronic conditions, such as congestive heart failure, ischemic heart disease, and stroke/transient ischemic attack, decreased. The deterioration of average health was due to other chronic conditions Analyzing the prevalence of 11 chronic conditions by using Medicare claims data provides a monitoring tool that can guide health care providers and policy makers in devising strategies to address chronic conditions and rising health care costs.\n"}]}]}}

A total of 4 children aged 5-14\u00a0years with a sternal fracture were treated in 2\u00a0years, 2\u00a0children were hospitalized for pain management and 2 remained in outpatient care. Isolated sternal fractures in childhood are often due to typical age-related traumatic incidents. Ultrasonography is a useful diagnostic tool for fracture detection and radiography is the method of choice for visualization of the extent of the dislocation.\n \nTraumatic displaced femoral neck fractures in the elderly can be treated with cemented or uncemented hemiarthroplasty with good outcomes. Earlier studies reported a higher incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) associated with cemented prostheses in elective total hip or knee arthroplasty. In addition, the hypercoagulable state after a traumatic femoral neck fracture and possible thrombogenic properties of bone cement could put these patients at greater risk for thromboembolism. We aimed to compare the incidence of DVT and progression to pulmonary embolism (PE) or mortality in cemented and uncemented hemiarthroplasty. The data of 271 patients treated with cemented or uncemented hemiarthroplasty after a traumatic displaced femoral neck fracture was retrospectively analysed for the incidence of DVT. The level of thrombosis, progression to PE and mortality were compared. There were 133 (49.1%) patients with cemented hemiarthroplasty, while 138 (50.9%) had uncemented hemiarthroplasty. The patients had an average age of 76.6 (range 53-99) years and 11 (4.1%) patients had DVT. There were no significant differences in development of DVT, level of thrombosis, PE and mortality regardless of whether a cemented or an uncemented prosthesis was used. Cemented hemiarthroplasty is not associated with higher risks of DVT, PE or mortality in patients with traumatic displaced femoral neck fracture. Cemented prostheses can be safely used for this group of patients.\n"}]}]}}

Substitution with androgens at physiological levels improves sexual function in women who experience decreased sexual desire and androgen deficiency from surgical menopause, pituitary disease, and age-related decline in androgen production in the ovaries. Measuring bioactive testosterone is difficult and new methods have been proposed, including measuring the primary androgen metabolite androsterone glucuronide (ADT-G). The aim of this study was to investigate a possible correlation between serum levels of androgens and sexual desire in women and whether the level of ADT-G is better correlated than the level of circulating androgens with sexual desire. This was a cross-sectional study including 560 healthy women aged 19-65 years divided into three age groups. Correlations were considered to be statistically significant at P<0.05. Sexual desire was determined as the total score of the sexual desire domain of the Female Sexual Function Index. Total testosterone (TT), calculated free testosterone (FT), androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), and ADT-G were analyzed using mass spectrometry. Sexual desire correlated overall with FT and androstenedione in the total cohort of women. In a subgroup of women aged 25-44 years with no use of systemic hormonal contraception, sexual desire correlated with TT, FT, androstenedione, and DHEAS. In women aged 45-65 years, androstenedione correlated with sexual desire. No correlations between ADT-G and sexual desire were identified. In the present study, FT and androstenedione were statistically significantly correlated with sexual desire in the total cohort of women. ADT-G did not correlate more strongly than circulating androgens with sexual desire and is therefore not superior to measuring circulating androgens by mass spectrometry.\n \nScreening mammogram can decrease the mortality of breast cancer. Studies show that women avoid mammogram because of fear of pain, diagnosis, and radiation. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a radiolucent pad (MammoPad; Hologic Inc, Bedford [MA], US) during screening mammogram to reduce pain in Chinese patients and the possibility of glandular dose reduction. This case series was conducted in a private hospital in Hong Kong. Between November 2011 and January 2012, a total of 100 Chinese patients were recruited to our study. Left mammogram was performed without MammoPad and served as a control. Right mammogram was performed with the radiolucent MammoPad. All patients were then requested to complete a simple questionnaire. The degree of pain and discomfort was rated on a 0-10 numeric analogue scale. Significant reduction in discomfort was defined as a decrease of 10% or more. Of the 100 patients enrolled in this study, 66.3% of women reported at least a 10% reduction in the level of discomfort with the use of MammoPad. No statistical differences between age, breast size, and the level of discomfort were found. The use of MammoPad significantly reduced the level of discomfort experienced during mammography. Radiation dose was also reduced.\n"}]}]}}

The objective of the current study was to determine whether the survival of women with recurrent breast cancer has improved from 1974 to 2000. The authors analyzed the survival experience of 834 women who developed recurrent breast cancer between November 1974 and December 2000. All patients had been treated previously with adjuvant anthracycline-based protocols. Patients were divided into five consecutive groups based on year of breast cancer recurrence, and survival was compared across the five groups. Because some prognostic variables were divided unevenly divided among the cohorts, a multivariate model was created to determine the association of year of recurrence and survival after accounting for other prognostic factors. In the unadjusted analysis, there was a statistically significant improvement in survival across the five groups, and the more recent cohorts had longer survival (P < 0.001). Other variables that predicted longer survival after breast cancer recurrence included smaller initial tumor size, lower stage of disease, fewer lymph nodes involved, longer disease-free interval, estrogen receptor-positive tumors, and nonvisceral dominant site of disease recurrence. In the multivariate analysis, which adjusted for these prognostic factors, year of recurrence was associated with a trend toward improved survival, with a 1% reduction in risk for each increasing year. For these cohorts of patients, the authors present data suggesting that the prognosis for patients with recurrent breast cancer improved between 1974 and 2000.\n"}]}]}}

To investigate a large sample of pterygia for the presence of HPV in order to clarify the putative association between pterygia and HPV. 100 specimens of pterygium from Danish patients and 20 normal conjunctival biopsy specimens were investigated for the presence of HPV with PCR technique using beta-globin primers to access the quality of the extracted DNA and the HPV primers MY09/11 and GP5+/6+. HPV-positive specimens underwent subsequent HPV typing with type-specific HPV primers and further investigation with DNA in situ hybridisation (ISH). 90 of 100 investigated pterygia proved suitable for HPV analysis by PCR. As beta-globin could not be amplified, 10 specimens were excluded from the study. 4 of 90 pterygia harboured HPV. HPV type 6 was identified in all four HPV-positive pterygia. The 20 normal conjunctival biopsy specimens were beta-globin positive and HPV negative. All four pterygia that were HPV type 6 positive were DNA ISH negative.

Using koilocytosis as a marker, the rate of \"active\" cervical lesions was compared with the rate of \"non active\" cervical lesions in patients with \"active\" versus \"non active\" vaginal lesions. Finally, the rates of mild and severe cervical lesions were compared among each group of VAIN (low-grade, high-grade, with or without koilocytosis). In patients with mild vaginal lesions, mild cervical lesions were significantly more frequent than severe cervical lesions.

The differences in rates of mild cervical lesions and severe cervical lesions among patients with high-grade VAIN and low-grade VAIN (with and without koilocytosis) were not significant.

The aim of this study is to identify the factors associated with the use of sphincter-preserving surgery and to quantify the potential for an increase in sphincter preservation. This population-based retrospective cohort study used patient-level data collected through a comprehensive, standardized review of hospital inpatient and outpatient medical records and cancer center charts. This study was conducted in all hospitals providing rectal cancer surgery in a Canadian province. All patients with a new diagnosis of rectal cancer from July 1, 2002 to June 30, 2006 who underwent potentially curative radical surgery were included. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with receiving a permanent colostomy. Patients were categorized as having received an appropriate or potentially inappropriate colostomy based on a priori determined patient, tumor, operative, and pathologic criteria. Of 466 patients who underwent radical surgery, 48% received a permanent colostomy. There was significant variation in the rate of sphincter-preserving surgery among the 10 hospitals that provided rectal cancer care (12%-73%, p = 0.0001). On multivariate analysis, male sex, low tumor height, and increasing tumor stage were associated with the receipt of a permanent colostomy. Among patients who received a permanent stoma, 65 of 224 (29%) patients received a potentially inappropriate stoma. On multivariate analysis, male sex and treatment in a medium- or low-volume hospital was associated with the receipt of a potentially inappropriate colostomy. This study was limited by its retrospective design. These data suggest that the receipt of a permanent colostomy by many patients with rectal cancer may be inappropriate, and there is potential to increase the use of sphincter-preserving surgery in patients with rectal cancer.\n"}]}]}}

These associations were then adjusted for confounding by a series of factors measured in childhood. The three disorder groups had rates of adult MD during the period 18-35 years that were significantly (p<.05) higher than that of the group with no disorder. Furthermore, those in the comorbid MD/AUD group had significantly (p <.05) higher rates of adult MD than those in the AUD-only group, and marginally (p <.10) higher rates of adult MD than those in the MD-only group. After adjustment for confounding, the difference in rates of adult MD between the MD-only group and the MD/AUD group were no longer statistically significant. The factors that explained the associations were gender, childhood behavior problems, and exposure to physical and sexual abuse. The data were obtained by self-report, and may have been subject to biases. The results of these analyses suggest that marginally higher rates of depression to age 35 amongst the comorbid MD/AUD group were explained by increased exposure to adverse childhood circumstances amongst members of the comorbid group. Adolescent MD/AUD comorbidity is likely to be a risk marker, rather than a causal factor in subsequent MD.\n"}]}]}}

We hypothesize that breast reduction surgery has a high satisfaction rate, and that body mass index (BMI), and the amount of breast tissue removed would not alter this outcome. The purpose of this study was to determine if there is an improvement in the quality of life in patients undergoing breast reduction surgery, and whether breast volume or patient size influences this outcome. A retrospective chart review was performed on 600 consecutive patients at a single institution from 2000 to 2010. Patients were mailed The Breast Q questionnaire to complete. Demographic, surgical, and clinical data were collected and entered into a database. Descriptive statistical analyses were conducted using SAS Software version 9.1.3 with statistical significance determined at P<0.05. A total of 178 surveys were returned and included in our study (a response rate of 29.6%). Patient data included a mean BMI of 28.3 (4.6) kg/m, and mean total amount of breast tissue removed of 1220.9 (665.4) g. The primary indications for patients having breast surgery were for symptomatic macromastia (85%), asymmetry (5.6%), and for cosmesis (2.5%). The Breast Q questionnaire demonstrated patients overwhelmingly agreed that they were satisfied with their breast surgery. The mean response was 2.8 with a standard deviation (SD) of 0.47 (where 1, disagree; 2, somewhat agree; and 3, definitely agree). Patient BMI and total amount of breast tissue removed had a statistically significant positive correlation (0.479; P<0.0001). There was no statistically significant difference between the amount of total breast tissue removed and patient response (P=0.57). The study supports a positive outcome after breast reduction surgery. Over 95% of the patients surveyed were satisfied and would do it again. It demonstrates the improvement of the patient's quality of life regardless of the amount of breast tissue removed. Furthermore, it suggests that the size and weight of the patient has no impact on this outcome. As we face new government and insurance restrictions for surgeries that have both cosmetic and reconstructive value, patient reported outcome studies may have an influence on future third-party payer.\n \nThe aim of study was to evaluate the importance of induced abortions for reproduction medicine in Czech Republic. Demographic analysis of data published by EUROSTAT and Czech statistical office. Department of Demography and Geodemography Faculty of Science, Charles University Prague. Widespread use of the liberal abortion law in socialist countries contributed to the decline of fertility rates only to the replacement level. In the Czech Republic total fertility rate dropped below 1.3 in 1995 and it did not increase above 1.5 children per woman till 2007. The increased use of modern contraceptive methods that results in a sharp decline in fertility and in a significant decrease of induced abortions can be documented. The total abortion rate fell from 1.54 abortions per a woman in 1990 to 0.34 in 2007. The proportion of women aged 15-49 years who were prescribed oral contraception increased from 4 percent in 1990 to 48 percent in 2007. An induced abortion is still used largely as a way to avoid birth of additional children by women who already have the number of children they want. This is in sharp contrast with the situation in the majority of Western European countries in which abortion is used mainly by teen-age girls whose attempts to avoid pregnancy have failed. In contrast to other demographic characteristics which classify the Czech Republic to Eastern Europe, the level of induced abortion rate is comparable with the levels observed in some Western European countries.\n"}]}]}}

A significant reduction in the \"no-flow-time\", quantitatively better chest compressions and an improved quality of ventilation can be demonstrated during CPR using supraglottic airway devices (SADs). Previous studies have demonstrated the ability of inexperienced persons to operate SADs after brief instruction. The aim of this pilot study was to determine whether an instruction manual consisting of four diagrams enables laypersons to operate a Laryngeal Mask Supreme\u00ae (LMAS) in the manikin. An instruction manual of four illustrations with speech bubbles displaying the correct use of the LMAS was designed. Laypersons were handed a bag containing a LMAS, a bag mask valve device (BMV), a syringe prefilled with air and the instruction sheet, and were asked to perform and ventilate the manikin as displayed. Time to ventilation was recorded and degree of success evaluated. A total of 150 laypersons took part. Overall 145 participants (96.7%) inserted the LMAS in the manikin in the right direction. The device was inserted inverted or twisted in 13 (8.7%) attempts. Eight (5.3%) individuals recognized this and corrected the position. Within the first 2 minutes 119 (79.3%) applicants were able to insert the LMAS and provide tidal volumes greater than 150 ml (estimated dead space). Time to insertion and first ventilation was 83.2 \u00b1 29 s. No significant difference related to previous BLS training (P = 0.85), technical education (P = 0.07) or gender could be demonstrated (P = 0.25). In manikin laypersons could insert LMAS in the correct direction after onsite instruction by a simple manual with a high success rate. This indicates some basic procedural understanding and intellectual transfer in principle. Operating errors (n = 91) were frequently not recognized and corrected (n = 77). Improvements in labeling and the quality of instructional photographs may reduce individual error and may optimize understanding.\n \nPropofol has been found to depress the laryngeal reflexes. We studied whether this property could be utilized to relieve laryngeal spasm. This study was conducted over a period of 3 years, and included children aged 3-10 years, ASA status I and II. Most of the children were undergoing minor surgical procedures, under general anaesthesia with Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA trade mark ) and caudal epidural analgesia. During this period, 20 patients developed laryngeal spasm on removal of the LMA at the end of surgery. Initially, they all were treated with 100% O2, with gentle positive pressure ventilation. Out of 20 patients, seven responded well with 100% O2 and gentle positive pressure ventilation. The remaining 13 were treated with a small dose of propofol (0.8 mg.kg-1 body weight). Laryngeal spasm was relieved successfully in 10 patients and three patients required intubation to improve their oxygenation. Propofol in a small dose (0.8 mg.kg-1 body weight) was a useful drug to relieve laryngeal spasm in most children (76.9%) following the removal of the LMA. Because it was not found to be effective in all patients, succinylcholine still has a role to play in critical conditions. However, we recommend propofol as a suitable alternative for relieving laryngeal spasm in situations where succinylcholine is contraindicated.\n"}]}]}}

The sample comprised of 100 autopsy specimens from South Indian population. INA was measured using software-aided processing of digital photographs. Length of the ISON was measured on each side using Vernier calipers. RAPL of the OC was noted during dissection. These were analysed with statistical methods. RAPL of OC was found to be prefixed in 24\u00a0%, normofixed in 65\u00a0% and postfixed in 11\u00a0%. The INA had an overall mean of 69.9\u00b0 (SD 9.29\u00b0). ANOVA confirmed statistically significant difference in INA among different groups; the corresponding mean value for the group was as follows The INA is wider when OC is prefixed, intermediate when normofixed and narrowed when postfixed. This observation throws light on the possibility of using INA as a marker of RAPL of OC. As INA can be measured in axial MRI sections, it can be used in differentiation of the cases with prefixed OC from others during pre-operative work up for pituitary surgeries and to identify individuals 'at risk' during subfrontal approach for pituitary lesions.\n"}]}]}}

The second part of the study consisting of a telephone survey to assess timing and details concerning the circumcision, included two groups 162 neonates (108 males, 54 females) were hospitalised with UTI.

The incidence of UTI in males peaked at 2-4 weeks of age, that is, the period immediately following circumcision. In females, the incidence tended to rise with age. Accordingly, male predominance disappeared at 7 weeks and the male-to-female ratio reversed. In the second part of the study, 111 males (< or =1 month old) were included There was a higher preponderance of UTI among male neonates. Its incidence peaked during the early post-circumcision period, as opposed to the age-related rise in females.

One hundred patients (aged 61.8\u00b113.3 y, 54.1% females), underwent an early (4 to 6 wk) colonoscopy after hospital discharge. There were no significant differences in patients' characteristics or survival between those with or without colonoscopy (4\u00b11.9 vs. 4.2\u00b12.1 y, P=0.62). No colonic malignancy was detected. However, in 32 patients (32%) at least 1 polyp was found. Only 1 was determined as an advanced adenoma. No new or different diagnosis was made after colonoscopy. Our results suggest that colonoscopy does not affect the management of patients with acute diverticulitis nor alter the outcome.

The aim of this study was to assess whether acute diverticulitis was more virulent in young patients. A retrospective, cross-sectional study included all patients who were admitted for a first episode of acute diverticulitis between January 2004 and December 2013. The patients were divided into two groups (\u226450 years and >50 years) based on their age. Patients' characteristics, clinical and surgical data were recorded and analyzed. Overall, 636 patients were included in the database, including 177 (27.8%) in the younger group and 459 in the elder group. There were no significant differences between the groups in disease complexity, peritonitis, laboratory work-up, vital signs on presentation, bowel obstruction or the presence of fistula and abscess in need of drainage.

Length of hospital stay (P\u2009=\u20090.0001) was longer and postoperative complications were more common in the elder patients. The clinical presentation of acute diverticulitis does not seem to be worse in the young population. Younger patients tend to have a more severe presentation on CT scan and more readmissions, but this did not translate to a more severe disease course.\n"}]}]}}

We hypothesize that there will be a difference in Modified Barthel Index (MBI) scores between the 'older old' (>85 years) and the 'younger old' (<85 years). Hip fracture patients (>60 years) treated surgically were divided into Group A (below 85 years) and Group B (above 85 years). Demographic data, Charlson's Comorbidity Index (CCI) score, time to surgery and length of stay (LOS) were recorded. To assess the recovery in activities of daily living, the MBI scores were measured for the following intervals; pre-fall, at discharge, at 6-month and at 1-year follow-up. The mean age for Group A (n = 120) was 77 years (60-85) and the mean age for Group B (n = 59) was 91.8 years (86-108).

The attending physician independently completed the body image and description scale and indicated the figure that most accurately represented the patient without reference to BMI standards. Accuracy of the patients', parents', and doctors' estimates were statistically compared. The sample population consisted of 6.4% underweight, 70.5% normal weight, 7.7% overweight, and 15.4% obese. Forty-four percent of parents underestimated children's body size using word descriptions and 47% underestimated using figures. Forty percent of the children underestimated their own body size using descriptions and 43% underestimated using figures. The physicians in this study had a higher percentage of correct estimates; however, they underestimated 33% of the patients using both word descriptions and figures. Some obese children were not recognized, and several average children were perceived as underweight. Many children underestimated their degree of overweight. Their parents and even their attending physicians shared this misperception. This study demonstrates the need to further educate physicians to recognize obesity and overweight so that they can counsel children and their families.\n"}]}]}}

The aim of the present study is to re-evaluate the usefulness of the measurement of alpha-SU serum level in response to TRH stimulation in detecting the gonadotropic nature of nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas before the neurosurgical treatment. We have studied 14 patients with CNFPAs. The response of alpha-SU to the administration of TRH was studied in each patient before the surgery. alpha-SU blood serum level increase over 50% of the baseline level after TRH treatment was considered to be significant. The patients were divided into 2 groups, each including 7 subjects. The first group included the patients with gonadotropinomas (tumors immunopositive for FSH and/or LH or their free subunits). The second group included the patients with adenomas immunonegative for gonadotropins and alpha-SU. The basal level of alpha-SU was elevated over the upper limit of normal range in two patients of the first group (gonadotroph adenomas) and in one in the second group. All but one patient from the first group and none of seven patients with tumors immunonegative for FSH, LH or alpha-SU, had a significant alpha-SU (over 50%) response to TRH. In three of seven patients with gonadotropins immunonegative tumors a decrease of alpha-SU serum level after TRH was observed. The measurement of alpha-SU serum level in response to TRH administration seems to be useful in preoperative identification of gonadotroph adenomas among other nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas.\n \nVerify whether a journal's impact factor is a mechanism that modifies the ethical requirements described in the instructions provided to authors of articles published in Brazilian medical journals. 48 selected journals were divided into two groups The average score of the impact-factor group was significantly higher than that of the no-impact-factor group (3.12 \u00b1 1.03 vs. 2.08 \u00b1 1.64, p=0.0121). When each ethical requirement was compared between the groups, there was significant difference only between the requirement of an informed consent and the disclosure of conflicts of interest (p < 0.05). The impact factor is a determinant factor on the ethics included in the instructions to authors of articles in scientific journals, showing that higher-quality journals seek better-designed articles that are conscientious at the beginning of the research.\n"}]}]}}

The initial analysis showed that the cases with dyspepsia and Helicobacter pylori infection were more frequently associated with overweight, obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, and metabolic syndrome, but the paired analysis nullified all these differences. The patients with dyspepsia infected with Helicobacter pylori had similar clinical characteristics to the non-infected patients and could not be differentiated a priori.

We investigated for the first time whether in vitro combinations of 2ME with various chemotherapeutic compounds may result in an additive inhibitory effect on the proliferation of human ovary cancer cells. As a model two different human ovary cancer cell lines were used. All cell lines were incubated with equimolar concentrations of 2ME (0.8-25 microM) and the chemotherapeutics epirubicine, doxorubicine, paclitaxel, docetaxel, carboplatin, vinorelbine, 5-fluorouracil and mafosfamide. Proliferation was measured after four days using the ATP-chemosensitivity test. For both ovary cancer cell lines a significant additive effect of 2ME with epirubicine and carboplatin was observed at the lower concentration range of these chemotherapeutic substances. 2ME is able to enhance the antiproliferative activity of certain chemotherapeutics at pharmacological relevant concentrations. This estradiol metabolite is currently in a phase II trial in patients with refractary metastatic breast cancer and the tolerability has been shown to be very good. The combination of 2ME with chemotherapeutics may therefore offer a new clinically relevant treatment regimen for hormone-dependent cancer.\n \nSurgical excision of ovarian endometriomas in patients desiring pregnancy has recently been criticized because of the risk of damage to healthy ovarian tissue and consequent reduction of ovarian reserve. A correct diagnosis in cases not scheduled for surgery is therefore mandatory in order to avoid unexpected ovarian cancer misdiagnosis. Endometriosis is often associated with high levels of CA125. This marker is therefore not useful for discriminating ovarian endometrioma from ovarian malignancy. The aim of this study was to establish if the serum marker CA72-4 could be helpful in the differential diagnosis between ovarian endometriosis and epithelial ovarian cancer. Serums CA125 and CA72-4 were measured in 72 patients with ovarian endometriomas and 55 patients with ovarian cancer. High CA125 concentrations were observed in patients with ovarian endometriosis and in those with ovarian cancer. A marked difference in CA72-4 values was observed between women with ovarian cancer (71.0%) and patients with endometriosis (13.8%) (P < 0.0001). This study suggests that CA72-4 determination can be useful to confirm the benign nature of ovarian endometriomas in women with high CA125 levels.\n"}]}]}}

Assessing joint lines (JLs) by means of bony landmarks is inadvisable because of large variations in human anatomy. Because of the inherent symmetry of the human body, we hypothesised that JLs may be directly assessed by measuring the distances from the bony landmarks to the JL of the contralateral knee by means of radiographic images. Using scaled weight-bearing radiographs in anteroposterior view of both knees, two independent observers measured the distances from the fibular head, the medial and lateral epicondyle, and the adductor tubercle to the JL. A two-sided p value of \u22640.05 was considered statistically significant. Two hundred knees of 100 patients (50 men and 50 women) were examined. For the fibular head, the mean difference between the treated and the control knee was 0.0 mm with narrow confidence limits ranging from -1.1 to 1.1. As a new assessment method, we have suggested to assess the JL by means of radiographs of the contralateral knee. The most precise parameter was found to be the distance between the fibular head and the JL. The level of arthritis, age, gender, visibility of the landmarks, and misalignment did not influence measurement accuracy. This parameter is the first tibia-related landmark for assessing the JL, which advantageously corresponds to the tibia-first technique in revision surgery. Diagnostic Study, Level II.\n \nIn vivo comparative gap measurements were performed in three different patella positions (reduced, subluxated and everted) using offset-type-force-controlled-spreader-system. Prospectively, 50 knees were operated by total knee arthroplasty using a navigation-assisted gap-balancing technique. The offset-type-force-controlled-spreader-system was used for gap measurements. This commercially available instrument allows controllable tension in patella-reduced position. The mediolateral gaps of knee extension (0\u00b0) and flexion (90\u00b0) angle were recorded in three different patella positions; reduced, subluxated and everted. Any gap differences of more than 3 mm were considered as a meaningful difference. Correlation between the difference with the demographic data, preoperative radiologic alignment and intraoperative data was analysed. For statistical analysis, ANOVA and Pearson's correlation test were used. The gaps in patella eversion demonstrated smaller gaps both in knee extension and flexion position compared to the gaps of patella reduction position. The amount of decreased gaps was more definite in knee flexion position. Statistically significant difference was observed for the lateral gap of patella eversion compared to gap of patella reduction in knee flexion position (p < 0.05). There were notable cases of variability in knee flexion position. Significant portion of 12 (24 %) knees of patella subluxation and 33 (66 %) knees of patella evertion demonstrated either increased or decreased gaps in knee flexion position compared to the gaps of patella reduction position. The gaps in patella eversion demonstrated smaller gaps both in knee extension and flexion position compared to the gaps of patella reduction position. The amount of decreased gaps was more definite in knee flexion position. Therefore, the intraoperative patellar positioning has influence on the measurement of the joint gap. Keeping the patella in reduced position is important during gap balancing. I.\n"}]}]}}

These include the magnitude of postoperative alignment and the type of material used. The effect of component design and material on postoperative alignment, however, has not been explored. We retrospectively reviewed 89 patients who underwent UKR with robotic guidance. Patients were divided into two groups, according to whether they had received an all-polyethylene inlay component (Inlay group) or a metal-backed onlay component (Onlay group). We explored the magnitude of mechanical alignment correction obtained in both groups. Mean postoperative mechanical alignment was significantly closer to neutral in the Onlay group (mean=2.8\u00b0; 95% CI=2.4\u00b0, 3.2\u00b0) compared to the Inlay group (mean=3.9\u00b0; 95% CI=3.4\u00b0, 4.4\u00b0) (R2=0.65; P=0.003), adjusting for gender, BMI, age, side and preoperative mechanical alignment (Fig. 2). Further exploration revealed that the thickness of the tibial polyethyelene insert had a significant effect on postoperative alignment when added to the model (R2=0.68; P=0.01). Patients who received a metal-backed Onlay tibial component obtained better postoperative mechanical alignment compared to those who received all-polyethylene Inlay prostheses. The thicker overall construct of Onlay prostheses appears to be an important determinant of postoperative alignment. Considering their higher survivorship rates and improved postoperative mechanical alignment, Onlay prostheses should be the first option when performing medial UKR.\n \nThe posterior tibial slope influences both the natural knee stability as well as the stability and kinematics after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Exact definition of the posterior tibial slope (PTS) requires lateral radiographs of the lower limb. Only lateral knee radiographs are routinely obtained after TKA, however. The purpose of the present study therefore was to analyse the relationship between PTS measurement results on short and expanded lateral knee radiographs. The PTS was measured on 100 consecutive lateral radiographs of the lower limb using the mechanical and three diaphyseal axes with various distances below the tibial plateau. Significant differences between PTS results were found for all three diaphyseal axes, with the smallest differences and the strongest correlation for a diaphyseal axis at 16 and 20\u00a0cm below the tibial plateau. Using short distances below the tibial plateau (6 and 10\u00a0cm) resulted in an overestimation of the PTS of 3\u00b0, on average. The PTS measurements in long lateral knee radiographs are more accurate compared to short radiographs. On short lateral knee radiographs, only a estimation of the PTS can be carried out.

All these variables were submitted to univariate and multivariate analysis to establish their impact on survival. Only tumour size appeared to be significantly different between the 3 groups. On univariate analysis, invasion of the perirenal fat, lymph node involvement, distant metastases and VEGF expression were significantly associated with survival (p < 0.01). On multivariate analysis, lymph node involvement, distant metastases and VEGF expression (OR 6.07) were identified as independent predictive factors of survival. Progression of a pT3 tumour into the renal vein and vena cava is not associated with increased tumour expression of VEGF. However, VEGF is an independent prognostic factor in this group of poor prognosis renal tumours.\n \nThe 2002 primary tumor classification for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) does not distinguish between patients with tumor thrombus involving the renal vein only and those with inferior vena cava tumor thrombus below the diaphragm. We evaluated the association of tumor thrombus level and fat invasion with outcome to determine if further subclassification would improve the prognostic accuracy of the current classification. We studied 675 patients treated with radical nephrectomy or nephron sparing surgery for pT3a (206, 30.5%), pT3b (422, 62.5%), pT3c (19, 2.8%) or pT4 (28, 4.2%) RCC at the Mayo Clinic between 1970 and 2000. Associations with outcome were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression. There were 531 deaths from RCC at a median of 1.5 years following nephrectomy. Patients with pT3b RCC and level I, II or III tumor thrombus were significantly more likely to die of RCC compared to patients with pT3b RCC and level 0 tumor thrombus (risk ratio 1.62, p <0.001). Patients with peripheral perinephric or renal sinus fat invasion were also more likely to die of RCC compared to patients without fat invasion (risk ratio 1.87, p <0.001). Therefore, patients with pT3 RCC were reclassified into 4 groups as thrombus level 0 without fat invasion, fat invasion only, thrombus level 0 with fat invasion or thrombus level I, II or III without fat invasion, and thrombus level I, II or III with fat invasion or thrombus level IV. This reclassification significantly improved prediction of death from RCC compared with the current classification (c indexes of 0.61 versus 0.55, respectively). Further subclassification of the primary tumor classification for patients with pT3 RCC improved prognostic accuracy.\n"}]}]}}

Data were collected from Coroner's inquest notes and General Practitioner records. The most common cause of death was poisoning by alcohol and drugs (29.1%, n = 78). A high proportion of cases were unemployed (39.4%, n = 106). Cases were also more likely to be single compared to the general population (74.2% vs 55.5%).

Yearly trends in HIV and STI incidence and risk factors were analysed using Poisson regression. Mean age at enrollment was 25 years. The median follow up time was 4 years. Until 1995 trends in HIV and STI incidence were concurrent, however since 1995 there was a significant (p<0.05) increase in syphilis (0 to 1.4/100 person years (PY)) and gonorrhoea incidence (1.1 to 6.0/100 PY), but no change in HIV incidence (1.1 and 1.3/100 PY). The incidence of syphilis and gonorrhoea has increased among young homosexual men since 1995, while HIV incidence has remained stable. Increasing STI incidence underscores the potential for HIV spread among young homosexual men.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical outcome of all patients treated with cyclosporin at our institution over the past five years. We conducted a retrospective study of 46 patients who presented to a tertiary referral center. Initial responders were those who avoided colectomy; a sustained response was defined as a remission that lasted while the patient was taking oral cyclosporin and for three months after this therapy was discontinued. Thirty-two (69 percent) of 46 patients had an initial response to therapy, and 50 percent met criteria for a sustained response. Eleven of 23 sustained responders subsequently relapsed. At a mean of 22 months' follow-up, 26 percent of patients remain well and have never relapsed. Serious infective complications occurred in two patients, possibly attributable to therapy. No factors predictive of a likely response were identifiable on retrospective analysis. This study confirms the efficacy of cyclosporin in the management of severe ulcerative colitis.

The haemoglobin level was measured in only 4-15% of patients, with no difference before or after completion of the PEP. Where a problem in uterine growth was detected, an appropriate response occurred in 0-8% of patients and no difference before or after completion of the PEP was ascertained. In all groups, estimation of fetal weight and pelvimetry were seldom performed, the urine and fetal heart rate documentation were moderately well done and the blood pressure monitoring, assessment of head above pelvis, monitoring of contractions and plotting of cervical dilatation were usually performed. No differences before or after the PEP were detected. Where problems were detected, appropriate actions taken during labour improved, but not significantly.

Measurements of obesity were made, OSA severity was recorded, and the 95th centile autoCPAP pressure was recorded during 1\u00a0week of autoCPAP. Spearman's rank correlation was performed between measurements of obesity and autoCPAP pressure, and between OSA severity and autoCPAP pressure. Fifty-four obese individuals (median body mass index (BMI) 43.0\u00a0kg/m(2)), 52\u00a0% of whom had OSA (apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI)\u2009\u2265\u200915), had a median 95th centile autoCPAP pressure of 11.8\u2009cmH2O. We found no significant correlation between autoCPAP pressure and neck circumference, waist circumference or BMI. There was a moderate correlation between autoCPAP pressure and OSA severity (AHI r\u2009=\u20090.34, p\u2009=\u20090.02; oxygen desaturation index (ODI) r\u2009=\u20090.48, p\u2009<\u20090.001). In this population, neither BMI nor neck circumference nor waist circumference is predictive of autoCPAP pressure. Therefore, the previously derived algorithm does not adequately predict the fixed CPAP pressure for subsequent clinical use in these obese individuals. In addition, some subjects without OSA generated high autoCPAP pressures, and thus, the correlation between OSA severity and autoCPAP pressure was only moderate.\n \nTo investigate polysomnographic and anthropomorphic factors predicting need of high optimal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Retrospective data analysis. Three hundred fifty-three consecutive obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients who had a successful manual CPAP titration in our sleep disorders unit. The mean optimal CPAP was 9.5 +/- 2.4 cm H2O. The optimal CPAP pressure increases with an increase in OSA severity from 7.79 +/- 2.2 in the mild, to 8.7 +/- 1.8 in the moderate, and to 10.1 +/- 2.3 cm H2O in the severe OSA group. A high CPAP was defined as the mean + 1 standard deviation (SD; > or =12 cm H2O). The predictor variables included apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), age, sex, body mass index (BMI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT). High CPAP was required in 2 (6.9%), 6 (5.8%), and 63 (28.6%) patients with mild, moderate, and severe OSA, respectively. On univariate analysis, AHI, BMI, ESS score, and the proportion of males were significantly higher in those needing high CPAP. They also have a lower MSLT mean. On logistic regression, the use of high CPAP was 5.90 times more frequent (95% confidence interval 2.67-13.1) in severe OSA patients after adjustment for the other variables. The area under the receiver operator curve was 72.4%, showing that the model was adequate. Severe OSA patients are much more likely to need high CPAP levels. However, because of the low positive predictive value (only 28.6%), the clinical value of such information is limited. ESS and MSLT did not increase the predictive value for the need for high CPAP.\n"}]}]}}

Women were categorized based on the clinical presentation of their prior preterm delivery as having ACD, PPROM, or PTL. Risks for sonographic short cervical length and recurrent SPTB were compared between women based on the clinical presentation of their prior preterm birth. Log-linear regression was used to control for confounders. Of 522 patients included in this study, 96 (18.4%) had prior ACD, 246 (47.1%) had prior PPROM, and 180 (34.5%) had prior PTL. Recurrent PTB occurred in 55.2% of patients with a history of ACD compared with 27.2% of those with PPROM and 32.2% with PTL (P = .001). The mean gestational age at delivery was significantly lower for those with a history of ACD (34.0 weeks) compared with women with prior PPROM (37.2 weeks) or PTL (37.0 weeks) (P = .001). The lowest mean cervical length prior to 24 weeks was significantly shorter in patients with a history of advanced cervical dilation when compared with the other clinical presentations. Patients with a history of ACD are at an increased risk of having recurrent preterm birth and cervical shortening in a subsequent pregnancy compared with women with prior preterm birth associated PPROM or PTL.\n \nIt is stated commonly that the earlier in pregnancy bacterial vaginosis is diagnosed, the greater is the increase in risk of preterm birth compared with women without bacterial vaginosis. However, this contention is based on small numbers of women. In this analysis of 12,937 women who were screened for bacterial vaginosis as part of a previously conducted clinical trial, the odds ratio of preterm birth (<7 weeks of gestation) for asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis-positive versus bacterial vaginosis-negative women was evaluated among women who were screened from 8 to 22 weeks of gestation. The odds ratio of preterm birth among bacterial vaginosis-positive versus bacterial vaginosis-negative women ranged from 1.1 to 1.6 and did not vary significantly according to the gestational age at which bacterial vaginosis was screened. The odds ratio for preterm birth did not vary significantly by gestational age at diagnosis when bacterial vaginosis was subdivided into Gram stain score 7 to 8 or 9 to 10. Although bacterial vaginosis was associated with an increased risk of preterm birth, the gestational age at which bacterial vaginosis was screened for and diagnosed did not influence the increase.\n"}]}]}}

This can be done either (i) acutely during the clamp study using high-dose insulin infusion, or (ii) slowly overnight preceding the clamp study using a low-dose insulin infusion. We assessed whether the choice of either of these methods to obtain euglycaemia biases subsequent assessment of glucose metabolism and insulin action. We studied seven obese Type 2 diabetic patients twice Basal plasma glucose levels (mean +/- sd) were 5.5 +/- 0.5 and 10.7 +/- 2.9 mmol/l in the + ON and - ON studies, respectively, and were clamped at -5.5 mmol/l. Basal rates of glucose production (GP) were similar in the + ON and - ON studies, 83 +/- 13 vs. 85 +/- 14 mg m-2 min-1 (NS), whereas basal rates of glucose disappearance (Rd) were lower in the + ON than in the - ON study, 84 +/- 8 vs. 91 +/- 11 mg m-2 min-1 (P = 0.02). During insulin infusion in the clamp period, rates of GP, 23 +/- 11 vs. 25 +/- 10 mg m-2 min-1, as well as rates of Rd, 133 +/- 32 vs. 139 +/- 37 mg m-2 min-1, were similar in the + ON and - ON studies, respectively (NS). Apart from basal rates of Rd, assessment of glucose turnover rates in euglycaemic clamp studies of Type 2 diabetic patients is not dependent on the method by which plasma glucose levels are lowered.\n"}]}]}}

The frequency of family history of psychiatric disorder was determined for each study as well as the relationship of family history to the presence of poststroke depression. Based on data obtained from 903 patients with stroke, the fixed model analysis found a risk ratio of 1.51 and the random model a risk ratio of 1.46 for the existence of poststroke depression if there is a positive family history of psychiatric disorder compared with a negative family history. The existence of a positive family history of psychiatric disorder constitutes a risk factor for development of poststroke depression. The role of family history in poststroke depression, however, appears to be substantially lower than among elderly depressed patients without evidence of vascular disease.\n \nA meta-analysis of observational studies on association between cigarette smoking and pancreatic cancer was performed to focus, particularly, on the role of the studies' quality in affecting meta-analysis results.

Because lysosomotropic amines can suppress major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigen presentation, their mechanism of action is potentially different from current immune suppressant drugs used to control GVHD such as cyclosporine. We investigated the use of cyclosporine and the lysosomotropic amines chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in combination for additive or synergistic immunosuppression on T-cell responses in vitro to MiHC and MHC in mice. We found that similar concentrations of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine suppress the T-cell response to MiHC in mice (C57BL/6 anti-BALB.B) and that lysosomotropic amines in combination with cyclosporine result in synergistic suppression of a proliferative response to MiHC. Similar suppression and synergy appear to be present in an alloreactive response (C57BL/6 anti-BALB/c). Direct inhibition by chloroquine of T-cell proliferative responses induced by anti-CD3epsilon in the absence of antigen-presenting cells is present at higher concentrations than that required to suppress responses to MiHC or MHC. Chloroquine appears to induce decreased T-cell viability at high concentrations. This effect does not appear to be due to decreased T-cell production of interleukin-2 or interferon-gamma. At lower concentrations (<25 microg/ml), chloroquine can also decrease the ability of antigen-presenting cells to stimulate an a C57BL/6 anti-BALB/c T-cell response and can inhibit MHC class II expression after activation with lipopolysaccharide. Lysosomotropic amines in combination with cyclosporine appear to be synergistic in the suppression of T-cell proliferation to MiHC and MHC. Use of chloroquine in combination with cyclosporine may result in improved control of GVHD.\n \nAn association between posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) and cyclosporine A (CsA) and OKT3 has often been postulated on the basis of retrospective studies, although a randomized study with PTLD as the endpoint will probably never be performed. Because focus on PTLD coincided with the use of these drugs, a bias could be suspected. In a retrospective, nonrandomized study, we reevaluated all lymphoma-like lesions arising in kidney-transplant patients grafted at our center during 1969 to 1998 and observed up to 2002. Case pathology was reviewed, and an association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection (and latency pattern) was assessed. We did not find any significant difference in the incidence of PTLDs when comparing the prednisolone/azathioprine, and CsA eras (P=0.89), the periods before or after OKT3 (P=0.61), and those before or after antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) (P=0.22). Occurrence time was shorter in the CsA (P=0.059), OKT3 (P=0.007), and ALG (P=0.007) eras. In the OKT3 era, 182 patients received, and 224 did not receive, OKT3; after the same observation time, there had been eight and five PTLDs, respectively (P=0.34). The use of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) was associated with a reduction in the number of PTLDs (P=0.01). EBV was detected in 16 of 21 (76%) cases. We found no evidence to implicate any one drug regime preferentially in the development of PTLDs. The risk of developing PTLD seems to be a result of the whole transplantation process, which includes the antigenicity of the foreign graft, the immunosuppression resulting in inadequate cytotoxic T-cell activity, and the result of EBV infection. An important minority of cases are EBV negative.\n"}]}]}}

Sixteen patients failed at distant sites alone. Among Stage IV patients the 5-year actuarial rates for patients who did and did not receive induction chemotherapy were as follows While not providing conclusive evidence, this single institution experience suggests that neoadjuvant chemotherapy for Stage IV NPC patients improves both survival and disease control. Recurrence within the irradiated volume was the most prevalent mode of failure and future studies will evaluate regimens to enhance local regional control.\n \nPatients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) eligible for extrapleural pneumonectomy (EPP) may benefit from induction chemotherapy (CT) as historically described, or from induction-accelerated hemithoracic intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) as a potential alternative.

Age at presentation, physical examination, ultrasonographic and intraoperative findings were recorded. Patients were followed after initial surgical intervention to determine the likelihood of developing a subsequent hydrocele or hernia. Thirty-seven patients were identified as presenting with neonatal torsion. Age of presentation averaged 3.5 days (range 1-14 days). Left-sided pathology was seen more commonly than the right, with a 25:12 distribution. All torsed testicles were nonviable. Twenty-two patients were noted to have a contralateral hydrocele at presentation. All hydroceles were opened through a scrotal approach at the time of contralateral scrotal fixation. No patient underwent an inguinal exploration to examine for a patent process vaginalis. None of the patients who presented with a hydrocele have developed a clinical hydrocele or hernia after an average 7.5 years (range 4.3-11.2) follow-up. We have demonstrated that approaching a contralateral hydrocele in cases of neonatal testicular torsion solely through a scrotal incision is safe and effective. Inguinal exploration was not performed in our study and our long-term results demonstrate that such an approach would have brought no additional benefit. In avoiding an inguinal approach we did not subject our patients to unnecessary risk of testicular or vasal injury. Contralateral hydrocele is commonly seen in cases of neonatal testicular torsion. In our experience this is a condition of minimal clinical significance and does not warrant formal inguinal exploration for treatment. This conservative management strategy minimizes the potential of contralateral spermatic cord injury in the neonate. The aims of the study were met.\n \nThe absence of a testis occurs for various reasons in children, but testicular prosthesis implantation in children is uncommon. The optimal time for prosthesis placement is still unclear, and its complication rate has been poorly studied in children. The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors of complications in cases of testicular prosthesis implantation in children. A monocentric, retrospective review was performed of children implanted with a testicular prosthesis between 2008 and 2014. All implantations were performed through an inguinal incision with a standardized procedure. Children were divided into two groups depending on the interval after orchiectomy Twenty-six patients (A, 15; B, 11) had a total of 38 testicular prostheses placements.

Indications were mainly spermatic cord torsion (27%), bilateral anorchia (27%), and testicular atrophy after cryptorchidism surgery (19.2%). Complications (10.5%) included two cases of extrusion, one infection and one migration. Patient 1 had a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia with testicle relapse 2 years after induction therapy. High-dose chemotherapy, total body irradiation and bilateral orchiectomies were performed, and bilateral prostheses were implanted 12 years after the end of chemotherapy. Complications happened 85 days after surgery. Patient 2 was followed-up for a proximal hypospadias. The tunica vaginalis flap, which was used during a redo urethroplasty, lead to testicular atrophy. Thirteen years after the last penile surgery, a testicular prosthesis was placed through an inguinal incision, and extrusion occurred 203 days after surgery. Bacterial cultures of the prostheses were sterile and histological review showed no sign of granuloma or graft rejection. The complication rate was significantly higher if the delay between the two surgeries exceeded 1 year (P\u00a0=\u00a00.01). Indications of orchiectomy, prior scrotal incision, and prosthesis size were not risk factors. Testicular prosthesis implantation was relatively safe in a pediatric cohort. The complication rate was significantly higher if the delay between the orchiectomy and the prosthetic placement exceeded 1 year. These results suggest that reducing the delay between orchiectomy and prosthesis implantation may lead to fewer complications.\n"}]}]}}

Using a 5-point rating scale, safety ratings for vehicular gaps of different durations were measured along a two-lane street of one-way traffic without a traffic signal. Safety ratings were collected from 12 normally sighted, 10 visually impaired, and 10 blind subjects for eight different gap times under three sensory conditions We found that normally sighted and visually impaired pedestrians were accurate and reliable in their street crossing decision-making ability when using either vision plus hearing or vision only (P > 0.05). Under the hearing only condition, all subjects were reliable (P > 0.05) but inaccurate with their street crossing decisions (P < 0.05). Compared to either the normally sighted (P = 0.018) or visually impaired subjects (P = 0.019), blind subjects were the least accurate with their street crossing decisions under the hearing only condition. Our data suggested that visually impaired pedestrians can make accurate and reliable street crossing decisions like those of normally sighted pedestrians. When using auditory information only, all subjects significantly overestimated the vehicular gap time. Our finding that blind pedestrians performed significantly worse than either the normally sighted or visually impaired subjects under the hearing only condition suggested that they may benefit from training to improve their detection ability and/or interpretation of vehicular gap times.\n \nTo assess the impact of clinicians' use of an online information retrieval system on their performance in answering clinical questions. Pre-/post-intervention experimental design. In a computer laboratory, 75 clinicians (26 hospital-based doctors, 18 family practitioners, and 31 clinical nurse consultants) provided 600 answers to eight clinical scenarios before and after the use of an online information retrieval system. We examined the proportion of correct answers pre- and post-intervention, direction of change in answers, and differences between professional groups. System use resulted in a 21% improvement in clinicians' answers, from 29% (95% confidence interval [CI] 25.4-32.6) correct pre- to 50% (95% CI 46.0-54.0) post-system use. In 33% (95% CI 29.1-36.9) answers were changed from incorrect to correct. In 21% (95% CI 17.1-23.9) correct pre-test answers were supported by evidence found using the system, and in 7% (95% CI 4.9-9.1) correct pre-test answers were changed incorrectly. For 40% (35.4-43.6) of scenarios, incorrect pre-test answers were not rectified following system use. Despite significant differences in professional groups' pre-test scores [family practitioners The use of an online information retrieval system was associated with a significant improvement in the quality of answers provided by clinicians to typical clinical problems. In a small proportion of cases, use of the system produced errors. While there was variation in the performance of clinical groups when answering questions unaided, performance did not differ significantly following system use. Online information retrieval systems can be an effective tool in improving the accuracy of clinicians' answers to clinical questions.\n"}]}]}}

Adult patients with chronic anal fissure were randomly assigned to undergo lateral internal sphincterotomy to the level of the dentate line or to the level of the fissure apex. The patients were reexamined on postoperative Days 1, 7, 14, 28, and then at 2 and 12 months. The time required for relief of pain postoperatively was 2.08 +/- 1.44 days in the dentate line group, which was significantly shorter than that for the fissure apex group (4.72 +/- 4.86 days; P = 0.002). Objective healing was achieved in 23.7 percent and 17.6 percent at 14 days, 97.4 percent and 88.2 percent at 28 days, and 100 percent and 97.7 percent at 2 months in the dentate line and fissure apex groups, respectively (P > 0.05 for all comparisons). Only sphincterotomy up to the dentate line caused a significant change in anal incontinence (P = 0.016). Both groups had significantly lower anal resting pressures at 4 months postoperatively, compared with their corresponding preoperative levels (P = 0.005 and P = 0.007). The postoperative resting pressures did not differ significantly between the two groups (P = 0.273). By 12 months postoperatively, no treatment failures or recurrences were noted in the dentate line group (100 percent healing rate). In the fissure apex group, there was one nonhealing case and four recurrences, resulting in a 13.2 percent rate of treatment failure (P = 0.058). Sphincterotomy up to the dentate line provided a faster and definitive healing within the time limits of this study, but it was associated with a significant alteration in anal continence. In turn, sphincterotomy up to the fissure apex was free of significant disturbance of continence, but its healing effect was slower and it was prone to an insignificantly higher rate of treatment failure.\n \nComparison of characteristic features, radiology, management and recurrence pattern of fungal sinusitis between children and adults. A prospective study conducted in the department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh in which all the cases presenting with the features of allergic fungal sinusitis (AFS) between January 2000 and January 2005 were enrolled. These cases were divided into two groups, group 1 comprised of cases with age less than 15 years and group 2 with age more than 15 years. Detailed history, physical examination and nasal endoscopic examination and computed tomography (CT) scan of the paranasal sinuses was done in all the cases. The cases with prior history of sinonasal surgery were excluded from the study. All patients refractory to medical management were subjected to endoscopic sinus surgery. All the cases were followed up for a period ranging from 6 to 39 months to see for the recurrence. The data of both the groups was analysed statistically using chi square test. The study population comprised of 200 cases, with 68 cases in group 1 and 132 cases in group 2. The most common symptom in both the groups was presence of nasal obstruction. The children had higher incidence of having unilateral disease (46 out of 68) compared with adults, where it was 38 out of 132. The bony erosion was seen more often in group 1. Surgery was done endoscopically in all the cases. The intra orbital or intra cranial extension was seen in 58 cases of group 1 and 47 cases of group 2 (p<0.001). Recurrence was seen in 18 (15 with intraorbital and 3 with intracranial extension) cases in group 1 and 13 cases (11 with intraorbital and 2 with intracranial extension) in group 2 (p<0.005). In our study, we found a higher incidence of facial deformities, proptosis, intraorbital/intracranial extension and a higher rate of recurrence in group 1, therefore, suggesting a more aggressive nature of AFS in children than adults mandating an early diagnosis, proper management and regular follow up in these cases.\n"}]}]}}

To achieve the objective a cross-sectional design was used in three government schools of Mahmoodabad and Chanesar Goth, Jamshed Town, Karachi. Students of either gender drawn from these schools fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criteria were interviewed using a pre-coded structured questionnaire. Along with demographic data, questions regarding frequency of Chaalia and Pan Masala use, practices of this habit in friends and family and place of procurement of these substances, were inquired. Knowledge was assessed about harmful effects and its source of information. In addition, practices in relation to that knowledge were assessed. A total of 370 students were interviewed over a period of six weeks, of which 205 (55.4%) were boys. The ages of the students were between 10 and 15 years. Thirty one percent of the fathers and 62% of the mothers were uneducated. The frequency of use of any brand of Chaalia was found to be 94% and that of Pan Masala was 73.8%. Eighty five percent of them were regular users. A large majority (88%) procured the substances themselves from near their homes. Ninety five percent of the children had friends with the same habits. Eighty four percent were using the substances in full knowledge of their families. Chaalia was considered harmful for health by 96% and Pan Masala by 60%. Good taste was cited as a reason for continuing the habit by 88.5% of the children and use by friends by 57%. Knowledge about established harmful effects was variable. Knowledge about harmful effects was high in both \"daily\" and \"less than daily users\". The frequency of habits of Chaalia and Pan Masala chewing, by school children in lower socio-economic areas is extremely high. The probable reasons for this high frequency are taste, the widespread use of these substances by family members and friends, low cost and easy availability.\n \nBone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP-7) is a key protein in organogenesis and liver development. The protein has been studied in the context of liver fibrosis and regeneration. The aim of the present study was to explore any possible association between fibrosis levels (as revealed by liver biopsy) and serum BMP-7 levels. A total of 189 patients with chronic hepatitis B and 51 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. The study group contained 120 (63.5%) males and 69 (36.5%) females, and the control group contained 25 males (49.0%) and 26 females (51%). In general, serum BMP-7 values of patients were higher than those of controls (p = 0.001). Serum BMP-7 values of patients with liver fibrosis of stages 1, 2, 3, or 4 were higher than control values (all p values = 0.01), but the serum BMP-7 levels of patients with stage 5 fibrosis were similar to that of controls. Associations between fibrosis stage and the serum levels of BMP-7, ALT, HBVDNA, platelets, and albumin were all statistically significant (p = 0.001). The AUROC for the BMP-7 level in advanced stage fibrosis was found to be 0.23. The data were analyzed using the binary logistic regression analysis (backward stepwise method) and BMP-7, HBVDNA, and platelet levels were found to be risk factors associated with fibrosis (p values 0.031, 0.040, and 0.001, respectively). BMP-7 may play anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrogenic roles in the pathogenesis of chronic hepatitis B infection.\n"}]}]}}

Case studies suggest a positive effect of cervical spine treatment on tinnitus complaints in patients with CST, but no experimental studies are available. To investigate the effect of a multimodal cervical physical therapy treatment on tinnitus complaints in patients with CST. Randomized controlled trial. Patients with a combination of severe subjective tinnitus (Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) All patients received cervical physical therapy for 6 weeks (12 sessions). Patients were randomized in an immediate-start therapy group (n\u00a0=\u00a019) and a 6-week delayed-start therapy group (n\u00a0=\u00a019). TFI and NBQ-scores were documented at baseline, after the wait-and-see period in the delayed-start group, after treatment and after 6 weeks follow-up. The Global Perceived Effect (GPE) was documented at all measuring moments, except at baseline. In all patients (n\u00a0=\u00a038) TFI and NBQ-scores decreased significantly after treatment (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04 and p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

This effect was maintained in 24% of patients after follow-up at six weeks. Cervical physical therapy can have a positive effect on subjective tinnitus complaints in patients with a combination of tinnitus and neck complaints. Larger studies, using more responsive outcome measures, are however necessary to prove this effect. NCT02016313.\n \nTraditionally, tinnitus accompanied by hemifacial spasm has been considered a type of hyperactive neurovascular compression syndrome that is similar to hemifacial spasm alone because of the anatomically close relationship between the facial nerve and cochlear nerve as well as the hyperactive clinical nature. Participants were 29 subjects who presented with hemifacial spasm and neuroradiological evidence of vascular compression of the cranial (facial/cochlear) nerve. We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to estimate the activity of the cochlear nerve in patients with and without tinnitus on the ipsilateral side. We compared the difference in the latency and the ratio of the equivalent current dipole (ECD) strength between the ipsilateral and contralateral sides of the spasm and tinnitus. Cochlear nerve activity in patients with tinnitus was increased with a shorter latency (p\u2009=\u20090.016) and stronger ECD strength (p\u2009=\u20090.028) compared with patients without tinnitus. The MEG results from normal-hearing patients who had tinnitus accompanied by hemifacial spasm suggest that the hyperactivity of the auditory central nervous system may be a crucial pathophysiological factor in the generation of tinnitus in these patients. The neurovascular compression that causes sensory input from the pathologic facial nerve activity may contribute to this hyperactivity of the central auditory nervous system.\n"}]}]}}

There are very few studies which looked at detailed sputum and blood cell counts in a large cohort of asthmatics divided into inflammatory phenotypes. The purpose of this study was to analyze sputum cell counts, blood leukocytes and systemic inflammatory markers in these phenotypes, and investigate how those groups compared with healthy subjects. We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study on 833 asthmatics recruited from the University Asthma Clinic of Liege and compared them with 194 healthy subjects. Asthmatics were classified into inflammatory phenotypes. The total non-squamous cell count per gram of sputum was greater in mixed granulocytic and neutrophilic phenotypes as compared to eosinophilic, paucigranulocytic asthma and healthy subjects (p\u2009<\u20090.005). Sputum eosinophils (in absolute values and percentages) were increased in all asthma phenotypes including paucigranulocytic asthma, compared to healthy subjects (p\u2009<\u20090.005). Eosinophilic asthma showed higher absolute sputum neutrophil and lymphocyte counts than healthy subjects (p\u2009<\u20090.005), while neutrophilic asthmatics had a particularly low number of sputum macrophages and epithelial cells. All asthma phenotypes showed an increased blood leukocyte count compared to healthy subjects (p\u2009<\u20090.005), with paucigranulocytic asthmatics having also increased absolute blood eosinophils compared to healthy subjects (p\u2009<\u20090.005). Neutrophilic asthma had raised CRP and fibrinogen while eosinophilic asthma only showed raised fibrinogen compared to healthy subjects (p\u2009<\u20090.005). This study demonstrates that a significant eosinophilic inflammation is present across all categories of asthma, and that paucigranulocytic asthma may be seen as a low grade inflammatory disease.\n \nThe guidelines for asthma recommend that the use of anti-inflammatory therapy should be adapted to the severity of the disease. However, few data are available to assess the adequacy of the use of drugs and its influence on the control of asthma in 'real life'. The adequacy of the current use of anti-asthmatic medication according to the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines was assessed in a random sample of 400 asthmatics identified in the frame of the Italian Study on Asthma in Young Adults. Asthma severity was assessed using the GINA criteria; accordingly, a patient was classified as receiving inadequate treatment if his/her current use of drugs was lower than that suggested by the guidelines for the corresponding severity level. The absence of asthma attacks in the last 3 months was used as an indicator of the disease control. Fifty-five percent of the patients had persistent asthma. Overall, 48% (95% CI 41.2-54.8) of persistent asthmatics were receiving inadequate treatment, and 66% (95% CI 59.5-72.4) had not used their medication daily over the past 3 months. Persistent asthmatics who were inadequately treated had a significantly greater frequency of asthma attacks (geometric mean ratio 3.7; 95% CI 2.1-6.6) than those using an adequate dose of medication. Mild and moderate persistent asthmatics using an adequate medication regimen reported a low number of asthma attacks (median 0). At the multivariate analysis, a good control of the disease was positively associated with an adequate dose of anti-inflammatory medication (OR = 2.2; 95% CI 1.1-4.5) and was negatively associated with a later onset of asthma (OR = 0.96; 95% CI 0.93-0.99) and severe asthma (OR = 0.37; 95% CI 0.17-0.81). Despite the increase in the use of inhaled corticosteroids, half of the persistent asthmatics from the general population are using a medication regimen below their severity level. When the use of drugs follows the GINA guideline recommendations, a good control of asthma is also achievable in the daily management of the disease, particularly in the case of mild and moderate asthmatics.\n"}]}]}}

Consecutive bacteraemia isolates of S. aureus (n=244) from patients hospitalized in 25 centres in the UK and Ireland during 2005 were screened for PVL and mecA genes. PVL-positive isolates were characterized by toxin gene profiling, PFGE, spa-typing and MIC determinations for a range of antimicrobials. Four out of 244 isolates (1.6%) were PVL-positive and susceptible to oxacillin [methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA)].

Point-prevalence study. Department for Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery at the University Hospital of Uppsala, Uppsala, Sweden. Samples were obtained from 133 individuals, 18 men and 115 women, using imprints of each hand on blood agar and a swab from the nose. S. aureus isolates were identified by standard methods and typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. S. aureus was found on the hands of 16.7% of the men and 9.6% of the women, and in the noses of 33.3% of the men and 17.4% of the women. The risk ratio for S. aureus carriage on the hands with nasal carriage was 7.4 (95% confidence interval, 2.7 to 20.2; P < .001). Among the 14 HCWs carrying S. aureus on their hands, strain likeness to the nasal isolate was documented for 7 (50%). Half of the HCWs acquired S. aureus on the hands from patients or the environment and half did so by apparent self-inoculation from the nose. Regardless of the source of contamination, good compliance with hand hygiene is needed from all HCWs to protect patients from nosocomial infections. The moderate rate of S. aureus carriage on hands in this setting could be the result of the routine use of alcoholic hand antisepsis.\n"}]}]}}

During 2001-03, 1895 patients underwent primary CABG [clinical DM (CDM) in 440/1895; complete data on fB-glu for n=1375/1455]. Using pre-operative fB-glu, non-diabetics were categorized as having normal fB-glu (<5.6 mmol/L), IFG (5.6< or =fB-glu<6.1 mmol/L), or suspected DM (SDM) (> or =6.1 mmol/L). fB-glu was normal in 59%.

Cox proportional hazards models with age as time-scale were used to calculate multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios for associations between type of basal insulin and risk of overall cancer, breast cancer, and seven other cancer sites. The median follow-up was 2.67 years in patients exposed to insulin glargine. Absolute event rates for all cancer in patients exposed to glargine versus other basal insulin users were 1,622 and 1,643 per 100,000 person-years, respectively. No significant association was observed between glargine exposure and overall cancer incidence after adjustment for sex, with a hazard ratio of 0.97 (95% CI 0.87-1.07), or after additional adjustment for any other hypoglycemic agent use and duration of diabetes. No increased risk of breast cancer was observed for glargine users compared with other basal insulins users, with a fully adjusted hazard ratio of 1.08 (0.72-1.62). In a large cohort of patients newly treated by basal insulin, no increased risk of any cancer was observed in insulin glargine users compared with other basal insulin users.

This study therefore prospectively assesses the impact of position emission tomography scanning on the management of primary rectal cancer. Forty-six patients with advanced primary rectal cancer referred for consideration of adjuvant preoperative therapy underwent position emission tomography scanning. The referring physicians prospectively recorded each patient's stage following conventional imaging and the proposed treatment plan prior to position emission tomography scanning. This was then compared with subsequent stage and actual management implemented, and the appropriateness of position emission tomography-induced changes was noted by subsequent clinical follow-up. The surgical management of 36 of 46 patients (78 percent) was unchanged as a result of position emission tomography, even though position emission tomography upstaged disease in 3 of 36 cases (8 percent) and downstaged disease in 5 of 36 cases (14 percent). In 8 of 46 cases (17 percent), management was altered because of the position emission tomography scan findings, including 6 cases (13 percent) in which surgery was cancelled and 2 other cases (4 percent) in which the radiotherapy field was changed. Where available, follow-up confirmed the appropriateness of position emission tomography-induced management change in each case. Two patients had a change in therapy independent of the position emission tomography scan due to clinical circumstances. Overall tumor stage was changed following position emission tomography in 18 of 46 patients (39 percent). Position emission tomography scanning appears to accurately change the stage or appropriately alter the therapy of almost a third of patients with advanced primary rectal cancer. In view of this, we suggest that position emission tomography scanning be considered part of standard workup for such patients, particularly if neoadjuvant chemoradiation is being considered as part of primary management.\n \nCompared with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) may have additional value in the assessment of primary and recurrent cervical cancer. However, the degree of tumour uptake of (18)F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D Patients with untreated locally advanced primary or clinically curable recurrent cervical carcinoma were enrolled.

Sixteen had hyperglycaemic DM, 12 had euglycaemic DM and 191 were in the non-DM group. The diagnostic power of PET in the hyperglycaemic DM, euglycaemic DM and non-DM groups did not differ significantly with regard to the identification of either metastatic lesions (AUC, 0.967/0.947/0.925, P>0.05) or primary tumours/local recurrence (AUC, 0.950/0.938/0.979, P>0.05). Considering all DM patients, PET showed a significantly higher detection power than MRI/CT scans in respect of metastatic lesions (AUC=0.956 vs 0.824, P=0.012). In comparison with its accuracy in non-DM patients, the accuracy of PET in cervical cancer patients with mild to moderate DM was not significantly reduced.\n"}]}]}}

This study was designed to compare tidal volumes delivered by the squeezing method, physical characteristics and education and practice levels. 114 individuals trained in basic life support and bag-valve-mask ventilation participated in this study. Individual characteristics were obtained by the observer and the education and practice level were described by the subjects. Ventilation was delivered with a manual resuscitator connected to a microspirometer and volumes were measured. Subjects completed three procedures The mean (standard deviation) volumes for the one-handed method were 592.84 ml (SD 117.39), two-handed 644.24 ml (SD 144.7) and two-handed half-compression 458.31 ml (SD 120.91) (p<0.01). Tidal volume delivered by two hands was significantly greater than that delivered by one hand (r = 0.398, p<0.01). The physical aspects including hand size, volume and grip power had no correlation with the volume delivered. There were slight increases in tidal volume with education and practice, but correlation was weak (r = 0.213, r = 0.281, r = 0.131, p<0.01). The tidal volume delivered by a manual resuscitator shows large variations. There were significant differences in the volume delivered by compression methods, but physical characteristics are not a predictor of tidal volume delivery.

The method used for estimating the FiN2O is based on one employed to calculate the FiO2 obtained with a nasal cannula. We assume a tidal volume of 500 ml, a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, an inspiratory time of 1 second, an expiratory time of 2 seconds, and an anatomic reservoir volume of 50 ml. The reservoir consists of the nose, the nasopharynx, and the oropharynx. Its volume is assumed to be one-third of the anatomic dead space. It is also assumed that during the last 0.5 second of expiration, there is negligible flow of expired respiratory gases. A 6 L/min flow from the cannula will completely fill the reservoir. The FiO2 or FiN2O is then calculated by assuming that during the 1 second inspiratory time period, the gases in the anatomic reservoir that are provided by the nasal cannula and a volume of air such that the sum of the components of the tidal volume equals 500 ml are inspired. Research laboratory of a university-affiliated metropolitan medical center. The calculated FiO2 values for 100% oxygen delivered by nasal cannula agree with those determined by others. The FiN2Os estimated were directly proportional to the cannula flow rate and the fraction of N2O delivered. At the maximum total flow rate considered, 6L/min flow, with 70% N2O (remainder O2) delivered to the nasal cannula, an FiN2O of only 0.21 was estimated due to the large volume of air inspired. The FiO2 under these conditions would only be 0.23. Our analysis shows that the maximum FiN2O achievable by using a nasal cannula is limited to 0.21 even with a 6 L/min flow of 70% N2O for the defined respiratory parameters.\n"}]}]}}

Published government tobacco tax documentation and statistics published by the Chinese STMA are used to analyse the interrelations among industry profits, taxes and retail price of cigarettes in China. The 2009 excise tax increase on cigarettes in China has not translated into higher retail prices because the Chinese STMA used its policy authority to ensure that retail cigarette prices did not change. The government tax increase is being collected at both the producer and wholesale levels. As a result, the 2009 excise tax increase in China has resulted in higher tax revenue for the government and lower profits for the tobacco industry, with no increase in the retail price of cigarettes for consumers. Numerous studies have found that taxation is one of the most effective policy instruments for tobacco control. However, these findings come from countries that have market economies where market forces determine prices and influence how cigarette taxes are passed to the consumers in retail prices. China's tobacco industry is not a market economy; therefore, non-market forces and the current Chinese tobacco monopoly system determine cigarette prices. The result is that tax increases do not necessarily get passed on to the retail price.\n \nThe tobacco industry claims that illicit cigarette trade in South Africa is high and rising. This is often used as an argument not to increase the tobacco excise tax or to regulate tobacco products. To determine how the tobacco industry's estimates of the size of the illicit cigarette market have changed over time. Published media articles were obtained from South African Press Cuttings; published articles and press releases were sourced from the internet. The period of interest is 1990-2012. Between 1990 and 2012 we found 90 newspaper articles and press statements that emphasised the tobacco industry's view on illicit trade. Articles that reported on action taken against illicit trade were excluded. Between 2006 and early 2011 the Tobacco Institute of Southern Africa, a body representing the interests of large cigarette companies, reported that South Africa's illicit cigarette market share was 20%. This share increased to 25% in late 2011 and 30% in 2012. In a 2012 presentation by Tobacco Institute of Southern Africa to National Treasury the illicit market share in 2008 was indicated as 7.9%, compared with claims in that year that the illicit market share was 20%. Industry findings that the illicit market decreased in 2007 and 2008 were not reported in the press. The tobacco industry has adjusted previous estimates of the illicit trade share downwards to create the impression that illicit trade is high and rising. If previous estimates by the tobacco industry were incorrect the credibility of current estimates should be questioned.\n"}]}]}}

The procedure reports, available endoscopic photographs, and histology reports were reviewed to establish the endoscopic and histologic appearance of the esophageal mucosa. Intraepithelial cells were counted in a blind review of 42 randomly selected biopsies.

Locations of bleeding spots and nonbleeding red color signs of esophageal varices were retrospectively evaluated by endoscopic photographs, and the relationship between the location of red color signs and the risk of bleeding was evaluated. Other possible predictors for bleeding were also investigated by multivariate regression analysis. Red color signs were frequently found in the right posterior wall of the lower esophagus. However, bleeding spots of esophageal varices were more frequently seen in the right anterior side (64.0%) than in others. The positive predictor for bleeding from esophageal varices was the presence of red color sign in the right anterior wall of the esophagus, and the administration of proton pomp inhibitor was the negative predictor. Gastroesophageal acid reflex may be a risk factor of bleeding from esophageal varices. Attention should be paid to the circumferential location of red color signs in endoscopic screening of patients with esophageal varices to predict future bleeding.\n"}]}]}}

We analysed continuous glucose monitoring data to explore its prevalence. We analysed data from 89 patients with Type 1 diabetes who participated in the UK Hypoglycaemia study.

To test whether selective carotid screening is as effective as non-selective screening in detecting significant carotid disease. The case records of patients consecutively undergoing CAB were reviewed. Patients were stratified retrospectively into high- or low-risk groups according to risk factors for significant carotid stenosis and perioperative stroke Overall, 205 consecutive patients underwent preoperative carotid screening. The prevalence of significant carotid stenosis was 5.8%. Univariate analysis confirmed that PVD (P=0.005), carotid bruit (P=0.003) and diabetes mellitus (P=0.05) were significant risk factors for stenosis. Carotid stenosis was a risk factor for stroke (P=0.03). Prevalence of carotid stenosis was higher in the high-risk group (9.1%) than the low-risk group (1.2%) (P<0.05). All concomitant or staged carotid endarterectomies/CAB (5/205) and all patients who had perioperative strokes (5/205) were in the high-risk group (P=0.01). In our cohort, selective screening of patients aged >70 years, with carotid bruit, a history of cerebrovascular disease, diabetes mellitus or PVD would have reduced the screening load by 40%, with trivial impact on surgical management or neurological outcomes.\n"}]}]}}

Although a 5-day course of oral prednisone or prednisolone has become the most commonly used regimen, dexamethasone has also been used for a shorter duration (1-2 days) with potential for improvement in compliance and palatability. We reviewed the literature to determine if there is sufficient evidence that dexamethasone can be used as an effective alternative in the treatment of pediatric asthma exacerbations in the inpatient setting. A Medline search was conducted on the use of dexamethasone in the treatment of asthma exacerbations in children. The studies selected were clinical trials comparing the efficacy of dexamethasone with prednisone. Meta-analysis was performed examining physician revisitation rates and symptomatic return to baseline. Six completed pediatric clinical trials met the inclusion criteria. All of the pediatric trials found that prednisone is not superior to dexamethasone in treating mild to moderate asthma exacerbations. Meta-analysis demonstrated homogeneity between the dexamethasone and prednisone groups when examining symptomatic return to baseline and unplanned physician revisits after the initial emergency department encounter. Some studies found potential additional benefits of dexamethasone, including improved compliance and less vomiting. The current literature suggests that dexamethasone can be used as an effective alternative to prednisone in the treatment of mild to moderate acute asthma exacerbations in children, with the added benefits of improved compliance, palatability, and cost. However, more research is needed to examine the role of dexamethasone in hospitalized children.\n \nConcern over the safety of influenza vaccination in individuals with obstructive airways disease has contributed to suboptimal rates of vaccine uptake in this group. We investigated the safety of influenza vaccine in older people with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in a cohort from the UK General Practice Research Database (GPRD). A population based cohort study of 12,000 individuals with asthma or COPD from 432 general practices was conducted. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) were calculated for asthma or COPD diagnoses, prescriptions for oral corticosteroids, and acute exacerbations on the day of vaccination and on days 1-2 and 3-14 after vaccination compared with other time periods in the influenza season. The IRRs for asthma or COPD diagnoses and oral corticosteroid prescriptions were increased on the day of vaccination (for example, the IRR for oral corticosteroid prescriptions for subjects with asthma during the 1992-3 influenza season was 8.24 (95% confidence interval 5.54 to 12.26)). However, there was no consistent increase in the IRR of any of the outcomes on days 1-2 or 3-14 after vaccination, and most of these IRRs were close to 1. Rates of exacerbation were low and showed no consistent statistically significant increase during any risk periods. Older people with asthma or COPD commonly have diagnoses recorded or prescriptions for oral corticosteroids given on the day of influenza vaccination, but there is no increased risk of adverse acute outcomes in the first 2 weeks after vaccination. Our findings strongly suggest that influenza vaccination is safe in this population.\n"}]}]}}

The objective of this study was to describe the attendance rate and outcome of the Norwegian Breast Cancer Screening Program (NBCSP) in the Sami-speaking municipalities and a control group. A retrospective registry-based study. The 8 municipalities included in the administration area of the Sami language law (Sami) were matched with a control group of 11 municipalities (non-Sami). Population data were accessed from Statistics Norway. Data regarding invitations and outcome in the NBCSP during the period 2001-2010 was derived from the Cancer Registry of Norway (CRN). The NBCSP targets women aged 50-69 years. Rates and percentages were compared using chi-square test with a p-value<0.05 as statistical significant. The attendance rate in the NBCSP was 78% in the Sami and 75% in the non-Sami population (p< 0.01). The recall rates were 2.4 and 3.3% in the Sami and non-Sami population, respectively (p<0.01). The rate of invasive screen detected cancer was not significantly lower in the Sami group (p=0.14). The percentage of all breast cancers detected in the NBCSP among the Sami (67%) was lower compared with the non-Sami population (86%, p=0.06). Despite a lower risk of breast cancer, the Sami attended the NBCSP more frequently than the control group. The recall and cancer detection rate was lower among the Sami compared with the non-Sami group.\n \nThe aim was to determine what effect the offer of a cervical smear test when attending for breast screening has on the uptake of cervical and breast screening. The study involved randomisation to compare uptake in those women invited for cervical screening in advance with their breast screening invitation (group 1) with those invited for breast screening only and then offered a smear test upon arrival for breast screening (group 2). The main outcome measure was improvement in the uptake of cervical screening among older women without detriment to the breast screening service. The study took place at the Northern Hospital in North Manchester. Participants were 2131 women aged 50-64 years invited for breast screening at the Northern Hospital in the summer of 1990. Overall, 54% of the women who were eligible attended for breast screening, 52% attended from group 1 and 55% from group 2. Of those attending for breast screening, 957 were eligible for cervical screening and 193 (20%) had a smear test. There was a difference in the proportion tested from each group (p < 0.001), 28% had a smear test from group 1 and 13% from group 2. Forty five percent of the 193 had not had a cervical smear for at least five years. The cervical screening facility did attract some women who were overdue for a smear test and who might not normally have attended for cervical screening, and there was no evidence to suggest that it had a detrimental effect on the breast screening uptake. An advanced cervical screening invitation seemed preferable to an invitation upon arrival at the breast screening unit.\n"}]}]}}

This can be done either (i) acutely during the clamp study using high-dose insulin infusion, or (ii) slowly overnight preceding the clamp study using a low-dose insulin infusion. We assessed whether the choice of either of these methods to obtain euglycaemia biases subsequent assessment of glucose metabolism and insulin action. We studied seven obese Type 2 diabetic patients twice Basal plasma glucose levels (mean +/- sd) were 5.5 +/- 0.5 and 10.7 +/- 2.9 mmol/l in the + ON and - ON studies, respectively, and were clamped at -5.5 mmol/l. Basal rates of glucose production (GP) were similar in the + ON and - ON studies, 83 +/- 13 vs. 85 +/- 14 mg m-2 min-1 (NS), whereas basal rates of glucose disappearance (Rd) were lower in the + ON than in the - ON study, 84 +/- 8 vs. 91 +/- 11 mg m-2 min-1 (P = 0.02). During insulin infusion in the clamp period, rates of GP, 23 +/- 11 vs. 25 +/- 10 mg m-2 min-1, as well as rates of Rd, 133 +/- 32 vs. 139 +/- 37 mg m-2 min-1, were similar in the + ON and - ON studies, respectively (NS). Apart from basal rates of Rd, assessment of glucose turnover rates in euglycaemic clamp studies of Type 2 diabetic patients is not dependent on the method by which plasma glucose levels are lowered.\n"}]}]}}

To explore the predictive accuracy of these instruments. The design was interviews of patients, audio recordings of the consultation and interviews of the doctors, in varied primary care practices in England. Participants were patients who were likely to discuss a medication issue. The outcome measures were judgements of appropriateness made by the researchers and by two instruments From 35 cases there was agreement between the judges and the instruments in 22 cases, 16 were appropriate and 6 inappropriate. Of 10 cases classified as inappropriate by the instruments the judges thought four were appropriate. Of 18 cases classified as appropriate by the instruments, two were considered inappropriate by the judges. In seven cases the prescribing decisions could not be classified by the instruments because the decision was to not prescribe. Current measures of appropriateness of prescribing depend predominantly on pharmacological criteria, and so do not represent cases that would be judged appropriate when including the patient's views and contextual factors. If most prescribing is appropriate then use of these measures may lead to more false negatives than real negatives. The instruments should be renamed as measures of 'pharmacological appropriateness' and are useful where the incidence of this type of inappropriate prescribing is relatively high.\n \nLittle is known about the validity and reliability of expert assessments of the quality of antimicrobial prescribing, despite their importance in antimicrobial stewardship. We investigated how infectious disease doctors' assessments compared with a reference standard (modal expert opinion) and with the assessments of their colleagues. Twenty-four doctors specialized in infectious diseases or clinical microbiology (16 specialists and 8 residents) from five hospitals were asked to assess the appropriateness of antimicrobial agents prescribed for a broad spectrum of indications in 56 paper cases. They were instructed how to handle guideline applicability and deviations. We created a reference standard of antimicrobial appropriateness using the modal assessment of 16 specialists. We calculated criterion validity and interrater and intrarater overall and specific agreement with an index expert (senior infectious disease physician) and analysed the influence of doctor characteristics on validity. Specialists agreed with the reference standard in 80% of cases (range 75%-86%), with a sensitivity and specificity of 75% and 84%, respectively. This did not differ by clinical specialty, hospital or years of experience, and residents had similar results. Specialists agreed with the index expert in 76% of cases and the index expert agreed with his previous assessments in 71% of cases. Doctors specialized in infectious diseases and clinical microbiology assess the appropriateness of antimicrobials prescribed for a broad spectrum of indications with acceptable agreement and validity, regardless of their experience or hospital of employment.

After prostatectomy, patients were evaluated at 6-month intervals for biochemical evidence of recurrence, defined as a prostate-specific antigen level of 0.5 ng/mL or greater. Patients with a prior benign biopsy had more favorable pathologic features with more organ-confined (74% versus 64%; P <0.001) and less margin-positive (9.8% versus 18%) disease. Only 24 patients (12%) in the study group (versus 20% in control group; P = 0.01) had eventual evidence of biochemical failure.

Cycloplegic refraction (from 3 to 4 drops of 1% cyclopentolate to ensure abolition of the light reflex) was measured by both autorefraction and retinoscopy. Refractive errors were defined as followed The mean spherical equivalent refractive error was at least +1.22 D for all ages and both genders. The prevalence of myopia for any definition at any age was at most 2.5%, and lower in most cases. In contrast, the prevalence of hyperopia was generally over 20%, and declined slightly with age. The prevalence of astigmatism was between 6% and 11%. There was very little change in refractive error with age over this age range. Previous reports of less hyperopic mean spherical equivalent refractive error, and more myopia and less hyperopia in children of this age may be due to problems with achieving adequate cycloplegia in children with dark irises. Using up to 4 drops of 1% cyclopentolate may be necessary to accurately measure refractive error in paediatric studies of such children. Our results suggest that children from all ethnic groups may follow a similar pattern of early refractive development, with little myopia and a hyperopic mean spherical equivalent over +1.00 D up to the age of 5-6 years in most conditions.\n \nThe objective of this randomized prospective study was to determine whether a urinary catheter is necessary for all patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia. Consecutive patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia were randomized to treatment with or without insertion of an indwelling urinary catheter. All patients received spinal anesthesia with 15 to 30 mg of 0.5% bupivacaine. The catheter group was subjected to a standard postoperative protocol, with removal of the indwelling catheter within forty-eight hours postoperatively. The experimental group was monitored for urinary retention and, if necessary, had straight catheterization up to two times prior to the placement of an indwelling catheter. Two hundred patients were included in the study. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the prevalence of urinary retention, the prevalence of urinary tract infection, or the length of stay. Nine patients in the no-catheter group and three patients in the catheter group (following removal of the catheter) required straight catheterization because of urinary retention. Three patients in the catheter group and no patient in the no-catheter group had development of urinary tract infection. Patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia appear to be at low risk for urinary retention. Thus, a routine indwelling catheter is not required for such patients.\n"}]}]}}

As in other chronic liver diseases, the presence of hepatocellular carcinoma in a patient with primary sclerosing cholangitis undergoing evaluation for orthotopic liver transplantation would clearly impact on the candidacy, diagnostic evaluation, and alternative treatment options. Thus, the aim of our study was to determine the prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients undergoing liver transplantation for primary sclerosing cholangitis. The records of the 520 patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation at our institution between 1985 and May 1995 were reviewed. Of the 134 patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis, three (2%) had hepatocellular carcinoma. In the 386 patients without primary sclerosing cholangitis undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation, 22 (6%) had hepatocellular carcinoma. Neither the duration of primary sclerosing cholangitis (range 7-23 years) nor the presence of ulcerative colitis (two of three patients) distinguished those patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis plus hepatocellular carcinoma from those with primary sclerosing cholangitis alone. None of the three patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis plus hepatocellular carcinoma had evidence for hepatitis B or C, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, or hemochromatosis. None of the tumors was of the fibrolamellar variety of hepatocellular carcinoma. The prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation is 2%. These data suggest that patients with advanced cirrhotic-stage primary sclerosing cholangitis are at increased risk for developing hepatocellular carcinoma and should be screened for hepatocellular carcinoma as well as for cholangiocarcinoma prior to orthotopic liver transplantation.\n"}]}]}}

We compared government records and self-reports of motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions in a sample of stroke survivors. The 56 participants were originally recruited for a prospective study on driving and community re-integration post-stroke; the study population consisted of moderately impaired stroke survivors without severe communication disorders who had been referred for a driving assessment. The driving records of the 56 participants for the 5 years before study entry and the 1-year study period were acquired with written consent from the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO), Canada. Self-reports of collisions and convictions were acquired via a semistructured interview and then compared with the MTO records. Forty-three participants completed the study. For 7 (13.5%) the MTO records did not match the self-reports regarding collision involvement, and for 9 (17.3%) the MTO records did not match self-reports regarding driving convictions. The kappa coefficient for the correlation between MTO records and self-reports was 0.52 for collisions and 0.47 for convictions (both in the moderate range of agreement). When both sources of data were consulted, up to 56 percent more accidents and up to 46 percent more convictions were identified in the study population in the 5 years before study entry compared to when either source was used alone. In our population of stroke survivors, self-reports of motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions differed from government records. In future studies, the use of both government and self-reported data would ensure a more accurate picture of driving safety post-stroke.\n \nESC (Electronic Stability Control) is a crash avoidance technology that reduces the likelihood of collisions involving loss of control. Although past and emerging research indicates that ESC is effective in reducing collision rates and saving lives, and its inclusion in all vehicle platforms is encouraged, drivers may demonstrate behavioral adaptation or an overreliance on ESC that could offset or reduce its overall effectiveness. The main objective of the present study was to determine whether behavioral adaptation to ESC is likely to occur upon the widespread introduction of ESC into the Canadian vehicle fleet. Secondary objectives were to confirm the results of a previous ESC public survey and to generate a baseline measure for the future assessment of planned and ongoing ESC promotional activities in Canada. Two separate telephone surveys evaluated drivers' perceptions and awareness of ESC. The first surveyed 500 randomly selected owners/drivers of passenger vehicles. The second surveyed 1017 owners/drivers of 2006-2008 ESC-equipped passenger vehicles from the provinces of Quebec and British Columbia, Canada. Though ESC drivers were much more likely than drivers of other vehicles to be aware of ESC (77% vs. 39%) and that their own vehicle was equipped with it (63% vs. 8%), 23 percent had never heard of it. Ninety percent of drivers who knew that their vehicle was equipped with ESC believed that ESC had made it safer to drive and reported being confident that ESC would work in an emergency. Twenty-three percent of ESC owners who knew their vehicle had ESC reported noticing long-lasting changes in their driving behavior since they began driving the vehicle. Collectively, results suggest that behavioral adaptation to ESC is likely in certain drivers; however, its proven effectiveness in reducing the likelihood of being involved in a serious crash probably outweighs any potential increases in unsafe driving. To fully benefit from ESC, vehicle manufacturers are encouraged to market ESC-equipped vehicles in a realistic, safe manner. Driver training and safety organizations are also encouraged to provide balanced educational information about ESC to their members.\n"}]}]}}

This study aimed to assess whether a similar outcome can be achieved by delivering retraining to patients in small groups, allowing considerable savings in the use of resources. Data were collected prospectively in a pelvic floor database. Patients received pelvic floor retraining either individually or in a small group setting and completed baseline and follow-up questionnaires. Two hundred and fifteen patients were treated, 119 individually and 96 in a small group setting. Scores before and after treatment for the two settings were compared for the Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index, the Fecal Incontinence Severity Index and the Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptoms. Additionally patients receiving group treatment completed a short questionnaire on their experience. The median change in Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index score was 5 (range -62 to 73) for individual treatment and 4 (range -41 to 47) for group treatment, both showing statistically significant improvement. However, there was no significant difference between the settings. Similar results were obtained with the Fecal Incontinence Severity Index and Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptoms scores for the faecal incontinence and obstructed defaecation subgroups respectively. The majority of patients experienced symptomatic improvement following pelvic floor retraining and there was no significant difference in the resulting improvement according to treatment setting.

We present a series of five cases of microsporidial keratitis from a single centre in southern India with microbiologic and histopathologic features. Patient charts of five cases of microsporidial stromal keratitis diagnosed between January 2002 and June 2004 were reviewed retrospectively for clinical data, microbiologic and histopathologic data. The presence of microsporidia was confirmed by special stains on corneal scrapings and/or corneal tissues, and electron microscopy. All patients were immunocompetent with a preceding history of trauma in three. Four patients presented with unilateral, small, persisting deep stromal infiltrates, of uncertain etiology, in the cornea, which were not responding to conventional antimicrobial treatment and required penetrating keratoplasty in three. Fifth case was unsuspected and underwent keratoplasty for post-traumatic scar. Three of five cases were diagnosed on corneal scrapings, prior to keratoplasty, while two were diagnosed only on histology. The microsporidia appeared as oval well defined bodies with dense staining at one pole. None of the patients showed recurrence following keratoplasty. Microsporidia, though rare, should be suspected in chronic culture-negative stromal keratitis. Organisms could lie dormant without associated inflammation.\n"}]}]}}

Nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR), which play a central role in lipid and glucose metabolism, had been hypothesized as being involved in colon cancerogenesis. In animal studies the lipid-lowering PPAR ligand bezafibrate suppressed colonic tumors. However, the effect of bezafibrate on colon cancer development in humans is unknown. Therefore, we proposed to investigate a possible preventive effect of bezafibrate on the development of colon cancer in patients with coronary artery disease during a 6-year follow-up. Our population included 3011 patients without any cancer diagnosis who were enrolled in the randomized, double blind Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention (BIP) Study. The patients received either 400 mg of bezafibrate retard (1506 patients) or placebo (1505 patients) once a day. Cancer incidence data were obtained by matching a subject's identification numbers with the National Cancer Registry. Each matched record was checked for correct identification.

The polymorphic N-acetyltransferase 2 enzyme (NAT2, E.C. 2.3.1.5) plays a key role in the transformation of HAAs to ultimate carcinogens. NAT2 enzyme activity is expressed in a genotype-dependent manner in colon epithelium. Therefore local activation of HAAs in colon, and hence increased risk to develop colon cancer, is likely to be related to high NAT2 enzyme activity. This study is aimed at analysing the association between genotypes leading to high NAT2 activity and colorectal cancer risk. Genomic DNA from 120 colorectal cancer patients and 258 healthy individuals were analysed for enzyme-inactivating mutations at the coding region of the NAT2 gene by means of a mutation-specific polymerase chain reaction. Among patients with sigmoid colon cancer, a significant excess of individuals with genotypes leading to high NAT2 activity was observed as compared both to controls and to the rest of patients with colorectal cancer (P < 0.05). Our findings, which require independent confirmation, suggest that the NAT2 genotype constitutes a secondary risk factor to develop sigmoid colon cancer.\n"}]}]}}

Although there is evidence for the influential role of transformational leadership on health outcomes, researchers have used either attitude outcomes (e.g. job satisfaction) or softer health measures, such as general well-being. Specific measures of well-being such as sleep quality have not been used, despite its association with working conditions. A longitudinal design was used to collect data from Danish healthcare workers at time 1 in 2005 (n = 447) and 18 months later at time 2 in 2007 (n = 274). Structural equation modelling was used to investigate the relationships between transformational leadership, self-efficacy and sleep quality at both time points independently (cross-sectionally) and longitudinally. For all constructs, time 2 measures were influenced by the baseline level. Direct relationships between transformational leadership and sleep quality were found. This relationship was negative cross-sectionally at both time points, but positive between baseline and follow-up. The relationship between leadership and employees' sleep quality was not mediated by employees' self-efficacy. Our results indicate that training managers in transformational leadership behaviours may have a positive impact on healthcare workers' health over time. However, more research is needed to examine the mechanisms by which transformational leadership brings about improved sleep quality; self-efficacy was not found to be the explanation.\n \nTo compare the effects of 800 mg of valerian with a placebo on sleep quality and symptom severity in people with restless legs syndrome (RLS). A prospective, triple-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel design was used to compare the efficacy of valerian with placebo on sleep quality and symptom severity in patients with RLS. Thirty-seven participants were randomly assigned to receive 800 mg of valerian or placebo for 8 weeks. The primary outcome of sleep was sleep quality with secondary outcomes including sleepiness and RLS symptom severity. Data were collected at baseline and 8 weeks comparing use of valerian and placebo on sleep disturbances (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Epworth Sleepiness Scale) and severity of RLS symptoms (International RLS Symptom Severity Scale) from 37 participants aged 36 to 65 years. Both groups reported improvement in RLS symptom severity and sleep. In a nested analysis comparing sleepy vs nonsleepy participants who received 800 mg ofvalerian (n=17), significant differences before and after treatment were found in sleepiness (P=.01) and RLS symptoms (P=.02). A strong positive association between changes in sleepiness and RLS symptom severity was found (P=.006). The results of this study suggest that the use of 800 mg of valerian for 8 weeks improves symptoms of RLS and decreases daytime sleepiness in patients that report an Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score of 10 or greater. Valerian may be an alternative treatment for the symptom management ofRLS with positive health outcomes and improved quality of life.\n"}]}]}}

Cystic neoplasms of the pancreas present a significant diagnostic dilemma in differentiating benign from premalignant or malignant variants. Since the first description of lymphoepithelial cysts in 1985, 109 cases have been reported in the literature. We describe 6 cases of this rare tumor, the preoperative imaging results, and a review the literature. Five males and one female ranging in age from 47 to 76 years underwent resection for lymphoepithelial cysts. Five patients presented with abdominal pain related to the lesion and in one patient the lesion was discovered incidentally. Four patients had elevated serum CA 19-9 levels. Pre-operative imaging with a CT scan and MRI of the abdomen typically revealed a well defined hypodense mass with Hounsfield units (HU) in the range of 15 to 20. One patient had papillary projections into the lesion. The mean size was 3.3 cm (ranging from 1.8 cm to 4 cm). All lesions were exophytic off the pancreatic parenchyma (1 cyst was located in the head of the pancreas, 2 were in the body, and 3 were in the tail region). Pre-operative EUS-guided/CT-guided needle aspiration, when performed, was not diagnostic. All patients underwent resection (one pancreaticoduodenectomy, five left pancreatectomies) to remove these cystic neoplasms. Pathology revealed a cyst lined by non-dysplastic squamous cells surrounded by sheets of benign lymphocytes. No evidence of malignancy was found. Lymphoepithelial cysts of the pancreas are rare and are characteristically seen in men. While a hypodense mass (less than 20 HU) with papillary projections should be considered suspicious for lymphoepithelial cyst, a definitive diagnosis cannot be made solely based on preoperative imaging. EUS-guided biopsy coupled with biochemical/tumor marker studies are increasingly being used as a diagnostic tool to help differentiate between the various types of cystic pancreatic neoplasms. Imaging findings of lymphoepithelial cysts are non-specific and hence surgical resection is often required to rule out the presence of a malignant or pre-malignant cystic pancreatic lesion. In true lymphoepithelial cysts, malignant transformation is not seen and patients who have these cysts are not at increased risk of developing a pancreatic malignancy.\n"}]}]}}

About 3/4 of the doctors would prescribe tamoxifen in older ER+ women and 30%-40% in post-menopausal ER-patients, but only 2/5 would do so in younger ER+ women. The vast majority of physicians considered five years as standard for ER+ patients. Nevertheless, about 1/4 of the doctors chose a shorter treatment duration for node-negative, pre-menopausal patients. A minority of physicians used tamoxifen for longer than five years. Older clinicians were less likely to prescribe tamoxifen, particularly for low-risk patients. According to the data of the recent EBCTG overview, an additional 20,000 lives could be saved worldwide each year if tamoxifen were given to all early breast cancer patients with hormone-sensitive disease, irrespective of age and disease stage, and for a minimum of five years. Our study, involving a representative sample of physicians practicing in Italy, shows that tamoxifen is not used optimally, with a substantial under-use in younger women and women with node-negative disease.\n"}]}]}}

Fundectomy was indicated when a residual fundus/neofundus was associated with severe GERD symptoms. The presence of a residual fundus/neofundus was assessed by a barium swallow and/or multislice computed tomography. No mortality or intra-operative complications occurred. Five postoperative complications occurred LF and cruroplasty is feasible and has good results in terms of GERD symptoms control and additional weight loss.

Appropriate care requires accurate physician estimates of severity. It is unknown if accuracy of physician estimates differs between black and white patients, and how this relates to asthma care disparities. We hypothesized that We conducted a cross-sectional survey among adult patients with asthma cared for in 15 managed care organizations in the United States. We collected physicians' estimates of their patients' asthma severity. Physicians' estimates of patients' asthma as being less severe than patient-reported symptoms were classified as underestimates of severity. Frequency of underestimation, asthma care, and communication. Three thousand four hundred and ninety-four patients participated (13% were black). Blacks were significantly more likely than white patients to have their asthma severity underestimated (OR = 1.39, 95% CI 1.08-1.79). Among black patients, underestimation was associated with less use of daily inhaled corticosteroids (13% vs 20%, p < .05), less physician instruction on management of asthma flare-ups (33% vs 41%, p < .0001), and lower ratings of asthma care (p = .01) and physician communication (p = .04). Biased estimates of asthma severity may contribute to racially disparate asthma care. Interventions to improve physicians' assessments of asthma severity and patient-physician communication may minimize racial disparities in asthma care.\n \nThe guidelines for asthma recommend that the use of anti-inflammatory therapy should be adapted to the severity of the disease. However, few data are available to assess the adequacy of the use of drugs and its influence on the control of asthma in 'real life'. The adequacy of the current use of anti-asthmatic medication according to the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines was assessed in a random sample of 400 asthmatics identified in the frame of the Italian Study on Asthma in Young Adults. Asthma severity was assessed using the GINA criteria; accordingly, a patient was classified as receiving inadequate treatment if his/her current use of drugs was lower than that suggested by the guidelines for the corresponding severity level. The absence of asthma attacks in the last 3 months was used as an indicator of the disease control. Fifty-five percent of the patients had persistent asthma. Overall, 48% (95% CI 41.2-54.8) of persistent asthmatics were receiving inadequate treatment, and 66% (95% CI 59.5-72.4) had not used their medication daily over the past 3 months. Persistent asthmatics who were inadequately treated had a significantly greater frequency of asthma attacks (geometric mean ratio 3.7; 95% CI 2.1-6.6) than those using an adequate dose of medication. Mild and moderate persistent asthmatics using an adequate medication regimen reported a low number of asthma attacks (median 0). At the multivariate analysis, a good control of the disease was positively associated with an adequate dose of anti-inflammatory medication (OR = 2.2; 95% CI 1.1-4.5) and was negatively associated with a later onset of asthma (OR = 0.96; 95% CI 0.93-0.99) and severe asthma (OR = 0.37; 95% CI 0.17-0.81). Despite the increase in the use of inhaled corticosteroids, half of the persistent asthmatics from the general population are using a medication regimen below their severity level. When the use of drugs follows the GINA guideline recommendations, a good control of asthma is also achievable in the daily management of the disease, particularly in the case of mild and moderate asthmatics.\n"}]}]}}

Minimally invasive techniques in foregut surgery have been suggested to cause less tissue trauma. We examined the factors associated with new-onset atrial fibrillation after foregut surgery at our institution. We retrospectively examined the records of 154 adult patients who underwent major foregut surgery which included esophagectomy, partial or total gastrectomy, redo Heller myotomy, redo or transthoracic fundoplications. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis with standard modeling techniques were performed to determine risk factors for new-onset atrial fibrillation. Of the 154 patients, 14 patients developed new-onset atrial fibrillation with a higher mean age of 67.1 years (+/-8.8 years) versus 56.4 years (+/-14.1 years) (p = 0.006). Laparoscopic (p = 0.004) and nonthoracic surgeries (p = 0.01) were associated with lower risk of atrial fibrillation. Patients with atrial fibrillation had received more fluid (6.5 +/- 2.8 liters versus 5.3 +/- 2.0 liters) and had longer operations (370 +/- 103 min versus 362 +/- 142 min), none of which were statistically significant. The average intensive care length of stay of patients was longer Laparoscopic surgery is associated with lower risk of atrial fibrillation in foregut surgery. Development of atrial fibrillation is associated with increased length of intensive care stay. We recommend a prospective trial to confirm our findings.\n \nLaparoscopic surgery is associated with well-known benefits, one of which is earlier return of bowel function. Since the laparoscopic approach to colon resections was introduced in the early 1990s, it has become the standard of care. Hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery (HALS) is a surgical approach in which dissection is facilitated by the surgeon's hand within the abdominal cavity during laparoscopy. The purpose of this study was to compare the incidence of postoperative ileus and the need for nasogastric tube (NGT) decompression in patients undergoing elective colon resections. Following institutional review board approval, we performed a retrospective review of a prospectively collected database. Included were patients who underwent elective left-sided large bowel resections between 2009 and 2012. Exclusion criteria were urgent operation, stoma creation, ASA IV classification, NGT left in place at the end of surgery, and postoperative anastomotic leakage. Patients were divided into three groups A total of 243 patients were included in this study; 73 patients underwent open surgery, 89 patients underwent HALS, and 81 patients underwent laparoscopic surgery. The proportion of patients who needed postoperative nasogastric decompression was significantly reduced in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery (3.7%) or HALS (4.5%) compared with those who underwent open resection (17.8%). The time from surgery to first flatus and first bowel movement, the time to tolerate solid diet, and the total length of postoperative hospital stay also were all significantly reduced in the laparoscopic and HALS groups compared with the open surgery group. There were no significant differences in any of these measures between the laparoscopic group and the hand-assisted group. Like laparoscopy, HALS is associated with less postoperative ileus and necessitates less NGT decompression than does open surgery.\n"}]}]}}

The authors analyzed 739 critiques-268 from 88 unfunded and 471 from 153 funded applications for grants awarded to 125 PIs (76 males, 49 females) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison between 2010 and 2014.

However, it is not known whether even occasional victimization has similar negative consequences and whether protective factors such as social support may prevent those harmful developments. The present study therefore focuses on the nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) and suicidal behavior (SB) in victims of bullying and the potentially moderating effect of parental monitoring. In all, a cross-sectional sample of 647 adolescents (mean age 12.8 years) were surveyed concerning bullying experiences, NSSI and SB, and parental monitoring. A total of 14.4% of respondents reported being a victim of frequent bullying in the past few months (with verbal and social bullying playing the most important role), which increased the risks of both NSSI (OR\u2009=\u200911.75) and SB (OR\u2009=\u20096.08). This relationship could also be shown for occasional victims of bullying (35.6%), although to a lesser extent. Parental monitoring had a significant protective effect on SB in victims of occasional bullying. However, parental monitoring did not show any protective effect in victims of repetitive bullying. Victims of bullying show a substantial risk for engaging in self-harm behavior. Therefore, the dissemination of anti-bullying programs in schools would probably also prevent such disorders. Parental participation in school-based prevention may increase its effect; this also matches the results of the present study, showing that parental monitoring may be able to buffer the negative effects of bullying victimization, at least to a certain degree.\n"}]}]}}

This study compared recognition of symbolic representation of emotions or movements in music by two groups of children with different communicative characteristics Participants listened to recorded musical excerpts conveying emotions or movements and matched them with labels. Measures relevant to auditory and/or language function were also gathered. There was no significant difference between the ASD and TD-NH groups in identification of musical emotions or movements.

To determine the hemodynamic effect due to lung IR injury, we performed a quantitative coronary blood-flow analysis in a swine model of in situ lung ischemia and reperfusion. In 14 healthy pigs, blood flow was measured in the ascending aorta, left anterior descending (LAD), circumflex (Cx), right coronary artery (RCA), right common carotid artery (RCCA), and left internal mammary artery (LIMA), along with left-and right-ventricular pressures (LVP and RVP), aortic pressure (AoP), and pulmonary artery pressure (PAP). Cardiac Troponin (cTn), interleukin 6 and 10 (IL-6 and IL-10), and tumor necrosis factor A (TNF-A) were measured in coronary sinus blood samples. The experimental (IR) group (n=10) underwent 60 min of lung ischemia followed by 60 min of reperfusion by clamping and releasing the left pulmonary hilum. Simultaneous measurements of all parameters were made at baseline and during IR. The control group (n=4) had similar measurements without lung IR. In the IR group, total coronary flow (TCF=LAD+Cx+RCA blood-flow) decreased precipitously and significantly from baseline (113\u00b141 ml min\"1) during IR (p<0.05), with the lowest value observed at 60 min of reperfusion (-37.1%, p<0.003). Baseline cTn (0.08\u00b10.02 ng ml(-1)) increased during IR and peaked at 45 min of reperfusion (+138%, p<0.001). Baseline IL-6 (9.2\u00b12.17 pg ml(-1)) increased during IR and peaked at 60 min of reperfusion (+228%, p<0.0001). Significant LVP drop at 5 min of ischemia (p<0.05) was followed by a slow return to baseline at 45 min of ischemia. A second LVP drop occurred at reperfusion (p<0.05) and persisted. Conversely, RVP increased throughout ischemia (p<0.05) and returned toward baseline during reperfusion. Coronary blood flow and hemodynamic profile remained unchanged in the control group. IL-10 and TNF-A remained below the measurable range for both the groups. In situ lung IR has a marked negative impact on coronary blood flow, hemodynamics, and inflammatory profile. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study where coronary blood flow is directly measured during lung IR, revealing the associated increased cardiac risk.\n \nBeta-adrenergic blocking agents are the cornerstone in the treatment of coronary artery disease (CAD). The exact pathophysiologic mechanism is not clear but depends largely on the oxygen-sparing effect of the drug. Thus, the effect of metoprolol on coronary flow reserve and coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR) was determined in patients with CAD. Coronary blood flow velocity was measured with the Doppler flow wire in 23 patients (age Rate-pressure product decreased after metoprolol from 9.1 to 8.0 x 10(3) mm Hg/min (p < 0.001). Pharmacologic CFVR was 2.1 at rest and increased after metoprolol to 2.7 (p = 0.002). Likewise, postischemic CFVR increased from 2.6 to 3.3 (p < 0.001). Postischemic CFVR was significantly higher than pharmacologic CFVR before as well as after metoprolol. Coronary vascular resistance decreased after metoprolol from 3.4 +/- 2.0 to 2.3 +/- 0.7 mm Hg x s/cm (p < 0.02). The following conclusions were drawn from this study. Metoprolol is associated with a significant increase in postischemic and pharmacologic CFVR. However, postischemic CFVR is significantly higher than pharmacologic CFVR. The increase in CFVR by metoprolol can be explained by a reduction in vascular resistance. The increase in CFVR (= increased supply) and the reduction in oxygen consumption (= decreased demand) after metoprolol explain the beneficial effect of this beta-blocker in patients with CAD.\n"}]}]}}

We examined the ethical implications of cold calling in a study of subjects with defined neurotic disorders followed up 12 years after initial assessment carried out to determine outcome in terms of symptoms, social functioning, and contact with health services. The patients concerned were asked at original assessment if they would agree to be followed up subsequently and although they agreed no time limit was put on this. To decide if cold calling was ethically justifiable and, if so, to set guidelines for researchers. The study was a cohort study of patients with neurotic disorder treated initially for 10 weeks in a randomised controlled trial. At follow up by a research medical practitioner 18 of the 210 patients had died and of the remaining 192 patients 186 (97%) were seen or had a telephone interview. Four patients refused and two others did not have interviews but agreed to some data being obtained. However, only 104 patients (54%) responded to letters inviting them to make an appointment or to refuse contact and the remainder were followed up by cold calling, with most patients agreeing readily to the research interview. The findings illustrate the dilemma of the need to get the maximum possible data from such studies to achieve scientific validity (and thereby justify the ethics of the study) and the protection of subjects' privacy and autonomy. More attention needs to be paid to consent procedures if cold calling is to be defended on ethical grounds but it is unreasonable to expect this to be obtained at the beginning of a research study in a way that satisfies the requirements for informed consent. A suggested way forward is to obtain written consent for the research at the time that cold calling takes place before beginning the research.\n \nThe aim of the study was to investigate trends in cancer prognosis by examining the relationship between period of diagnosis and probability of death from cancer in a population-based cohort. Within a cohort of Japanese men and women aged 40-69 years and free of prior diagnosis of cancer and cardiovascular disease at baseline, data from 4403 patients diagnosed with cancer between 1990 and 2006 and followed up until 2012 were analyzed using survival regression models to assess the presence of an effect of the period of diagnosis (before 1998 versus after 1998) on the risk of dying from cancer. We noted a significant decrease in risk of dying from cancer among individuals diagnosed after 1998 with lung cancer (hazard ratio [HR]=0.676 [0.571-0.800]) or colorectal cancer (HR=0.801 [0.661-0.970]). A decrease in the estimated five-year probability of death from cancer was also noted between the first (before 1998) and the second (after 1998) period of diagnosis for lung and colorectal cancers (e.g., 85.4% vs. 73.3% for lung cancer and 44.6% vs. 37.7% for colorectal cancer, respectively, for stage III in men aged 60 at diagnosis). This study presented the first scientific evidence of improvement in prognosis for lung and colorectal cancer patients in a population-based cohort in Japan. Our results suggest that recent advances in cancer treatment could have influenced cancer survival differently among lung, colorectal and gastric cancers.\n"}]}]}}

As resorption of foetal lung fluid is a catecholamine dependent process, we aimed at investigating, whether beta1- and beta2-adrenoreceptor (ADRB1, ADRB2) polymorphisms, known to alter catecholamine activity, are operative in TTN. DNA was collected for genotyping from 73 term newborns suffering from TTN and 55 healthy controls from a Caucasian cohort. TTN infants were more likely to be male (70% vs. 49%; p < 0.05), had a lower mean birthweight (3120 +/- 450 vs. 3396 +/- 504 g; p < 0.001) and gestational age (GA) (38.4 +/- 1.2 vs. 39.4 +/- 1.3 weeks; p < 0.001) and were more often delivered by caesarean section (CS) (71% vs. 26%; p < 0.001).

Multivariate analysis provided beta1Gly49 homozygotes with higher risk for TTN (OR 18.5; 95%CI 1.5-229; p = 0.023) than beta1Ser49 allele carrier. Further analysis showed significant association of T-47C, A46G, C79G and C491T (TACC) haplotype in ADRB2 gene with TTN (p = 0.048). We conclude that beta1Gly49 homozygosity and TACC haplotype of ADRB2 gene, both loss-of-function genetic variations, may predispose to TTN.\n \nAs the presence of a Trp64Arg polymorphism of the gene encoding the \u03b2(3)-adrenoceptor (B3AR) has been linked to the presence of overactive bladder, we investigated whether additional polymorphisms are detectable in this gene and explore their relationships parameters related to lower urinary tract function. The coding region and adjacent stretches of the B3AR gene was sequenced in 91 patients. In total, 1015 patients from a single academic hospital were genotyped for the presence of two single nucleotide polymorphisms. Symptom scores and parameters from pressure-flow studies were analyzed relative to genotype in the B3AR gene. No frequent novel polymorphisms were detected in the coding region. Five polymorphisms were found in the non-coding region of the gene but were in complete linkage with the 64Arg allele. Out of 32 parameters including bladder compliance, only prostate size was weakly (44 vs. 39\u2009mL) but significantly associated with the 64Arg allele, but was not mirrored by an association with prostate-specific antigen levels.

This study examined Dutch patients with an initial treatment episode in 2009 or 2010 in specialized mental health settings for depressive disorder (N\u00a0=\u00a085,754). Follow-up data about treatment episodes were available up until 2013.

By adding brief dynamic psychotherapy focused on the psychosocial vulnerability of patients with panic disorder to an established drug treatment regimen, we hypothesized that this would result in a lower relapse rate after pharmacotherapy. Patients with panic disorder (defined by DSM-III-R) were randomized to treatment with either clomipramine for 9 months (n = 20), or clomipramine for 9 months combined with 15 weekly sessions of brief dynamic psychotherapy (n = 20). Measures of anxiety and depression were collected at intake and at regular intervals. The patients had blind follow-up interviews at 6, 12, and 18 months after beginning treatment. All patients in both groups became free of panic attacks within 26 weeks of the start of treatment. On termination of pharmacotherapy, the relapse rate was significantly higher in the clomipramine-only group during the follow-up period. There were significantly lower scores for most anxiety measures in the clomipramine plus psychotherapy group at the 9-month follow-up. The addition of brief dynamic psychotherapy to treatment with clomipramine significantly reduces the relapse rate of panic disorder compared with clomipramine treatment alone.\n"}]}]}}

A total of 789 patients scheduled to undergo spinal surgery were randomly allocated into 2 groups The duration of anesthesia did not differ in the 2 groups (P > 0.05).

The optimal time for prosthesis placement is still unclear, and its complication rate has been poorly studied in children. The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors of complications in cases of testicular prosthesis implantation in children. A monocentric, retrospective review was performed of children implanted with a testicular prosthesis between 2008 and 2014. All implantations were performed through an inguinal incision with a standardized procedure. Children were divided into two groups depending on the interval after orchiectomy Twenty-six patients (A, 15; B, 11) had a total of 38 testicular prostheses placements. Mean follow-up was 36.2 months. First surgery was performed at the mean age of 11.8 years (range 0-17.9) (A, 14.1; B, 8.1; P\u00a0=\u00a00.01) and testicular prosthesis implantation at the mean age of 14.7 years (range 9-18) (A, 14.3; B, 14.6) with a mean delay of 36.1 months (A, 1.3; B, 80.3). Indications were mainly spermatic cord torsion (27%), bilateral anorchia (27%), and testicular atrophy after cryptorchidism surgery (19.2%). Complications (10.5%) included two cases of extrusion, one infection and one migration. Patient 1 had a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia with testicle relapse 2 years after induction therapy. High-dose chemotherapy, total body irradiation and bilateral orchiectomies were performed, and bilateral prostheses were implanted 12 years after the end of chemotherapy. Complications happened 85 days after surgery. Patient 2 was followed-up for a proximal hypospadias. The tunica vaginalis flap, which was used during a redo urethroplasty, lead to testicular atrophy. Thirteen years after the last penile surgery, a testicular prosthesis was placed through an inguinal incision, and extrusion occurred 203 days after surgery. Bacterial cultures of the prostheses were sterile and histological review showed no sign of granuloma or graft rejection. The complication rate was significantly higher if the delay between the two surgeries exceeded 1 year (P\u00a0=\u00a00.01). Indications of orchiectomy, prior scrotal incision, and prosthesis size were not risk factors. Testicular prosthesis implantation was relatively safe in a pediatric cohort. The complication rate was significantly higher if the delay between the orchiectomy and the prosthetic placement exceeded 1 year. These results suggest that reducing the delay between orchiectomy and prosthesis implantation may lead to fewer complications.\n"}]}]}}

Approval of the institutional ethical review committee was not required. This was a retrospective review of 322 computed tomographic angiographic studies that were performed in patients before they underwent elective EVAR for infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. Morphologic parameters evaluated were IMA patency, origin of the IMA in relation to the aneurysm sac, diameter of the IMA, the cross-sectional area of the contrast material-enhanced aortic lumen at the level of the IMA ostium, and the number of additional patent aortic side branches from the aneurysm sac. The association of IMA type II endoleaks with each variable was analyzed by using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models. The diameter of the IMA did not influence the development of IMA type II endoleaks (P = .51). The incidence of these endoleaks was significantly higher in patients with greater cross-sectional area of the aortic lumen at the IMA ostium (P < .001). Patients with an IMA type II endoleak had significantly more patent aortic side branches before EVAR than did patients without an endoleak (3.6 \u00b1 1.7 vs 2.2 \u00b1 1.4; P < .001). According to the final logistic regression model that included cross-sectional area of the aortic lumen at the IMA and the number of aortic side branches as independent predictors, risk for IMA type II endoleaks was determined with a sensitivity of 78% (39 of 50) and a specificity of 79% (92 of 116). Cross-sectional area of the contrast-enhanced aortic lumen at the level of the IMA ostium and the number of additional patent aortic side branches are associated with the development of IMA type II endoleaks.\n \nThe rate of aortic aneurysm rupture correlates with the aneurysm's diameter, and a higher rate of rupture is observed in patients with larger aneurysms. According to the literature, contradictory results concerning the relationship between atmospheric pressure and aneurysm size have been reported. In this paper, we assessed the influence of changes in atmospheric pressure on abdominal aneurysm ruptures in relationship to the aneurysm's size. The records of 223 patients with ruptured abdominal aneurysms were evaluated. All of the patients had been admitted to the department in the period 1997-2007 from the Silesia region. The atmospheric pressures on the day of the rupture and on the days both before the rupture and between the rupture events were compared. The size of the aneurysm was also considered in the analysis. There were no statistically significant differences in pressure between the days of rupture and the remainder of the days within an analysed period. The highest frequency of the admission of patients with a ruptured aortic aneurysm was observed during periods of winter and spring, when the highest mean values of atmospheric pressure were observed; however, this observation was not statistically confirmed. A statistically non-significant trend towards the higher rupture of large aneurysms (> 7 cm) was observed in the cases where the pressure increased between the day before the rupture and the day of the rupture. This trend was particularly pronounced in patients suffering from hypertension (p = 0.1). The results of this study do not support the hypothesis that there is a direct link between atmospheric pressure values and abdominal aortic aneurysm ruptures.\n"}]}]}}

Patient care-seeking patterns over a 6-year timeframe in Minnesota, where care systems have a significant portion of their revenue generated by shared-saving contracts with public and private payers. Weibull duration and probit models were used to examine patterns of patient attribution to a care system and the continuity of patient affiliation with a care system. Clustering of errors within family unit was used to account for within-family correlation in unobserved characteristics that affect patient loyalty. The payer provided data from health plan administrative files, matched to U.S. Census-based characteristics of the patient's neighborhood. Patients were retrospectively attributed to health care systems based on patterns of primary care. I find significant patient loyalty, with past loyalty a very strong predictor of future relationship. Relationships were shorter when the patient's health status was complex and when the patient's care system was smaller. Population health management can be beneficial to the care system making this investment, particularly for patients exhibiting prior continuity in care system choice. The results suggest that co-located primary and specialty services are important in maintaining primary care loyalty.\n"}]}]}}

Patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms have a great diversity of functional somatic symptoms. They use more somatic and psychotropic drugs than controls in the years before diagnosis.

In order for meaningful results to be extrapolated to specific populations, the limitations of the data and linkage methodology need to be investigated and clarified. It is the objective of this study to investigate the differences in ascertainment which may arise between a hospital admission dataset and a dispensing claims dataset, using major depression in pregnancy as an example. The safe use of antidepressants in pregnancy is an ongoing issue for clinicians with around 10% of pregnant women suffer from depression. As the birth admission will be the first admission to hospital during their pregnancy for most women, their use of antidepressants, or their depressive condition, may not be revealed to the attending hospital clinicians. This may result in adverse outcomes for the mother and infant. Population-based de-identified data were provided from the Western Australian Data Linkage System linking the administrative health records of women with a delivery to related records from the Midwives' Notification System, the Hospital Morbidity Data System and the national Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme dataset. The women with depression during their pregnancy were ascertained in two ways From 2002 to 2005, there were 96698 births in WA. At least one antidepressant was dispensed to 4485 (4.6%) pregnant women. There were 3010 (3.1%) women with a comorbidity related to depression recorded on their delivery admission, or other admission to hospital during pregnancy. There were a total of 7495 pregnancies identified by either set of records. Using data linkage, we determined that these records represented 6596 individual pregnancies. Only 899 pregnancies were found in both groups (13.6% of all cases). 80% of women dispensed an antidepressant did not have depression recorded as a comorbidity on their hospital records. A simple capture-recapture calculation suggests the prevalence of depression in this population of pregnant women to be around 16%. No single data source is likely to provide a complete health profile for an individual. For women with depression in pregnancy and dispensed antidepressants, the hospital admission data do not adequately capture all cases.\n \nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) and sociodemographic parameters on depression during pregnancy. Between September 2010 and September 2011, 200 consecutive women with HG were defined as the study group and 200 consecutive pregnant women without any signs and symptoms of HG, and matched for age, parity, and gestational age were defined as the control group. The Beck depression inventory-II (BDI-II) questionnaire and sociodemographic questionnaire evaluating educational level, occupation, economic status, and obstetric history were given to all participants for self-completion. The forms were collected within 6 h of hospital admission. Groups were compared according to the presence of depression and predictors of depression were analyzed by regression analysis. Median BDI-II scores in study and control groups were 15 and 5, respectively. The difference was statistically significant (p < 0.001). In the HG group, 35.1% of patients had mild depression, 26.0% moderate, and 17.8% had severe depression, while only 5% of patients in the control group had mild depression and 95% had no depression.

However, 12 patients in group I (12.9%) suffered postoperative ischemic stroke, a rate significantly higher than that of group II (1 patient, 1.7%; p = 0.0173). Any recurrence of PAF or atrial fibrillation with bradycardia was assessed at the time of stroke onset. Logistic regression analysis showed that the absence of warfarin therapy constituted a risk factor for post-CABG stroke associated with PAF (Odds 13.04, p = 0.027). Warfarin therapy administered concomitantly with an antiplatelet agent dramatically reduced the incidence of ischemic stroke associated with postoperative PAF.\n \nThe study was done to determine whether eptifibatide, a platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa antagonist, prevents ischemic complications following percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) in women as well as in men. Eptifibatide reduces ischemic complications after nonurgent coronary stent interventions. We compared outcomes in women (n = 562) and men (n = 1,502) enrolled in the Enhanced Suppression of the Platelet GP IIb/IIIa Receptor with Integrilin Therapy (ESPRIT) trial of double-bolus eptifibatide during PCI. Women in the ESPRIT trial were older, and more frequently had hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or acute coronary syndromes, but were less likely to have prior PCI or coronary artery bypass graft surgery. The primary end point, a composite at 48 h of death, myocardial infarction (MI), urgent target vessel revascularization (TVR), and unplanned GP IIb/IIIa use, occurred in 10.5% of women and 7.9% of men (p = 0.082). The composite of death, MI, or TVR after one year occurred in 24.5% of women compared with 18% of men (p = 0.0008). At 48 h, eptifibatide reduced the composite of death, MI, and TVR from 14.5% to 6.0% in women versus 9.0% to 6.8% in men. At one year, these differences persisted Eptifibatide is effective to prevent ischemic complications of PCI in women and may eliminate gender-related differences in PCI outcomes.\n"}]}]}}

This is a cost-utility study from a health care system's perspective comparing coformulated fixed dose (FXD) strategy versus multiple free dose combination (FRC) in antiretroviral therapy. The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) was used to identify HIV/AIDS patients with \u22652 active antiretroviral medications. Patients on FXD were matched in 1:1 ratio with the FRC group using propensity scores. All medical costs excluding those paid by patients and families were included. Utility was measured using SF-6D scores from the SF-12 questionnaire. Incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs) were calculated using the mean annual estimates. A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve was determined using a Monte Carlo probabilistic simulation technique. Nine FXD antiretroviral formulations approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by 2005 was included in this study. One hundred seventy HIV/AIDS patients with \u22652 antiretroviral agents were identified from the MEPS database, of which 53% (n=92) were on FXD formulation. On matching, 70 patients from FXD had a match from the FRC group. No differences in sociodemographic and health status variables were observed between the matched groups. The mean annual cost was $15,766.15 for FXD patients and $11,875.21 for FRC patients. The mean utility gained by using FXD over FRC was 0.085; however, this difference was not statistically significant. The ICUR for the FXD treatment over FRC treatment was $45,540.49/quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed FXD to dominate FRC (>50% probability of being cost-effective) above the $40,000 threshold. Although the cost-effectiveness of a single-pill strategy was within the acceptable willingness-to-pay threshold, the QALY difference were minimal. Further research is recommended to explore the long-term impact of the strategy.\n \nPatient reported outcome studies are extremely valuable. We hypothesize that breast reduction surgery has a high satisfaction rate, and that body mass index (BMI), and the amount of breast tissue removed would not alter this outcome. The purpose of this study was to determine if there is an improvement in the quality of life in patients undergoing breast reduction surgery, and whether breast volume or patient size influences this outcome. A retrospective chart review was performed on 600 consecutive patients at a single institution from 2000 to 2010. Patients were mailed The Breast Q questionnaire to complete. Demographic, surgical, and clinical data were collected and entered into a database. Descriptive statistical analyses were conducted using SAS Software version 9.1.3 with statistical significance determined at P<0.05. A total of 178 surveys were returned and included in our study (a response rate of 29.6%). Patient data included a mean BMI of 28.3 (4.6) kg/m, and mean total amount of breast tissue removed of 1220.9 (665.4) g. The primary indications for patients having breast surgery were for symptomatic macromastia (85%), asymmetry (5.6%), and for cosmesis (2.5%). The Breast Q questionnaire demonstrated patients overwhelmingly agreed that they were satisfied with their breast surgery. The mean response was 2.8 with a standard deviation (SD) of 0.47 (where 1, disagree; 2, somewhat agree; and 3, definitely agree). Patient BMI and total amount of breast tissue removed had a statistically significant positive correlation (0.479; P<0.0001). There was no statistically significant difference between the amount of total breast tissue removed and patient response (P=0.57). The study supports a positive outcome after breast reduction surgery. Over 95% of the patients surveyed were satisfied and would do it again. It demonstrates the improvement of the patient's quality of life regardless of the amount of breast tissue removed. Furthermore, it suggests that the size and weight of the patient has no impact on this outcome. As we face new government and insurance restrictions for surgeries that have both cosmetic and reconstructive value, patient reported outcome studies may have an influence on future third-party payer.\n"}]}]}}

Fourteen reviews were identified; 147 of the 156 primary studies included in these reviews were obtained and assessed. We extracted data on whether the dimensions place of residence, race/ethnicity/culture, occupation, gender, religion, education, socioeconomic status, and social capital and networks (PROGRESS) were reported or analyzed, and whether any interventions were aimed at disadvantaged or low- and middle-income country populations. Among the dimensions of PROGRESS reported at baseline in 147 primary studies, gender (89%) was the most commonly reported, followed by education (25%) and race/ethnicity (18%). Less than 50% of the systematic reviews reported dimensions of PROGRESS even when they had been reported in the primary study. Of 147 primary studies, 6 (5%) were aimed specifically at disadvantaged populations; another 6 reported on effectiveness by at least 1 dimension of PROGRESS. Primary studies of interventions for rheumatoid arthritis generally reported few variables necessary to answer questions about health inequalities. Most CMSG systematic reviews failed to assess those variables even when described in the primary studies. The Cochrane Health Equity Field welcomes the opportunity to provide guidance to systematic review authors on incorporating equity considerations into their reviews.\n"}]}]}}

Results were then correlated with socio-economic status measured by the percentage of habitants living below the poverty level. African-American and Hispanic women generally experience higher mortality than White non-Hispanics, and these differences are especially significant in the southeast metropolitan areas and southwest border of Texas. The proportion and location of significant racial disparities however changed depending on the type of statistic (RR versus RD) and the geographic level.

Geographic regions with significant racial disparities for African-Americans and Hispanics frequently had a poverty rate above 10.00%. This study investigates both relative and absolute racial disparities in breast cancer mortality between White non-Hispanic and African-American/Hispanic women at the census tract, zip code and county levels. Analysis at the census tract level generally led to a larger proportion of geographical units experiencing significantly higher mortality rates for minority groups, although results varied depending on the use of the relative versus absolute statistics.

Functional neuroimaging studies have raised the question of possible residual conscious awareness also in clinically-defined UWS patients. The aim of our study was to identify electrophysiological parameters, by means of a transcranial magnetic stimulation approach, which might potentially express the presence of residual networks sustaining fragmentary behavioral patterns, even when no conscious behavior can be observed. We enrolled 25 severe DOC patients, following post-anoxic or traumatic brain injury and 20 healthy individuals (HC) as control group. Baseline electrophysiological evaluation evidenced, in comparison to HC, a partial preservation of cortical effective connectivity and excitability in clinically defined MCS, whereas these components were absent in clinically defined UWS. Then, we applied an anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (a-tDCS) protocol over the orbitofrontal cortex. a-tDCS was able to boost cortical connectivity and excitability in all HC, MCS, and to unmask such excitability/connectivity in some UWS patients. a-tDCS could be useful in identifying residual connectivity markers in clinically-defined UWS, who may lack of purposeful behavior as a result of a motor-output failure.\n \nTo determine the potential prognostic value of using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify patients with disorders of consciousness, who show potential for recovery.

Further course on the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised. Participants performed a mental imagery fMRI paradigm. They were asked to alternately imagine playing tennis and navigating through their home. In 14 of the 22 examined patients (VS, n=5; MCS, n=9), a significant activation of the regions of interest (ROIs) of the mental imagery paradigm could be found. All 5 patients with activation of a significant blood oxygen level dependent signal, who were in a VS at the time of the fMRI examination, reached at least an MCS at the end of the observation period. In contrast, 5 participants in a VS who failed to show activation in ROIs, did not (sensitivity 100%, specificity 100%). Six of 9 patients in an MCS with activation in ROIs emerged from an MCS. Of 3 patients in an MCS who did not show activation, 2 patients stayed in an MCS and 1 patient emerged from the MCS (sensitivity 85%, specificity 40%). The fMRI paradigm mental imagery displays a high concordance with the further clinical course of patients in a VS. All 5 patients in a VS who showed significant activation of ROIs had a favorable further course until the end of the observation period. We therefore propose the term \"functional minimally conscious state\" for these patients. They may benefit from rehabilitation treatment. In cases where no significant activation was seen, the method has no prognostic value. Prediction of the clinical course of patients in an MCS by fMRI was considerably less accurate than in patients in a VS.\n"}]}]}}

One-hundred twenty-eight patients (45.3%) showed a distant relapse, whereas 15 patients (5.3%) developed both distant relapse and local relapse. The site of relapse influenced survival because the patients with vaginal vault recurrences lived significantly longer than the patients with recurrences in other sites. Eighty (28.4%) of the 282 patients became symptomatic and anticipated the scheduled visit, 37 (13.1 %) of the patients reported their symptoms during the follow-up meeting, and 165 (58.5 %) of the patients were asymptomatic and the diagnostic path was introduced by a planned visit or examination.

Patients with additional maxillofacial fractures and patients whose application time to our clinic was more than 10 days after the trauma were excluded. Patients were classified into 5 types according to their fracture. All patients underwent closed reduction and external fixation under local anesthesia. Patients were asked about their satisfaction in a survey at 28th day and sixth month after the surgery. Patients were divided into groups according to fracture type and intervention time, and the results of the survey were evaluated. Of the 43 patients included in the study, 38 were male, 5 were female, and the average age was 24.9. The average intervention time of the patients was 5.44 days. Twenty-eight (65%) of 43 patients were satisfied with the result, whereas 15 (35%) patients were not happy with their operation. In a comparison of patient satisfaction rates according to fracture type, the mild fracture group had a higher satisfaction rate compared to the severe fracture group. Closed reduction is an easy and sufficient treatment for nasal fractures, especially for mild nasal fractures. Early intervention raises the patient satisfaction rate.\n"}]}]}}

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of preoperative TBS in newborns with EA in preventing complications and improving diagnosis and surgical treatment. In the period ranging from 1997 to 2003, 62 patients with EA underwent preoperative TBS. The procedure was carried out with flexible bronchoscope maintaining spontaneous breathing. When a wide carinal fistula was found, this was mechanically occluded by Fogarty catheter and cannulated with rigid bronchoscopy. Type of EA, surgical procedure variations caused by TBS, and associated anomalies not easily detectable were recorded. Before TBS, the Gross classification of the 62 patients was as follows Tracheobronchoscopy is a useful and safe procedure and should be recommended in tertiary centers for babies with EA before surgical repair.\n \nThe primary aim of this study was to test the widespread assumption that the viability of the gastric fundus is compromised by fundoplication, thereby limiting the use of stomach to reconstruct the upper gastrointestinal tract after esophageal resection. Between February 1991 and February 2006, a consecutive series of 142 patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma (EADC) underwent esophageal resection. To reconstruct the upper gastrointestinal tract, all patients had a narrow gastric tube (greater curvature of stomach based on the right gastroepiploic artery) transposed through the posterior mediastinum to the left neck where an anastomosis to the cervical esophagus was performed. From a prospective database, 15 patients were identified to have undergone an 'open' fundoplication (transabdominal Nissen, n=11; transthoracic Belsey, n=4) from 12 to 23 years earlier. Outcomes were compared between patients with EADC who had undergone previous fundoplication, and patients with EADC who never had antireflux surgery. Gastric transposition and cervical esophagogastrostomy were technically feasible in all patients. No significant differences in outcome were found between patient groups. Gastric necrosis developed in only one patient, who had not undergone previous fundoplication. Anastomotic leak rates after esophageal resection and reconstruction were not statistically different based on whether patients had undergone previous fundoplication (2/15, 13.3%) or not (16/127, 12.6%; p=0.99). With careful attention to surgical technique, previous fundoplication does not preclude the use of stomach to reconstruct the foregut after esophageal resection, refuting the notion that previous antireflux surgery is a relative contraindication to, or alters the approach to esophageal cancer surgery.\n"}]}]}}

Sixty females had their Q angles measured in bilateral and unilateral stance. Linear regressions showed predictive equations and positive correlations for unilateral and bilateral stance Q angles (r=0.81-0.89, p<0.001). The equations generated were used to predict unilateral Q angle from bilateral Q angle measurements in 12 patients with patellofemoral joint pain. The actual unilateral Q angle measurement of the symptomatic knee was significantly greater than that predicted for each individual (p=0.01), whilst the asymptomatic knee showed no significant difference (p=0.16). This study showed a strong positive relationship between bilateral and unilateral stance Q angles which could be represented in a positive linear regression equation. The linear regression equation was then used to predict the effect on the Q angle of moving from a bilateral to a unilateral stance. It has been found previously that patients with patellofemoral joint pain on loading the limb in unilateral stance in activities such as walking and stair descent have increased knee valgus angle. The current study supports those findings indicating that when taking up unilateral stance patients with patellofemoral joint pain demonstrate greater than expected increase in Q angle which could increase loading on the patellofemoral joint.\n \nTo determine whether audiologic characteristics of unilateral hearing loss in children were associated with language, cognitive, or achievement scores. Case-control study Pediatric otolaryngology ambulatory practice Cases (n = 109) were children aged 6 to 12 years with permanent unilateral hearing loss; controls (n = 95) were siblings with normal bilateral hearing. Audiologic characteristics measured included side and severity of hearing loss and word recognition scores in quiet and in noise. Cognitive abilities were measured using the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence; reading, math, and writing achievement was measured with the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test - Second Edition - Abbreviated; and oral language skills were measured with the Oral Written and Language Scales. Children with unilateral hearing loss had worse verbal cognitive and oral language scores than children with normal hearing, but there were no differences in achievement scores. Children with profound unilateral hearing loss tended to have worse cognitive scores and had significantly lower oral language scores. Higher word recognition scores of the normal hearing ear in quiet were associated with higher cognitive, oral language, and reading achievement scores. Higher word recognition scores in noise were slightly correlated with higher oral language scores. As expected, children with unilateral hearing loss had worse language scores than their siblings with normal hearing, with trends toward worse cognitive scores. Children with profound unilateral hearing loss tended to have worse outcomes than children with normal hearing or less severe unilateral loss. However, there were no differences in outcomes between children with right or left unilateral hearing loss.\n"}]}]}}

Epidemiologic studies investigating the relationship between appendectomy and infertility or ectopic pregnancy were identified by searching the MEDLINE database from 1966 to 1997. Appropriate citations were also extracted from a manual search of the bibliographies of selected papers. Twenty-three articles were retrieved. Only 4 presented original data including comparisons to a nonexposed control group and they form the basis for this study. Because the raw data or specific techniques of data analysis were not always explicitly described, indices of risk for exposure were extracted from the data as presented and were analysed without attempting to convert them to a common measure. Articles were assessed according to the criteria of the Evidence-Based Medicine Working Group for evaluating articles on harm. Review of the literature yielded estimates of the risk of adverse fertility outcomes ranging from 1.6 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1 to 2.5) for ectopic pregnancy after an appendectomy to 4.8 (95% CI 1.5 to 14.9) for tubal infertility from perforation of the appendix. Recall bias, and poor adjustment for confounding variables in some reports, weakened the validity of the studies. The methodologic weaknesses of the studies do not permit acceptance of increased risk of tubal pregnancy or infertility as a consequence of perforation of the appendix, so a causal relationship cannot be supported by the data currently available. Only a well-designed case-control study with unbiased ascertainment of exposure and adjustment for confounding variables will provide a definitive answer.\n \nThe aim of this study is to evaluate whether closure of a tympanic membrane perforation with an intact ossicular chain results in a closure of the air-bone gap.

Between 2001 and 2009, overall, 106 patients with a central tympanic membrane perforation and, an intact ossicular chain were further analyzed. All patients underwent myringoplasty using temporalis fascia in an underlay technique. Comparison of the preoperative and postoperative hearing results in patients undergoing myringoplasty for chronic otitis media simplex. The mean postoperative air-bone gap (ABG) was 8.2 dB for the frequencies 0.5 to 4 kHz. Eighty-three patients (78%) showed postoperatively a mean ABG of 10 dB or lower. The ABG difference (improvement) was statistically significant for each single frequency (0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 4 kHz) (p < 0.0001). There is a linear correlation between the preoperative tympanic membrane perforation size and the postoperative ABG (p = 0.0017) for the frequencies 0.5 to 4 kHz. No statistical significant correlation was seen between the state of the middle-ear mucosa, temporal bone pneumatization, tympanometric middle-ear/mastoid volume, and the postoperative ABG. Complete ABG closure by myringoplasty could be achieved in only approximately 20% of the cases. 80% respectively presented with a mean residual ABG of 8 dB. We found a significant linear correlation between the preoperative size of the tympanic membrane perforation and the postoperative ABG, whereas mastoid volume, temporal bone pneumatization, and the condition of the mucosa did not affect the outcome.\n"}]}]}}

A significant association was found between the presence of anti-Ro/La antibodies and positive salivary gland findings characteristic for SS (p<0.0001, Fisher's exact test). These findings tend to support the suggestion that a patient suspected to suffer from SS in a community setting may be first tested for the presence of anti-Ro/La antibodies to confirm the diagnosis. Only those with a negative result for the presence of anti-Ro/La antibodies need to be referred for salivary gland biopsy.\n"}]}]}}

In the post-assessment evaluation portion of the study, students gave significant higher ratings for the ACS station and \"overall OSCE evaluation\" in the FE track; also with small effect sizes. It seems quite admissible and justified to encourage medical students to officiate as examiners in undergraduate emergency medicine OSCE formative testing, but not necessarily in summative assessment evaluations.\n \nCurrently, a 'pedagogical gap' exists in distributed medical education in that distance educators teach medical students but typically do not have the opportunity to assess them in large-scale examinations such as the objective structured clinical examination (OSCE). We developed a remote examiner OSCE (reOSCE) that was integrated into a traditional OSCE to establish whether remote examination technology may be used to bridge this gap. The purpose of this study was to explore whether remote physician-examiners can replace on-site physician-examiners in an OSCE, and to determine the feasibility of this new examination method. Forty Year 3 medical students were randomised into six reOSCE stations that were incorporated into two tracks of a 10-station traditional OSCE. For the reOSCE stations, student performance was assessed by both a local examiner (LE) in the room and a remote examiner (RE) who viewed the OSCE encounters from a distance. The primary endpoint was the correlation of scores between LEs and REs across all reOSCE stations. The secondary endpoint was a post-OSCE survey of both REs and students. Statistically significant correlations were found between LE and RE checklist scores for history taking (r = 0.64-r = 0.80), physical examination (r = 0.41-r = 0.54), and management stations (r = 0.78). Correlations between LE and RE global ratings were more varied (r = 0.21-r = 0.77). Correlations on three of the six stations reached significance. Qualitative analysis of feedback from REs and students showed high acceptance of the reOSCE despite technological issues. This preliminary study demonstrated that OSCE ratings by LEs and REs were reasonably comparable when using checklists. Remote examination may be a feasible and acceptable way of assessing students' clinical skills, but further validity evidence will be required before it can be recommended for use in high-stakes examinations.\n"}]}]}}

Included among the syndromes are ataques de nervios (ADN), which are reported to be bound to the Hispanic culture and closely resemble panic attacks. However, the cultural distinctiveness and phenomenology of ADN has not been adequately investigated. The current study employed an ethnically diverse study sample (N=342) of undergraduates. Participants completed a number of measures that assessed acculturation, syndrome and anxiety risk factors. In contrast to the DSM-IV's conceptualization of ADN, the rate of ADN did not significantly vary across the three main groups (African American, Caucasian, and Hispanic participants) nor did it vary based on acculturation. More consistent with the DSM-IV, the symptom comparisons indicated some differentiation between ADN and panic attacks. The present report provides data indicating that ADNs, as described by the DSM-IV, are not unique to the Hispanic culture and are experienced by non-Hispanic individuals at similar rates to Hispanic-endorsement.

However, consultancy/employee status was the only COI category statistically associated with publication of positive results (P < 0.001). Self-reported COI are uncommon in plastic surgery research. Our results provide evidence that certain types of financial COI are more likely than others to be associated with the presentation of positive findings. This analysis suggests that certain investigators may be more biased, consciously or unconsciously, by the type of financial benefit offered by industry.\n"}]}]}}

Demographic analysis of data published by EUROSTAT and Czech statistical office. Department of Demography and Geodemography Faculty of Science, Charles University Prague. Widespread use of the liberal abortion law in socialist countries contributed to the decline of fertility rates only to the replacement level. In the Czech Republic total fertility rate dropped below 1.3 in 1995 and it did not increase above 1.5 children per woman till 2007. The increased use of modern contraceptive methods that results in a sharp decline in fertility and in a significant decrease of induced abortions can be documented. The total abortion rate fell from 1.54 abortions per a woman in 1990 to 0.34 in 2007. The proportion of women aged 15-49 years who were prescribed oral contraception increased from 4 percent in 1990 to 48 percent in 2007. An induced abortion is still used largely as a way to avoid birth of additional children by women who already have the number of children they want. This is in sharp contrast with the situation in the majority of Western European countries in which abortion is used mainly by teen-age girls whose attempts to avoid pregnancy have failed. In contrast to other demographic characteristics which classify the Czech Republic to Eastern Europe, the level of induced abortion rate is comparable with the levels observed in some Western European countries.\n"}]}]}}

One hundred sixteen patients who were hospitalized in the coronary care unit were included in the study. Psychiatric assessment of the patients was carried out within 1-6months post-MI. Psychiatric interviews were conducted with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-I). Also used were the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and Health Anxiety Inventory (HAI). A total of 116 patients were divided into two groups according to age as an early age myocardial infarction group (EA-MI) and a late age myocardial infarction group (LA-MI). The EA-MI group included 24 patients 45years of age and under. The LA-MI group included 92 patients over 45years of age. Current psychiatric disorders, lifetime psychiatric disorders and lifetime depressive disorders were significantly more frequent in the EA-MI group than in the LA-MI group. EA-MI patients have experienced a depressive episode prior to the onset of the MI, whereas in the LA-MI group, the patients typically experienced depressive episodes after MI.

In unicompartmental replacement, the other compartments and knee ligaments are largely untouched. Therefore, it was hypothesized that the knee kinematics after unicompartmental replacement may also be unchanged. To test this hypothesis, knee kinematics and quadriceps tension were recorded before and after replacement with a unicompartmental design and then with a tricompartmental design. Six human cadaver knees were tested before implantation, after implantation with a bicruciate-retaining unicompartmental knee prosthesis, and after implantation with a posterior cruciate-retaining tricompartmental knee prosthesis. The unicompartmental prosthesis was initially implanted, and it was then revised to a total condylar knee replacement. The knee kinematics were measured with use of an electromagnetic tracking device while the knee was put through dynamic simulated stair-climbing under peak flexion moments of approximately 40 N-m. Quadriceps tension was also measured for all three conditions. No significant differences in tibial axial rotation were noted between the intact and unicompartmental conditions. However, tricompartmental replacement significantly affected tibial axial rotation (p = 0.001). Femoral rollback was not significantly affected by either unicompartmental or tricompartmental arthroplasty. Quadriceps tension was also similar among all three conditions. In this in vitro cadaver study, the tricompartmental replacement significantly changed knee kinematics while the unicompartmental replacement preserved normal knee kinematics.\n \nThe posterior tibial slope influences both the natural knee stability as well as the stability and kinematics after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Exact definition of the posterior tibial slope (PTS) requires lateral radiographs of the lower limb. Only lateral knee radiographs are routinely obtained after TKA, however. The purpose of the present study therefore was to analyse the relationship between PTS measurement results on short and expanded lateral knee radiographs. The PTS was measured on 100 consecutive lateral radiographs of the lower limb using the mechanical and three diaphyseal axes with various distances below the tibial plateau. Significant differences between PTS results were found for all three diaphyseal axes, with the smallest differences and the strongest correlation for a diaphyseal axis at 16 and 20\u00a0cm below the tibial plateau. Using short distances below the tibial plateau (6 and 10\u00a0cm) resulted in an overestimation of the PTS of 3\u00b0, on average. The PTS measurements in long lateral knee radiographs are more accurate compared to short radiographs. On short lateral knee radiographs, only a estimation of the PTS can be carried out.

There are 71 previously untreated patients with cytological or histological evidence of primary lung cancer who were admitted to the oncology department between November 2013 and August 2014. Forty-five healthy individuals with age, sex and BMI matching the lung cancer patients, were recruited to take part in the study as a control group. Leptin levels were measured quantitatively by using a microELISA kit. The serum leptin levels at diagnosis were significantly lower in lung cancer patients than those in control subjects (4.75\u00b14.91 ng/ml, 9.67\u00b18.02 ng/ml; p<0.001). We did not find any significant difference in leptin values related to clinicopathological parameters such as ECOG PS, weight loss, histological type, disease stage and TNM classification. Nevertheless, we demonstrated a significant correlation between serum leptin levels and BMI in lung cancer patients (correlation coefficient Our results showed that the serum leptin level has no prognostic indications in advanced lung cancer patients. Leptin is decreased in lung cancer, and there is lack of correlation with tumour\u2011related factors including prognosis. Therefore, leptin is not a useful clinical marker in lung cancer (Tab. 2, Fig. 2, Ref. 22).\n \nThe limited information on serum leptin levels in elderly men suggests the occurrence of an age-related decrease, with disruption of the relationship between fat mass and leptin levels. A relative leptin deficiency might thus be implicated in the increase of fat mass and decrease of serum testosterone levels in elderly men. Therefore, we have reevaluated the age-related changes in serum leptin levels and their relationship with adiposity and androgen levels in a large group of community dwelling men. Serum leptin and androgen levels were measured in 271 healthy, ambulatory elderly men (median age 74 years), as well as in 61 middle-aged (median 43 years) and 40 young (median 25.5 years) controls. Adiposity was assessed by anthropometrical measurements (body mass index; BMI) and by estimation of fat mass by the bio-impedance method. Serum leptin levels, whether or not adjusted for BMI, were found to increase with age, the values tending to level off after the age of 45 years, and were strongly correlated to BMI (r = 0.77) and fat mass assessed by the bio-impedance method (r = 0.81). Linear regression analysis showed a similar slope for the relationship between BMI and serum leptin in the three age groups. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated BMI, age and serum insulin, but not serum testosterone, as significant independent correlates of serum leptin. Serum (free) testosterone levels were negatively correlated with age and serum leptin, also after partialization for BMI Ageing in men is accompanied by a rise of serum leptin levels with a maintained strong association between serum leptin and adiposity in elderly men. Testosterone does not appear to be a major determinant of serum leptin in healthy men, while leptin does emerge as a negative correlate of serum testosterone. Increased fat mass and decreased testosterone production in elderly men cannot be attributed to a relative leptin deficiency.\n"}]}]}}

The study sample included women who delivered a live singleton baby between April 2003 and March 2004. Pregnant women who made at least one ED visit for asthma were counted as cases and the rest of the women as control subjects. We performed a multivariable analysis using logistic regression to model the risk of having an ED visit for asthma, with fetal gender being one of the predictors. In addition, a series of multivariable logistic regressions were also constructed separately for cases and controls for the following adverse delivery outcomes Among 109,173 live singleton deliveries, 530 women had visited ED due to asthma during pregnancy. While having an ED visit for asthma was positively associated with teenage pregnancy, low income, and presence of pregnancy-induced hypertension, it was not associated with fetal gender (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85-1.19). Fetal gender was not a significant predictor of adverse pregnancy outcomes among women who had an asthma ED visit during pregnancy.

We noticed that several children undergoing laceration repair in emergency department requested to be sutured by a female physician. This study attempted to find gender preferences of children and parents for the physician in the emergency department. We undertook this study to determine whether pediatric patients or their parents have a preference for physicians of a particular gender. We also tried to determine whether they would be willing to wait longer to be seen to accommodate their choice. A total of 200 children aged between 8 and 13 years presenting to our pediatric emergency department for laceration repair were enrolled. With the knowledge and consent of their parents, the enrolled children were given a short questionnaire. They were asked, if they had a choice, would they prefer to have a male or a female doctor or would they prefer the doctor with the most experience. Their parents were also then given the questionnaire. They were also asked if they would be willing to wait longer to be seen by the doctor of their choice. The study sample comprised 200 children, 139 boys and 61 girls. Among boys, 78% (n = 109) said they would prefer a female physician. Only 21% (n = 30) preferred a male physician. Among girls, 80% (n = 49) reported they would prefer a female physician, 20% (n = 12) preferred a male physician. None of the children surveyed wanted the \"best\" physician. When the parents were surveyed, 60% (n = 120) preferred a male physician as compared with 19% (n = 38) who expressed a preference for female physician. Only 21% (n = 42) of parents desired the most experienced physician of either sex to repair the laceration. All the parents who expressed a preference for the \"most experienced\" physician said they were willing to wait (42/42) until that physician was available as compared with less than a third of parents who were willing to wait for the physician of a specific gender (44/158). Most children (79%) preferred a female physician for their sutures, whereas parents overall (60%) appeared to prefer a male physician. The children did not appear to care if the physician was the \"best.\" Surprisingly, many parents also chose physician gender rather than physician experience. One hundred percent of the parents who chose the most experienced physician were willing to wait longer to be seen as compared with 29% who preferred a physician of a particular gender.\n"}]}]}}

Although AF can have a genetic etiology, links between inherited gene defects and acquired factors such as atrial stretch have not been explored. Mutation screening of the KCNQ1, KCNE1, KCNE2, and KCNE3 genes was performed in 50 families with AF. The effects of mutant protein on cardiac I(Ks) activation were evaluated using electrophysiological studies and human atrial action potential modeling. One missense KCNQ1 mutation, R14C, was identified in 1 family with a high prevalence of hypertension. Atrial fibrillation was present only in older individuals who had developed atrial dilation and who were genotype positive. Patch-clamp studies of wild-type or R14C KCNQ1 expressed with KCNE1 in CHO cells showed no statistically significant differences between wild-type and mutant channel kinetics at baseline, or after activation of adenylate cyclase with forskolin. After exposure to hypotonic solution to elicit cell swelling/stretch, mutant channels showed a marked increase in current, a leftward shift in the voltage dependence of activation, altered channel kinetics, and shortening of the modeled atrial action potential duration. These data suggest that the R14C KCNQ1 mutation alone is insufficient to cause AF. Rather, we suggest a model in which a \"second hit\", such as an environmental factor like hypertension, which promotes atrial stretch and thereby unmasks an inherited defect in ion channel kinetics (the \"first hit\"), is required for AF to be manifested. Such a model would also account for the age-related increase in AF development.\n \nPatients with an accessory pathway (AP) have an increased propensity to develop atrial fibrillation (AF), but the mechanism is unknown. The purpose of this study was to identify crucial risk factors and to test the hypothesis that reflection and/or microreentry of atrial impulses propagating into the AP triggers AF. Five hundred thirty-four patients successfully treated with radiofrequency ablation of AP at two university hospitals were evaluated. Patients were separated into those with concealed vs those with manifest AP in terms of their propensity to develop AF. To investigate AF triggering mechanisms, linear and branched two-dimensional models of atrium-to-ventricle propagation across a heterogeneous 1 x 6 AP using human ionic kinetics were simulated. A history of AF was twice as common in patients with manifest AP vs concealed AP irrespective of AP location. AF was more likely to occur in older males and in patients with larger atria. There was no correlation between AF history and AP refractory measures. However, the electrophysiologic properties of APs seemed to fulfill the prerequisites for reflection and/or microreentry of atrially initiated impulses. In the linear AP model, repetitive atrial stimulation resulted in progressively larger delay of atrium-to-ventricle propagation across the passive segment. Eventually, sufficient time for repolarization of the atrial segment allowed for reflection of an impulse that activated the entire atrium and by wavefront-wavetail interaction with a new atrial stimulus AF reentry was initiated. Simulations using the branched model showed that microreentry at the ventricular insertion of the AP could also initiate AF via retrograde atrial activation as a result of unidirectional block at the AP-ventricle junction. Propensity for AF in patients with an AP is strongly related to preexcitation, larger atria, male gender, and older age. Reflection and microreentry at the AP may be important for AF initiation in patients with manifest (preexcited) Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Similar mechanisms also may trigger AF in patients without an AP.\n"}]}]}}

There were substantial differences in both the aortic arch index and the aortic arch angle of the type III and IV groups. A multivariate analysis confirmed that the aortic arch angle was significantly associated with the occurrence of type III damage (OR 1.5; 95% CI 1.03-2.2).

Between January 1995 and March 2001, 43 consecutive patients underwent operations for acute aortic dissection. In all patients the distal repair was performed under circulatory arrest without the use of an aortic cross-clamp. Fifteen patients underwent aortic arch replacement with additional reconstruction of supra-aortic vessels in 3 patients. Complete replacement of all dissected tissue could be achieved in 21 patients (group 1). Because of the distal extent of the dissection beyond the aortic arch, replacement of all the dissected tissue was not possible in 22 patients (group 2). Early mortality was 4.7% (2 patients), and the incidence of perioperative cerebrovascular events was 7.0% (3 patients). All of these events occurred in group 2 (p < 0.025).

A persisting patent false lumen was observed in 14 of the 36 surviving patients (39%). Extended replacement of the dissected ascending aorta and aortic arch can be done with good early and midterm results, even though it requires a complex surgical technique.

Eighty-three patients met the study criteria. Most (92%) were Caucasian and had advanced stage disease (71%). Primary tumors were 58% ovary, 35% endometrium, and 6% cervix. All patients were receiving chemotherapy on admission (72% for primary, 28% for recurrent disease). Forty-eight percent had a positive culture, and most (58%) positive cultures were urine. Seventy-six percent of patients were considered low risk. High-risk patients were more likely to have a severe complication (10% versus 50%, p=0.0003), multiple severe complications (3% versus 20%, p=0.0278), ICU admission (2% versus 40%, p<0.0001), overall mortality (2% versus 15%, p=0.0417), and death due to neutropenic fever (0% versus 15%, p=0.0124). MASCC had a positive predictive value of 50% and negative predictive value of 90%. The median MASCC score for all patients was 22 (range, 11-26), but the median MASCC score for those with death or a severe complication was 17 (range, 11-24). Based on this pilot data, MASCC score appears promising in determining suitability for outpatient management of NF in gynecologic oncology patients. Prospective study is ongoing to confirm safety and determine impact on cost.\n \nMicrobial contamination can be a marker for faulty process and is assumed to play an important role in the collection of hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) and infusion procedure. We aimed to determine the microbial contamination rates and evaluate the success of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in patients who received contaminated products. We analyzed microbial contamination records of HPC grafts between 2012 and 2015, retrospectively. Contamination rates of autologous donors were evaluated for at three steps A total of 445 mobilization procedures were carried out on 333 (167 autologous and 166 allogeneic) donors. The microbiological contamination of peripheral blood (323/333 donations) and bone marrow (10/333 donations) products were analyzed. Bacterial contamination was detected in 18 of 1552 (1.15 %) culture bottles of 333 donors. During the study period 248 patients underwent HCT and among these patients microbial contamination rate on sample basis was 1.3 % (16/1212). Microbial contamination detected in nine patients (7 autologous; 2 allogeneic). In 8 of 9 patients, a febrile neutropenic attack was observed. The median day for the neutropenic fever was 4 days (0-9). None of the patients died within the post-transplant 30 days who received contaminated products. The use of contaminated products with antibiotic prophylaxis may be safe in terms of the first day of fever, duration of fever, neutrophil, platelet engraftment and duration of hospitalization.\n"}]}]}}

Retrospective analysis of 92 internal or central-breast node-negative tumours with mastectomy and external irradiation of the internal mammary chain at the dose of 50 Gy, from 1994 to 1998. Local recurrence rate was 5 % (five cases). Recurrence sites were the operative scare and chest wall. Factors associated with increased risk of local failure were age < or = 40 years and tumour size greater than 20mm, without statistical significance. Post-mastectomy radiotherapy should be discussed for a sub-group of node-negative patients with predictors factors of local failure such as age < or = 40 years and larger tumour size.\n \nAxillary dissection is associated with a high incidence of lymphedema, which has been brought down with the introduction of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in patients with early breast cancer. However, sentinel lymph node biopsy is not widely accepted in patients of locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) [T3N1, Any T4, Any N2-3 with no distant metastasis] after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) and these patients routinely undergo axillary lymph node clearance. Axillary reverse mapping (ARM) with blue dye has the potential to differentiate the arm lymphatics from the breast lymphatics and it can be used to decrease lymphedema in patients undergoing ALND by preserving these lymphatics. However, ARM in LABC patients is yet to be accepted as the standard of care. 51 patients of locally advanced breast carcinoma were included in the study from May 2011 to May 2012. All patients received neo-adjuvant chemotherapy followed by modified radical mastectomy. Axillary reverse mapping (ARM) was carried out using blue dye. 2 ml of methylene blue dye was injected intradermal, upper medial aspect of the ipsilateral arm. The number, size and site and distribution of lymph nodes identified were recorded and the nodes were labelled as ARM nodes and complete axillary dissection was carried out. Blue nodes were identified in 45 (88.2%) out of the 51 patients. The average number of ARM nodes identified was 4.03 \u00b1 0.28 [range 1-8]. In majority (77.8%) of the cases, nodes were located in the triangle formed by axillary vein above, below by the first intercostobrachial nerve and medially by the chest wall/serratus anterior. In patients with complete or partial response to NACT, ARM and breast axillary LN were negative in 63.3% patients whereas 36.6% had positive breast but negative ARM nodes. In this study we did not intend to preserve any ARM nodes but in 90% of these cases, at least one ARM node had to be removed or was injured during axillary clearance. ARM nodes could be identified in 15 (83.3%) out of the 18 patients with stable or progressive disease following ARM. 12 (80%) out of these 15 cases demonstrated positive ARM and breast LN whereas 3 (20%) patients had positive breast but negative ARM nodes. Skin tattooing (82.3%) was the most common complication observed in our study. Identification rates of ARM nodes can be improved by injecting the blue dye in the upper medial aspect of the arm at the time of induction. Majority of the arm nodes lie between the axillary vein and the first intercostobrachial nerve. It is difficult to preserve the ARM nodes in patients of LABC, who have had good response to NACT and in patients of LABC with poor response to NACT, the incidence of metastasis in ARM nodes is quite high. Therefore, ARM is not a feasible option in patients with locally advanced breast cancer.\n"}]}]}}

The BMD at both sites decreased precipitously within 24 months of stopping treatment, raising the question as to whether bisphosphonates can be stopped in a growing child with skeletal fragility. At age 23 months, a male toddler sustained a low trauma fracture of his right femur. Skeletal radiographs revealed generalised osteopenia with multiple vertebral body fractures. He was diagnosed with type IV osteogenesis imperfecta; however, no mutations were found in COL1A1 or COL1A2 genes. This case report presents bone densitometry data before, during and after bisphosphonate treatment. Axial QCT was main outcome from 2 years of age; DXA and pQCT were taken after age 5. QCT confirmed that he had low spinal trabecular volumetric BMD (Z-score -2.4). After 4 years of treatment his vertebral fractures had been remodelled and all bone densitometry values (QCT, DXA and pQCT) were within normal range and therefore treatment was discontinued. Shortly after this he suffered stress fractures of his left mid tibia and at the sclerotic metaphyseal line corresponding to his first APD treatment. He had marked reduction in spinal trabecular and distal radial vBMD; change in BMAD was less marked. The patient has been restarted on IV APD therapy. This case has led us to consider whether bisphosphonate therapy can be discontinued in a child with fragility fractures before his/her linear growth has ceased?\n \nThe pathogenesis of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ) is not completely understood. The most popular hypothesis has suggested that the bone turnover (BT) in the jawbone is greater than that in other sites and that this turnover will be overly suppressed by bisphosphonates. Using bone scintigraphy, a simple tool for the quantitative evaluation of bone metabolism and blood flow, the goals of the present study were to determine whether the rate of bone remodeling is greater in the jaw and whether the bone BT in the jaw is differentially altered after bisphosphonate intake compared with that in other skeletal sites. The bone scintigraphies of 90 female patients with breast cancer were retrospectively analyzed (n\u00a0= 45 with bisphosphonate intake; n\u00a0= 45 without bisphosphonate intake [control group]). All patients in the study group had undergone bone scintigraphy before therapy and during the treatment (course after 12 and 24\u00a0months). The data were quantitatively analyzed using 6 predetermined regions of interest. The bone BT of the mandible was similar to that of the femur and significantly reduced compared with that of the maxilla (P < .01). None of the investigated bone regions (including the mandible and maxilla) were significantly altered after bisphosphonate administration (P > .05). The finding that the mandible had significantly lower bone BT than that of the maxilla and that two thirds of BRONJ cases occur in the mandible were inconsistent with the investigated hypothesis. Furthermore, the bone BT in the jawbone was not overly suppressed by bisphosphonates. Thus, it is unlikely that over suppression of bone BT is the exclusive causation playing a role in the pathomechanism of BRONJ.\n"}]}]}}

At our institution, a regional anesthesia program was instituted for patients undergoing surgery for hip fracture. This retrospective cohort review examines the effects of regional anesthesia (from mainly after July 2007) vs general anesthesia (mainly prior to July 2007) on morbidity, mortality and hospitalization costs. This retrospective cohort study involved data collection from electronic and paper charts of 308 patients who underwent surgery for hip fracture from September 2006 to December 2008. Data on postoperative morbidity, in-patient mortality, and cost of hospitalization (as estimated from data on hospital charges) were collected and analyzed. Seventy-three patients received regional anesthesia and 235 patients received general anesthesia. During July 2007, approximately halfway through the study period, a regional anesthesia and analgesia program was introduced. The average cost of hospitalization in patients who received surgery for hip fracture was no different between patients who receive regional or general anesthesia ($16,789 + 631 vs $16,815 + 643, respectively, P = 0.9557). Delay in surgery and intensive care unit (ICU) admission resulted in significantly higher hospitalization costs. Age, male gender, African American race and ICU admission were associated with increased in-hospital mortality. In-hospital mortality and rates of readmission are not statistically different between the two anesthesia groups. There is no difference in postoperative morbidity, rates of rehospitalization, in-patient mortality or hospitalization costs in geriatric patients undergoing regional or general anesthesia for repair of hip fracture. Delay in surgery beyond 3 days and ICU admission both increase cost of hospitalization.\n \nSurgical patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are at increased risk of perioperative complications. In this study, we sought to quantify the benefit of avoiding general anesthesia in this patient population. Data from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database (2005-2010) were used for this review. Patients who met the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program definition for COPD and underwent surgery under general, spinal, epidural, or peripheral nerve block anesthesia were included in this study. For each primary current procedural terminology code with \u2265 1 general and \u2265 1 regional (spinal, epidural, or peripheral nerve block) anesthetic, regional patients were propensity score--matched to general anesthetic patients. Propensity scoring was calculated using all available demographic and comorbidity data. This match yielded 2644 patients who received regional anesthesia and 2644 matched general anesthetic patients. These groups were compared for morbidity and mortality. Groups were well matched on demographics, comorbidities, and type of surgery. Compared with matched patients who received regional anesthesia, patients who received general anesthesia had a higher incidence of postoperative pneumonia (3.3% vs 2.3%, P = 0.0384, absolute difference with 95% confidence interval = 1.0% [0.09, 1.88]), prolonged ventilator dependence (2.1% vs 0.9%, P = 0.0008, difference = 1.2% [0.51, 1.84]), and unplanned postoperative intubation (2.6% vs 1.8%, P = 0.0487, difference = 0.8% [0.04, 1.62]). Composite morbidity was 15.4% in the general group versus 12.6% (P = 0.0038, difference = 2.8% [0.93, 4.67]). Composite morbidity not including pulmonary complications was 13.0% in the general group versus 11.1% (P = 0.0312, difference = 1.9% [0.21, 3.72]). Thirty-day mortality was similar (2.7% vs 3.0%, P = 0.6788, difference = 0.3% [-1.12, 0.67]). As a test for validity, we found a positive association between pulmonary end points because patients with 1 pulmonary complication were significantly more likely to have additional pulmonary complications. The use of regional anesthesia in patients with COPD is associated with lower incidences of composite morbidity, pneumonia, prolonged ventilator dependence, and unplanned postoperative intubation.\n"}]}]}}

A cross-sectional design was used for this study. Twenty children who had spina bifida and were ambulatory participated. The (.)Vo(2)peak was measured during a graded treadmill exercise test. The validity of (.)Vo(2)peak measurements was evaluated by use of previously described guidelines for maximum exercise testing in children who are healthy, as well as differences between Vo(2)peak and (.)Vo(2) during a supramaximal protocol ((.)Vo(2)supramaximal). The average values for (.)Vo(2)peak and normalized (.)Vo(2)peak were, respectively, 1.23 L/min (SD=0.6) and 34.1 mL/kg/min (SD=8.3).

Twenty-seven healthy normal glucose-tolerant humans with either a previous diagnosis of gestational diabetes or having two parents with Type 2 diabetes and 27 healthy adults who had no history of diabetes were recruited. Maximal oxygen uptake was assessed using an incremental exercise test to exhaustion. Skin microvascular function was assessed using laser Doppler techniques as the maximum skin hyperaemic response to a thermal stimulus (maximum hyperaemia) and the forearm skin blood flow response to the iontophoretic application of acetylcholine (ACh) and sodium nitroprusside. Maximal oxygen uptake was not significantly different in the 'at-risk' group compared with healthy controls. Maximum hyperaemia was reduced in those 'at risk' (1.29 +/- 0.30 vs. 1.46 +/- 0.33 V, P = 0.047); however, the peak response to acetylcholine or sodium nitroprusside did not differ in the two groups. A significant positive correlation was demonstrated between maximal oxygen uptake and maximum hyperaemia (r = 0.52, P = 0.006 l/min and r = 0.60, P = 0.001 ml/kg/min) and peak ACh response (r = 0.40, P = 0.04 l/min and r = 0.47, P = 0.013 ml/kg/min) in the 'at-risk' group when expressed in absolute (l/min) or body mass-related (ml/kg/min) terms. No significant correlations were found in the control group. In this 'at-risk' group with skin microvascular dysfunction maximal oxygen uptake was not reduced compared with healthy controls.

On comparing patients with AF and controls, no significant difference was found in the distribution of SRF between groups (P = .74). Regions of SRF overlapped areas of wave-front collision 75% \u00b1 13% of the time. (1) There is little overlap between regions of CFAEs during AF and regions of SRF measured in the time domain or the frequency domain, (2) the majority of SRF appears to occur in regions with wave-front collision, (3) the distribution of SRF is similar in patients with AF and normal controls, suggesting that this may not have an important role in AF maintenance and may not be a suitable ablation target.\n \nData on predictors of failure of electrical cardioversion of acute atrial fibrillation are scarce. We explored 6,906 electrical cardioversions of acute (<48 hours) atrial fibrillation in 2,868 patients in a retrospective multicenter study. The success rate of electrical cardioversion was 94.2%. In 26% of unsuccessful cardioversions, the cardioversion was performed successfully later. Antiarrhythmic drug therapy, short (<12 hours) duration of atrial fibrillation episode, advanced age, permanent pacemaker, history of atrial fibrillation episodes within 30 days before cardioversion, and \u03b2-blockers were independent predictors of unsuccessful electrical cardioversion. In the subgroup of patients with cardioversion of the first atrial fibrillation episode (N = 1,411), the short duration of episode (odds ratio [OR] = 2.28; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.34-3.90, P = 0.003) and advanced age (OR = 1.03; 95% CI 1.02-1.05, P < 0.001) were the only independent predictors of unsuccessful cardioversion. After successful cardioversion, the rate of early (<30 days) clinical recurrence of atrial fibrillation was 17.3%. The index cardioversion being performed due to the first atrial fibrillation episode was the only predictor of remaining in the sinus rhythm. A short (<12 hours) duration of acute atrial fibrillation is a significant predictor of unsuccessful cardioversion, especially during the first attack. First atrial fibrillation episode was the only predictor of remaining in the sinus rhythm.\n"}]}]}}

To test the hypothesis that very premature infants born to mothers residing in rural areas have poorer outcomes than those residing in urban areas in the state of New South Wales (NSW) and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) despite a coordinated referral and transport system. \"Rural\" or \"urban\" status was based on the location of maternal residence. Perinatal characteristics, major morbidity and case mix adjusted mortality were compared between 1879 rural and 6775 urban infants <32 weeks gestational age, born in 1992-2002 and admitted to all 10 neonatal intensive care units in NSW and ACT. Rural mothers were more likely to be teenaged, indigenous, and to have had a previous premature birth, prolonged ruptured membrane, and antenatal corticosteroid. Urban mothers were more likely to have had assisted conception and a caesarean section. More urban (93% v 83%) infants were born in a tertiary obstetric hospital. Infants of rural residence had a higher mortality (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07 to 1.48, p = 0.005). This trend was consistently seen in all subgroups and significantly for the tertiary hospital born population and the 30-31 weeks gestation subgroup. Regional birth data in this gestational age range also showed a higher stillbirth rate among rural infants (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.32, p<0.001). Premature births from rural mothers have a higher risk of stillbirth and mortality in neonatal intensive care than urban infants.\n \nThe aim of the present study is to evaluate the effects of the increased number of caesarean deliveries (CDs) in cases of multiple repeat caesarean deliveries (MRCDs) on maternal and neonatal morbidity. MRCDs admitted to our hospital between January 2013 and September 2014 were analysed retrospectively. A total number of 1133 women were included in the study and were divided into 4 groups. Group 1 The differences among the groups were found to be statistically significant in terms of mean maternal age, gravida, APGAR (Activity, Pulse, Grimace, Appearance, Respiration) scores, hospital stay and operation time. In addition, the difference was also statistically significant for severe adhesion, bladder injury and premature birth. No statistically significant difference was observed among the groups with respect to placenta previa, placenta accreta, caesarean hysterectomy, uterine scar rupture. According to our findings, MRCDs seem to increasing the maternal and neonatal morbidity even though they are not life-threatening.\n"}]}]}}

Ninety-six Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 2 (groups E and L). Each group was further subdivided into 6 subgroups (EA1, EA2, EA3, EB1, EB2, EB3, LA1, LA2, LA3, LB1, LB2, LB3), each containing 8 rats. Intestinal anastomosis was performed by polyglactin 910 sutures in A subgroups and with ethyl-2-cyanoacrylate in B subgroups. The anastomosis was end to end in A1 and B1, side to side in A2 and B2, and end to side in A3 and B3. Time for anastomosis performance (AT) was recorded. In group E, bursting pressures and hydroxyproline levels were determined on the second postoperative day, whereas in group L, the same measurements were made on the sixth postoperative day. One-way analysis of variance was used for analyses of variance in the groups. Quantitative data were analyzed with Student's t test. P value was considered significant at less than .05. There was no significant difference between bursting pressures of subgroup pairs on both postoperative days 2 and 6. Hydroxyproline levels and AT were significantly better in B subgroups. Better healing, shorter AT, and equal strength were achieved with ethyl-2-cyanoacrylate compared with polyglactin 910 sutures in intestinal anastomosis in the experimental setting.\n \nAnastomotic complications such as leakage and bleeding remain among the most serious complications of laparoscopic colorectal surgery. No perfect method exists for accurate and reliable avoidance of these catastrophes. This study aimed to study the usefulness of routine intraoperative endoscopy (RIOE) by comparing the surgical outcomes for RIOE patients with those for selective intraoperative endoscopy (SIOE) patients. A retrospective chart review was performed for consecutive patients who underwent elective laparoscopic colorectal resections with distal anastomosis between January 2004 and May 2007. One surgeon performed RIOE, whereas the other three surgeons performed SIOE as necessary. All the abnormalities of IOE patients were managed with a subsequent salvage procedure, and the postoperative outcomes were compared between the RIOE and SIOE groups. The study included 107 patients in the RIOE group and 137 patients in the SIOE group. Abnormalities were detected in 11 RIOE patients (10.3%) (six with staple line bleeding, three with positive air leak test results, and two with additional pathology identified). All but one abnormality was laparoscopically managed without conversion to laparotomy. Whereas one patient experienced postoperative staple line bleeding that required a second operation, the remaining 10 patients recovered uneventfully. The mean hospital stay was 6 days (range, 4-9) days. The RIOE group had overall rates of 0% for anastomotic leakage and 0.9% for staple line bleeding. Intraoperative endoscopies were performed for 30 (21.9%) of the 137 patients in the SIOE group. The postoperative outcomes comparison between the RIOE and SIOE groups showed a tendency toward more overall anastomotic complications (0.9% vs. 5.1%) in the SIOE group, which due to the small sample size did not translate into significant differences in terms of staple line bleeding and anastomotic leakage. There also were no significant differences in other outcomes such as ileus, abdominal or pelvic sepsis, reoperation, positive distal margin, distance from distal margins, length of hospital stay, or mortality. Routine IOE for patients undergoing elective laparoscopic colorectal surgery with distal anastomosis can detect abnormalities at or around the anastomosis. Although the RIOE group had fewer postoperative anastomotic complications, due to the small sample size, the 5.7-fold increase in anastomotic failure did not translate into significantly better postoperative outcomes than the SIOE group experienced. A larger-scale single or multicenter prospective randomized study or a metaanalysis including similar studies is necessary for further investigation of this issue.\n"}]}]}}

Fifty-two bone blocks were extracted from fresh bovine pelvic bone. Four groups were created based on bone type (iliac or pubic region) and presence or absence of cortical bone. Specimens were micro-computed tomography imaged to evaluate trabecular thickness, trabecular number, trabecular separation, bone volume density (BV/TV), BMD, and cortical thickness. Miniscrews 1.4 mm in diameter and 6 mm long were inserted into the bone blocks, and primary stability was evaluated by insertion torque (IT), mini-implant mobility (PTV), and pull-out strength (PS). Intergroup comparison showed lower levels of primary stability when the BMD of trabecular bone was lower and in the absence of cortical bone (P\u2264.05). The Pearson correlation test showed correlation between trabecular number, trabecular thickness, BV/TV, trabecular BMD, total BMD, and IT, PTV, and PS. There was correlation between cortical thickness and IT and PS (P\u2264.05). Cancellous bone plays an important role in primary stability of mini-implants in the presence or absence of cortical bone.\n \nThe aim of this retrospective study was to determine the need for bone grafting in the surgical treatment of displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures. We reviewed 390 cases of displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures treated with plate osteosynthesis with or without autologous iliac bone grafting, and compared outcomes and complications related to fracture stabilization. Three hundred ninety patients with displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures that were treated with plate osteosynthesis from December 2002 to December 2010 were reviewed. Two hundred two patients (group A) were treated by osteosynthesis with autologous bone grafting, and 188 patients (group B) were treated by osteosynthesis without bone grafting. One hundred eighty-one patients with an AO type 73-C1 fracture (Sanders type II), 182 patients with an AO type 73-C2 fracture (Sanders type III), and 27 patients with an AO type 73-C3 fracture (Sanders type IV) were included in this study. Bohler's angle, the crucial angle of Gissane, and calcaneal height in the immediate postoperative period and at the 2-year follow-up were compared. Any change in the subtalar joint status was documented and analyzed. The final outcomes of all patients were evaluated by the AOFAS Ankle-Hindfoot Scale and compared in both groups. The mean full weight-bearing time in group A (with bone grafting) was significantly lower (median 6.2 months, range 2.8-9.2 months) than that in group B (without bone grafting; median 9.8 months, range 6.8-12.2 months). The immediate-postoperative Bohler's angle and that at the 2-year follow-up were significantly higher in group A. The loss of Bohler's angle after 2 years was significantly lower in group A (mean 3.5\u00b0; 95 % CI 0.8\u00b0-6.2\u00b0) than in group B (mean 6.2\u00b0; 95 % CI 1.0\u00b0-11.2\u00b0). The average change in the crucial angle and the average change in calcaneal height were not statistically significant for either group. The infection rate in the bone grafting group was higher, though statistically insignificantly so, than in the nongrafting group (8.3 vs. 6.3 %). No significant difference was found between the groups in terms of the rates of good reduction, postoperative osteoarthritis, and subtalar fusion. Regarding the efficacy outcomes, the mean AOFAS score was lower (mean 76.4 points; 95 % CI 65.8-82.9 points) in group A than in group B (mean, 81.6 points; 95 % CI, 72.3-88.8 points), but this difference was not significant (p > 0.05). Bohler's angle showed improved restoration and the patients returned to full weight-bearing earlier when bone grafting was used in the treatment of intra-articular calcaneal fracture. However, the functional outcomes and complication rates of both groups were similar.\n"}]}]}}

There has been some evidence supporting the presence of the July effect, including data from surgical specialties. Uniformity of care, regardless of time of year, is required for patients undergoing major cancer surgery. We therefore sought to perform a population-level assessment for the presence of a July effect in this field. We used the Nationwide Inpatient Sample to abstract data on patients undergoing 1 of 8 major cancer surgeries at academic medical centres between Jan. 1, 1999, and Dec. 30, 2009. The primary outcomes examined were postoperative complications and in-hospital mortality. Univariate analyses and subsequently multivariate analyses, controlling for patient and hospital characteristics, were performed to identify whether the time of surgery was an independent predictor of outcome after major cancer surgery. On univariate analysis, the overall postoperative complication rate, as well as genitourinary and hematologic complications specifically, was higher in July than the rest of the year. However, on multivariate analysis, only hematologic complications were significantly higher in July, with no difference in overall postoperative complication rate or in-hospital mortality for all 8 surgeries considered separately or together. On the whole, the data confirm an absence of a July effect in patients undergoing major cancer surgery.\n \nClinical pathways are intended to improve the quality of care. In March 2001, our unit implemented a pathway for patients undergoing major colorectal surgery. The aim of this study was to assess its impact on the quality of patient care. We reviewed 204 patients managed using this pathway in 2001, and compared their outcomes with those of a control group of 204 patients who had undergone similar procedures the year before. The endpoints measured were postoperative morbidity, length of stay and readmission rates. Both groups were similar in terms of patient demographics, diagnosis, and nature of surgery performed. In the study group, 61% of patients underwent elective surgery compared with 62% in the control group. The incidence of postoperative morbidity in the study group was 20% compared with 33% in the control group (p = 0.003). The rate of readmission as a result of surgical complications was 6% in the study group versus 13% in the control group (p = 0.029). The average length of stay was 10.4 days in the study group and 12.1 days in the control group (p = 0.105).

Prospective, randomized study. Tertiary referral center. A total of 104 patients with choledocholithiasis-induced acute cholangitis who underwent primary endoscopic treatment were compared according to insertion of an ENBD tube (51 in the ENBD group and 53 in the no-ENBD group). Insertion of an ENBD tube after clearance of CBD stones. Recurrence of cholangitis and length of hospital stay after clearance of CBD stones. Baseline clinical characteristics were similar between both groups. There were no significant differences in the recurrence rate of cholangitis at 24 weeks (3.9% for the ENBD group vs 3.8% for the no-ENBD group at 24 weeks; P = .99) and length of hospital stay (7.9 days [standard error = 1.2] for the ENBD group vs 7.9 days [standard error = 0.7] for the no-ENBD group; P = .98).

Single-center study. A routinely inserted ENBD tube did not improve the clinical course, despite patients having to endure increased procedure time and discomfort, and the insertion would therefore be unnecessary.\n \nTo clarify whether or not use of an endoscopic biliary stenting (EBS) is superior to endoscopic nasobiliary drainage (ENBD) in cases of acute cholangitis due to choledocholithiasis. Of 447 patients with choledocholithiasis who were treated in the Department of Gastroenterology, Fukuoka University Chikushi Hospital between January 1994 and September 2006, the subjects were 99 moderate acute cholangitis patients who underwent endoscopic drainage as initial treatment. Clinical efficacy, complications and patient satisfaction (meal intake rete) were investigated in the EBS group (67 patients) and the ENBD group (32 patients). There were no significant differences in the improvement in inflammation, total bilirubin, or biliary enzymes between the EBS and ENBD groups. Catheter occlusion was seen in three patients (4%) in the EBS group, and the catheter was self-extracted by three patients (10%) in the ENBD group. In moderate acute cholangitis due to choledocholithisis, the treatment efficacy and safety of EBS are equal to those of ENBD, and EBS appears to be a better choice in elderly patients in particular.\n"}]}]}}

The probe recorded the temperature level every 10 minutes during four days. We compared the results found with the new storage can with results obtained in the same conditions with the storage can formerly used by our team. We also studied the best position of the probe for temperature monitoring and the influence of the amount of ice within the transport pack on the temperature level. We then monitored the temperature during the conservation of actual human kidney grafts harvested at our institution from August 2007 to May 2008. The temperature levels were the same regardless of the position of the probe within the transport pack. The lowest temperature was maintained during 15 hours, and the temperature level stayed below 5 degrees C for 57 hours with the new storage can. The former storage can maintained the lowest temperature level for 80 minutes, and temperature reached 5 degrees C after 10 hours 40 minutes. Temperature levels were similar when 2 or 4 kg of crushed ice were used. We observed similar results when monitoring the conservation of human grafts.

We examined the ethical implications of cold calling in a study of subjects with defined neurotic disorders followed up 12 years after initial assessment carried out to determine outcome in terms of symptoms, social functioning, and contact with health services. The patients concerned were asked at original assessment if they would agree to be followed up subsequently and although they agreed no time limit was put on this. To decide if cold calling was ethically justifiable and, if so, to set guidelines for researchers. The study was a cohort study of patients with neurotic disorder treated initially for 10 weeks in a randomised controlled trial. At follow up by a research medical practitioner 18 of the 210 patients had died and of the remaining 192 patients 186 (97%) were seen or had a telephone interview. Four patients refused and two others did not have interviews but agreed to some data being obtained. However, only 104 patients (54%) responded to letters inviting them to make an appointment or to refuse contact and the remainder were followed up by cold calling, with most patients agreeing readily to the research interview. The findings illustrate the dilemma of the need to get the maximum possible data from such studies to achieve scientific validity (and thereby justify the ethics of the study) and the protection of subjects' privacy and autonomy. More attention needs to be paid to consent procedures if cold calling is to be defended on ethical grounds but it is unreasonable to expect this to be obtained at the beginning of a research study in a way that satisfies the requirements for informed consent. A suggested way forward is to obtain written consent for the research at the time that cold calling takes place before beginning the research.\n"}]}]}}

In fact, data from the era of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) suggest that clinical examination of the axilla is falsely positive in as many as 30% of cases. Here we report the results of SLN biopsy in a selected group of breast cancer patients with palpable axillary nodes classified as either moderately or highly suspicious for metastasis. Among 2,027 consecutive SLN biopsy procedures performed by two experienced surgeons, clinically suspicious axillary nodes were identified in 106, and categorized as group 1 (asymmetric enlargement of the ipsilateral axillary nodes moderately suspicious for metastasis, n = 62) and group 2 (clinically positive axillary nodes highly suspicious for metastasis, n = 44). Clinical examination of the axilla was inaccurate in 41% of patients (43 of 106) overall, and was falsely positive in 53% of patients (33 of 62) with moderately suspicious nodes and 23% of patients (10 of 44) with highly suspicious nodes. False-positive results were less frequent with larger tumor size (p = 0.002) and higher histologic grade (p = 0.002), but were not associated with age, body mass index, or a previous surgical biopsy. Clinical axillary examination in breast cancer is subject to false-positive results, and is by itself insufficient justification for axillary lymph node dissection. If other means of preoperative assessment such as palpation- or image-guided fine needle aspiration are negative or indeterminate, then SLN biopsy deserves wider consideration as an alternative to routine axillary lymph node dissection in the clinically node-positive setting.\n \nAxillary nodal status is one of the most important prognostic factors in breast cancer. In the present study we used it to determine the predictors of axillary lymph node metastases in breast cancer and to determine if there is a group of patients in whom minimal axillary surgery is indicated. This article reports a retrospective study of 953 patients with T1 and T2 invasive breast carcinomas seen in the University Malaya Medical Centre between January 2001 and December 2005, where axillary dissection was done. Of the 953 patients, 283 (29.7%) had breast-conserving surgery, and the rest had mastectomies. In this series, 463 patients (48.6%) were younger than 50 years of age; 365 patients (38.3%) had lymph node involvement. The Malays tend to have more axillary node metastases (45.1%) than the Chinese (36.9%); however, there was no significant relationship between age and race and lymph node involvement. Some 23.9% of grade 1 cancers were node positive, compared to 42.9% of grade 2/3 cancers. Tumor size ranged from 0.2 cm to 5 cm; 55.5% of tumors were T2 (>2-5 cm). There were only 13 (1.4%) T1a tumors (>0.1-0.5 cm). Node involvement was documented in 7.7% of T1a tumors, 12.3% of T1b tumors (>0.5-1 cm), 29.2% of T1c tumors, and 48.2% of T2 tumors. In patients who had no lymphovascular invasion (LVI), 24.4% had axillary node metastases, compared with 52.2% of patients where LVI was reported. On univariate analysis, our study found that tumor diameter>2 cm, presence of lymphovascular invasion, and higher tumor grade (2&3) were factors significantly associated with a higher risk of nodal metastases. On multivariate analysis, however, only lymphovascular invasion and tumor size were independent predictors based on the logistic regression. In T1 tumors, axillary lymph node dissection will overtreat almost 75% of cases; therefore a sentinel lymph node biopsy is justified in these tumors.

Prospective study of 153 children (aged 2 months to 2 years), seen in the emergency department after a convulsive episode. After a thorough history and physical examination, a retinal examination was performed by an ophthalmologist. If findings were positive, further investigation was undertaken to rule out systemic disorder or child abuse. One child was found with unilateral retinal haemorrhages following an episode of a simple febrile convulsion. A thorough investigation uncovered no other reason for this finding. Retinal haemorrhages following a convulsive episode are rare. Such a finding should trigger an extensive search for other reasons, including child abuse.\n \nTo identify whether after performing retinal photography, direct ophthalmoscopy can improve the yield of screening for the detection of sight-threatening diabetic eye disease (STDED). Patients (n = 408) who had previously received both dilated direct ophthalmoscopy by a diabetologist and retinal photography graded by a diabetologist within 3 months of each other were included. The results of the other screening modality were not available to the grader/screener. The first 308 patients were consecutive attendees at the clinic who fulfilled the study criteria and 100 were selected because they were identified as having potential STDED by either one of these modalities. An ophthalmologist using slit lamp biomicroscopy then examined patients identified with potential STDED. In 357 (88%) patients there was agreement between the two modalities about whether referral to an ophthalmologist was required (kappa 0.62). Retinal photography identified 38 patients for referral to ophthalmology which ophthalmoscopy missed. Of these, the ophthalmologist agreed that STDED was present in 32 (84%) and four patients required early laser. Ophthalmoscopy identified 13 patients for referral who were not identified by photography. Of these, the ophthalmologist agreed with the diabetologist that STDED was present in seven (54%) and one patient required early laser. Ophthalmoscopy may identify the occasional patient with diabetes who has STDED which is missed by retinal photography. For a systematic retinal screening programme, adding ophthalmoscopy to retinal photography will increase false-positive referrals and is likely to detect only a few extra patients requiring laser.\n"}]}]}}

We assessed whether the choice of either of these methods to obtain euglycaemia biases subsequent assessment of glucose metabolism and insulin action. We studied seven obese Type 2 diabetic patients twice Basal plasma glucose levels (mean +/- sd) were 5.5 +/- 0.5 and 10.7 +/- 2.9 mmol/l in the + ON and - ON studies, respectively, and were clamped at -5.5 mmol/l. Basal rates of glucose production (GP) were similar in the + ON and - ON studies, 83 +/- 13 vs. 85 +/- 14 mg m-2 min-1 (NS), whereas basal rates of glucose disappearance (Rd) were lower in the + ON than in the - ON study, 84 +/- 8 vs. 91 +/- 11 mg m-2 min-1 (P = 0.02).

Socioeconomic status for each individual patient was derived using Carstairs and Morris Deprivation Category ranging from 1 (least deprived) to 7 (most deprived) on the basis of the postcode sector of their address. In all, 129 lung cancer patients entered into the study. Of these data for 82 patients were complete (at baseline and follow-up). 57% of patients were of lower socioeconomic status and they had more health problems, less functioning, and more symptoms as compared to affluent patients. Of these, physical mobility (P = 0.05), energy (P = 0.01), role functioning (P = 0.04), physical functioning (P = 0.03), and breathlessness (P = 0.02) were significant at baseline. However, at follow-up assessment there was no significant difference between patient groups nor did any consistent pattern emerge. At baseline assessment patients of lower socioeconomic status showed lower health related quality of life. Since there was no clear trend at follow-up assessment this suggests that patients from different socioeconomic status responded to treatment similarly. In general, the findings suggest that quality of life is not only the outcome of the disease and its treatment, but is also highly dependent on each patients' socioeconomic characteristics.\n \nThe incidence of lung cancer cases among HIV-infected individuals is increasing with time. It is unclear whether HIV-infected individuals receive the same care for lung cancer as immunocompetent patients because of comorbidities, the potential for interaction between antiretroviral agents and cancer chemotherapy, and concerns regarding complications related to treatment or infection. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of HIV infection on receipt of guidance-concordant care, and its impact on overall survival among non-small cell lung cancer Medicare beneficiaries. The study design was a matched case-control design where each HIV patient was matched by age group, sex, race, and lung cancer stage at diagnosis with 20 controls randomly selected among those who were not HIV infected. The patients included in this study were Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer between 1998 and 2007, who qualified for Medicare on the basis of age and were 65 years of age or older at the time of lung cancer diagnosis. HIV infection status was based on Medicare claims data. A total of 174 HIV cases and 3480 controls were included in the analysis. Odds ratios for receiving guidance-concordant care and hazard ratios for overall survival were estimated. HIV infection was not independently associated with the receipt of guidance-concordant care. Among stage I/II patients, median survival times were 26 and 43 months, respectively, for those with and without HIV infection (odds ratio=1.48, P=0.021). HIV infection was not associated with receipt of guidance-concordant care but reduced survival in early-stage patients.\n"}]}]}}

Here a new liver failure model is introduced to assess whether bone marrow-derived progeny contribute to liver regeneration after acute hepatotoxic liver failure. Retrorsine was used to inhibit endogenous hepatocyte proliferation, before inducing acute liver failure by carbon tetrachloride. Bone marrow chimeras were generated before inducing liver failure to trace bone marrow-derived cells. Therefore, CD45 and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I dimorphic rat models were applied. Early after acute liver failure a multilineage inflammatory infiltrate was observed, mainly consisting of granulocytes. In long-term experiments small numbers of CD90+/CD45- cells of donor origin occurred in clusters associated with portal triads. Bone marrow cell infusion was not able to enhance liver regeneration. Cellular hypertrophy was the predominant way of liver mass regeneration in models applying retrorsine. Retrorsine pretreatment did not affect sensitivity for carbon tetrachloride. A multilineage inflammatory infiltrate was observed in rats whether pretreated with retrorsine or not. Few donor cells co-expressing CD90 (THY 1) were present in recipient livers, which may resemble donor-derived hematopoietic progenitors or oval cells. No other donor cells within liver parenchyma were detected. This is in contrast to other cell infusion models of acute cell death.\n"}]}]}}

After risk adjustment, the variable \"individual hospital\" demonstrated the strongest association with likelihood for FTR (likelihood ratio=39.1; p<0.001). Overall risk-adjusted mortality, cardiac arrest, and FTR rates varied across hospitals and did not correlate. High-performing hospitals with lowest FTR rates accrued longer postoperative and intensive care unit stays after the index operation (2 to 3 days; p<0.001). Significant hospital variation exists in cardiac surgical mortality and FTR rates after cardiac arrest. Institutional factors appear to confer the strongest influence on the likelihood for mortality after cardiac arrest compared with patient and operative factors.

Women residing in rural areas and in their 0-12 months after childbirth from 30 rural townships participated in a household survey. A structured questionnaire was used to evaluate women's socio-demographic characteristics, previous pregnant experiences, foetal characteristics and use of maternal health services. The scale for rural postnatal quality of life was adopted to assess postnatal quality of life from six dimensions The overall caeserean section rate was 70\u00b70% (962/1375), and most of them (59\u00b77%) were selected by maternal request.

The main objective of this study was to explore the role of uterine natural killer (uNK) cells and their regulatory cytokine IL-15 in irregular bleeding in HT users. This was a prospective observational study conducted between 2002 and 2004. The study was conducted in a tertiary referral menopause clinic at King Edward Memorial Hospital, Western Australia. Patients included 117 postmenopausal women taking combined HT. Outpatient endometrial biopsies were taken during and outside bleeding episodes. The relationship between endometrial uNK cells (CD56+) and bleeding patterns was measured. We also addressed the impact of HT exposure on uNK cell populations, the relationship between endometrial IL-15 expression and uNK cell populations, and killer Ig like receptor genotype in subjects with irregular bleeding. Endometrial CD56+ uNK cells were significantly increased in biopsies obtained during bleeding episodes (P < 0.001), compared with HT users with no bleeding. The highest level of IL-15 expression was also seen in biopsies taken during bleeding. No clear relationship between killer Ig like receptor genotype and bleeding on HT was observed. Little is known about the mechanisms underlying irregular bleeding in HT users.

The management of atypical endometrial hyperplasia (AEH) confined to EP is not yet established. Recently, an alternative pathological nomenclature has emerged using the term endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia (EIN) instead of atypia. The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety of conservative hysteroscopic resection of endometrial polyps with AEH or EIN. Retrospective cohort study of all cases of hysteroscopic resections of EP was performed at a single center between the years 2000-2011. All patients with a pathologic diagnosis of AEH in EP were included. A post-hoc revision of the pathologic specimens was made according to the EIN classification. Of the 32 patients with AEH in EP, 25 had normal endometrial curetting. Even with AEH confined to EP, 12 cases (48%) showed AEH (11 cases) or carcinoma (1 case) in the hysterectomy specimens. EIN in EP (14 cases) was correlated with 57% of diagnosis of EIN or carcinoma in the uterus; whereas in the absence of EIN in EP only 1 of 9 cases showed EIN in the final pathologic specimen (p=0.002), and none with carcinoma, which yields a PPV of 14% and a NPV of 100%. The diagnosis of EIN in EP may be a better predictor than AEH for endometrial involvement with malignant or pre-malignant neoplasms. The safety of conservative hysteroscopic resection of EP with AEH/EIN is questioned.\n"}]}]}}

We examined 60 patients with benign cystic thyroid nodules confirmed by fine-needle aspiration biopsy and divided them into 2 groups according to nonaspiration (group A, n = 30) or aspiration (group B, n = 30) of ethanol-mixed fluid after intracystic ethanol injection. We evaluated in both groups the complete disappearance of the cystic portion of the thyroid nodule on follow-up ultrasonography (first follow-up ultrasonography; mean, 4.6 months in group A; mean, 4.4 months in group B) (chi-square test), side effects or complications during and after the procedure (chi-square test), and the total procedure time (Student t test). Most patients showed complete disappearance of the cystic portion of the thyroid nodule (group A, n = 29; group B, n = 28), and they revealed no recurrence on follow-up ultrasonography. There was no statistical difference in the success rates between group A and group B (P > .05). Pain, the most common side effect, and other mild side effects or complications occurred in small numbers of patients in each group, but there was no significant difference in side effects or complications between the 2 groups (P > .05), except for intracystic hemorrhage (P < .05) and the complaint of all group B patients due to a double puncture (P < .001). The total procedure time was nearly double in group B than in group A because of the additional procedures, such as complete evacuation of the ethanol-mixed fluid and the 10-minute compression. Percutaneous ethanol injection without aspiration of ethanol-mixed fluid seems to be the preferable method of treatment of benign cystic thyroid nodules from the perspective of both the physician and the patient.\n \nThyroid nodules are common, and of those biopsied by fine-needle aspiration (FNA), the majority will be benign colloid nodules (BCN). Current guidelines suggest these BCN should be followed by ultrasonographic examination (US) every 3 years, with no endpoint specified. This study evaluated if long-term follow-up of benign thyroid nodules was associated with change in treatment or improvement in diagnosing a missed malignancy compared with short-term follow-up. All patients with FNA-based diagnosis of BCN at our institution from 1998 to 2009 were identified. Patients observed after the diagnosis were divided into short-term follow-up (<3 years) and long-term follow-up (\u22653 years). Rates of repeat FNA, thyroidectomy, and malignancy detection were compared. Of 738 patients with BCN, 92 patients underwent thyroid resection after the initial US. Six hundred forty-six patients were observed, of which 366 returned for 1 or more follow-up US Long-term follow-up of patients with BCN is associated with increased repeat FNA and US without improvement in the malignancy detection rate. After 3 years of follow-up, consideration should be given to ceasing long-term routine follow-up of biopsy-proven BCN.\n"}]}]}}

The aim of the present study is to re-evaluate the usefulness of the measurement of alpha-SU serum level in response to TRH stimulation in detecting the gonadotropic nature of nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas before the neurosurgical treatment. We have studied 14 patients with CNFPAs. The response of alpha-SU to the administration of TRH was studied in each patient before the surgery. alpha-SU blood serum level increase over 50% of the baseline level after TRH treatment was considered to be significant. The patients were divided into 2 groups, each including 7 subjects. The first group included the patients with gonadotropinomas (tumors immunopositive for FSH and/or LH or their free subunits). The second group included the patients with adenomas immunonegative for gonadotropins and alpha-SU. The basal level of alpha-SU was elevated over the upper limit of normal range in two patients of the first group (gonadotroph adenomas) and in one in the second group. All but one patient from the first group and none of seven patients with tumors immunonegative for FSH, LH or alpha-SU, had a significant alpha-SU (over 50%) response to TRH. In three of seven patients with gonadotropins immunonegative tumors a decrease of alpha-SU serum level after TRH was observed. The measurement of alpha-SU serum level in response to TRH administration seems to be useful in preoperative identification of gonadotroph adenomas among other nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas.\n"}]}]}}

The aim of the study was to evaluate if a direct single blockade of the LFCN in patients undergoing knee surgery resulted in a better tolerance to the tourniquet with equally good analgesic quality during surgery. A total of 40 patients undergoing knee arthroscopy received a proximal blockade of the sciatic nerve and randomly either an FN or an LFCN block. Practicability, onset time, quality of sensory and motor block, and clinical effectiveness during tourniquet and surgery were assessed. Stimulation time was significantly longer in the LFCN than in the FN group. Quality of sensory and motor block was worse in the LFCN than the NF group. Of the LFCN patients 65% indicated troublesome paraesthesia or pain when a tourniquet was placed, compared to 35% of the FN patients. Of the LFCN patients 50% had pain during cutaneous incision, compared to none of the FN group. During the course of surgery, 70% of the LFCN patients needed supplemental systemic analgesia, but this was required by only 30% of the FN group.

Fifty-three patients diagnosed with mono-radiculopathy in C5, 6, or 7. US-CRB with fluoroscopic confirmation was performed. After the cervical roots were identified in ultrasound imaging, a needle was gently introduced toward the posterior edge of the root using an in-plane approach. The spread of 1 mL and 4 mL contrast medium, each injected in the same needle position, was examined with anteroposterior and lateral fluoroscopic views. After contrast injection, a mixture of local anesthetic and corticosteroid was injected. Clinical outcome was assessed using a numeric rating scale before and 2 weeks after the procedure. Contrast medium did not spread into the epidural space in any patients with 1 mL contrast medium injection, but it did spread into the intraforaminal epidural space in 13 patients (24.5%) with 4 mL. Pain improved in all patients. There was no significant difference in pain relief according to the spreading pattern. The spreading pattern of injected solution in US-CRB could be partially affected by the injectant volume. However, further studies are needed to assess the importance of other factors, such as needle position and physiological effects.\n"}]}]}}

It offers an excellent weight loss and resolution of comorbidities in the short term with a very low incidence of complications. However, the ever present risk of a staple line leak is still a major concern. Since 2005, data from obese patients that undergo bariatric procedures in Germany are prospectively registered in an online database and analyzed at the Institute of Quality Assurance in Surgical Medicine. For the current analysis, all patients that had undergone primary sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity within a 7-year period were considered. Using the GBSR, data from 5.400 LSGs were considered for analysis. Staple line leak rate decreased during the study period from 6.5 to 1.4 %. Male gender, higher BMI, concomitant sleep apnea, conversion to laparotomy, longer operation time, use of both buttresses and oversewing, and the occurrence of intraoperative complications were associated with a significantly higher leakage rate. On multivariate analysis, operation time and year of procedure only had a significant impact on staple line leak rate. The results of the current study demonstrated that there are factors that increase the risk of a leakage which would enable surgeons to define risk groups, to more carefully select patients, and to offer a closer follow-up during the postoperative course with early recognition and adequate treatment. All future efforts should be focused on a further reduction of serious complications to make the LSG a widely accepted and safer procedure.\n \nAnastomotic complications such as leakage and bleeding remain among the most serious complications of laparoscopic colorectal surgery. No perfect method exists for accurate and reliable avoidance of these catastrophes. This study aimed to study the usefulness of routine intraoperative endoscopy (RIOE) by comparing the surgical outcomes for RIOE patients with those for selective intraoperative endoscopy (SIOE) patients. A retrospective chart review was performed for consecutive patients who underwent elective laparoscopic colorectal resections with distal anastomosis between January 2004 and May 2007. One surgeon performed RIOE, whereas the other three surgeons performed SIOE as necessary. All the abnormalities of IOE patients were managed with a subsequent salvage procedure, and the postoperative outcomes were compared between the RIOE and SIOE groups. The study included 107 patients in the RIOE group and 137 patients in the SIOE group. Abnormalities were detected in 11 RIOE patients (10.3%) (six with staple line bleeding, three with positive air leak test results, and two with additional pathology identified). All but one abnormality was laparoscopically managed without conversion to laparotomy. Whereas one patient experienced postoperative staple line bleeding that required a second operation, the remaining 10 patients recovered uneventfully. The mean hospital stay was 6 days (range, 4-9) days. The RIOE group had overall rates of 0% for anastomotic leakage and 0.9% for staple line bleeding. Intraoperative endoscopies were performed for 30 (21.9%) of the 137 patients in the SIOE group. The postoperative outcomes comparison between the RIOE and SIOE groups showed a tendency toward more overall anastomotic complications (0.9% vs. 5.1%) in the SIOE group, which due to the small sample size did not translate into significant differences in terms of staple line bleeding and anastomotic leakage. There also were no significant differences in other outcomes such as ileus, abdominal or pelvic sepsis, reoperation, positive distal margin, distance from distal margins, length of hospital stay, or mortality. Routine IOE for patients undergoing elective laparoscopic colorectal surgery with distal anastomosis can detect abnormalities at or around the anastomosis. Although the RIOE group had fewer postoperative anastomotic complications, due to the small sample size, the 5.7-fold increase in anastomotic failure did not translate into significantly better postoperative outcomes than the SIOE group experienced. A larger-scale single or multicenter prospective randomized study or a metaanalysis including similar studies is necessary for further investigation of this issue.\n"}]}]}}

To identify distinctive features in patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms, and to determine whether these symptoms support the hypothesis of the existence of specific somatic syndromes. Observational study, with a comparison control group. Four primary care practices affiliated with the University of Nijmegen in the Netherlands. One hundred and eighty-two patients diagnosed between 1998 and 2002 as having chronic functional somatic symptoms and 182 controls matched by age, sex, socioeconomic status, and practice were included. Data on comorbidity, referrals, diagnostic tests, and hospital admissions over a period of 10 years prior to the diagnosis were collected. Medication use and number of visits to the general practitioner (GP) were extracted from the moment computerised registration was started. In the 10 years before the diagnosis of chronic functional somatic symptoms, significantly more patients than controls presented functional somatic symptoms in at least two body systems, and used more somatic and psychotropic drugs. They visited the GP twice as much, statistically had significantly more psychiatric morbidity, and were referred more often to mental health workers and somatic specialists. The number of patients undergoing diagnostic tests was higher for patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms than for controls, but hospital admissions rates were equal. Patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms have a great diversity of functional somatic symptoms. They use more somatic and psychotropic drugs than controls in the years before diagnosis. Moreover, they show high rates of referrals and psychiatric morbidity. The diversity of symptoms of patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms supports the concept that symptoms do not cluster in well defined distinct syndromes. Therefore, patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms should preferably not be classified into medical subspecialty syndromes.\n \nTo study the effectiveness of combined integral somatic and psychiatric treatment in a medical-psychiatric unit (MPU). Retrospective case-note study. The case notes of all patients admitted to the MPU at the VU Medical Center, Amsterdam, in 2011 were analysed. Data on reasons for referral and somatic and psychiatric diagnoses were collected. Using a global clinical assessment scale and the Health of the Nations Outcome Scales (HoNOS), data on psychiatric symptomology and limitations, behavioural problems, social problems and limitations associated with physical health problems were collected on both admission and discharge. In this way the effect of the admission period on various problems was determined. In 2011 there were 139 admissions to the MPU with a wide variation of somatic and psychiatric diagnoses. The average admission period was 9 days. Global clinical evaluation of the treatment goals set for somatic and psychiatric conditions showed that more than 90% and 85% of the treatment goals, respectively, were completely achieved. HoNOS scores showed a reduction in severity of both psychiatric and somatic problems. The total HoNOS-core was significantly reduced by nearly 3.5 points - a large effect size. The MPU has succeeded in its goal to deliver integral care to a very diverse group of patients with somatic and psychiatric co-morbidities. It is able to offer care to a vulnerable patient group in which it can be presumed that treatment on a non-integrated unit could not have been delivered or not delivered adequately, due to the complexity of their somatic and behavioural problems.\n"}]}]}}

Incomplete bladder emptying may be related to bladder-sphincter dyssynergia. Ultrasonography and uroflowmetry are used in the initial evaluation of many children with voiding dysfunction. We determine in children with voiding dysfunction whether incomplete bladder emptying has an important role in the pathogenesis of urinary tract infections and whether abnormal ultrasonography or uroflowmetry can predict which children are at increased risk of recurrent UTIs. In this retrospective cohort study charts of 148 consecutive patients diagnosed with voiding dysfunction were reviewed for information regarding residual urine volumes on initial post-void ultrasound and the number of urinary tract infections on followup. Initial uroflowmetry curves were blindly reevaluated for this study. Considerable (greater than 10% predicted) post-void residual urine volumes were seen on 15% of ultrasounds, and 78% of uroflowmetry studies were characterized as abnormal. The volume of residual urine (corrected for age) showed a positive correlation with the number of UTIs occurring after the initial visit (r = 0.3, p <0.002). There was no correlation between an abnormal uroflow pattern and number of subsequent UTIs. Although increased residual urine on post-void ultrasound increases the risk of UTI recurrence in children with voiding dysfunction, it does not allow accurate identification of specific children at risk.\n \nTo determine the relationship between obesity and febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) in young children.

All subjects were subcategorized into 3 groups of lean, overweight, and obese using weight-for-length measurements. The effect of obesity on UTI risk was evaluated and odds ratios were calculated. We analyzed 465 patients with UTIs and 812 controls. The proportion of overweight and obese children was higher in patients with UTIs (22.8%) and acute pyelonephritis (APN; 31.1%) compared with those in the control (11.7%; P\u00a0<.05). After adjusting for age and gender, the odds ratio (OR) of UTI in obese relative to lean children was 1.84 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-3.05) and that of APN was 2.43 (95% CI, 1.27-4.62). The OR of APN in overweight relative to lean children was 1.96 (95% CI, 1.11-3.46). After adjusting for age, the OR of APN in obese relative to lean boys was 2.74 (95% CI, 1.11-6.77) and that in overweight to lean girls was 2.48 (95% CI, 1.05-5.83). Within patients with UTIs, compared with lean children, the obese showed a longer duration of fever and a higher frequency of APN and the overweight had a higher incidence of hydronephrosis (P\u00a0<.05). Obesity may be associated with higher odds of a febrile UTI and APN in young children.\n"}]}]}}

We conducted descriptive analyses using the 2008 and 2010 Chronic Conditions Public Use Files, which are newly available from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and have administrative (claims) data on 100% of the Medicare fee-for-service population. We examined the data by age, sex, and dual eligibility (eligibility for both Medicare and Medicaid). Medicare Part A beneficiaries had more chronic conditions on average in 2010 than in 2008. The percentage increase in the average number of chronic conditions was larger for dual-eligible beneficiaries (2.8%) than for nondual-eligible beneficiaries (1.2%). The prevalence of some chronic conditions, such as congestive heart failure, ischemic heart disease, and stroke/transient ischemic attack, decreased. The deterioration of average health was due to other chronic conditions Analyzing the prevalence of 11 chronic conditions by using Medicare claims data provides a monitoring tool that can guide health care providers and policy makers in devising strategies to address chronic conditions and rising health care costs.\n \nDiagnostic imaging services have been repeatedly targeted as a source of excess health care expenditure. In particular, MRI is considered a high-tech and high-cost imaging service that saw rapid increases in utilization in the early 2000s. However, the most recent trends in the utilization of MR are not known. The aim of this study was to quantify trends in MR utilization overall and by body system from 1998 to 2010 in the Medicare population. Medicare Part B data sets were obtained for 1998 to 2010 for all MR examinations performed in the Medicare population. Using Current Procedural Terminology codes, the total volume and utilization rates of all MR examinations were tabulated for each year of the study period. MR volume was then categorized by body system. The utilization rate of MR examinations in the Medicare population was 73 per 1,000 beneficiaries in 1998, increased to a peak of 189 in 2008, and decreased to 183 in 2010. The compound annual growth rate from 1998 to 2008 was 10%. The utilization rate in 2010 represents a decrease of 3.1% from the 2009 utilization rate. The most frequently imaged body section in every year was the head, which accounted for 2,404,250 examinations in 2010, 37.3% of all MR examinations in that year. The overall MRI utilization rate sharply increased from 1998 until 2008 but then decreased in each of the next 2 years. A similar trend was noted for MR examinations performed in most body sections. These trends are likely to be the result of a number of possible causative factors.\n"}]}]}}

The three midwife obstetric units (MOUs) in a health district of Mpumalanga were included in the study. Two MOUs enrolled in the PEP and the third did not. A 'before-and-after' study design was used to assess any changes in practice, and to monitor whether any changes occurred in the district during the time of the study; data were also collected at the third MOU. Data were collected by scoring of the obstetric files after the patient had delivered. We ascertained whether the obstetric history, syphilis testing, blood group testing, haemoglobin measurement and uterine growth assessment were performed during antenatal care along with whether appropriate action was taken. For intrapartum care, estimation of fetal weight, the performance of pelvimetry, blood pressure monitoring, urine testing, evaluation of head above pelvis, fetal heart rate monitoring, monitoring of contractions and plotting of cervical dilatation, and whether the appropriate actions were taken, were assessed. Eight of the 13 midwives at the two MOUs completed the PEP and all demonstrated an improvement in knowledge. Case notes of 303 patients from the various clinics were studied. There was no change in the referral patterns of any of the clinics during the study period. The obstetric history was well documented, but in no group was there a satisfactory response to a detected problem; appropriate action was taken in between 0% and 12% of cases. Syphilis testing was performed in 56-82% of cases, with no difference between the groups. The haemoglobin level was measured in only 4-15% of patients, with no difference before or after completion of the PEP. Where a problem in uterine growth was detected, an appropriate response occurred in 0-8% of patients and no difference before or after completion of the PEP was ascertained. In all groups, estimation of fetal weight and pelvimetry were seldom performed, the urine and fetal heart rate documentation were moderately well done and the blood pressure monitoring, assessment of head above pelvis, monitoring of contractions and plotting of cervical dilatation were usually performed. No differences before or after the PEP were detected. Where problems were detected, appropriate actions taken during labour improved, but not significantly. Completion of the obstetric manual of the PEP improved the knowledge of the midwives but no alteration in practice was detected.\n \nThe aims of the study were to find out the maternal and perinatal outcome of early onset severe preeclampsia (PE) in a tertiary care center in a developing country like India and to determine whether expectant management in such a setup improves the perinatal outcome. It was a retrospective study. All women with early PE were admitted stabilized and evaluated. Expectant management was given whenever there was no indication for eminent delivery. The perinatal outcome of the expectant group was compared with that of the aggressive group, and appropriate statistical analysis was carried out. A total of 106 women were admitted with severe PE, 61 were treated aggressively, and 45 were stable enough to receive expectant management. The total days gained on expectant management was 7 days. Perinatal mortality was 31.13%. Perinatal outcome of the expectant and aggressive management groups did not differ (P = 0.141); there was no increase in maternal complications on expectant management. There were 2 cases of maternal mortality in the aggressively managed group. Perinatal mortality in severe PE is high. There was no increase in maternal morbidity on expectant management; however, there was no difference in perinatal mortality on expectant management.\n"}]}]}}

A total of 1369 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer underwent radical prostatectomy by a single surgeon between 1991 and 2001. A subset of 203 patients (14.9%), who had undergone at least one prior benign prostate biopsy for a rising prostate-specific antigen and/or abnormal digital rectal examination, constituted our study population. A total of 1115 patients with no prior biopsy represented our control group. After prostatectomy, patients were evaluated at 6-month intervals for biochemical evidence of recurrence, defined as a prostate-specific antigen level of 0.5 ng/mL or greater. Patients with a prior benign biopsy had more favorable pathologic features with more organ-confined (74% versus 64%; P <0.001) and less margin-positive (9.8% versus 18%) disease. Only 24 patients (12%) in the study group (versus 20% in control group; P = 0.01) had eventual evidence of biochemical failure. Kaplan-Meier analyses suggested that patients with prior benign biopsies have improved biochemical disease-free survival, especially for those with more aggressive disease (Gleason sum 7 or greater; P <0.01). Overall, patients in the study group had lower probability (odds ratio 0.57, P <0.001) of biochemical failure compared with those in the control group. A prior benign prostate biopsy may be independently associated with more favorable surgical and biochemical outcomes after prostatectomy.

Study 1. We recruited 24 patients awaiting standard 12-core TRUS-guided biopsies of the prostate to undergo PHS immediately beforehand. We compared PHS with the TRUS-guided biopsy results in terms of their ability to detect cancer within the whole prostate and to localize it to the correct side and to the correct region of the prostate. Lesions that were suspicious on PHS were biopsied separately. Study 2. We recruited 57 patients awaiting TTB to have PHS beforehand. We compared PHS with the TTB pathology results in terms of their ability to detect prostate cancer within the whole gland and to localize it to the correct side and to the correct sextant of the prostate. Study 3. We recruited 24 patients awaiting radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer to undergo preoperative PHS. We compared PHS with standardized pathological analysis of the whole-mount prostatectomy specimens in terms of their measurement of total tumour volume within the prostate, tumour volume within prostate sextants and volume of index lesions identified by PHS. The PHS-targeted biopsies had an overall cancer detection rate of 38.1%, compared with 62.5% with standard TRUS-guided biopsies. The sensitivity and specificity of PHS for localizing tumour to the correct prostate sextant, compared with standard TRUS-guided biopsies, were 100 and 5.9%, respectively. The PHS-targeted biopsies had an overall cancer detection rate of 13.4% compared with 54.4% for standard TTB. PHS had a sensitivity and specificity for cancer detection in the posterior gland of 100 and 13%, respectively, and for the anterior gland, 6 and 82%, respectively. We found no correlation between total tumour volume estimates from PHS and radical prostatectomy pathology (Pearson correlation coefficient -0.096). Sensitivity and specificity of PHS for detecting tumour foci \u22650.2\u2009mL in volume were 63 and 53%. These three independent studies in 105 patients suggest that PHS does not reliably identify and characterize prostate cancer in the routine clinical setting.\n"}]}]}}

Between 1990 and 2004, 89 patients (49 male and 40 female) each with a pulmonary hydatid cyst were treated surgically. The patients were divided into two groups based on whether capitonnage was carried out (group 1, n = 44) or not (group 2, n = 45). Cystotomy and the closure of the bronchial openings were carried out in both groups. The results were assessed in two groups during a 1 year follow-up period. The groups were comparable with regards to their clinical, operative and demographic characteristics. There was no mortality, and no significant difference in hospitalisation time between the two groups. It was 8.2 +/- 3.2 days for group 1 and 8 +/- 3.1 days for group 2 (P = 0.89). The most serious complications were restricted bronchopleural fistula (only one patient in group 2), empyema (only one patient in group 1 and two patients in group 2), and prolonged air leak (five patients in group 1 and six patients in group 2).

Thirty-six patients (51-82 years) with vertebral localization of MM were randomly divided into two groups Technical success was 100 % in both groups.

The amount of medication was equally decreased in the two groups. No statistically significant difference was noted. No major complication occurred and two patients died from other causes. The use of percutaneous vertebroplasty alone appears to be effective for the pain management of the patients with vertebral involvement of multiple myeloma. The use of RFA that includes cost and time does not offer any clear added benefit on the midterm pain management of such patients.\n"}]}]}}

The purposes of this study were to (1) explore predictive factors of functional level at discharge, (2) evaluate 1-year mortality after hip fracture compared with that of the general population, and (3) evaluate the affect of early functional outcome on 1-year mortality in patients operated on for hip fractures. A total of 228 consecutive patients (average age, 77.6 \u00b1 7.4 years) with hip fractures who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled in an open, prospective, observational cohort study. Functional level at discharge was measured with the motor Functional Independence Measure (FIM) score, which is the most widely accepted functional assessment measure in use in the rehabilitation community. Mortality rates in the study population were calculated in absolute numbers and as the standardized mortality ratio. Multivariate regression analysis was used to explore predictive factors for motor FIM score at discharge and for 1-year mortality adjusted for important baseline variables. Age, health status, cognitive level, preinjury functional level, and pressure sores after hip fracture surgery were independently related to lower discharge motor FIM scores. At 1-year followup, 57 patients (25%; 43 women and 14 men) had died. The 1-year hip fracture mortality rate compared with that of the general population was 31% in our population versus 7% for men and 23% in our population versus 5% for women 65 years or older. The 1-year standardized mortality rate was 341.3 (95% CI, 162.5-520.1) for men and 301.6 (95% CI, 212.4-391.8) for women, respectively. The all-cause mortality rate observed in this group was higher in all age groups and in both sexes when compared with the all-cause age-adjusted mortality of the general population. Motor FIM score at discharge was the only independent predictor of 1-year mortality after hip fracture. Functional level at discharge is the main determinant of long-term mortality in patients with hip fracture. Motor FIM score at discharge is a reliable predictor of mortality and can be recommended for clinical use.\n"}]}]}}

One mechanism proposed for this association is that green space provides a venue for, and therefore encourages, physical activity. It has also been suggested that socio-economic health inequalities may be narrower in greener areas because of the equalised opportunity for physical activity green spaces provide. However, research exploring associations between the availability of green space and physical activity has produced mixed results. Limits to the assessment of the type and amount of physical activity which occurs specifically in green space may account for these mixed findings. This observational study was therefore concerned with the extent to which green space is a venue for physical activity and whether this could account for narrower socio-economic health inequalities in greener neighbourhoods. Secondary analysis of cross sectional data on 3679 adults (16+) living in urban areas across Scotland matched with a neighbourhood level measure of green space availability. Associations between green space availability and both total physical activity, and activity specifically within green space, were explored using logistic regression models. Interactions between socio-economic position and physical activity were assessed. All models adjusted for age, sex and household income. The availability of green space in a neighbourhood was not associated with total physical activity or that specifically in green space. There was no evidence that income-related inequalities in physical activity within green space were narrower in greener areas of Scotland. Physical activity may not be the main mechanism explaining the association between green space and health in Scotland. The direct effect of perceiving a natural environment on physiological and psychological health may offer an alternative explanation.\n"}]}]}}

There was no association between FI and age, sex, body mass index, or living with/without a partner. Our data indicate that FI is still a serious health problem-FI currently affects more than half of the nursing home residents in Ostrava, Czech Republic. The study outcomes (revealed high prevalence and seriousness of FI) emphasize the importance of close monitoring and appropriately managing FI in nursing home residents.\n \nThe Tokyo guidelines for diagnostic criteria and severity assessment of acute cholecystitis (AC), published in 2007, recommend early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (ELC) be done as soon as possible after the onset of symptoms. We conducted this study to analyze the changes in the therapeutic strategy for AC in a surgical center in Tunisia after the Tokyo guidelines were published. Between January, 2005 and January, 2013, 649 patients underwent cholecystectomy for AC at the Department of Surgery, Mohamed Tahar Maamouri Hospital in Nabeul, Tunisia. The study period was subdivided into before (n\u00a0=\u00a0192) and after (n\u00a0=\u00a0457) the publication of the Tokyo guidelines, that is, prior to and including 2007, and from 2008 onward, respectively. We reviewed patient records retrospectively to collect demographic data, biochemical data, radiological findings, and postoperative outcomes. All these factors were compared between the groups. The duration of symptoms before surgery was significantly longer before 2008 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.018). ELC was significantly more frequent after 2008 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). Laparoscopic surgery was converted to open surgery in 16.1\u00a0% of patients before 2008 vs. 7.8\u00a0% of patients after 2008 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). There were no significant differences in bile duct injury or postoperative complications between the groups. The length of preoperative, postoperative, and total hospital stay was longer before 2008. ELC is a safe and effective therapeutic strategy for AC. The Tokyo guidelines resulted in a significant increase in the number of ELCs being performed and significantly reduced preoperative and total hospital stay without increasing intra- and postoperative complications. Importantly, ELC reduced medical costs, which is crucial for a country with limited resources, such as Tunisia.\n"}]}]}}

To ascertain wheter vaginal lesions have a natural history similar to cervical lesions. A retrospective study to identify patients with vaginal lesions and synchronous cervical lesions through biopsy. The rate of mild cervical lesions (koilocytosis, warts, CIN I with and without koilocytosis) was compared with the rate of severe cervical lesions (CIN II and III, cervical carcinoma) in patients with mild vaginal lesions (warts and koilocytosis, and low-grade VAIN) and in patients with severe vaginal lesions (high-grade VAIN). Using koilocytosis as a marker, the rate of \"active\" cervical lesions was compared with the rate of \"non active\" cervical lesions in patients with \"active\" versus \"non active\" vaginal lesions. Finally, the rates of mild and severe cervical lesions were compared among each group of VAIN (low-grade, high-grade, with or without koilocytosis). In patients with mild vaginal lesions, mild cervical lesions were significantly more frequent than severe cervical lesions. In patients with \"active\" vaginal lesions the rate of \"active\" cervical lesions was significantly higher than \"non active\" cervical lesions. The differences in rates of mild cervical lesions and severe cervical lesions among patients with high-grade VAIN and low-grade VAIN (with and without koilocytosis) were not significant. These data suggest that CIN and VAIN may have some common features in certain cases, i.e., if an HPV infection is proved.\n \nThe objective of this study was to determine the outcome of women who underwent hysterectomy for recurrent cytological abnormalities where repeat loop treatment was considered not to be technically possible because of insufficient remaining cervical tissue. Women undergoing a hysterectomy for the above indication at the Northern Gynaecological Cancer Centre over a period of 10 years (1992-2001) were identified from a prospectively collected database. Case notes were then reviewed and women undergoing hysterectomy for other indications were excluded. Relevant demographic and clinical data were then extracted. 33 patients meeting the above criteria were identified. The overall hysterectomy rate for this indication was 0.73%. 20 out of the 33 women had significant pathology on the hysterectomy specimen. 95% of these had high-grade disease with one having a Stage 1A1 squamous carcinoma. None of the patients required more radical treatment than a simple hysterectomy. There were no major complications following the hysterectomy. Positive endocervical margins on the previous loop specimen (P = 0.05) was an important correlating factor predicting the presence of CIN on the hysterectomy specimen. One out of the thirty hysterectomies (3.3%) performed using the vaginal route had incomplete excision compared to one of three (33%) using the abdominal route. Hysterectomy was successful in treating 85.2% of the women; only 4 women subsequently developed vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia. Simple hysterectomy appears to be a suitable diagnostic and treatment option for women with recurrent high-grade cytological abnormalities where further loop treatment is technically not possible. Incomplete excision at the endocervical margin on the previous loop specimen was the main factor associated with the presence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia at hysterectomy.\n"}]}]}}

We sought to investigate whether contact with specialist care was associated with lifestyle factors or socioeconomic status. Nationwide population-based prospective cohort study in Denmark, based on a random sample of 51 090 women aged 20 years or older from the general population. A web-based questionnaire regarding gynecological alarm symptoms and lifestyle was distributed to the invited individuals. Data about contact with specialist care were obtained from the National Patient Register and the National Health Insurance Service Registry, whereas information about socioeconomic status was collected from Statistics Denmark. Main outcome measures were percentages of patients having contact with specialist care and odds ratios (ORs) for associations between specialist care contact, lifestyle factors and socioeconomic status. The study included 25 866 nonpregnant women; 2957 reported the onset of at least one gynecological cancer alarm symptom, and 683 of these (23.1%) reported symptoms to their general practitioner. The proportion of individuals having contact with specialist care ranged from 39.3% (pain during intercourse) to 47.8% (bleeding during intercourse). Individuals with higher educational level had significantly higher odds of contact with a specialist (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.17-2.95). Educational level influences contact with specialist care among patients with gynecological cancer alarm symptoms.

Conventional screening criteria are too limiting and exclude suitable heart donors. Echocardiography is now widely available and is a reliable tool to assess left ventricular dysfunction in brain-dead donors. Yet few data are available on the degree of left ventricular dysfunction where a transplantation is possible. Fifty-five potential brain-dead heart donors (age 38 +/- 11 years) were prospectively evaluated by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) before harvesting. Fractional area change (FAC) was used to assess left ventricular function in potential brain-dead donors. Transplanted hearts were evaluated on the fifth postoperative day. The transplantation was considered a success if the recipient was alive, not retransplanted, without an assistance device or an epinephrine infusion of more than 1 mg/h and showed an ejection fraction above 40%. Of the 55 potential heart donors, 20 exhibited an FAC of less than 50%. Forty hearts were harvested, 36 of which were successfully transplanted. Nine patients had an FAC below 50% (group H2) and 27 had an FAC over 50% (group H1). Four patients died TEE is useful to assess left ventricular function in potential brain-dead donors. An FAC less than 50% is present in 36% of potential heart donors. Because left ventricular dysfunction is often reversible shortly after transplantation, an FAC below 50% may not necessarily preclude the use of hearts for transplantation.\n \nPatients presenting with stroke or transient cerebral ischemic episodes often undergo transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) as part of their initial evaluation. Previous studies have demonstrated that TEE is superior to transthoracic echocardiography for the detection of potential cardiac sources of embolism. In our institution, this scenario now represents the most frequent reason for requesting TEE. For the most part, these TEE examinations are ordered by a neurologist, and transthoracic echocardiography is not performed beforehand. Over a 2-year period, TEE was requested for 137 patients at our institution for the evaluation of a cerebral ischemic event. The complete hospital chart was available for review in 106 of these patients, and they form the study group. All patients underwent TEE using either a biplane or omniplane transducer, with Doppler color flow imaging and saline contrast administration performed in every case. Studies were reviewed for the presence of possible cardiac or aortic sources of cerebral emboli, and hospital charts were reviewed to collect clinical information. A potential cardiovascular embolic source was detected in 35% of patients. Abnormalities were discovered in 53% (16/30) of patients with atrial fibrillation vs 28% (21/76) of patients in sinus rhythm (P < .001). Both patients who had left atrial thrombus and 12 of 13 with left atrial spontaneous contrast had atrial fibrillation (P < .001). Protruding aortic atherosclerotic debris was the most frequent abnormality among patients in sinus rhythm. It may not be cost-effective to perform TEE as a routine diagnostic procedure in patients presenting with cerebral ischemic events. Most patients with atrial fibrillation are candidates for empiric warfarin sodium therapy, and patients in sinus rhythm usually have findings for which there is no recommended therapy or for which only aspirin is indicated.\n"}]}]}}

Twenty-eight female Sprague Dawley rats were allocated randomly to 4 groups. The sham group (group 1) was only subjected to catheter insertion, not to pneumoperitoneum. Group 2 received a 1 mg/kg dose of 0.9% sodium chloride by the intraperitoneal route for 10 min before pneumoperitoneum. Groups 3 and 4 received 6 and 12 mg/kg edaravone, respectively, by the intraperitoneal route for 10 min before pneumoperitoneum. After 60 min of pneumoperitoneum, the gas was deflated. Immediately after the reperfusion period, both ovaries were excised for histological scoring, caspase-3 immunohistochemistry and biochemical evaluation including glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. Also, total antioxidant capacity (TAC) was measured in plasma samples to evaluate the antioxidant effect of edaravone. Ovarian sections in the saline group revealed higher scores for follicular degeneration and edema (p < 0.0001) when compared with the sham group. Administration of different doses of edaravone in rats significantly prevented degenerative changes in the ovary (p < 0.0001). Caspase-3 expression was only detected in the ovarian surface epithelium in all groups, and there was a significant difference between the treatment groups and the saline group (p < 0.0001). Treatment of rats with edaravone reduced caspase-3 expression in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, biochemical measurements of oxidative stress markers (MDA, GSH and TAC) revealed that prophylactic edaravone treatment attenuated oxidative stress induced by I/R injury. These results indicate that prophylactic treatment with edaravone prevents I/R-induced ovarian damage during pneumoperitoneum in an experimental rat model.\n \nIn several studies, the prolonged exposure to talc has been associated with development of ovarian cancer. However, some studies have advocated contrary views. The present study aims to investigate histopathological changes and whether long-term talc exposure is associated with potential carcinogenic effects on the female genital organs of rats. The present study was conducted at Dumlupinar University Medical Faculty and a total of 28 Sprague-Dawley rats were included. The experimental animals were allocated into four groups having seven rats each. Groups 1 and 2 served as controls, where the rats in Group 1 did not receive any intervention and Group 2 received intravaginal saline. Groups 3 and 4 received intravaginal or perineal talc application, respectively. Talc was applied for 3 months on a daily basis. Histopathological changes in the peritoneum and female genital system were evaluated. For statistical analyses, Fisher's exact test was carried out using SPSS. In both the groups exposed to talc (Groups 3 and 4), evidence of foreign body reaction and infection, along with an increase in inflammatory cells, were found in all the genital tissues. Genital infection was observed in 12 rats in the study group and 2 rats in the control group. Neoplastic change was not found. However, there was an increase in the number of follicles in animals exposed to talc. No peritoneal change was observed. In the groups not exposed to talc, similar infectious findings were found, but there was a statistically significant difference between the groups (Groups 1 and 2 vs. Groups 3 and 4, P > 0.05). Neoplastic change was also not observed in these groups. Four groups were compared in terms of neoplastic effects and infections. In Groups 1, 5 rats were normal, two developed vulvovaginitis and endometritis with overinfection (in both ovaries), and one developed salpingitis (in both fallopian tubes), that is, infection was found in a total of two rats. In Group 2, only one experimental animal had endometritis. All the animals in Groups 3 and 4 developed infections. Talc has unfavorable effects on the female genital system. However, this effect is in the form of foreign body reaction and infection, rather than being neoplastic.\n"}]}]}}

The lace plant (Aponogeton madagascariensis) produces perforations in its leaves through PCD. The leaves of the plant consist of a latticework of longitudinal and transverse veins enclosing areoles. PCD occurs in the cells at the center of these areoles and progresses outwards, stopping approximately five cells from the vasculature. The role of mitochondria during PCD has been recognized in animals; however, it has been less studied during PCD in plants. The following paper elucidates the role of mitochondrial dynamics during developmentally regulated PCD in vivo in A. madagascariensis. A single areole within a window stage leaf (PCD is occurring) was divided into three areas based on the progression of PCD; cells that will not undergo PCD (NPCD), cells in early stages of PCD (EPCD), and cells in late stages of PCD (LPCD). Window stage leaves were stained with the mitochondrial dye MitoTracker Red CMXRos and examined. Mitochondrial dynamics were delineated into four categories (M1-M4) based on characteristics including distribution, motility, and membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m). A TUNEL assay showed fragmented nDNA in a gradient over these mitochondrial stages. Chloroplasts and transvacuolar strands were also examined using live cell imaging. The possible importance of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) formation during PCD was indirectly examined via in vivo cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment. This treatment resulted in lace plant leaves with a significantly lower number of perforations compared to controls, and that displayed mitochondrial dynamics similar to that of non-PCD cells. Results depicted mitochondrial dynamics in vivo as PCD progresses within the lace plant, and highlight the correlation of this organelle with other organelles during developmental PCD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of mitochondria and chloroplasts moving on transvacuolar strands to form a ring structure surrounding the nucleus during developmental PCD. Also, for the first time, we have shown the feasibility for the use of CsA in a whole plant system. Overall, our findings implicate the mitochondria as playing a critical and early role in developmentally regulated PCD in the lace plant.\n \nThe hypothesis was tested that pectin content and methylation degree participate in regulation of cell wall mechanical properties and in this way may affect tissue growth and freezing resistance over the course of plant cold acclimation and de-acclimation. Experiments were carried on the leaves of two double-haploid lines of winter oil-seed rape (Brassica napus subsp. oleifera), differing in winter survival and resistance to blackleg fungus (Leptosphaeria maculans). Plant acclimation in the cold (2 degrees C) brought about retardation of leaf expansion, concomitant with development of freezing resistance. These effects were associated with the increases in leaf tensile stiffness, cell wall and pectin contents, pectin methylesterase (EC 3.1.1.11) activity and the low-methylated pectin content, independently of the genotype studied. However, the cold-induced modifications in the cell wall properties were more pronounced in the leaves of the more pathogen-resistant genotype. De-acclimation promoted leaf expansion and reversed most of the cold-induced effects, with the exception of pectin methylesterase activity. The results show that the temperature-dependent modifications in pectin content and their methyl esterification degree correlate with changes in tensile strength of a leaf tissue, and in this way affect leaf expansion ability and its resistance to freezing and to fungus pathogens.\n"}]}]}}

Since optotypes are evaluated on individuals with good visual acuity and without eye disorders, differences in the lower visual acuity range cannot be excluded. In this study, visual acuity measured with the Snellen E was compared to the Landolt C acuity. 100 patients (age 8 - 90 years, median 60.5 years) with various eye disorders, among them 39 with amblyopia due to strabismus, and 13 healthy volunteers were tested. Charts with the Snellen E and the Landolt C (Precision Vision) which mimic the ETDRS charts were used to assess visual acuity. Three out of 5 optotypes per line had to be correctly identified, while wrong answers were monitored. In the group of patients, the eyes with the lower visual acuity, and the right eyes of the healthy subjects, were evaluated. Differences between Landolt C acuity (LR) and Snellen E acuity (SE) were small. The mean decimal values for LR and SE were 0.25 and 0.29 in the entire group and 0.14 and 0.16 for the eyes with strabismus amblyopia.

Asthma severity was assessed using the GINA criteria; accordingly, a patient was classified as receiving inadequate treatment if his/her current use of drugs was lower than that suggested by the guidelines for the corresponding severity level. The absence of asthma attacks in the last 3 months was used as an indicator of the disease control. Fifty-five percent of the patients had persistent asthma. Overall, 48% (95% CI 41.2-54.8) of persistent asthmatics were receiving inadequate treatment, and 66% (95% CI 59.5-72.4) had not used their medication daily over the past 3 months. Persistent asthmatics who were inadequately treated had a significantly greater frequency of asthma attacks (geometric mean ratio 3.7; 95% CI 2.1-6.6) than those using an adequate dose of medication. Mild and moderate persistent asthmatics using an adequate medication regimen reported a low number of asthma attacks (median 0).

Despite the increase in the use of inhaled corticosteroids, half of the persistent asthmatics from the general population are using a medication regimen below their severity level.

However, few studies give accurate estimates of the health effects of passive smoking in children with asthma using an objective measure of exposure. The effects of passive smoking using salivary cotinine levels to measure exposure were investigated. A sample of 438 children aged 2-12 years with asthma who had a parent who smoked were recruited in Tayside and Fife, Scotland. Health service contacts for asthma, assessed from GP case records, were used as a proxy for morbidity. A weak U-shaped relationship was found between the salivary cotinine level and health service contacts for asthma High levels of parental smoking in the home are associated with a reduction in health care contacts for asthma. This could be due to a lack of awareness of asthma symptoms among heavy smokers or a reluctance to visit the GP. Children with asthma who have parents who smoke heavily may not be receiving adequate management.\n"}]}]}}

Our long-term study showed significantly better (2-fold) results regarding the continence score for the abdominal approach compared with the transanal pull-through. The stool pattern and enterocolitis scores were somewhat better for the TERPT group. These findings raise an important issue about the current surgical management of HD; however, more cases will need to be studied before a definitive conclusion can be drawn.\n \nTo examine the progress of the airway obstruction over time in children with cerebral palsy (CP) and the timing of any interventions. The medical notes of patients with CP younger than 16 years admitted with airway obstruction to a tertiary referral Pediatric Otolaryngology Center from 2006 to 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. The gender, age of referral, co-morbidities, type of surgical intervention and age this was performed and the time interval between sequential surgeries were documented. Fifteen children with CP and airway obstruction were admitted, eight boys and seven girls with an average age of referral 8 years (range 3-13.3 years). Adenotonsillectomy was performed in 11/15 patients at a mean age of 9.1 years (range 4.5-14 years). Tracheostomy was performed in 8/15 children at an average age of 11.6 years (range 7.5-15 years). Seven out of 11 patients having undergone adenotonsillectomy, required tracheostomy after an average time interval of 1.9 years (range 0.5-3.5 years). Tracheostomy was performed in 80% of referred patients with CP older than 10 years, while surgical intervention was uncommon in children younger than 5 years. There was a statistically significant correlation between the age of the children and the performance of a tracheostomy (Pearson's correlation coefficient 0.68, p = 0.005). The severity of the airway obstruction in children with CP tends to increase with age. We postulate that this increase results from worsening hypotonia of pharyngeal musculature. Children with CP and severe upper airway obstruction are likely to require tracheostomy as they grow older.\n"}]}]}}

Relatively little attention has been paid to whether the sex of the physician affects the rates of cancer screening among women. We examined differences between male and female physicians in the frequency of screening mammograms and Pap smears among women patients enrolled in a large Midwestern health plan. We identified claims for mammography and Pap tests submitted by primary care physicians for 97,962 women, 18 to 75 years of age, who were enrolled in the health plan in 1990. The sex of the physician was manually coded, and the physician's age was obtained from the state licensing board. After identifying a principal physician for each woman, we calculated the frequency of mammography and Pap smears for each physician, using the number of women in his or her practice during 1990 as the denominator. Using unconditional logistic regression, we also calculated the odds ratio of having a Pap smear or mammogram for women patients with female physicians as compared with those with male physicians, controlling for the physician's and the patient's age. Crude rates for Pap smears and mammography were higher for the patients of female than male physicians in most age groups of physicians. The largest differences between female and male physicians were in the rates of Pap smears among the youngest physicians. For the subgroup of women enrolled in the health plan for a year who saw only one physician, after adjustment for the patient's age and the physician's age and specialty, the odds ratio for having a Pap smear was 1.99 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.72 to 2.30) for the patients of female physicians as compared with those of male physicians. For women 40 years old and older, the odds ratio for having a mammogram was 1.41 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.22 to 1.63). For both Pap smears and mammography, the differences between female and male physicians in screening rates were much more pronounced in internal medicine and family practice than in obstetrics and gynecology. Women are more likely to undergo screening with Pap smears and mammograms if they see female rather than male physicians, particularly if the physician is an internist or family practitioner.\n \nFew studies have explored health care market structure and colorectal cancer (CRC) screening test use, and little is known whether market factors contribute to racial/ethnic screening disparities. We investigated whether HMO market level factors, controlling for individual covariates, differentially impact Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) subjects' access to CRC screening compared with white subjects. We used random intercept hierarchical models to predict CRC test use. Individual-level survey data was linked to market data by metropolitan statistical areas from InterStudy. Insured first-degree relatives, ages 40-80, of a random sample of colorectal cancer cases identified from the California Cancer Registry Dependent variables were receipt of (1) annual fecal occult blood test only; (2) sigmoidoscopy in the past 5 years; (3) colonoscopy in the past 10 years; and (4) any of these tests over the recommended time interval. Market characteristics were HMO penetration, HMO competition, and proportion of staff/group/network HMOs. Market characteristics were as important as individual-level characteristics for AAPI but not for white subjects. Among AAPI subjects, a 10% increase in the percent of group/staff/network model HMO was associated with a reduction in colonoscopy use (28.9% to 20.5%) and in receipt of any of the CRC tests (53.2% to 45.4%). The prevailing organizational structure of a health care market confers a penalty on access to CRC test use among high-risk AAPI subjects but not among high-risk white subjects. Identifying the differential effect of market structure on race/ethnicity can potentially reduce the cancer burden among disadvantaged racial groups.\n"}]}]}}

Indications included evaluation anemia/gastrointestinal bleed, small bowel IBD and dilation of strictures. Video-capsule endoscopy (VCE) was used prior to DBE in 43 of the 66 patients prior to DBE evaluation. The mean age was 62 years. Thirty-two patients were female, 15 were African-American; 44 antegrade and 44 retrograde DBEs were performed. The mean time per antegrade DBE was 107.4\u00b130.0 minutes with a distance of 318.4\u00b1152.9 cm reached past the pylorus. The mean time per lower DBE was 100.7\u00b127.3 minutes with 168.9\u00b1109.1 cm meters past the ileocecal valve reached. Endoscopic therapy in the form of electrocautery to ablate bleeding sources was performed in 20 patients (30.3%), biopsy in 17 patients (25.8%) and dilation of Crohn's-related small bowel strictures in 4 (6.1%). 43 VCEs with pathology noted were performed prior to DBE, with findings endoscopically confirmed in 32 cases (74.4%). In 3 cases the DBE showed findings not noted on VCE. DBE appears to be equally safe and effective when performed in the community setting as compared to a tertiary referral center with a comparable yield, efficacy, and complication rate.\n \nThe aim of this study was to analyze the contribution of the double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) for diagnosis of the small bowel disorders. Forty-four patients (20 women, 24 men; mean age 53.5 years-old, range 21-89 years) with chronic gastrointestinal bleeding, diarrhea, polyposis, weight-loss, Roux-en-Y surgery, and other indications underwent DBE. Twenty patients had occult or obscure gastrointestinal bleeding. The source of bleeding was identified in 15/20 (75%) 1. DBE is a safe and and accurate method to diagnose small bowel disorders; 2. this method permits chromoscopy, biopsies and treatment of the lesions.\n"}]}]}}

The aim of this study was to analyse the 30-day mortality, age-related 30-day mortality and 1-year mortality following emergency laparotomy. We hope this will encourage prospective data collection, improvement of care and initiate strategies to establish best practice in this area. This was a retrospective study of patients who underwent emergency laparotomy from June 2010 to May 2012. The primary end point of the study was 30-day mortality, age-related 30-day mortality and 1-year all-cause mortality. 477 laparotomies were performed in 446 patients. 57% were aged <70 and 43% aged >70 years. 30-day mortality was 12, 4% in those aged <70 years and 22% in those >70 years (p < 0.001). 1-year mortality was 25, 15% in those aged under 70 years and 38% in those aged >70 years (p < 0.001). Emergency laparotomy carries a high rate of mortality, especially in those over the age of 70 years, and more needs to be done to improve outcomes, particularly in this group. This could involve increasing acute surgical care manpower, early recognition of patients requiring emergency surgery, development of clear management protocols for such patients or perhaps even considering centralisation of emergency surgical services to specialist centres with multidisciplinary teams involving emergency surgeons and care of the elderly physicians in hospital and related community outreach services for post-discharge care.\n \nHip fractures in the elderly are followed by considerable risk of functional decline and mortality. The purposes of this study were to (1) explore predictive factors of functional level at discharge, (2) evaluate 1-year mortality after hip fracture compared with that of the general population, and (3) evaluate the affect of early functional outcome on 1-year mortality in patients operated on for hip fractures. A total of 228 consecutive patients (average age, 77.6 \u00b1 7.4 years) with hip fractures who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled in an open, prospective, observational cohort study. Functional level at discharge was measured with the motor Functional Independence Measure (FIM) score, which is the most widely accepted functional assessment measure in use in the rehabilitation community. Mortality rates in the study population were calculated in absolute numbers and as the standardized mortality ratio. Multivariate regression analysis was used to explore predictive factors for motor FIM score at discharge and for 1-year mortality adjusted for important baseline variables. Age, health status, cognitive level, preinjury functional level, and pressure sores after hip fracture surgery were independently related to lower discharge motor FIM scores. At 1-year followup, 57 patients (25%; 43 women and 14 men) had died. The 1-year hip fracture mortality rate compared with that of the general population was 31% in our population versus 7% for men and 23% in our population versus 5% for women 65 years or older. The 1-year standardized mortality rate was 341.3 (95% CI, 162.5-520.1) for men and 301.6 (95% CI, 212.4-391.8) for women, respectively. The all-cause mortality rate observed in this group was higher in all age groups and in both sexes when compared with the all-cause age-adjusted mortality of the general population. Motor FIM score at discharge was the only independent predictor of 1-year mortality after hip fracture. Functional level at discharge is the main determinant of long-term mortality in patients with hip fracture. Motor FIM score at discharge is a reliable predictor of mortality and can be recommended for clinical use.\n"}]}]}}

This research uses vignettes to elucidate factors associated with sleep disorders in adult Japanese before and after adjustment for reporting heterogeneity in self-reports. This study also evaluates the need for adjusting for reporting heterogeneity in the management of sleep and energy related problems in Japan. We investigated a dataset of 1002 respondents aged 18 years and over from the Japanese World Health Survey, which collected information through face-to-face interview from 2002 to 2003. The ordered probit model and the Compound Hierarchical Ordered Probit (CHOPIT) model, which incorporated anchoring vignettes, were employed to estimate and compare associations of sleep and energy with socio-demographic and life-style factors before and after adjustment for differences in response category cut-points for each individual. The prevalence of self-reported problems with sleep and energy was 53 %. Without correction of cut-point shifts, age, sex, and the number of comorbidities were significantly associated with a greater severity of sleep-related problems. After correction, age, the number of comorbidities, and regular exercise were significantly associated with a greater severity of sleep-related problems; sex was no longer a significant factor. Compared to the ordered probit model, the CHOPIT model provided two changes with a subtle difference in the magnitude of regression coefficients after correction for reporting heterogeneity. Sleep disorders are common in the general adult population of Japan. Correction for reporting heterogeneity using anchoring vignettes is not a necessary tool for proper management of sleep and energy related problems among Japanese adults. Older age, gender differences in communicating sleep-related problems, the presence of multiple morbidities, and regular exercise should be the focus of policies and clinical practice to improve sleep and energy management in Japan.\n \nThe National Kidney Foundation recommends reporting estimates of glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) rather than timed urine collections. When 2 of the 3 major hospitals in our region began reporting eGFR at different times we recognized a natural experiment. We conducted a retrospective, observational study at the 3 major hospitals in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Data were collected on the frequency of timed urines during a 41/2-year period. Regression analysis was used to study the association of the rate of ordering timed urines adjusted for other factors. There was a marked drop in the rate of ordering of timed urines at all 3 hospitals from a mean of 21.8 per 1000 admissions in the first 4 quarter years of the study to 10.9 in the last 4 (15th-18th) quarter years. The drop began before the reporting of eGFR at any hospital. The reporting of eGFR had a small effect (-1.7 per 1000 hospital admissions) that was not statistically significant (P = 0.15). There has been a marked drop in the ordering of timed urines in our region. The decline began before the reporting of eGFR at 2 of the hospitals and therefore is attributable to other factors.\n"}]}]}}

We studied 50 patients (mean age 42 years\u00b114), with no history of cardio-cerebrovascular events and \"normal\" IMT. We assessed the traditional cardiovascular risk factors, the CCA IMT, and the local stiffness with Quality Arterial Stiffness technology, based on Radio frequency signal (RFQAS-ESAOTE, Italy). CCA distensibility coefficient (DC), compliance coefficient (CC), pulse wave velocity (PWV) and \u03b2 parameter were measured in patients, with and without traditional cardiovascular risk factors. 25 subjects with risk factors (mean age 49\u00b113) were compared with 25 controls (mean age 36\u00b112). We did not find any significant differences in the IMT measurement between subjects with CV risk factors compared to controls (0.530\u00b10.99 mm vs. 0.626\u00b10.127 mm; P=5.68).

ROC curves showed that PWV>6.05 m/s better identified, among patients with IMT <0.9 mm, those with cardiovascular risk factors (sensitivity 82.0% specificity 62.0%; AUC 0.73). Increased stiffness is a result of change both in quantity and quality of the arterial wall. Arterial functional changes and distention alterations may herald the onset of vascular disease before manifestation of symptoms or detection of preclinical atherosclerotic lesions.\n \nThe aim of the study was to investigate whether changes in the level of oxidized LDL (oxLDL) over 2-years contribute to the development of subclinical macroangiopathy and/or microvascular complications in patients with DM1. Basic clinical and biochemical parameters and oxLDL level were measured in 70 patients at baseline and after 2 years of the study. In addition, an ultrasonographic study was performed to assess the carotid intima media thickness (IMT). Patients did not differ according to basic clinical and biochemical parameters at the beginning and after 2 years of the study. IMT increased (p=0.000001) whereas oxLDL level decreased (p=0.00001) in DM1 patients during 2 years. Multivariate regression analysis showed that oxLDL independently influences IMT in DM1 patients (\u03b2=0.454, R2=0.35). Further, positive correlations between oxLDL value and LDL-C concentration (r=0.585, p<0.05, n=70) and between oxLDL level and apo-B concentration have been established (r=0.610, p<0.05, n=70). Moreover, patients with chronic microvascular complications showed a higher value of IMT in comparison with patients without them (p=0.003). Our results provide the evidence that oxLDL accelerates atherosclerotic plaque formation and may contribute to the development of microvascular complications in DM1.\n"}]}]}}

This is a descriptive comparison of prospectively collected data on all children admitted to the short stay ward at Westmead Hospital (WH) during 1994 and the short stay ward at the New Children's Hospital (NCH) during 1997-98. These hospitals service an identical demographic area with the latter (NCH) a tertiary referral center. The following outcome measures were used The short stay ward accounted for 10.3% (Westmead Hospital) and 14.7% (New Children's Hospital) of admissions, with 56% medical in nature, 30% surgical, and the remainder procedural or psychological. Admission patterns were similar, with asthma, gastroenteritis, convulsion, pneumonia, and simple surgical conditions accounting for most short stay ward admissions. The short stay ward increased hospital efficiency with an average length of stay of 17.5 hours (Westmead Hospital) compared to 20.5 hours (New Children's Hospital). The users of the short stay ward were children of young age less than 2 years, with stay greater than 23 hours reported in only 1% of all admissions to the short stay ward. The rate of patient admission to an in-hospital bed was low, (4% [Westmead Hospital] compared to 6% [New Children's Hospital]), with the number of unscheduled visits within 72 hours of short stay ward discharge less than 1%. There were no adverse events reported at either short stay ward, with parental satisfaction high. The short stay ward was developed through reallocation of resources from within the hospital to the short stay ward. This resulted in estimated savings of $1/2 million (Westmead Hospital) to $2.3 million (New Children's Hospital) to the hospital, due to more efficient bed usage. This data demonstrates the robust nature of the short stay ward. At these two very different institutions we have shown improved bed efficient and patient care in a cost-effective way. We have also reported on greater parental satisfaction and early return of the child with their family to the community.\n"}]}]}}

To maintain safe and independent transport, mobility is important for all individuals, but especially for older drivers. The objective of this study was to investigate whether automatic transmission, compared with manual transmission, may improve the driving behavior of older drivers. In total, 31 older drivers (mean age 75.2 years) and 32 younger drivers - used as a control group (mean age 39.2 years) - were assessed twice on the same fixed route; once in a car with manual transmission and once in a car with automatic transmission. The cars were otherwise identical. The driving behavior was assessed with the Ryd On-Road Assessment driving protocol. Time to completion of left turns (right-hand side driving) and the impact of a distraction task were measured. The older group had more driving errors than the younger group, in both the manual and the automatic transmission car. However, and contrary to the younger drivers, automatic transmission improved the older participants' driving behavior as demonstrated by safer speed adjustment in urban areas, greater maneuvering skills, safer lane position and driving in accordance with the speed regulations. Switching to automatic transmission may be recommended for older drivers as a means to maintain safe driving and thereby the quality of their transport mobility.\n"}]}]}}

There were no differences in age (P\u00a0=\u00a0.5), Injury Severity Score (P\u00a0=\u00a0.6), type (P\u00a0=\u00a0.1), and grade of injury of the organ (P\u00a0=\u00a0.6) between the 3 groups. There were 67 liver (43.2%), 63 spleen (40.6%), 49 kidney (31.6%), and 24 multiple solid organ (15.4%) injuries. There was no difference in operative intervention (P\u00a0=\u00a0.8) and postprophylaxis blood transfusion (P\u00a0=\u00a0.3) between the 3 groups. Early enoxaparin-based anticoagulation may be a safe option in trauma patients with blunt solid organ injury. This study showed no significant correlation between early anticoagulation and development of bleeding complications.\n \nAnticoagulation for the haemodialysis circuit in patients treated with oral anticoagulation poses additional haemorrhagic risk. The few available data suggest that tapering or even stopping heparinization is feasible and the HeprAN membrane with grafted heparin was developed to decrease heparin dose. The objective of our study was to evaluate the need for additional anticoagulation in patients on long-term oral anticoagulation, according to the type of membrane used. This is a prospective, randomized, crossover bifactorial trial in haemodialysed patients on oral anticoagulation. Each patient had four haemodialysis sessions with two different membranes [HeprAN or polysulphone (PS)] and with or without enoxaparin. Clinical coagulation was evaluated by the need for premature ending and by a visual score (Janssen scale). Coagulation activation markers were also measured Ten patients were included (M/F = 4/6, mean age 63 \u00b1 15 years). None of the 40 sessions ended prematurely. The clotting scores were similar with or without enoxaparin (dialyser These results suggest that haemodialysis without additional anticoagulation is possible in patients with oral anticoagulation. The HeprAN membrane did not provide any additional benefit compared with a PS membrane.\n"}]}]}}

We investigated the role of routine laboratory parameters in distinguishing NASH from ASH. Liver biopsies performed at our hospital over a 10-year period were reviewed, 95 patients with steatohepatitis identified and their data prior to biopsy reevaluated. The diagnosis NASH or ASH was assigned (other liver diseases excluded) on the basis of the biopsy and history of alcohol consumption (< 140 g/week). Logistic regression models were used for analysis. NASH was diagnosed in 58 patients (61%; 30 f) and ASH in 37 (39%; 9 f). High-grade fibrosis (59% vs. 19%, P < 0.0001) and an AST/ALT ratio > 1 (54.1% vs 20.7%, P = 0.0008) were more common in ASH. The MCV was elevated in 53% of ASH patients and normal in all NASH patients (P < 0.0001). Multivariate analysis identified the MCV (P = 0.0013), the AST/ALT ratio (P = 0.011) and sex (P = 0.0029) as relevant regressors (aROC = 0.92). The AST/ALT ratio (P < 0.0001) and age (P = 0.00049) were independent predictors of high-grade fibrosis. Differences in MCV were more marked in high-grade fibrosis. Higher MCVs and AST/ALT ratios in ASH reflect the severity of underlying liver disease and do not differentiate NASH from ASH. Instead, these biomarkers might prove useful in guiding selection of patients for liver biopsy and in targeting therapy.\n \nThyroid hormones play an important role in the regulation of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, both of which are affected in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Anecdotally, we have observed that a number of patients with NASH carried a diagnosis of hypothyroidism. However, it is unknown if thyroid dysfunction plays any role in the pathogenesis of NASH. To further investigate this observation, we conducted a case-control study to determine the association between hypothyroidism and NASH. Cases were defined as patients with well-documented NASH attending hepatology clinics at Indiana University Hospital from January 1, 1995 to December 31, 2000. Age, gender, race, and body-weight matched individuals seen during the same period in the general medical clinics served as controls. Patients with a previous diagnosis of hypothyroidism who are currently on synthetic T4 replacement were considered to be \"hypothyroid\". The strength of association was assessed by logistic regression analysis after controlling for the frequency of diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. One hundred seventy-four patients with NASH (cases) and 442 controls were included. The mean age of cohort was 49 +/- 13 years, 59% were female, and 98% were white. The prevalence of hypothyroidism in patients with NASH was 15% was significantly higher than in the controls (7.2%, P < 0.001). By multivariate analysis, the prevalence of hypothyroidism in the NASH group was significantly higher than in control group (OR These data suggest that hypothyroidism is associated with human NASH. Further research is needed to confirm this finding and to understand its implications.\n"}]}]}}

One of the municipalities was selected for the validation study. The health survey 1984-86 addressed all inhabitants > or = 20 years of age in Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag county, Norway; 76,885 (90.3%) of the eligible population participated in answering the question on diabetes. All inhabitants in the municipality answering \"yes\" to the question on diabetes (n = 169) and the persons with the same sex born closest before and after each diabetic patient and answering \"no\" to the diabetes question (n = 338) were included. A very thorough search was made in the medical files of the general practitioners in the municipality for corresponding information. Compared to the files, diabetes was verified in 163 out of the 169. The commonest cause of discrepancy was renal glycosuria. One out of the 338 registered non-diabetic persons was found to have diabetes. Diabetic patients tended to overestimate diabetes duration significantly. Insulin treatment was verified in 19/20 (95%) and treatment with oral hypoglycaemic agents in all 44 with an affirmative questionnaire answer. A negative answer on insulin and oral hypoglycaemic agents was verified in 100% and 99% respectively. The concordance was considerably higher than in a comparable Norwegian study performed 10 years earlier.

The aim of this study was to compare quality of life related to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in patients who underwent intra-thoracic stomach repair with and without fundoplication. We proposed that the group without a fundoplication would have poorer quality of life due to continued symptoms. All patients undergoing foregut surgery at the Creighton University Esophageal Center are entered in a prospectively maintained database. The database was queried to identify patients who underwent surgery for a near complete (>75\u00a0% of stomach in chest) intra-thoracic stomach with gastric volvulus between 2004 and 2013. A questionnaire was derived from the Quality of Life in Reflux and Dyspepsia and Frequency Scale for Symptoms of GERD questionnaires to assess for symptoms related to reflux, and this questionnaire was administered by phone. A total of 150 patients underwent repair of ITS\u00a0during the study period. A total of 109 patients had ITS repair with fundoplication, while 41 had only ITS repair. Follow-up was available in 54\u00a0% of patients in the fundoplication group (median follow-up of 5.2\u00a0years) and in 49\u00a0% of patients in the non-fundoplication group (median follow-up of 4\u00a0years). Significantly, more patients woke up at night (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and found themselves coughing around mealtime (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) in the fundoplication group. Patients in the non-fundoplication group had significantly more daytime reflux (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). Despite these symptoms, only one patient in the fundoplication group and no patients in the non-fundoplication group admitted that these symptoms were severe enough to severely affect their quality of life. All other patients contacted felt satisfied, and >80\u00a0% rated their quality of life as either good or excellent.

A questionnaire on US education and bedside US use was pilot tested and given to EM residents. The primary outcomes included the number of US examinations performed, scope of bedside US applications, barriers to residents' US education, and US use in the emergency department.

Residents in programs with EUS fellowships reported performing more scans than those in programs without fellowships (P = .04). Significant differences were noted in most applications of bedside US between residency programs with and without fellowships (P < .05). There were also significant differences in the barriers to US education between residency programs with and without fellowships (P < .05).

We studied seven obese Type 2 diabetic patients twice Basal plasma glucose levels (mean +/- sd) were 5.5 +/- 0.5 and 10.7 +/- 2.9 mmol/l in the + ON and - ON studies, respectively, and were clamped at -5.5 mmol/l. Basal rates of glucose production (GP) were similar in the + ON and - ON studies, 83 +/- 13 vs. 85 +/- 14 mg m-2 min-1 (NS), whereas basal rates of glucose disappearance (Rd) were lower in the + ON than in the - ON study, 84 +/- 8 vs. 91 +/- 11 mg m-2 min-1 (P = 0.02).

Most children who do not undergo transplant are reported to have chronic liver disease and its complications. The aim of this single-center study was to identify children with normal laboratory indices and no clinical evidence of chronic liver disease 10 or more years after Kasai portoenterostomy (KP). A retrospective analysis of the medical notes of all children surgically treated at the authors' center between 1979 and 1991 was undertaken. Criteria for inclusion were absence of surgical complications, unremarkable clinical examination, and normal bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, albumin, international normalized prothrombin ratio, and platelet count. Of 244 children surgically treated during the observation period, the authors identified 28 (11%) adolescents (14 male) who fulfilled the entry criteria. Their median age was 13.4 years (range, 10.2-22.2 years). Twenty-six with type 3 EHBA had conventional KP, whereas 2 underwent modified operations. The corrective surgery was performed at a median age of 58 days (range, 20-99 days). Median time of complete clearance of jaundice from the date of KP was 75 days (range, 21-339 days). Twelve (43%) patients had history of cholangitis at a median age of 3.4 years. The liver histologic findings were suggestive of mild to moderate fibrosis in 54.2% and cirrhosis in 40.7% of the patients who underwent biopsy. No child had gastrointestinal bleeding during follow-up. Thirteen (46%) patients had an elective esophagogastroduodenoscopy, which was normal in all. Twenty-six (93%) patients were in mainstream education, whereas the remaining two (7%) attended special school because of reasons unrelated to liver disease. A sizable proportion of children with EHBA avoid significant chronic liver disease and its complications 10 years or more after conventional surgical correction and have an excellent quality of life. Their good outcome is not hampered by isolated episodes of ascending cholangitis. Whether or not the residual histologic damage will become symptomatic during their lifetime remains to be established.\n \nTo assess and compare the value of split-liver transplantation (SLT) and living-related liver transplantation (LRT). The concept of SLT results from the development of reduced-size transplantation. A further development of SLT, the in situ split technique, is derived from LRT, which itself marks the optimized outcome in terms of postoperative graft function and survival. The combination of SLT and LRT has abolished deaths on the waiting list, thus raising the question whether living donor liver transplantation is still necessary. Outcomes and postoperative liver function of 43 primary LRT patients were compared with those of 49 primary SLT patients (14 ex situ, 35 in situ) with known graft weight performed between April 1996 and December 2000. Survival rates were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. After a median follow-up of 35 months, actual patient survival rates were 82% in the SLT group and 88% in the LRT group. Actual graft survival rates were 76% and 81%, respectively. The incidence of primary nonfunction was 12% in the SLT group and 2.3% in the LRT group. Liver function parameters (prothrombin time, factor V, bilirubin clearance) and surgical complication rates did not differ significantly. In the SLT group, mean cold ischemic time was longer than in the LRT group. Serum values of alanine aminotransferase during the first postoperative week were significantly higher in the SLT group. In the LRT group, there were more grafts with signs of fatty degeneration than in the SLT group. The short- and long-term outcomes after LRT and SLT did not differ significantly. To avoid the risk for the donor in LRT, SLT represents the first-line therapy in pediatric liver transplantation in countries where cadaveric organs are available. LRT provides a solution for urgent cases in which a cadaveric graft cannot be found in time or if the choice of the optimal time point for transplantation is vital.\n"}]}]}}

The contribution of attitudes to racial and ethnic disparities in effective method use was assessed via mediation analysis, using a series of regression models. Blacks and Latinas were more likely than whites to believe that the government encourages contraceptive use to limit minority populations (odds ratio, 2.5 for each). Compared with white women, Latinas held more favorable attitudes toward pregnancy (2.5) and childbearing (coefficient, 0.3) and were more fatalistic about the timing of pregnancy (odds ratio, 2.3); blacks were more fatalistic about life in general (2.0). Only one attitude, skepticism that the government ensures contraceptive safety, was associated with contraceptive use (0.7), but this belief did not differ by race or ethnicity. Although blacks and Latinas used less effective methods than whites (0.3 and 0.4, respectively), attitudes did not explain disparities. Lower contraceptive knowledge partially explained Latinas' use of less effective methods. Providing basic information about effective methods might help to decrease ethnic disparities in use. Research should examine other variables that might account for these disparities, including health system characteristics and provider behavior.\n"}]}]}}

Cancer specific survival for the 22 patients with pT3a or pT3b tumors that directly invaded the ipsilateral adrenal gland was significantly worse compared with that of patients with pT3a (p <0.001) or pT3b (p = 0.011) disease that did not invade the adrenal gland. There was no significant difference in the 5-year cancer specific survival between the patients with pT3a or pT3b tumors that directly invaded the ipsilateral adrenal gland and patients with pT4 tumors (cancer specific survival rates of 20% and 14%, respectively, p = 0.490). Although rare, RCC with direct ipsilateral adrenal invasion behaves more aggressively than tumors involving perinephric or renal sinus fat. We believe that RCC tumors with direct adrenal invasion should be classified as pT4.\n \nTo determine the value of ipsilateral adrenalectomy with radical nephrectomy, by investigating the clinical aspects of adrenal involvement and adrenocortical function in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The demographic, clinical and pathological data of adrenal involvement were reviewed in 247 patients with RCC. To evaluate adrenocortical function, 14 patients (adrenalectomy in eight, adrenal-sparing in six) had a rapid adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test before and 2 weeks after surgery. There was adrenal involvement with RCC in seven of the 247 (2.8%) patients (a solitary adrenal metastatic tumour in four and direct extension into the adrenal gland in three). All adrenal involvement was detectable on abdominal computed tomography before surgery, and these patients had a large primary renal tumour of > pT2 and/or distant metastasis. Plasma cortisol levels declined significantly more in response to the rapid ACTH stimulation test in those treated by adrenalectomy than in those with spared adrenal glands at 2 weeks after surgery (P < 0.05), while there was no significant difference between the groups before surgery. These results suggest that unconditional ipsilateral adrenalectomy with radical nephrectomy for RCC should be avoidable, and thus preserve the reserve of adrenocortical function, as preoperative imaging, especially thin-slice multidetector helical computed tomography, can detect adrenal involvement with RCC in most cases. Unilateral adrenalectomy might cause an irreversible impairment of the reserve of adrenocortical function.\n"}]}]}}

This study aimed to investigate the influence rural placement and rural background had on students' intentions to live and work in a rural or remote location after graduation. Between January 2005 and December 2006, 336 students participated in the placement program. Students were requested to complete a survey at the completion of their placement. A response rate of 239 was achieved (71%). The survey measured students' stated rural career intentions and rural background status according to location of primary and secondary school attendance. A demographic analysis of respondents was undertaken and results cross tabulated according to the rural, remote and metropolitan area (RRMA) classification system. Statistical analyses, including paired t-tests and a Wilcoxon signed rank test, were conducted to compare reported mean intention to practise rurally both prior to and after placement. The results from this survey show that rural placements in the undergraduate health science programs have a predominantly positive influence on students' intention to work in a rural community post-graduation. While these findings were significant for the disciplines of nursing, medicine and allied health, the results were not significant for pharmacy students. Students' average intention to practise rurally significantly increased after the placement for students from RRMA classifications 1 and 3-5. The value of rural placements as a method for increasing health science students' intentionality to take up rural practice as a positive and viable career option is considerable.\n \nThe burden of maternal mortality in sub-Saharan Africa is very high. In Ghana maternal mortality ratio was 380 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2013. Skilled birth attendance has been shown to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity, yet in 2010 only 68 percent of mothers in Ghana gave birth with the assistance of skilled birth attendants. In 2005, the Ghana Health Service piloted a strategy that involved using the integrated Community-based Health Planning and Services (CHPS) program and training Community Health Officers (CHOs) as midwives to address the gap in skilled attendance in rural Upper East Region (UER). The study assesses the feasibility of and extent to which the skilled delivery program has been implemented as an integrated component of the existing CHPS, and documents the benefits and challenges of the integrated program. We employed an intrinsic case study design with a qualitative methodology. We conducted 41 in-depth interviews with health professionals and community stakeholders. We used a purposive sampling technique to identify and interview our respondents. The CHO-midwives provide integrated services that include skilled delivery in CHPS zones. The midwives collaborate with District Assemblies, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and communities to offer skilled delivery services in rural communities. They refer pregnant women with complications to district hospitals and health centers for care, and there has been observed improvement in the referral system. Stakeholders reported community members' access to skilled attendants at birth, health education, antenatal attendance and postnatal care in rural communities. The CHO-midwives are provided with financial and non-financial incentives to motivate them for optimal work performance. The primary challenges that remain include inadequate numbers of CHO-midwives, insufficient transportation, and infrastructure weaknesses. Our study demonstrates that CHOs can successfully be trained as midwives and deployed to provide skilled delivery services at the doorsteps of rural households. The integration of the skilled delivery program with the CHPS program appears to be an effective model for improving access to skilled birth attendance in rural communities of the UER of Ghana.\n"}]}]}}

Half of those casualties are expected to require immediate medical treatment. This study was performed to evaluate the efficacy of the current readiness guidelines based on the epidemiology of encountered HMCIs. A retrospective study of HMCIs was recorded in the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) home front command and the Israeli National Trauma Registry (ITR) between November 2000 and June 2003. An HMCI is defined by the Emergency and Disaster Medicine Division in the Israeli Ministry of Health as >or=10 casualties or >or=4 suffering from injuries with an ISS>or=16 arriving to a single hospital. The study includes a total of 32 attacks, resulting in 62 HMCIs and 1292 casualties. The mean number of arriving casualties to a single hospital was 20.8+/-13.3 (range 4-56, median 16.5). In 95% of the HMCIs the casualty load was <or=52. Based on severity scores and ED discharges 1022 (79.2%) casualties did not necessitate immediate medical treatment. Hospital preparedness can be better defined by a fixed number of casualties rather than a percentile of its bed capacity. Only 20% of the arriving casualties will require immediate medical treatment.

Three-hundred and eighty consecutive pregnancies, of which 340 (89%) were singletons, participated in our study. Anencephaly was diagnosed in 26 cases Our case series data suggest a comparatively higher rate of anencephaly in IVF-ICSI pregnancy secondary to twinning and not because of the assisted reproductive technology.

Data were collected as part of The Baby's Breath Project, a hospital-based SHSe intervention trial targeting parents with a high-risk infant in the NICU who reported a smoker in the household (N = 99). Measures of sociodemographics, smoking, home and car smoking bans, and depression were collected. Overall, 26% of all families with a high-risk infant in the NICU reported a household smoker. Almost half of the families with a smoker reported an annual income of less than $25,000. 46.2% of families reported having a total smoking ban in place in both their homes and cars. Only 27.8% families earning less than $25,000 reported having a total smoking ban in place relative to almost 60% of families earning more (p < .01). African American and Caucasian families were less likely to have a smoking ban compared with Hispanics (p < .05). Mothers who reported no smoking ban were more depressed than those who had a household smoking ban (p < .02). The most disadvantaged families were least likely to have protective health behaviors in place to reduce SHSe and, consequently, are most at-risk for tobacco exposure and subsequent tobacco-related health disparities. Innovative SHSe interventions for this vulnerable population are sorely needed.\n \nPremature infants are at increased risk for rehospitalization after discharge from the hospital. Racial disparities are known to exist in pediatric health care. To evaluate whether racial disparities exist in the proportion of extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants rehospitalized prior to 18 months corrected age and the causes of rehospitalization. The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neonatal Research Network database was used to identify all ELBW infants (n=2446) who were born between November 1, 1998 and May 31, 2000 at the 14 participating centers and discharged alive (n=1591). Infants were seen at 18-22 months corrected age for followup. Data related to maternal variables, race, socioeconomic status, medical morbidities, insurance, and rehospitalizations were recorded from the medical record and parent interview. Logistic regression analyses were used to examine the relationship of race/ethnicity and rehospitalization while controlling for gestational age, gender, center, maternal education, family income, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), necrotizing enterocolitis, ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) prophylaxis, and insurance type. In all, 1405 (88%) infants were evaluated at followup. The racial distribution of infants admitted, discharged, seen at followup, and rehospitalized were similar. Rehospitalization occurred at least once in 49% of the infants. In the logistic regression analyses, race was not a significant predictor for rehospitalization. The odds of rehospitalization were related to low family income, type of insurance, BPD, VP shunt, RSV prophylaxis, and center. Race was not a predominant variable in the risk of rehospitalization in this cohort of ELBW infants. Medical morbidities and low family income appear to be the major risk factors for rehospitalization.\n"}]}]}}

In a randomized, double-blind multicenter trial, 322 patients with predominantly New York Heart Association class II or III congestive heart failure and left ventricular ejection fractions of 35% or less, who were stabilized on a diuretic, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, and digoxin, were treated with 100 mg flosequinan once daily, 75 mg flosequinan twice daily, or matching placebo. Efficacy was evaluated with serial measurements of treadmill exercise time, responses to the Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire (LWHF), and clinical assessments during a baseline phase and a 16-week treatment period. After 16 weeks, 100 mg flosequinan once daily produced a significant increment in median exercise time (64 seconds at 16 weeks) compared with placebo (5 seconds), whereas the higher-dose flosequinan group did not show a statistically significant increase. Flosequinan (100 mg once daily) also improved the overall LWHF score significantly compared with placebo; both active therapies decreased the physical component, but 75 mg flosequinan twice daily was associated with a trend toward worsening of the emotional component. Most clinical assessments tended to improve on active therapy. These results indicate that additional symptomatic benefit can be attained by adding flosequinan to a therapeutic regimen already including a converting enzyme inhibitor. Because in the future most patients will fall into this category, flosequinan is a potential adjunctive agent in the management of severe congestive heart failure.

The records of 465 patients with an established diagnosis of age related macular degeneration who had attended a specialist macular clinic between 1990 and 1998 were scrutinised. A full clinical examination and standardised refraction had been carried out in 189 of these cases on a minimum of two occasions. Cases were looked for where an improvement of one or more lines of either distance or near acuity was recorded in the eye unaffected by macular disease. In each one of these cases the improvement in visual acuity could not be attributed to treatment of other existing pathology. 12 such cases were detected. In nine of these the eye showing improvement of acuity had a history of amblyopia. The mean improvement in distance and near acuity in amblyopic eyes by 12 months was 3.3 and 1.9 lines logMAR respectively. The improvement in acuity generally occurred between 1 and 12 months from baseline and remained stable over the period of follow up. Older people with a history of amblyopia who develop visual loss in the previously normal eye can experience recovery of visual function in the amblyopic eye over a period of time. This recovery in visual function occurs in the wake of visual loss in the fellow eye and the improvement appears to be sustained.\n \nAssessment of visual acuity depends on the optotypes used for measurement. The ability to recognize different optotypes differs even if their critical details appear under the same visual angle. Since optotypes are evaluated on individuals with good visual acuity and without eye disorders, differences in the lower visual acuity range cannot be excluded. In this study, visual acuity measured with the Snellen E was compared to the Landolt C acuity. 100 patients (age 8 - 90 years, median 60.5 years) with various eye disorders, among them 39 with amblyopia due to strabismus, and 13 healthy volunteers were tested. Charts with the Snellen E and the Landolt C (Precision Vision) which mimic the ETDRS charts were used to assess visual acuity. Three out of 5 optotypes per line had to be correctly identified, while wrong answers were monitored. In the group of patients, the eyes with the lower visual acuity, and the right eyes of the healthy subjects, were evaluated. Differences between Landolt C acuity (LR) and Snellen E acuity (SE) were small. The mean decimal values for LR and SE were 0.25 and 0.29 in the entire group and 0.14 and 0.16 for the eyes with strabismus amblyopia. The mean difference between LR and SE was 0.55 lines in the entire group and 0.55 lines for the eyes with strabismus amblyopia, with higher values of SE in both groups. The results of the other groups were similar with only small differences between LR and SE. Using the charts described, there was only a slight overestimation of visual acuity by the Snellen E compared to the Landolt C, even in strabismus amblyopia. Small differences in the lower visual acuity range have to be considered.\n"}]}]}}

We studied 114 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens obtained from locally advanced urothelial carcinoma patients receiving surgery alone or adjuvant M-VEC. The authors evaluated HER2 immunoreactivity using immunohistochemical staining and explored the influence of pathological parameters and HER2 immunoreactivity on progression-free survival (PFS) and disease-specific overall survival (OS) using univariate and multivariate Cox's analyses. Urothelial carcinoma of the bladder had a significantly higher frequency of HER2 immunoreactivity than that of the upper urinary tract (60.7 vs. 20.7%, p < 0.0001). Overall, nodal status was a strong and independent prognostic indicator for clinical outcome. The HER2 immunoreactivity was significantly associated with PFS (p = 0.02) and disease-specific OS (p = 0.005) in advanced urothelial carcinoma patients. As for patients with adjuvant M-VEC, HER2 immunoreactivity was a significant prognostic factor for PFS (p = 0.03) and disease-specific OS (p = 0.02) using univariate analysis, but not multivariate analysis, and not for patients receiving watchful waiting. HER2 immunoreactivity might have a limited prognostic value for advanced urothelial carcinoma patients with adjuvant M-VEC.\n \nIt has been demonstrated that there are a lot of different prognostic factors which are worthy of consideration whereas diabetes mellitus (DM) has not been clearly or consistently identified as a prognostic value in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic significance of the characteristics of patients in advanced NSCLC. Specifically, we investigated the impact of DM for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients receiving first-line platinum-based doublets chemotherapy. We retrospectively reviewed 442 patients with advanced NSCLC. DM and other potential prognostic variables were chosen for analysis in this study. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify prognostic factors associated with survival. The results of univariate analysis for OS were identified as having prognostic significance In conclusion, DM at the time of diagnosis was associated with the negative prognostic importance for PFS and OS in the advanced stage patients who were receiving first-line platinum-based doublets chemotherapy. In addition poor performance status and advanced stage were identified as negative prognostic factors.\n"}]}]}}

We studied the frequencies of TNF-\u03b1-308 gene polymorphism in 90 male subjects (60 subjects with COPD and 30 healthy smokers) in a Caucasian population. There was no significant difference in the frequency of G/G and G/A gene polymorphisms in the COPD group compared with control subjects (p>0.05). We compared COPD patients as G/A gene polymorphism and G/G gene polymorphism; the PFTs and BMI before and after one year were not statistically significant (p>0.05). Also, the exacerbation and hospitalization data of COPD patients were not significant between these groups. In conclusion, there was no difference between smoking-related COPD and the control group according to TNF \u03b1-308 gene polymorphism in a Caucasian population. In addition, it was shown that important determinants of prognosis of COPD such as FEV1, BMI, COPD exacerbation and hospitalization were not associated with TNF-\u03b1-308 gene polymorphism.\n \nCurrent guidelines recommend spirometry to confirm a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). To investigate whether a self-reported diagnosis of COPD is associated with prior spirometry and whether a correct diagnosis of COPD is more likely when spirometry was performed. We used data from the population-based Austrian Burden of Obstructive Lung Disease (BOLD) study. Participants were aged >40 years and completed post-bronchodilator spirometry. Reported COPD diagnosis and reported prior lung function test were based on questionnaire. Persistent airflow limitation was defined as post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second/forced vital capacity ratio <0.7, corresponding with COPD Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) grade I+, and GOLD grade II+ was also investigated. A correct diagnosis of COPD was defined as a reported physician's diagnosis of COPD and the presence of persistent airflow limitation. 68 (5.4%) of 1,258 participants reported a prior physician's diagnosis of COPD. Of these, only 17 (25.0%) reported a lung function test within the past 12 months and 46 (67.6%) at any time in the past. The likelihood for a correct COPD GOLD grade I+ diagnosis was similar among subjects reporting a lung function test during the last 12 months (likelihood ratio 2.07, 95% CI 0.89 to 5.50) and those not reporting a lung function during the last 12 months (likelihood ratio 2.78, 95% CI 1.58 to 4.87). Similar likelihood ratios were seen when GOLD grade II+ was investigated and when lung function was reported at any time in the past. One-third of subjects with a reported diagnosis of COPD never had a lung function test. When spirometry was reported, this did not increase the likelihood of a correct COPD diagnosis.\n"}]}]}}

In order to compare adipocytes resulting from the differentiation of preadipocytes with those of purified adipose tissue, we implanted them in 10 nude mice. The preadipocytes were implanted using a collagen scaffold as intermediary and the adipose tissue following the plastic surgery protocol described by SR Coleman. After 8 weeks, tissue fragments were explanted and analysed after staining with HPS, Oil Red O and labelling with human anti-vimentin antibodies. The scaffold seeded with preadipocytes had the macroscopic appearance of adipose tissue with peripheral neovascularisation. The preadipocytes had been transformed into mature adipocytes. Purified adipose tissue also presented peripheral neovascularisation. Numerous mature adipocytes were found. There was an abundant murine extracellular matrix since anti-vimentin labelling was negative.

The mortality rate, morbidity criteria, and risk factors for grave prognosis were compared between a group of 25 patients who received HBO as part of their treatment protocol and a group of the remaining 12 patients treated by surgical excision and antibiotics alone. The two groups were found to be similar with regard to age, gender, the incidence of individual risk factors for ominous prognosis, and the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score for disease's severity on presentation.

All rats were sacrificed on postoperative day 7, and liver injury was assessed by measuring alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels. Protein synthetic ability was determined based albumin levels and liver regeneration by the mitotic index (MI). The AST and ALT values of group II rats were significantly higher than those of group I, but not those of group III. Rats treated with doxorubicin and HBO (groups II and III) showed slightly but not significant differences in albumin levels than those subjected to only RPVL or sham-operated. The MI was significantly increased in groups I, II, and III, with the MI of group III rats significantly higher than those of group I rats.

Second, the changes in the curriculum of surgical education were documented as perceived by program coordinators and directors. In all, 85% (17/20) of surgical programs in New England responded to the survey. The programs began to implement the 80-hour workweek from 2002 to 2004. An equal distribution of community (n = 8) and university programs (n = 9) was sampled. Prior to the initiation of the 80-hour workweek, residency programs emphasized weekly didactic sessions given by attending physicians (88%), mock orals (88%), and conventional journal club (76%). After the 80-hour workweek was implemented, the education curriculum most often consisted of didactic sessions by attending (100%), mock orals (88%), and simulation laboratories (75%).

In-training exam scores improved significantlyfor the classes taught with the block rotation over those without it. Most of the geriatric learning occurred during the 1-month geriatric block rotation during the residency. In-training geriatric exam scores improved significantly with a geriatric block rotation. The use of structured repetitive learning experiences during the rotation to emphasize the common clinical issues and the skewed exposure to geriatric patients in the random nature of residency clinic and inpatient encounters accountfor this result.\n"}]}]}}

The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test was used for statistically significant results and indicated a difference in performance over deciles. The standardized mortality ratio was used to estimate the overall model performance.

We aimed to demonstrate acute behavioral change (using a simple motor response task MRT) during photoparoxysmal response (PPR) in children below 18 years. Children performed a simple repetitive motor task during intermittent photic stimulation (IPS). All episodes of PPR not associated with obvious clinical change (as observed by the technologist or reported by the patient) were analyzed for this study. The average time interval between two successive motor responses across a PPR (test time) was compared to the average time interval between two successive motor responses during IPS not associated with PPR (control time) using Wilcoxon signed ranks test. 21 children who had PPR successfully completed the MRT. The difference between the mean durations was 0.894 s (p=0.002). More than 50% increase compared to the control time was considered a delay in MRT during PPR. 10 children showed slowing of MRT during PPR. By definition, acute behavioral change during generalized epileptiform discharges represent provoked seizures. Detecting subclinical seizures can have important safety implications in children (skiing, skating and driving) with PPR on EEG, but no clinical seizures. We recommend MRT during IPS.\n"}]}]}}

Patients were classified according to whether they came to the hospital during the first 72 hours after the haemorrhage (Group 1) or later (Group 2). Thirty three patients were included in Group 1 and sixteen patients in Group 2. Thirteen patients (26.5%) had sonographic vasospasm. In eight of these patients (61 %), the vasospasm was symptomatic. The initial mean velocity (MV) for Group 1 was normal. The increase in MV/24h (MV/24h) within the first 72 hours after SAH was higher (p< 0.007), in those whose developed sonographic vasospasm.

The current study was performed to determine the knowledge, attitudes, and confidence of PCPs in the safety net at delivering care to survivors of breast cancer. A modified version of the National Cancer Institute's Survey of Physician Attitudes Regarding Care of Cancer Survivors was given to providers at 2 county hospitals and 5 associated clinics (59 providers). Focus groups were held to understand barriers to survivorship care. Although the majority of providers believed PCPs have the skills necessary to provide cancer-related follow-up, the vast majority were not comfortable providing these services themselves. Providers were adherent to American Society of Clinical Oncology recommendations for mammography (98%) and physical examination (87%); less than one-third were guideline-concordant for laboratory testing and only 6 providers (10%) met all recommendations. PCPs universally requested additional training on clinical guidelines and the provision of written survivorship care plans before transfer. Concerns voiced in qualitative sessions included unfamiliarity with the management of endocrine therapy and confusion regarding who would be responsible for certain aspects of care.

Indicators used to assess involvement with managed care included global measures of managed care participation, risk contracting, exposure to financial incentives, and impact of care management tools. Changes in these measures over the 2 study periods are reported. Analyses were conducted for all physicians, as well as for primary care physicians (PCPs) and specialists separately. The percentage of practice revenue derived from managed care increased only modestly over the study period (from 42% to 45%).

Among care management tools, only treatment guidelines had a significantly increased impact on medical practice, primarily among PCPs (from 46% to 52%; P < .001). Many aspects of managed care leveled off between 1996 and 1999 in ways not accurately reflected by plan enrollment patterns. This \"flattening of the curve\" trend appears to hold generally across multiple measures. A stalling of the managed care \"revolution,\" if it is sustained, may portend future escalation in healthcare costs.\n"}]}]}}

As in other chronic liver diseases, the presence of hepatocellular carcinoma in a patient with primary sclerosing cholangitis undergoing evaluation for orthotopic liver transplantation would clearly impact on the candidacy, diagnostic evaluation, and alternative treatment options. Thus, the aim of our study was to determine the prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients undergoing liver transplantation for primary sclerosing cholangitis. The records of the 520 patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation at our institution between 1985 and May 1995 were reviewed. Of the 134 patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis, three (2%) had hepatocellular carcinoma. In the 386 patients without primary sclerosing cholangitis undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation, 22 (6%) had hepatocellular carcinoma. Neither the duration of primary sclerosing cholangitis (range 7-23 years) nor the presence of ulcerative colitis (two of three patients) distinguished those patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis plus hepatocellular carcinoma from those with primary sclerosing cholangitis alone. None of the three patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis plus hepatocellular carcinoma had evidence for hepatitis B or C, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, or hemochromatosis. None of the tumors was of the fibrolamellar variety of hepatocellular carcinoma. The prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation is 2%. These data suggest that patients with advanced cirrhotic-stage primary sclerosing cholangitis are at increased risk for developing hepatocellular carcinoma and should be screened for hepatocellular carcinoma as well as for cholangiocarcinoma prior to orthotopic liver transplantation.\n \nThe purpose of this study is to examine whether or not well differentiated (w-d) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is indeed clinically early cancer. Seventy six patients with solitary small HCCs up to 3 cm in diameter, who underwent hepatectomy, were observed for at least 2 years for possible recurrence. These patients were divided into two groups The histological analysis revealed that w-d HCCs had lower incidences of fibrous capsule formation (P<0.01), when compared to l-d HCCs. There were no significant differences in the incidence of intrahepatic metastasis, or portal vein invasion. In a resected specimen of w-d HCC, barium sulfate and gelatin were injected into portal vein and a transparent specimen was made. The transparent specimen showed that the portal vein in the tumor seemed to be intact. Microscopically, cancer cell infiltration into the fibrous frame of the portal tract was present. There were no significant differences in the disease free survival between the two groups. An analysis of tumor volume doubling time in recurrent foci suggested that minute cancerous foci had been present at the time of operation. W-d HCCs were clinically demonstrated not to be early cancer, because there was no significant difference in disease free survival between the patients with w-d and l-d HCCs.\n"}]}]}}

Retrospective cohort study. Three northern California family planning clinics. All women with abnormal Pap smear results referred for initial colposcopy and a random sample of those referred for repeated Pap smear. Medical records were located and reviewed for 90 of 107 women referred for colposcopy and 153 of 225 women referred for repeated Pap smears. Routine clinic protocols for follow-up--telephone call, letter, or certified letter--were applied without regard to the type of abnormality seen on a Pap smear or recommended examination. Documented adherence to follow-up within 8 months of an abnormal result. Attempts to contact the patients for follow-up, adherence to follow-up recommendations, and patient characteristics were abstracted from medical records. The probability of adherence to follow-up vs the number of follow-up attempts was modeled with survival analysis. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine multivariate relationships related to adherence. The rate of overall adherence to follow-up recommendations was 56.0% (136/243). Adherence to a second colposcopy was not significantly different from that to a repeated Pap smear (odds ratio, 1.40; 95% confidence interval, 0.80-2.46). The use of as many as 3 patient reminders substantially improved adherence to follow-up. Women without insurance and women attending 1 of the 3 clinics were less likely to adhere to any follow-up recommendation (hazard ratio for no insurance, 0.43 [95% confidence interval, 0.20-0.93], and for clinic, 0.35 [95% confidence interval, 0.15-0.73]). Adherence to follow-up was low in this family planning clinic population, no matter what type of follow-up was advised. Adherence was improved by the use of up to 3 reminders. Allocating resources to effective methods for improving adherence to follow-up of abnormal results may be more important than which follow-up procedure is recommended.\n \nThe 2001 American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology Consensus Guidelines recommend that women who have Papanicolaou (Pap) smears diagnosed as atypical squamous cells (ASC), cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) (ASC-H) should be referred for immediate colposcopic examination. The objective of this pilot study was to evaluate whether reflex human papillomavirus (HPV)-DNA testing performed on smears diagnosed as ASC-H may obviate the need for immediate colposcopic examination. All ThinPrep Pap smears that were diagnosed as ASC-H or atypical squamous metaplastic cells (ASMT) between 2001-2003 and that had HPV-DNA testing and subsequent histologic and/or cytologic follow-up were evaluated. Those smears that were diagnosed as ASMT were reviewed and reclassified under the 2001 Bethesda System as either ASC of undetermined significance (ASCUS) or ASC-H. Smears that were diagnosed as ASCUS were excluded from the study. The study included of 48 smears that were diagnosed as ASC-H. All patients with biopsy-proven HSIL had positive high-risk (HR)-HPV results (100% negative predictive value). Approximately 80% of patients with ASC-H who had biopsy-proven, low-grade intraepithelial lesion on follow-up had positive HR-HPV results. Among the patients who had ASC-H with negative follow-up, 50% had positive HR-HPV results, and 50% had negative HR-HPV results. Among patients with ASC-H, a negative HR-HPV result was found to be an excellent predictor of the absence of HSIL. The results of this pilot study suggested that HPV-DNA testing may serve as a means to better select which patients with ASC-H on Pap smear should undergo colposcopic examination. This approach potentially may reduce medical costs and eliminate the need for routine colposcopic examination among patients with ASC-H Pap smears.\n"}]}]}}

The traditional cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide-based method was modified for DNA isolation from pollen. Taxon-specific DNA sequences were identified via bioinformatics or literature searches and were PCR amplified from the matching allergenic taxa; based on the sequences of PCR products, complementary or degenerate TaqMan probes were developed. The accuracy of the quantitative real-time PCR assay was tested on 3 plant species. The setup of a modified DNA extraction protocol allowed us to achieve good-quality pollen DNA. Taxon-specific nuclear gene fragments were identified and sequenced. Designed primer pairs and probes identified selected pollen taxa, mostly at the required classification level. Pollen was properly identified even when collected on routine aerobiological tape. Preliminary quantification assays on pollen grains were successfully performed on test species and in mixes. The real-time PCR approach revealed promising results in pollen identification and quantification, even when analyzing pollen mixes. Future perspectives could concern the development of multiplex real-time PCR for the simultaneous detection of different taxa in the same reaction tube and the application of high-throughput molecular methods.\n \nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the relative frequencies of sensitisation to four common inhalant allergens in two atopic populations suffering from asthma and/or rhinitis. One had been studied in the period of 1975 till 1979, and a second population was evaluated between 1992 and 1995. At both time periods patients with inhalant allergy and visiting our outpatient clinic were included. Quantification of IgE to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, birch, timothy grass, and mugwort was performed via the Phadebas RAST technique (Pharmacia, Brussels, Belgium). In patients suffering from respiratory allergy the frequency of birch pollen sensitisation significantly increased from 13% in the period 1975-1979 to 34% in the period 1992-1995. In contrast, the frequency of house dust mite, timothy grass pollen, and mugwort pollen sensitisation remained almost unchanged. The increase was not associated with an increase in the birch pollen count. Birch pollen hypersensitivity has almost tripled among atopic subjects during the last 2 decades. The exact mechanisms for this increase remain to be evaluated.\n"}]}]}}

Histologic and ultrastructural studies of normal corneas showed significant differences in the direction of collagen fibrils and/or the degree of lamellar interweaving in Bowman's layer, the anterior third of the corneal stroma, the posterior two-thirds of the corneal stroma, and Descemet's membrane. Cohesive tensile strength testing directly supported these morphologic findings as the stronger, more rigid regions of the cornea were located anteriorly and peripherally. This suggests that PRK and ASA, and secondarily SBK, should be biomechanically safer than conventional LASIK with regard to risk for causing keratectasia after surgery. Because adult human corneal stromal wounds heal slowly and incompletely, all excimer laser keratorefractive surgical techniques still have some distinct disadvantages due to inadequate reparative wound healing. Despite reducing some of the risk for corneal haze compared to conventional PRK, ASA cases still can develop corneal haze or breakthrough haze from the hypercellular fibrotic stromal scarring. In contrast, similar to conventional LASIK, SBK still has the short- and long-term potential for interface wound complications from the hypocellular primitive stromal scar. Ophthalmic pathology and basic science research show that SBK and ASA are improvements in excimer laser keratorefractive surgery compared to conventional LASIK or PRK, particularly with regard to maintaining corneal biomechanics and perhaps moderately reducing the risk of corneal haze. However, most of the disadvantages caused by wound healing issues remain.\n \nMicrocirculation and oxygen supply in cervical skin were measured with an optical, noninvasive method in patients with or without radiotherapy before neck dissection. The course of wound healing was monitored after the surgical procedure to identify predictive factors for postoperative wound healing disorders. Tissue spectrophotometry and laser Doppler flowmetry were used to determine capillary oxygen saturation, hemoglobin concentration, blood flow, and blood velocity at 2-mm and 8-mm depths in the cervical skin of 91 patients before neck dissection in a maxillofacial unit of a university hospital in Munich, Germany. Parameters were evaluated for differences between patients with irradiation (24) and without (67) and patients with wound healing disorders (25) and without (66) (univariate or multivariate statistical analyses). Velocity at 2 mm was lower in irradiated skin (P = .016). Flow at 2 mm was higher in patients with wound healing disorders (P = .018). High flow values could help to identify patients at risk for cervical wound healing disorders.\n"}]}]}}

The study took place at a quaternary referral center that specializes in pelvic exenteration. Patients referred for pelvic exenteration from October 1994 to November 2012 were reviewed. Patients who did and did not receive radiotherapy as part of their primary rectal cancer treatment were compared. The main outcomes of interest were resection margins, overall survival, disease-free survival, and surgical morbidities. There were 108 patients, of which 87 were eligible for analysis. Patients who received radiotherapy for their primary rectal cancer (n = 41) required more radical exenterations (68% vs 44%; p = 0.020), had lower rates of clear resection margins (63% vs 87%; p = 0.010), had increased rates of surgical complications per patient (p = 0.014), and had a lower disease-free survival (p = 0.022). Overall survival and disease-free survival in patients with clear margins were also lower in the primary irradiated patients (p = 0.049 and p < 0.0001). This difference in survival persisted in multivariate analysis that corrected for T and N stages of the primary tumor.

The frequency of rectal cancer in this population, surgical intervention, general outcomes and cancer recurrence are described. Data on 1850 patients undergoing restorative proctocolectomy from 1983 to 2001 were reviewed. Information was gathered from data in the department's pelvic pouch database, as well as pathology and surgical reports. Follow-up questionnaires routinely sent to patients as part of the database were included in the analysis to determine current functional status. Mean follow-up period was 7.5 years after surgery. Seventy patients had coexisting colorectal cancer at time of IPAA. 7 (10%) of cancers were incidental. Pre-operative duration of disease was 18.6 years. Twenty-six of the cancers were rectal cancers. The most common form of anastomosis in the rectal cancers was mucosectomy, especially in pre-operatively known rectal cancer or low lying dysplasia. Preferred surgical technique for rectal cancer in mucosal ulcerative colitis (UC) included high ligation of mesenteric vessels with radical colectomy and taped occlusion of the rectum with irrigation of the rectal stump with Turnbull solution prior to mucosectomy. Patients with Stage 3 cancers received postoperative chemotherapy. Post-operative radiation therapy was not commonly recommended. Five of 70 patients were deceased from metastatic colon cancer; 55 patients were confirmed alive with good to excellent pouch function with a follow-up range of 1-17 years. Restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis is a successful surgical approach for patients with coexisting colorectal cancer in UC. When the appropriate surgical technique is used in patients with colon or rectal cancer, along with adjuvant chemotherapy when appropriate, prognosis and function is very good.\n"}]}]}}

A total of 360 core needle biopsies was obtained from 169 breast lesions in 146 patients. Additional open breast biopsy was performed in 111 women (127/169 breast lesions); the remaining 42 lesions were followed up for at least 24 months. 3D ultrasound visualization of the needle in the postfiring position was used to classify the biopsy as central, marginal or outside the lesion.

A median of two core samples per lesion provided for all the lesions a sensitivity for malignancy of 96.9%, specificity of 100%, false-positive rate of 0% and false-negative rate of 3.1%, and for the excised lesions a sensitivity of 96.5%, specificity of 100%, false-positive rate of 0%, false-negative rate of 3.5% and an underestimation rate of 3.4%. 3D ultrasound validation of the postfiring needle position is an efficient adjunct to ultrasound-guided LCNB.

The dataset from both of these examinations was digitally stored and evaluated. MDCT was performed in nonanesthetized patients; however, in the RT 3D TEE group, general anesthesia was established. The distances from the right coronary artery and the left coronary artery ostium were measured retrospectively. Bland-Altman Plots and linear regression analysis showed excellent correlation between the 2 methodologies; intraobserver and interobserver variance were calculated using analysis of variance. Krippendorff's \u03b1 indicated excellent agreement between the 2 observers (0.96 and 0.98) as well as between RT 3D TEE and MDCT (0.97 and 0.98). The observations showed that RT 3D TEE reliably can measure the coronary ostium distance from the aortic annulus.

Multicenter retrospective cohort study of patients with recurrent vulvar cancer who presented with groin and/or pelvic lymph node metastases between 2000 and 2014 at 3 tertiary referral hospitals. Our primary outcome was to assess survival after groin recurrence of vulvar cancer and the influence of multimodal treatment. All analyses were done using Stata 12 (Stata Corporation, College Station, Tex). Hazard ratios (HRs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals were calculated using a Cox proportional hazards model. We identified 30 patients with a median time from diagnosis to groin recurrence of 10 months. The median follow-up of patients who were alive at the time of analysis was 22 months (range, 9-123 months). A Kaplan-Meier estimate showed an overall survival rate of 50% after 7 years.

Three-month mortality was 3% for GM and 0% for SM (n.s.). Overall survival rates were 67% and 51% for SM and GM at 3 years (n.s.), and 35 and 31% at 5 years (n.s.). Disease-free survival to 5 years was higher in SM patients (14% vs. 11%, P = 0.009). GM of CRC and SLM was associated with fewer procedures but did not influence overall survival. SM was associated with a longer delay and increased use of chemotherapy between procedures, suggesting that more rigorous selection of SM patients for surgery may explain the higher disease-free survival after SLM resection.\n"}]}]}}

However, eye movement closely interacts with motion perception. The known eye-tracking difficulties in schizophrenia patients may interact with their motion perception. Two speed discrimination experiments were conducted in a within-subject design. In experiment 1, the stimulus duration was 150 msec to minimize the chance of eye-tracking occurrence. In experiment 2, the duration was increased to 300 msec, increasing the possibility of eye movement intrusion. Regular eye-tracking performance was evaluated in a third experiment. At 150 msec, speed discrimination thresholds did not differ between schizophrenia patients (n = 38) and control subjects (n = 33). At 300 msec, patients had significantly higher thresholds than control subjects (p = .03). Furthermore, frequencies of eye tracking during the 300 msec stimulus were significantly correlated with speed discrimination in control subjects (p = .01) but not in patients, suggesting that eye-tracking initiation may benefit control subjects but not patients. The frequency of eye tracking during speed discrimination was not significantly related to regular eye-tracking performance. Speed discrimination, per se, is not impaired in schizophrenia patients. The observed abnormality appears to be a consequence of impairment in generating or integrating the feedback information from eye movements. This study introduces a novel approach to motion perception studies and highlights the importance of concurrently measuring eye movements to understand interactions between these two systems; the results argue for a conceptual revision regarding motion perception abnormality in schizophrenia.\n \nEpisodic memory is significantly impaired in people with schizophrenia. The precise cause of this impairment has yet to be determined, as the formation of episodic memories is dependent on other processes, some of which also show impairment in schizophrenia. One such process is closure, that is, the filling-in of missing information. Failure to close adequately incomplete stimuli may cause people with schizophrenia to store inadequate or piecemeal representations in memory. Forty people with schizophrenia and 21 healthy comparison subjects participated in the study. The experiment was divided into six blocks, each of which involved both an encoding and a recognition phase. During the encoding phase, 20 figures were presented sequentially and participants had to determine whether each was symmetric or asymmetric. These figures were either complete or fragmented at three different levels. In subsequent recognition phase, 40 abstract figures (20 new and 20 old) were presented. All figures were complete in this phase. Memory performance of both groups was affected similarly by fragmentation, with an additional increase in performance afforded by a slight fragmentation for participants with schizophrenia. Slight fragmentation may have induced a perceptual difficulty that was mild enough to increase visual processing without compromising it. Closure was thus not involved in the episodic memory deficit of people with schizophrenia.\n"}]}]}}

We present results of per-oral transgastric splenectomy in a porcine model. The goal of this study was to determine the technical feasibility of per-oral transgastric splenectomy using a flexible endoscope. We performed acute experiments on 50-kg pigs. All animals were fed liquids for 3 days prior to procedure. The procedures were performed under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation. The flexible endoscope was passed per orally into the stomach and puncture of the gastric wall was performed with a needle knife. The puncture was extended to create a 1.5-cm incision using a pull-type sphincterotome, and a double-channel endoscope was advanced into the peritoneal cavity. The peritoneal cavity was insufflated with air through the endoscope. The spleen was visualized. The splenic vessels were ligated with endoscopic loops and clips, and then mesentery was dissected using electrocautery. Endoscopic splenectomy was performed on six pigs. There were no complications during gastric incision and entrance into the peritoneal cavity. Visualization of the spleen and other intraperitoneal organs was very good. Ligation of the splenic vessels and mobilization of the spleen were achieved using commercially available devices and endoscopic accessories. Transgastric endoscopic splenectomy in a porcine model appears technically feasible. Additional long-term survival experiments are planned.\n \nThe British Committee for Standards in Haematology currently recommends concomitant splenectomy in children with mild hereditary spherocytosis (HS) undergoing cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstones. However, splenectomy is associated with a risk of life-threatening infection, particularly in young children. The aim of this study was to audit the outcome of the practice of uncoupling splenectomy and cholecystectomy in such patients. Children referred with symptomatic gallstones complicating HS between April 1999 and April 2009 were prospectively identified and reviewed retrospectively. During this period, the policy was to undertake concomitant splenectomy only if indicated for haematological reasons and not simply because of planned cholecystectomy. A total of 16 patients (mean age 10.4, range 3.7 to 16 years, 11 women) with HS and symptomatic gallstones underwent cholecystectomy. Three patients subsequently required a splenectomy for haematological reasons 0.8-2.5 years after cholecystectomy; all three splenectomies were performed laparoscopically. There were no postoperative complications in the 16 patients; postoperative hospital stay was 1-3 days after either cholecystectomy or splenectomy. The 13 children with a retained spleen remain under regular review by a haematologist (median follow-up 4.6, range 0.5 to 10.6 years) and are well and transfusion independent. The advice to perform a concomitant splenectomy in children with mild HS undergoing cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstones needs revisiting. In the era of minimal access surgery, the need for splenectomy in such children should be judged on its own merits.\n"}]}]}}

We highlighted the majority of the plants commonly involved with the female reproductive system including This study is a narrative review of studies of plants that are possible alternative treatments for FSD. The species described have clinical and popular uses in different cultures as well as medical indications for female reproductive disturbances, mainly in climacteric women. We have also analyzed the evidence level of clinical studies. The main outcome assessed is the efficacy of plants in improving the symptoms of FSD. There is little evidence from the literature to recommend the use of medicinal plants when treating FSD. The majority of studies with a strong level of evidence are associated with the treatment of the vasomotor symptoms of menopause. Ferula hermonis, Angelica sinensis, and Gingko biloba may be suggested for arousal disorder studies. Cimicifuga racemosa, Trifolium pratense, and Vitex agnus-castus may be recommended for several FSD. Humulus lupulus and Tribulus terrestris may help with desire disorder studies. Lepidium meyenii should be studied further. Studies of these plants indicate that they may be useful as a possible alternative and/or complementary approach for studies aimed at the treatment of FSD. At this time, however, this review cannot recommend a plant that has a strong enough level of evidence for treatment of FSD. Thus, there is a need for clinical (double-blinded and randomized) studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of several plants that can exert a positive effect on the management of FSD.\n \nThe prospective memory (PM) construct is aimed at capturing cognitive operations involved in the successful accomplishment of delayed intentions. It is generally agreed that PM impairment occurs in patients with prefrontal lobes damage. To evaluate if there is a causal role of a deficit of executive abilities (failures of planning, set-shifting, selective attention, or working memory) over the PM impairment. We report a detailed investigation of PM and executive abilities in two patients with posttraumatic damage to prefrontal lobes who complained from a reduced compliance with appointments and daily routines. Laboratory tests confirmed a difficulty in fulfilling delayed intentions in response to the occurrence of critical events and elapsed time. In one patient, PM impairment was associated with poor performance on tests investigating planning, working memory, and mental shifting. The other patient performed in the normal range on all executive tests. Despite the frequent claim of a dependence of PM deficits from executive dysfunction, the reported cases demonstrate that this is not necessarily the case. The results are discussed in the light of current hypotheses relating PM impairment to other deficits that commonly occur as a result of damage to the prefrontal lobes.\n"}]}]}}

The control group is made up of 91 transplants, matched with those from the study group, whose donor and recipient were younger than 60 years. There were no differences between groups with regard to recipient age, sex, cause of death and renal function of the donor, hepatitis C and cytomegalovirus serologies, cold ischemia time, tubular necrosis, immediate diuresis, need for dialysis, human leukocyte antigen incompatibilities, hypersensitized patients, acute rejection, waiting time on dialysis, and days of admission. Survival in both groups at 1, 5, and 10 years was 97.6%, 87.2%, and 76.6% vs. 98.8%, 87.5%, and 69.5% for the patient (P=0.642), 92.9%, 81.3%, and 64.2% vs. 93.9%, 76.4%, and 69.5% for the graft (P=0.980), and 94.4%, 92.6%, and 77.4% vs. 94.3%, 86.7%, and 84.4% for the graft with death censured (P=0.747), respectively.

In addition, coinfection of CMV and IE has not been reported. Therefore, the current study was initiated to determine whether CMV infection is a risk factor for developing of IE after kidney transplantation. In a retrospectively study, we analyzed the medical records of 3700 kidney recipients at two transplant centers in Iran, between January 2000 and June 2008 for infective endocarditis. During the study, 15 patients with IE hospitalized in our centers were included. The predominant causative microorganisms (60%) were group D non-enterococcal streptococci and enterococci. Patient survival rate in all recipients was 66% at 6 months. Data analysis showed no significant differences in 6 months patient survival from hospitalization between both groups with and without CMV infection (P=0.2). The presentation time of infective endocarditis in recipients with CMV coinfection was more likely to be early when compared to CMV negative coinfection patients (P=0.03). The present study indicates that CMV infection may lead to predispose to infective endocarditis after kidney transplantation. Rapid diagnosis, effective treatment, and prompt recognition of complications in kidney transplant recipients are essential to good patient outcome.\n"}]}]}}

In Ghana maternal mortality ratio was 380 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2013. Skilled birth attendance has been shown to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity, yet in 2010 only 68 percent of mothers in Ghana gave birth with the assistance of skilled birth attendants. In 2005, the Ghana Health Service piloted a strategy that involved using the integrated Community-based Health Planning and Services (CHPS) program and training Community Health Officers (CHOs) as midwives to address the gap in skilled attendance in rural Upper East Region (UER). The study assesses the feasibility of and extent to which the skilled delivery program has been implemented as an integrated component of the existing CHPS, and documents the benefits and challenges of the integrated program. We employed an intrinsic case study design with a qualitative methodology. We conducted 41 in-depth interviews with health professionals and community stakeholders. We used a purposive sampling technique to identify and interview our respondents. The CHO-midwives provide integrated services that include skilled delivery in CHPS zones. The midwives collaborate with District Assemblies, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and communities to offer skilled delivery services in rural communities. They refer pregnant women with complications to district hospitals and health centers for care, and there has been observed improvement in the referral system. Stakeholders reported community members' access to skilled attendants at birth, health education, antenatal attendance and postnatal care in rural communities. The CHO-midwives are provided with financial and non-financial incentives to motivate them for optimal work performance. The primary challenges that remain include inadequate numbers of CHO-midwives, insufficient transportation, and infrastructure weaknesses. Our study demonstrates that CHOs can successfully be trained as midwives and deployed to provide skilled delivery services at the doorsteps of rural households. The integration of the skilled delivery program with the CHPS program appears to be an effective model for improving access to skilled birth attendance in rural communities of the UER of Ghana.\n \nTo determine the impact of Florida's Medicaid Demonstration 4 years post-implementation on per member per month (PMPM) Medicaid expenditures and whether receiving care through HMOs versus provider service networks (PSNs) in the Demonstration was associated with PMPM expenditures. Florida Medicaid claims from two fiscal years prior to implementation of the Demonstration (FY0405, FY0506) and the first four fiscal years after implementation (FY0607-FY0910) from two urban Demonstration counties and two urban non-Demonstration counties. A difference-in-difference approach was used to compare changes in enrollee expenditures before and after implementation of the Demonstration overall and specifically for HMOs and PSNs. Claims data were extracted for enrollees in the Demonstration and non-Demonstration counties and collapsed into monthly amounts (N = 26,819,987 person-months). Among SSI enrollees, the Demonstration resulted in lower increases in PMPM expenditures over time ($40) compared with the non-Demonstration counties ($186), with Demonstration PSNs lowering PMPM expenditures by $7 more than HMOs. Savings were also seen among TANF enrollees but to a lesser extent. The Medicaid Demonstration in Florida appears to result in lower PMPM expenditures. Demonstration PSNs generated slightly greater reductions in expenditures compared to Demonstration HMOs. PSNs appear to be a promising model for delivering care to Medicaid enrollees.\n"}]}]}}

The case records of patients consecutively undergoing CAB were reviewed. Patients were stratified retrospectively into high- or low-risk groups according to risk factors for significant carotid stenosis and perioperative stroke Overall, 205 consecutive patients underwent preoperative carotid screening. The prevalence of significant carotid stenosis was 5.8%. Univariate analysis confirmed that PVD (P=0.005), carotid bruit (P=0.003) and diabetes mellitus (P=0.05) were significant risk factors for stenosis. Carotid stenosis was a risk factor for stroke (P=0.03). Prevalence of carotid stenosis was higher in the high-risk group (9.1%) than the low-risk group (1.2%) (P<0.05). All concomitant or staged carotid endarterectomies/CAB (5/205) and all patients who had perioperative strokes (5/205) were in the high-risk group (P=0.01).

The 2 groups were similar in age (P =.9), left ventricular function (P =.7), extent of coronary artery disease (P =.5), carotid artery disease (P =.4), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P =.5). However, off-pump patients had more previous strokes (P =.05) and peripheral vascular disease (P =.02); on-pump patients had a higher preoperative New York Heart Association class (P =.01). In the matched pairs the mean number of bypass grafts was 2.8 +/- 1.0 in off-pump patients and 3.5 +/- 1.1 in on-pump patients (P <.001).

Both off- and on-pump procedures produced excellent early clinical results with low mortality. An advantage of an off-pump operation was less postoperative morbidity; however, less complete revascularization introduced uncertainty about late results. A disadvantage of on-pump bypass was higher morbidity that seemed attributable to cardiopulmonary bypass.\n"}]}]}}

Clinicopathological parameters and survival data were analyzed. Loss of DKK3 expression was found in 64 of 158 (40.5%) samples, and it was associated with advanced T stage (p < 0.001), lymph node metastasis (p < 0.001), UICC TNM stage (p < 0.001), tumor location (p = 0.029), lymphovascular invasion (p = 0.035), and perineural invasion (p = 0.032).

TNM stage (p = 0.028 and p < 0.001, respectively) and residual tumor (p < 0.001 and p = 0.003, respectively) were independent predictors of disease-free and overall survival. Based on the preoperative clinical stage assessed by computed tomography (CT), loss of DKK3 expression was predominantly associated with worse prognosis in patients with clinically node-negative advanced gastric cancer (AGC). The combination of DKK3 expression status and CT increased the accuracy of CT staging for predicting lymph node involvement from 71.5 to 80.0% in AGC patients. Loss of DKK3 protein expression was significantly associated with poor survival in patients with gastric cancer and was strongly correlated with the TNM stage. DKK3 might be a potential biomarker of lymph node involvement that can improve the predictive power of CT.\n"}]}]}}

In addition to lipid lowering, statins have a number of antiatherothrombotic and neuroprotective properties. In a preliminary observational study, we explored whether clinical outcome is improved in patients who are on treatment with statins when stroke occurs. We conducted a population-based case-referent study of 25- to 74-year-old stroke patients with, for each case of a patient who was on statin treatment at the onset of stroke (n=125), 2 referent patients who were not treated with statins but were matched for age, gender, year of onset, and stroke subtype (n=250). The unadjusted odds ratio for early discharge to home (versus late discharge or death) was 1.41 (95% CI 0.91 to 2.17) when patients on statin treatment were compared with referent stroke patients not on statins. Prognostic factors were, in general, more unfavorable among patients on statins. When this was adjusted for in a logistic regression model, the use of statins was a moderately strong but statistically nonsignificant predictor of discharge to home (multiple-adjusted odds ratio 1.42, 95% CI 0.90 to 2.22). The statistical power of this case-referent study was such that only large beneficial effects of statins in acute stroke could be confirmed. However, the observed trend, together with experimental observations, is interesting enough to warrant a more detailed analysis of the relationship between statins and stroke outcome.\n \nRecent studies have demonstrated that statins have pleiotropic effects, including anti-inflammatory effects and atrial fibrillation (AF) preventive effects. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of preoperative statin therapy in preventing AF after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). 221 patients underwent CABG in our hospital from 2004 to 2007. 14 patients with preoperative AF and 4 patients with concomitant valve surgery were excluded from this study. Patients were divided into two groups to examine the influence of statins The overall incidence of postoperative AF was 26%. Postoperative AF was significantly lower in the Statin group compared with the Non-statin group (16% versus 33%, p = 0.005). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that independent predictors of AF development after CABG were preoperative statin therapy (odds ratio [OR] 0.327, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.107 to 0.998, p = 0.05) and age (OR 1.058, 95% CI 1.004 to 1.116, p = 0.035).

The study used a cross-sectional design to examine the independent effects of NHIS enrolment on two dependent variables (frequency and timing of antenatal visits) among 1610 Ghanaian women. Negative binomial and logit models were fitted given that count and categorical variables were employed as outcome measures, respectively. Regardless of socio-economic and demographic factors, women enrolled in the NHIS make more antenatal visits compared with those not enrolled; however, there was no statistical association with the timing of the crucial first visit. Women who are educated, living in urban areas and are wealthy were more likely to attend antenatal care than those living in rural areas, uneducated and from poorer households. The NHIS should be strengthened and resourced as it may act as an important tool for increasing antenatal care attendance among women in Ghana.\n \nMedicare beneficiaries who have chronic conditions are responsible for a disproportionate share of Medicare fee-for-service expenditures. The objective of this study was to analyze the change in the health of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Part A (hospital insurance) between 2008 and 2010 by comparing the prevalence of 11 chronic conditions. We conducted descriptive analyses using the 2008 and 2010 Chronic Conditions Public Use Files, which are newly available from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and have administrative (claims) data on 100% of the Medicare fee-for-service population. We examined the data by age, sex, and dual eligibility (eligibility for both Medicare and Medicaid). Medicare Part A beneficiaries had more chronic conditions on average in 2010 than in 2008. The percentage increase in the average number of chronic conditions was larger for dual-eligible beneficiaries (2.8%) than for nondual-eligible beneficiaries (1.2%). The prevalence of some chronic conditions, such as congestive heart failure, ischemic heart disease, and stroke/transient ischemic attack, decreased. The deterioration of average health was due to other chronic conditions Analyzing the prevalence of 11 chronic conditions by using Medicare claims data provides a monitoring tool that can guide health care providers and policy makers in devising strategies to address chronic conditions and rising health care costs.\n"}]}]}}

A total of 4 children aged 5-14\u00a0years with a sternal fracture were treated in 2\u00a0years, 2\u00a0children were hospitalized for pain management and 2 remained in outpatient care. Isolated sternal fractures in childhood are often due to typical age-related traumatic incidents. Ultrasonography is a useful diagnostic tool for fracture detection and radiography is the method of choice for visualization of the extent of the dislocation.\n \nTraumatic displaced femoral neck fractures in the elderly can be treated with cemented or uncemented hemiarthroplasty with good outcomes. Earlier studies reported a higher incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) associated with cemented prostheses in elective total hip or knee arthroplasty. In addition, the hypercoagulable state after a traumatic femoral neck fracture and possible thrombogenic properties of bone cement could put these patients at greater risk for thromboembolism. We aimed to compare the incidence of DVT and progression to pulmonary embolism (PE) or mortality in cemented and uncemented hemiarthroplasty. The data of 271 patients treated with cemented or uncemented hemiarthroplasty after a traumatic displaced femoral neck fracture was retrospectively analysed for the incidence of DVT. The level of thrombosis, progression to PE and mortality were compared. There were 133 (49.1%) patients with cemented hemiarthroplasty, while 138 (50.9%) had uncemented hemiarthroplasty. The patients had an average age of 76.6 (range 53-99) years and 11 (4.1%) patients had DVT. There were no significant differences in development of DVT, level of thrombosis, PE and mortality regardless of whether a cemented or an uncemented prosthesis was used. Cemented hemiarthroplasty is not associated with higher risks of DVT, PE or mortality in patients with traumatic displaced femoral neck fracture. Cemented prostheses can be safely used for this group of patients.\n"}]}]}}

Substitution with androgens at physiological levels improves sexual function in women who experience decreased sexual desire and androgen deficiency from surgical menopause, pituitary disease, and age-related decline in androgen production in the ovaries. Measuring bioactive testosterone is difficult and new methods have been proposed, including measuring the primary androgen metabolite androsterone glucuronide (ADT-G). The aim of this study was to investigate a possible correlation between serum levels of androgens and sexual desire in women and whether the level of ADT-G is better correlated than the level of circulating androgens with sexual desire. This was a cross-sectional study including 560 healthy women aged 19-65 years divided into three age groups. Correlations were considered to be statistically significant at P<0.05. Sexual desire was determined as the total score of the sexual desire domain of the Female Sexual Function Index. Total testosterone (TT), calculated free testosterone (FT), androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), and ADT-G were analyzed using mass spectrometry. Sexual desire correlated overall with FT and androstenedione in the total cohort of women. In a subgroup of women aged 25-44 years with no use of systemic hormonal contraception, sexual desire correlated with TT, FT, androstenedione, and DHEAS. In women aged 45-65 years, androstenedione correlated with sexual desire. No correlations between ADT-G and sexual desire were identified. In the present study, FT and androstenedione were statistically significantly correlated with sexual desire in the total cohort of women. ADT-G did not correlate more strongly than circulating androgens with sexual desire and is therefore not superior to measuring circulating androgens by mass spectrometry.\n \nScreening mammogram can decrease the mortality of breast cancer. Studies show that women avoid mammogram because of fear of pain, diagnosis, and radiation. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a radiolucent pad (MammoPad; Hologic Inc, Bedford [MA], US) during screening mammogram to reduce pain in Chinese patients and the possibility of glandular dose reduction. This case series was conducted in a private hospital in Hong Kong. Between November 2011 and January 2012, a total of 100 Chinese patients were recruited to our study. Left mammogram was performed without MammoPad and served as a control. Right mammogram was performed with the radiolucent MammoPad. All patients were then requested to complete a simple questionnaire. The degree of pain and discomfort was rated on a 0-10 numeric analogue scale. Significant reduction in discomfort was defined as a decrease of 10% or more. Of the 100 patients enrolled in this study, 66.3% of women reported at least a 10% reduction in the level of discomfort with the use of MammoPad. No statistical differences between age, breast size, and the level of discomfort were found. The use of MammoPad significantly reduced the level of discomfort experienced during mammography. Radiation dose was also reduced.\n"}]}]}}

A retrospective review was conducted of all patients undergoing tissue expander/implant breast reconstruction from November of 2010 to November of 2012 at a single institution. Breasts were divided into two cohorts A total of 1211 breasts met inclusion criteria. The control group (November of 2010 to October of 2011) included 606 breasts. The Biopatch cohort (November of 2011 to October of 2012) included 605 breasts. When comparing breasts with disks to controls, there were no statistical differences in overall infection (6.2 versus 7.4 percent; p = 0.4235), major infection (4.0 versus 4.3 percent; p = 0.8853), need for explantation (2.2 versus 1.8 percent; p = 0.5372), and mastectomy skin flap necrosis (12.6 versus 14.6 percent; p = 0.3148).

Biopatch disks do not reduce the rate infectious complications in patients undergoing immediate tissue expander breast reconstruction. Other conventional risks, including medical comorbidities, obesity, and mastectomy skin flap necrosis, remain significantly associated with infectious complications.

The objective of the current study was to determine whether the survival of women with recurrent breast cancer has improved from 1974 to 2000. The authors analyzed the survival experience of 834 women who developed recurrent breast cancer between November 1974 and December 2000. All patients had been treated previously with adjuvant anthracycline-based protocols. Patients were divided into five consecutive groups based on year of breast cancer recurrence, and survival was compared across the five groups. Because some prognostic variables were divided unevenly divided among the cohorts, a multivariate model was created to determine the association of year of recurrence and survival after accounting for other prognostic factors. In the unadjusted analysis, there was a statistically significant improvement in survival across the five groups, and the more recent cohorts had longer survival (P < 0.001). Other variables that predicted longer survival after breast cancer recurrence included smaller initial tumor size, lower stage of disease, fewer lymph nodes involved, longer disease-free interval, estrogen receptor-positive tumors, and nonvisceral dominant site of disease recurrence. In the multivariate analysis, which adjusted for these prognostic factors, year of recurrence was associated with a trend toward improved survival, with a 1% reduction in risk for each increasing year. For these cohorts of patients, the authors present data suggesting that the prognosis for patients with recurrent breast cancer improved between 1974 and 2000.\n"}]}]}}

To investigate a large sample of pterygia for the presence of HPV in order to clarify the putative association between pterygia and HPV. 100 specimens of pterygium from Danish patients and 20 normal conjunctival biopsy specimens were investigated for the presence of HPV with PCR technique using beta-globin primers to access the quality of the extracted DNA and the HPV primers MY09/11 and GP5+/6+. HPV-positive specimens underwent subsequent HPV typing with type-specific HPV primers and further investigation with DNA in situ hybridisation (ISH). 90 of 100 investigated pterygia proved suitable for HPV analysis by PCR. As beta-globin could not be amplified, 10 specimens were excluded from the study. 4 of 90 pterygia harboured HPV. HPV type 6 was identified in all four HPV-positive pterygia. The 20 normal conjunctival biopsy specimens were beta-globin positive and HPV negative. All four pterygia that were HPV type 6 positive were DNA ISH negative.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether increasing rurality was associated with later presentation to healthcare services at a more advanced stage of aortic stenosis. This was a retrospective cohort study. Using ICD-10 discharge codes and local databases, 605 patients with aortic stenosis who presented between 31 November 1999 and 1 December 2008 were identified. Aortic stenosis was defined as a pressure gradient across the aortic valve of 25 mmHg or more. Patients with prior aortic valve replacement were excluded. Clinical notes were reviewed for all patients. Gender, age and pressure gradient across the aortic valve at presentation and patient GP-practice location were recorded. Patients were then assigned a Clinical Peripherality Index score based on the postcode of their GP's practice to define rurality.

It is unclear if these lower rates are due to patient, tumor, or treatment factors; thus, the potential to increase the use of sphincter-preserving surgery is unknown. The aim of this study is to identify the factors associated with the use of sphincter-preserving surgery and to quantify the potential for an increase in sphincter preservation. This population-based retrospective cohort study used patient-level data collected through a comprehensive, standardized review of hospital inpatient and outpatient medical records and cancer center charts. This study was conducted in all hospitals providing rectal cancer surgery in a Canadian province. All patients with a new diagnosis of rectal cancer from July 1, 2002 to June 30, 2006 who underwent potentially curative radical surgery were included. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with receiving a permanent colostomy. Patients were categorized as having received an appropriate or potentially inappropriate colostomy based on a priori determined patient, tumor, operative, and pathologic criteria. Of 466 patients who underwent radical surgery, 48% received a permanent colostomy. There was significant variation in the rate of sphincter-preserving surgery among the 10 hospitals that provided rectal cancer care (12%-73%, p = 0.0001). On multivariate analysis, male sex, low tumor height, and increasing tumor stage were associated with the receipt of a permanent colostomy. Among patients who received a permanent stoma, 65 of 224 (29%) patients received a potentially inappropriate stoma. On multivariate analysis, male sex and treatment in a medium- or low-volume hospital was associated with the receipt of a potentially inappropriate colostomy. This study was limited by its retrospective design.

The aim of this study is to determine predictors of early alcohol use that can easily be detected in Preventive Child Healthcare (PCH). We obtained data from the first two waves on 1261 Dutch adolescents who participated in TRAILS (TRacking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey) at ages 10-14 years and from the PCH records regarding ages 4-10 years. Early adolescence alcohol use (age 10-14 years) was defined as alcohol use at least once at ages 10-12 years (wave 1) and at least once in the previous 4 weeks at ages 12-14 years (wave 2). Predictors of early alcohol use concerned parent and teacher reports at wave 1 and PCH registrations, regarding the child's psychosocial functioning, and parental and socio-demographic characteristics. A total of 17.2% of the adolescents reported early alcohol use. Predictors of early alcohol use were teacher-reported aggressive behaviour [odds ratios (OR); 95% confidence interval (CI) A limited set of factors was predictive for early alcohol use. Use of this set may improve the detection of early adolescence alcohol use in PCH.\n \nComorbid major depression (MD) and alcohol use disorder (AUD), particularly in adolescents, have been shown to be associated with poorer subsequent MD outcomes. Longitudinal data were used to model associations between a four-level classification of MD/AUD during the period 15-18 years (neither; MD-only; AUD-only; comorbid MD/AUD) and MD over the period 18-35 years. These associations were then adjusted for confounding by a series of factors measured in childhood. The three disorder groups had rates of adult MD during the period 18-35 years that were significantly (p<.05) higher than that of the group with no disorder. Furthermore, those in the comorbid MD/AUD group had significantly (p <.05) higher rates of adult MD than those in the AUD-only group, and marginally (p <.10) higher rates of adult MD than those in the MD-only group. After adjustment for confounding, the difference in rates of adult MD between the MD-only group and the MD/AUD group were no longer statistically significant. The factors that explained the associations were gender, childhood behavior problems, and exposure to physical and sexual abuse. The data were obtained by self-report, and may have been subject to biases. The results of these analyses suggest that marginally higher rates of depression to age 35 amongst the comorbid MD/AUD group were explained by increased exposure to adverse childhood circumstances amongst members of the comorbid group. Adolescent MD/AUD comorbidity is likely to be a risk marker, rather than a causal factor in subsequent MD.\n"}]}]}}

We hypothesize that breast reduction surgery has a high satisfaction rate, and that body mass index (BMI), and the amount of breast tissue removed would not alter this outcome. The purpose of this study was to determine if there is an improvement in the quality of life in patients undergoing breast reduction surgery, and whether breast volume or patient size influences this outcome. A retrospective chart review was performed on 600 consecutive patients at a single institution from 2000 to 2010. Patients were mailed The Breast Q questionnaire to complete. Demographic, surgical, and clinical data were collected and entered into a database. Descriptive statistical analyses were conducted using SAS Software version 9.1.3 with statistical significance determined at P<0.05. A total of 178 surveys were returned and included in our study (a response rate of 29.6%). Patient data included a mean BMI of 28.3 (4.6) kg/m, and mean total amount of breast tissue removed of 1220.9 (665.4) g. The primary indications for patients having breast surgery were for symptomatic macromastia (85%), asymmetry (5.6%), and for cosmesis (2.5%). The Breast Q questionnaire demonstrated patients overwhelmingly agreed that they were satisfied with their breast surgery. The mean response was 2.8 with a standard deviation (SD) of 0.47 (where 1, disagree; 2, somewhat agree; and 3, definitely agree). Patient BMI and total amount of breast tissue removed had a statistically significant positive correlation (0.479; P<0.0001). There was no statistically significant difference between the amount of total breast tissue removed and patient response (P=0.57). The study supports a positive outcome after breast reduction surgery. Over 95% of the patients surveyed were satisfied and would do it again. It demonstrates the improvement of the patient's quality of life regardless of the amount of breast tissue removed. Furthermore, it suggests that the size and weight of the patient has no impact on this outcome. As we face new government and insurance restrictions for surgeries that have both cosmetic and reconstructive value, patient reported outcome studies may have an influence on future third-party payer.\n \nThe aim of study was to evaluate the importance of induced abortions for reproduction medicine in Czech Republic. Demographic analysis of data published by EUROSTAT and Czech statistical office. Department of Demography and Geodemography Faculty of Science, Charles University Prague. Widespread use of the liberal abortion law in socialist countries contributed to the decline of fertility rates only to the replacement level. In the Czech Republic total fertility rate dropped below 1.3 in 1995 and it did not increase above 1.5 children per woman till 2007. The increased use of modern contraceptive methods that results in a sharp decline in fertility and in a significant decrease of induced abortions can be documented. The total abortion rate fell from 1.54 abortions per a woman in 1990 to 0.34 in 2007. The proportion of women aged 15-49 years who were prescribed oral contraception increased from 4 percent in 1990 to 48 percent in 2007. An induced abortion is still used largely as a way to avoid birth of additional children by women who already have the number of children they want. This is in sharp contrast with the situation in the majority of Western European countries in which abortion is used mainly by teen-age girls whose attempts to avoid pregnancy have failed. In contrast to other demographic characteristics which classify the Czech Republic to Eastern Europe, the level of induced abortion rate is comparable with the levels observed in some Western European countries.\n"}]}]}}

Previous studies have demonstrated the ability of inexperienced persons to operate SADs after brief instruction. The aim of this pilot study was to determine whether an instruction manual consisting of four diagrams enables laypersons to operate a Laryngeal Mask Supreme\u00ae (LMAS) in the manikin. An instruction manual of four illustrations with speech bubbles displaying the correct use of the LMAS was designed. Laypersons were handed a bag containing a LMAS, a bag mask valve device (BMV), a syringe prefilled with air and the instruction sheet, and were asked to perform and ventilate the manikin as displayed. Time to ventilation was recorded and degree of success evaluated. A total of 150 laypersons took part. Overall 145 participants (96.7%) inserted the LMAS in the manikin in the right direction. The device was inserted inverted or twisted in 13 (8.7%) attempts. Eight (5.3%) individuals recognized this and corrected the position. Within the first 2 minutes 119 (79.3%) applicants were able to insert the LMAS and provide tidal volumes greater than 150 ml (estimated dead space). Time to insertion and first ventilation was 83.2 \u00b1 29 s. No significant difference related to previous BLS training (P = 0.85), technical education (P = 0.07) or gender could be demonstrated (P = 0.25). In manikin laypersons could insert LMAS in the correct direction after onsite instruction by a simple manual with a high success rate. This indicates some basic procedural understanding and intellectual transfer in principle. Operating errors (n = 91) were frequently not recognized and corrected (n = 77). Improvements in labeling and the quality of instructional photographs may reduce individual error and may optimize understanding.\n \nPropofol has been found to depress the laryngeal reflexes. We studied whether this property could be utilized to relieve laryngeal spasm. This study was conducted over a period of 3 years, and included children aged 3-10 years, ASA status I and II. Most of the children were undergoing minor surgical procedures, under general anaesthesia with Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA trade mark ) and caudal epidural analgesia. During this period, 20 patients developed laryngeal spasm on removal of the LMA at the end of surgery. Initially, they all were treated with 100% O2, with gentle positive pressure ventilation. Out of 20 patients, seven responded well with 100% O2 and gentle positive pressure ventilation. The remaining 13 were treated with a small dose of propofol (0.8 mg.kg-1 body weight). Laryngeal spasm was relieved successfully in 10 patients and three patients required intubation to improve their oxygenation. Propofol in a small dose (0.8 mg.kg-1 body weight) was a useful drug to relieve laryngeal spasm in most children (76.9%) following the removal of the LMA. Because it was not found to be effective in all patients, succinylcholine still has a role to play in critical conditions. However, we recommend propofol as a suitable alternative for relieving laryngeal spasm in situations where succinylcholine is contraindicated.\n"}]}]}}

This observation throws light on the possibility of using INA as a marker of RAPL of OC. As INA can be measured in axial MRI sections, it can be used in differentiation of the cases with prefixed OC from others during pre-operative work up for pituitary surgeries and to identify individuals 'at risk' during subfrontal approach for pituitary lesions.\n"}]}]}}

The second part of the study consisting of a telephone survey to assess timing and details concerning the circumcision, included two groups 162 neonates (108 males, 54 females) were hospitalised with UTI. Mean age at admission was significantly lower in males (27.5 vs 37.7 days, p = 0.0002). The incidence of UTI in males peaked at 2-4 weeks of age, that is, the period immediately following circumcision. In females, the incidence tended to rise with age. Accordingly, male predominance disappeared at 7 weeks and the male-to-female ratio reversed. In the second part of the study, 111 males (< or =1 month old) were included There was a higher preponderance of UTI among male neonates. Its incidence peaked during the early post-circumcision period, as opposed to the age-related rise in females.

The aim of this study was to assess whether acute diverticulitis was more virulent in young patients. A retrospective, cross-sectional study included all patients who were admitted for a first episode of acute diverticulitis between January 2004 and December 2013. The patients were divided into two groups (\u226450 years and >50 years) based on their age. Patients' characteristics, clinical and surgical data were recorded and analyzed. Overall, 636 patients were included in the database, including 177 (27.8%) in the younger group and 459 in the elder group. There were no significant differences between the groups in disease complexity, peritonitis, laboratory work-up, vital signs on presentation, bowel obstruction or the presence of fistula and abscess in need of drainage. Younger patients had more free extra-luminal air on computed tomography (CT) scan (P\u2009=\u20090.03).

Length of hospital stay (P\u2009=\u20090.0001) was longer and postoperative complications were more common in the elder patients. The clinical presentation of acute diverticulitis does not seem to be worse in the young population. Younger patients tend to have a more severe presentation on CT scan and more readmissions, but this did not translate to a more severe disease course.\n"}]}]}}

Though there is evidence of improved quality of patient care and outcomes with well-established models of care, we do not know if the functional recovery in activities of daily living among this group of patients is also dependant on age. We hypothesize that there will be a difference in Modified Barthel Index (MBI) scores between the 'older old' (>85 years) and the 'younger old' (<85 years). Hip fracture patients (>60 years) treated surgically were divided into Group A (below 85 years) and Group B (above 85 years). Demographic data, Charlson's Comorbidity Index (CCI) score, time to surgery and length of stay (LOS) were recorded. To assess the recovery in activities of daily living, the MBI scores were measured for the following intervals; pre-fall, at discharge, at 6-month and at 1-year follow-up. The mean age for Group A (n = 120) was 77 years (60-85) and the mean age for Group B (n = 59) was 91.8 years (86-108). There was no significant difference in the mean CCI (A We conclude that age is not a factor in determining functional recovery with regard to activities of daily living in an integrated model of care for geriatric hip fracture patients.\n"}]}]}}

The study was a cross-sectional survey. The study was conducted in the United States. The study comprised adults aged 18 years or older with chronic disease-related functional limitations. Data were obtained from the 2002 and 2007 U.S. National Health Interview Survey to compare the use of 22 CAM therapies (n=9313 and n=7014, respectively). Estimates were age adjusted to the year 2000 U.S. standard population. The unadjusted and age-standardized prevalence of overall CAM use (22 therapies comparable between both survey years) was higher in 2007 than in 2002 (30.6% versus 26.9%, p<0.001 and 34.4% versus 30.6%, p<0.001, respectively). Adults with functional limitations that included changing and maintaining body position experienced a significant increase in CAM use between 2002 and 2007 (31.1%-35.0%, p<0.01). The use of deep breathing exercises was the most prevalent CAM therapy in both 2002 and 2007 and increased significantly during this period (from 17.9% to 19.9%, p<0.05). The use of meditation, massage, and yoga also increased significantly from 2002 and 2007 (11.0%-13.5%, p<0.01; 7.0%-10.9%, p<0.0001; and 5.1% to 6.6%, p<0.05, respectively), while the use of the Atkins diet decreased (2.2%- 1.4%, p<0.01). Among U.S. adults with chronic disease-related functional limitations, the overall increase in CAM use from 2002 to 2007 was significant, particularly among those with changing and maintaining body position limitations.\n \nTo compare children's, parents' and physicians' perceptions of children's body size. We administered a structured questionnaire of body size perception using a descriptive Likert scale keyed to body image figures to children ages 12 to 18 years. The same scale was given to parents of children ages 5 to 18 years. The sample consisted of 91 children and their parents being seen in the Pediatric Gastroenterology Clinic for concerns unrelated to overweight. Weight and height of the children were measured, and body mass index (BMI) was calculated. The children's BMI percentiles were categorized as underweight (<15th), normal (15th-85th), overweight (85th-95th), and obese (95th and above). The attending physician independently completed the body image and description scale and indicated the figure that most accurately represented the patient without reference to BMI standards. Accuracy of the patients', parents', and doctors' estimates were statistically compared. The sample population consisted of 6.4% underweight, 70.5% normal weight, 7.7% overweight, and 15.4% obese. Forty-four percent of parents underestimated children's body size using word descriptions and 47% underestimated using figures. Forty percent of the children underestimated their own body size using descriptions and 43% underestimated using figures. The physicians in this study had a higher percentage of correct estimates; however, they underestimated 33% of the patients using both word descriptions and figures. Some obese children were not recognized, and several average children were perceived as underweight. Many children underestimated their degree of overweight. Their parents and even their attending physicians shared this misperception. This study demonstrates the need to further educate physicians to recognize obesity and overweight so that they can counsel children and their families.\n"}]}]}}

We have studied 14 patients with CNFPAs. The response of alpha-SU to the administration of TRH was studied in each patient before the surgery. alpha-SU blood serum level increase over 50% of the baseline level after TRH treatment was considered to be significant. The patients were divided into 2 groups, each including 7 subjects. The first group included the patients with gonadotropinomas (tumors immunopositive for FSH and/or LH or their free subunits). The second group included the patients with adenomas immunonegative for gonadotropins and alpha-SU. The basal level of alpha-SU was elevated over the upper limit of normal range in two patients of the first group (gonadotroph adenomas) and in one in the second group. All but one patient from the first group and none of seven patients with tumors immunonegative for FSH, LH or alpha-SU, had a significant alpha-SU (over 50%) response to TRH. In three of seven patients with gonadotropins immunonegative tumors a decrease of alpha-SU serum level after TRH was observed. The measurement of alpha-SU serum level in response to TRH administration seems to be useful in preoperative identification of gonadotroph adenomas among other nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas.\n \nVerify whether a journal's impact factor is a mechanism that modifies the ethical requirements described in the instructions provided to authors of articles published in Brazilian medical journals. 48 selected journals were divided into two groups The average score of the impact-factor group was significantly higher than that of the no-impact-factor group (3.12 \u00b1 1.03 vs. 2.08 \u00b1 1.64, p=0.0121). When each ethical requirement was compared between the groups, there was significant difference only between the requirement of an informed consent and the disclosure of conflicts of interest (p < 0.05). The impact factor is a determinant factor on the ethics included in the instructions to authors of articles in scientific journals, showing that higher-quality journals seek better-designed articles that are conscientious at the beginning of the research.\n"}]}]}}

We investigated for the first time whether in vitro combinations of 2ME with various chemotherapeutic compounds may result in an additive inhibitory effect on the proliferation of human ovary cancer cells. As a model two different human ovary cancer cell lines were used. All cell lines were incubated with equimolar concentrations of 2ME (0.8-25 microM) and the chemotherapeutics epirubicine, doxorubicine, paclitaxel, docetaxel, carboplatin, vinorelbine, 5-fluorouracil and mafosfamide. Proliferation was measured after four days using the ATP-chemosensitivity test. For both ovary cancer cell lines a significant additive effect of 2ME with epirubicine and carboplatin was observed at the lower concentration range of these chemotherapeutic substances. 2ME is able to enhance the antiproliferative activity of certain chemotherapeutics at pharmacological relevant concentrations. This estradiol metabolite is currently in a phase II trial in patients with refractary metastatic breast cancer and the tolerability has been shown to be very good. The combination of 2ME with chemotherapeutics may therefore offer a new clinically relevant treatment regimen for hormone-dependent cancer.\n \nSurgical excision of ovarian endometriomas in patients desiring pregnancy has recently been criticized because of the risk of damage to healthy ovarian tissue and consequent reduction of ovarian reserve. A correct diagnosis in cases not scheduled for surgery is therefore mandatory in order to avoid unexpected ovarian cancer misdiagnosis. Endometriosis is often associated with high levels of CA125. This marker is therefore not useful for discriminating ovarian endometrioma from ovarian malignancy. The aim of this study was to establish if the serum marker CA72-4 could be helpful in the differential diagnosis between ovarian endometriosis and epithelial ovarian cancer. Serums CA125 and CA72-4 were measured in 72 patients with ovarian endometriomas and 55 patients with ovarian cancer. High CA125 concentrations were observed in patients with ovarian endometriosis and in those with ovarian cancer. A marked difference in CA72-4 values was observed between women with ovarian cancer (71.0%) and patients with endometriosis (13.8%) (P < 0.0001). This study suggests that CA72-4 determination can be useful to confirm the benign nature of ovarian endometriomas in women with high CA125 levels.\n"}]}]}}

Assessing joint lines (JLs) by means of bony landmarks is inadvisable because of large variations in human anatomy. Because of the inherent symmetry of the human body, we hypothesised that JLs may be directly assessed by measuring the distances from the bony landmarks to the JL of the contralateral knee by means of radiographic images. Using scaled weight-bearing radiographs in anteroposterior view of both knees, two independent observers measured the distances from the fibular head, the medial and lateral epicondyle, and the adductor tubercle to the JL. A two-sided p value of \u22640.05 was considered statistically significant. Two hundred knees of 100 patients (50 men and 50 women) were examined. For the fibular head, the mean difference between the treated and the control knee was 0.0 mm with narrow confidence limits ranging from -1.1 to 1.1. As a new assessment method, we have suggested to assess the JL by means of radiographs of the contralateral knee. The most precise parameter was found to be the distance between the fibular head and the JL. The level of arthritis, age, gender, visibility of the landmarks, and misalignment did not influence measurement accuracy. This parameter is the first tibia-related landmark for assessing the JL, which advantageously corresponds to the tibia-first technique in revision surgery. Diagnostic Study, Level II.\n \nIn vivo comparative gap measurements were performed in three different patella positions (reduced, subluxated and everted) using offset-type-force-controlled-spreader-system. Prospectively, 50 knees were operated by total knee arthroplasty using a navigation-assisted gap-balancing technique. The offset-type-force-controlled-spreader-system was used for gap measurements. This commercially available instrument allows controllable tension in patella-reduced position. The mediolateral gaps of knee extension (0\u00b0) and flexion (90\u00b0) angle were recorded in three different patella positions; reduced, subluxated and everted. Any gap differences of more than 3 mm were considered as a meaningful difference. Correlation between the difference with the demographic data, preoperative radiologic alignment and intraoperative data was analysed. For statistical analysis, ANOVA and Pearson's correlation test were used. The gaps in patella eversion demonstrated smaller gaps both in knee extension and flexion position compared to the gaps of patella reduction position. The amount of decreased gaps was more definite in knee flexion position. Statistically significant difference was observed for the lateral gap of patella eversion compared to gap of patella reduction in knee flexion position (p < 0.05). There were notable cases of variability in knee flexion position. Significant portion of 12 (24 %) knees of patella subluxation and 33 (66 %) knees of patella evertion demonstrated either increased or decreased gaps in knee flexion position compared to the gaps of patella reduction position. The gaps in patella eversion demonstrated smaller gaps both in knee extension and flexion position compared to the gaps of patella reduction position. The amount of decreased gaps was more definite in knee flexion position. Therefore, the intraoperative patellar positioning has influence on the measurement of the joint gap. Keeping the patella in reduced position is important during gap balancing. I.\n"}]}]}}

These include the magnitude of postoperative alignment and the type of material used. The effect of component design and material on postoperative alignment, however, has not been explored. We retrospectively reviewed 89 patients who underwent UKR with robotic guidance. Patients were divided into two groups, according to whether they had received an all-polyethylene inlay component (Inlay group) or a metal-backed onlay component (Onlay group). We explored the magnitude of mechanical alignment correction obtained in both groups. Mean postoperative mechanical alignment was significantly closer to neutral in the Onlay group (mean=2.8\u00b0; 95% CI=2.4\u00b0, 3.2\u00b0) compared to the Inlay group (mean=3.9\u00b0; 95% CI=3.4\u00b0, 4.4\u00b0) (R2=0.65; P=0.003), adjusting for gender, BMI, age, side and preoperative mechanical alignment (Fig. 2). Further exploration revealed that the thickness of the tibial polyethyelene insert had a significant effect on postoperative alignment when added to the model (R2=0.68; P=0.01). Patients who received a metal-backed Onlay tibial component obtained better postoperative mechanical alignment compared to those who received all-polyethylene Inlay prostheses. The thicker overall construct of Onlay prostheses appears to be an important determinant of postoperative alignment. Considering their higher survivorship rates and improved postoperative mechanical alignment, Onlay prostheses should be the first option when performing medial UKR.\n \nThe posterior tibial slope influences both the natural knee stability as well as the stability and kinematics after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Exact definition of the posterior tibial slope (PTS) requires lateral radiographs of the lower limb. Only lateral knee radiographs are routinely obtained after TKA, however. The purpose of the present study therefore was to analyse the relationship between PTS measurement results on short and expanded lateral knee radiographs. The PTS was measured on 100 consecutive lateral radiographs of the lower limb using the mechanical and three diaphyseal axes with various distances below the tibial plateau. Significant differences between PTS results were found for all three diaphyseal axes, with the smallest differences and the strongest correlation for a diaphyseal axis at 16 and 20\u00a0cm below the tibial plateau. Using short distances below the tibial plateau (6 and 10\u00a0cm) resulted in an overestimation of the PTS of 3\u00b0, on average. The PTS measurements in long lateral knee radiographs are more accurate compared to short radiographs. On short lateral knee radiographs, only a estimation of the PTS can be carried out.

All these variables were submitted to univariate and multivariate analysis to establish their impact on survival. Only tumour size appeared to be significantly different between the 3 groups. On univariate analysis, invasion of the perirenal fat, lymph node involvement, distant metastases and VEGF expression were significantly associated with survival (p < 0.01). On multivariate analysis, lymph node involvement, distant metastases and VEGF expression (OR 6.07) were identified as independent predictive factors of survival. Progression of a pT3 tumour into the renal vein and vena cava is not associated with increased tumour expression of VEGF. However, VEGF is an independent prognostic factor in this group of poor prognosis renal tumours.\n \nThe 2002 primary tumor classification for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) does not distinguish between patients with tumor thrombus involving the renal vein only and those with inferior vena cava tumor thrombus below the diaphragm. We evaluated the association of tumor thrombus level and fat invasion with outcome to determine if further subclassification would improve the prognostic accuracy of the current classification. We studied 675 patients treated with radical nephrectomy or nephron sparing surgery for pT3a (206, 30.5%), pT3b (422, 62.5%), pT3c (19, 2.8%) or pT4 (28, 4.2%) RCC at the Mayo Clinic between 1970 and 2000. Associations with outcome were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression. There were 531 deaths from RCC at a median of 1.5 years following nephrectomy. Patients with pT3b RCC and level I, II or III tumor thrombus were significantly more likely to die of RCC compared to patients with pT3b RCC and level 0 tumor thrombus (risk ratio 1.62, p <0.001). Patients with peripheral perinephric or renal sinus fat invasion were also more likely to die of RCC compared to patients without fat invasion (risk ratio 1.87, p <0.001). Therefore, patients with pT3 RCC were reclassified into 4 groups as thrombus level 0 without fat invasion, fat invasion only, thrombus level 0 with fat invasion or thrombus level I, II or III without fat invasion, and thrombus level I, II or III with fat invasion or thrombus level IV. This reclassification significantly improved prediction of death from RCC compared with the current classification (c indexes of 0.61 versus 0.55, respectively). Further subclassification of the primary tumor classification for patients with pT3 RCC improved prognostic accuracy.\n"}]}]}}

The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical outcome of all patients treated with cyclosporin at our institution over the past five years. We conducted a retrospective study of 46 patients who presented to a tertiary referral center. Initial responders were those who avoided colectomy; a sustained response was defined as a remission that lasted while the patient was taking oral cyclosporin and for three months after this therapy was discontinued. Thirty-two (69 percent) of 46 patients had an initial response to therapy, and 50 percent met criteria for a sustained response. Eleven of 23 sustained responders subsequently relapsed. At a mean of 22 months' follow-up, 26 percent of patients remain well and have never relapsed. Serious infective complications occurred in two patients, possibly attributable to therapy.

A substantial minority (26 percent) of all patients treated remain in long-term remission.\n \nTo determine whether successful completion of the Perinatal Education Programme (PEP) improves obstetric practice. The three midwife obstetric units (MOUs) in a health district of Mpumalanga were included in the study. Two MOUs enrolled in the PEP and the third did not. A 'before-and-after' study design was used to assess any changes in practice, and to monitor whether any changes occurred in the district during the time of the study; data were also collected at the third MOU. Data were collected by scoring of the obstetric files after the patient had delivered. We ascertained whether the obstetric history, syphilis testing, blood group testing, haemoglobin measurement and uterine growth assessment were performed during antenatal care along with whether appropriate action was taken. For intrapartum care, estimation of fetal weight, the performance of pelvimetry, blood pressure monitoring, urine testing, evaluation of head above pelvis, fetal heart rate monitoring, monitoring of contractions and plotting of cervical dilatation, and whether the appropriate actions were taken, were assessed. Eight of the 13 midwives at the two MOUs completed the PEP and all demonstrated an improvement in knowledge. Case notes of 303 patients from the various clinics were studied. There was no change in the referral patterns of any of the clinics during the study period. The obstetric history was well documented, but in no group was there a satisfactory response to a detected problem; appropriate action was taken in between 0% and 12% of cases. Syphilis testing was performed in 56-82% of cases, with no difference between the groups. The haemoglobin level was measured in only 4-15% of patients, with no difference before or after completion of the PEP. Where a problem in uterine growth was detected, an appropriate response occurred in 0-8% of patients and no difference before or after completion of the PEP was ascertained. In all groups, estimation of fetal weight and pelvimetry were seldom performed, the urine and fetal heart rate documentation were moderately well done and the blood pressure monitoring, assessment of head above pelvis, monitoring of contractions and plotting of cervical dilatation were usually performed. No differences before or after the PEP were detected. Where problems were detected, appropriate actions taken during labour improved, but not significantly. Completion of the obstetric manual of the PEP improved the knowledge of the midwives but no alteration in practice was detected.\n"}]}]}}

In earlier work from this unit, we used correlations between autoCPAP pressure and both OSA severity and obesity, to construct an algorithm to estimate the fixed CPAP pressure a patient required for subsequent clinical use. We wished to discover if these relationships could be reliably extended to a much more obese group. We performed a prospective cohort study in an obese population. Measurements of obesity were made, OSA severity was recorded, and the 95th centile autoCPAP pressure was recorded during 1\u00a0week of autoCPAP. Spearman's rank correlation was performed between measurements of obesity and autoCPAP pressure, and between OSA severity and autoCPAP pressure. Fifty-four obese individuals (median body mass index (BMI) 43.0\u00a0kg/m(2)), 52\u00a0% of whom had OSA (apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI)\u2009\u2265\u200915), had a median 95th centile autoCPAP pressure of 11.8\u2009cmH2O. We found no significant correlation between autoCPAP pressure and neck circumference, waist circumference or BMI. There was a moderate correlation between autoCPAP pressure and OSA severity (AHI r\u2009=\u20090.34, p\u2009=\u20090.02; oxygen desaturation index (ODI) r\u2009=\u20090.48, p\u2009<\u20090.001). In this population, neither BMI nor neck circumference nor waist circumference is predictive of autoCPAP pressure. Therefore, the previously derived algorithm does not adequately predict the fixed CPAP pressure for subsequent clinical use in these obese individuals. In addition, some subjects without OSA generated high autoCPAP pressures, and thus, the correlation between OSA severity and autoCPAP pressure was only moderate.\n \nTo investigate polysomnographic and anthropomorphic factors predicting need of high optimal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Retrospective data analysis. Three hundred fifty-three consecutive obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients who had a successful manual CPAP titration in our sleep disorders unit. The mean optimal CPAP was 9.5 +/- 2.4 cm H2O. The optimal CPAP pressure increases with an increase in OSA severity from 7.79 +/- 2.2 in the mild, to 8.7 +/- 1.8 in the moderate, and to 10.1 +/- 2.3 cm H2O in the severe OSA group. A high CPAP was defined as the mean + 1 standard deviation (SD; > or =12 cm H2O). The predictor variables included apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), age, sex, body mass index (BMI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT). High CPAP was required in 2 (6.9%), 6 (5.8%), and 63 (28.6%) patients with mild, moderate, and severe OSA, respectively. On univariate analysis, AHI, BMI, ESS score, and the proportion of males were significantly higher in those needing high CPAP. They also have a lower MSLT mean. On logistic regression, the use of high CPAP was 5.90 times more frequent (95% confidence interval 2.67-13.1) in severe OSA patients after adjustment for the other variables. The area under the receiver operator curve was 72.4%, showing that the model was adequate. Severe OSA patients are much more likely to need high CPAP levels. However, because of the low positive predictive value (only 28.6%), the clinical value of such information is limited. ESS and MSLT did not increase the predictive value for the need for high CPAP.\n"}]}]}}

Women were categorized based on the clinical presentation of their prior preterm delivery as having ACD, PPROM, or PTL. Risks for sonographic short cervical length and recurrent SPTB were compared between women based on the clinical presentation of their prior preterm birth. Log-linear regression was used to control for confounders. Of 522 patients included in this study, 96 (18.4%) had prior ACD, 246 (47.1%) had prior PPROM, and 180 (34.5%) had prior PTL. Recurrent PTB occurred in 55.2% of patients with a history of ACD compared with 27.2% of those with PPROM and 32.2% with PTL (P = .001). The mean gestational age at delivery was significantly lower for those with a history of ACD (34.0 weeks) compared with women with prior PPROM (37.2 weeks) or PTL (37.0 weeks) (P = .001). The lowest mean cervical length prior to 24 weeks was significantly shorter in patients with a history of advanced cervical dilation when compared with the other clinical presentations. Patients with a history of ACD are at an increased risk of having recurrent preterm birth and cervical shortening in a subsequent pregnancy compared with women with prior preterm birth associated PPROM or PTL.\n \nIt is stated commonly that the earlier in pregnancy bacterial vaginosis is diagnosed, the greater is the increase in risk of preterm birth compared with women without bacterial vaginosis. However, this contention is based on small numbers of women. In this analysis of 12,937 women who were screened for bacterial vaginosis as part of a previously conducted clinical trial, the odds ratio of preterm birth (<7 weeks of gestation) for asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis-positive versus bacterial vaginosis-negative women was evaluated among women who were screened from 8 to 22 weeks of gestation. The odds ratio of preterm birth among bacterial vaginosis-positive versus bacterial vaginosis-negative women ranged from 1.1 to 1.6 and did not vary significantly according to the gestational age at which bacterial vaginosis was screened. The odds ratio for preterm birth did not vary significantly by gestational age at diagnosis when bacterial vaginosis was subdivided into Gram stain score 7 to 8 or 9 to 10. Although bacterial vaginosis was associated with an increased risk of preterm birth, the gestational age at which bacterial vaginosis was screened for and diagnosed did not influence the increase.\n"}]}]}}

This can be done either (i) acutely during the clamp study using high-dose insulin infusion, or (ii) slowly overnight preceding the clamp study using a low-dose insulin infusion. We assessed whether the choice of either of these methods to obtain euglycaemia biases subsequent assessment of glucose metabolism and insulin action. We studied seven obese Type 2 diabetic patients twice Basal plasma glucose levels (mean +/- sd) were 5.5 +/- 0.5 and 10.7 +/- 2.9 mmol/l in the + ON and - ON studies, respectively, and were clamped at -5.5 mmol/l. Basal rates of glucose production (GP) were similar in the + ON and - ON studies, 83 +/- 13 vs. 85 +/- 14 mg m-2 min-1 (NS), whereas basal rates of glucose disappearance (Rd) were lower in the + ON than in the - ON study, 84 +/- 8 vs. 91 +/- 11 mg m-2 min-1 (P = 0.02).

Apart from basal rates of Rd, assessment of glucose turnover rates in euglycaemic clamp studies of Type 2 diabetic patients is not dependent on the method by which plasma glucose levels are lowered.\n"}]}]}}

The frequency of family history of psychiatric disorder was determined for each study as well as the relationship of family history to the presence of poststroke depression.

The existence of a positive family history of psychiatric disorder constitutes a risk factor for development of poststroke depression.

Because lysosomotropic amines can suppress major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigen presentation, their mechanism of action is potentially different from current immune suppressant drugs used to control GVHD such as cyclosporine. We investigated the use of cyclosporine and the lysosomotropic amines chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in combination for additive or synergistic immunosuppression on T-cell responses in vitro to MiHC and MHC in mice. We found that similar concentrations of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine suppress the T-cell response to MiHC in mice (C57BL/6 anti-BALB.B) and that lysosomotropic amines in combination with cyclosporine result in synergistic suppression of a proliferative response to MiHC. Similar suppression and synergy appear to be present in an alloreactive response (C57BL/6 anti-BALB/c). Direct inhibition by chloroquine of T-cell proliferative responses induced by anti-CD3epsilon in the absence of antigen-presenting cells is present at higher concentrations than that required to suppress responses to MiHC or MHC. Chloroquine appears to induce decreased T-cell viability at high concentrations. This effect does not appear to be due to decreased T-cell production of interleukin-2 or interferon-gamma. At lower concentrations (<25 microg/ml), chloroquine can also decrease the ability of antigen-presenting cells to stimulate an a C57BL/6 anti-BALB/c T-cell response and can inhibit MHC class II expression after activation with lipopolysaccharide. Lysosomotropic amines in combination with cyclosporine appear to be synergistic in the suppression of T-cell proliferation to MiHC and MHC. Use of chloroquine in combination with cyclosporine may result in improved control of GVHD.\n \nAn association between posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) and cyclosporine A (CsA) and OKT3 has often been postulated on the basis of retrospective studies, although a randomized study with PTLD as the endpoint will probably never be performed. Because focus on PTLD coincided with the use of these drugs, a bias could be suspected. In a retrospective, nonrandomized study, we reevaluated all lymphoma-like lesions arising in kidney-transplant patients grafted at our center during 1969 to 1998 and observed up to 2002. Case pathology was reviewed, and an association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection (and latency pattern) was assessed. We did not find any significant difference in the incidence of PTLDs when comparing the prednisolone/azathioprine, and CsA eras (P=0.89), the periods before or after OKT3 (P=0.61), and those before or after antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) (P=0.22). Occurrence time was shorter in the CsA (P=0.059), OKT3 (P=0.007), and ALG (P=0.007) eras. In the OKT3 era, 182 patients received, and 224 did not receive, OKT3; after the same observation time, there had been eight and five PTLDs, respectively (P=0.34). The use of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) was associated with a reduction in the number of PTLDs (P=0.01). EBV was detected in 16 of 21 (76%) cases. We found no evidence to implicate any one drug regime preferentially in the development of PTLDs. The risk of developing PTLD seems to be a result of the whole transplantation process, which includes the antigenicity of the foreign graft, the immunosuppression resulting in inadequate cytotoxic T-cell activity, and the result of EBV infection. An important minority of cases are EBV negative.\n"}]}]}}

Sixteen patients failed at distant sites alone.

However, the impact of the type of induction therapy on postoperative morbidity and mortality remains unknown. We performed a retrospective study including every patient who underwent EPP for MPM in our institution between January 2001 and December 2014.

Age at presentation, physical examination, ultrasonographic and intraoperative findings were recorded. Patients were followed after initial surgical intervention to determine the likelihood of developing a subsequent hydrocele or hernia. Thirty-seven patients were identified as presenting with neonatal torsion. Age of presentation averaged 3.5 days (range 1-14 days). Left-sided pathology was seen more commonly than the right, with a 25:12 distribution. All torsed testicles were nonviable. Twenty-two patients were noted to have a contralateral hydrocele at presentation. All hydroceles were opened through a scrotal approach at the time of contralateral scrotal fixation. No patient underwent an inguinal exploration to examine for a patent process vaginalis. None of the patients who presented with a hydrocele have developed a clinical hydrocele or hernia after an average 7.5 years (range 4.3-11.2) follow-up. We have demonstrated that approaching a contralateral hydrocele in cases of neonatal testicular torsion solely through a scrotal incision is safe and effective. Inguinal exploration was not performed in our study and our long-term results demonstrate that such an approach would have brought no additional benefit. In avoiding an inguinal approach we did not subject our patients to unnecessary risk of testicular or vasal injury. Contralateral hydrocele is commonly seen in cases of neonatal testicular torsion. In our experience this is a condition of minimal clinical significance and does not warrant formal inguinal exploration for treatment. This conservative management strategy minimizes the potential of contralateral spermatic cord injury in the neonate. The aims of the study were met.\n \nThe absence of a testis occurs for various reasons in children, but testicular prosthesis implantation in children is uncommon. The optimal time for prosthesis placement is still unclear, and its complication rate has been poorly studied in children. The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors of complications in cases of testicular prosthesis implantation in children. A monocentric, retrospective review was performed of children implanted with a testicular prosthesis between 2008 and 2014. All implantations were performed through an inguinal incision with a standardized procedure. Children were divided into two groups depending on the interval after orchiectomy Twenty-six patients (A, 15; B, 11) had a total of 38 testicular prostheses placements. Mean follow-up was 36.2 months. First surgery was performed at the mean age of 11.8 years (range 0-17.9) (A, 14.1; B, 8.1; P\u00a0=\u00a00.01) and testicular prosthesis implantation at the mean age of 14.7 years (range 9-18) (A, 14.3; B, 14.6) with a mean delay of 36.1 months (A, 1.3; B, 80.3). Indications were mainly spermatic cord torsion (27%), bilateral anorchia (27%), and testicular atrophy after cryptorchidism surgery (19.2%). Complications (10.5%) included two cases of extrusion, one infection and one migration. Patient 1 had a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia with testicle relapse 2 years after induction therapy. High-dose chemotherapy, total body irradiation and bilateral orchiectomies were performed, and bilateral prostheses were implanted 12 years after the end of chemotherapy. Complications happened 85 days after surgery. Patient 2 was followed-up for a proximal hypospadias. The tunica vaginalis flap, which was used during a redo urethroplasty, lead to testicular atrophy. Thirteen years after the last penile surgery, a testicular prosthesis was placed through an inguinal incision, and extrusion occurred 203 days after surgery. Bacterial cultures of the prostheses were sterile and histological review showed no sign of granuloma or graft rejection. The complication rate was significantly higher if the delay between the two surgeries exceeded 1 year (P\u00a0=\u00a00.01). Indications of orchiectomy, prior scrotal incision, and prosthesis size were not risk factors. Testicular prosthesis implantation was relatively safe in a pediatric cohort. The complication rate was significantly higher if the delay between the orchiectomy and the prosthetic placement exceeded 1 year. These results suggest that reducing the delay between orchiectomy and prosthesis implantation may lead to fewer complications.\n"}]}]}}

Safety ratings were collected from 12 normally sighted, 10 visually impaired, and 10 blind subjects for eight different gap times under three sensory conditions We found that normally sighted and visually impaired pedestrians were accurate and reliable in their street crossing decision-making ability when using either vision plus hearing or vision only (P > 0.05). Under the hearing only condition, all subjects were reliable (P > 0.05) but inaccurate with their street crossing decisions (P < 0.05). Compared to either the normally sighted (P = 0.018) or visually impaired subjects (P = 0.019), blind subjects were the least accurate with their street crossing decisions under the hearing only condition. Our data suggested that visually impaired pedestrians can make accurate and reliable street crossing decisions like those of normally sighted pedestrians. When using auditory information only, all subjects significantly overestimated the vehicular gap time. Our finding that blind pedestrians performed significantly worse than either the normally sighted or visually impaired subjects under the hearing only condition suggested that they may benefit from training to improve their detection ability and/or interpretation of vehicular gap times.\n \nTo assess the impact of clinicians' use of an online information retrieval system on their performance in answering clinical questions. Pre-/post-intervention experimental design. In a computer laboratory, 75 clinicians (26 hospital-based doctors, 18 family practitioners, and 31 clinical nurse consultants) provided 600 answers to eight clinical scenarios before and after the use of an online information retrieval system. We examined the proportion of correct answers pre- and post-intervention, direction of change in answers, and differences between professional groups. System use resulted in a 21% improvement in clinicians' answers, from 29% (95% confidence interval [CI] 25.4-32.6) correct pre- to 50% (95% CI 46.0-54.0) post-system use. In 33% (95% CI 29.1-36.9) answers were changed from incorrect to correct. In 21% (95% CI 17.1-23.9) correct pre-test answers were supported by evidence found using the system, and in 7% (95% CI 4.9-9.1) correct pre-test answers were changed incorrectly. For 40% (35.4-43.6) of scenarios, incorrect pre-test answers were not rectified following system use. Despite significant differences in professional groups' pre-test scores [family practitioners The use of an online information retrieval system was associated with a significant improvement in the quality of answers provided by clinicians to typical clinical problems. In a small proportion of cases, use of the system produced errors. While there was variation in the performance of clinical groups when answering questions unaided, performance did not differ significantly following system use. Online information retrieval systems can be an effective tool in improving the accuracy of clinicians' answers to clinical questions.\n"}]}]}}

Adult patients with chronic anal fissure were randomly assigned to undergo lateral internal sphincterotomy to the level of the dentate line or to the level of the fissure apex. The patients were reexamined on postoperative Days 1, 7, 14, 28, and then at 2 and 12 months. The time required for relief of pain postoperatively was 2.08 +/- 1.44 days in the dentate line group, which was significantly shorter than that for the fissure apex group (4.72 +/- 4.86 days; P = 0.002). Objective healing was achieved in 23.7 percent and 17.6 percent at 14 days, 97.4 percent and 88.2 percent at 28 days, and 100 percent and 97.7 percent at 2 months in the dentate line and fissure apex groups, respectively (P > 0.05 for all comparisons). Only sphincterotomy up to the dentate line caused a significant change in anal incontinence (P = 0.016). Both groups had significantly lower anal resting pressures at 4 months postoperatively, compared with their corresponding preoperative levels (P = 0.005 and P = 0.007). The postoperative resting pressures did not differ significantly between the two groups (P = 0.273). By 12 months postoperatively, no treatment failures or recurrences were noted in the dentate line group (100 percent healing rate). In the fissure apex group, there was one nonhealing case and four recurrences, resulting in a 13.2 percent rate of treatment failure (P = 0.058). Sphincterotomy up to the dentate line provided a faster and definitive healing within the time limits of this study, but it was associated with a significant alteration in anal continence. In turn, sphincterotomy up to the fissure apex was free of significant disturbance of continence, but its healing effect was slower and it was prone to an insignificantly higher rate of treatment failure.\n \nComparison of characteristic features, radiology, management and recurrence pattern of fungal sinusitis between children and adults. A prospective study conducted in the department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh in which all the cases presenting with the features of allergic fungal sinusitis (AFS) between January 2000 and January 2005 were enrolled. These cases were divided into two groups, group 1 comprised of cases with age less than 15 years and group 2 with age more than 15 years. Detailed history, physical examination and nasal endoscopic examination and computed tomography (CT) scan of the paranasal sinuses was done in all the cases. The cases with prior history of sinonasal surgery were excluded from the study. All patients refractory to medical management were subjected to endoscopic sinus surgery. All the cases were followed up for a period ranging from 6 to 39 months to see for the recurrence. The data of both the groups was analysed statistically using chi square test. The study population comprised of 200 cases, with 68 cases in group 1 and 132 cases in group 2. The most common symptom in both the groups was presence of nasal obstruction. The children had higher incidence of having unilateral disease (46 out of 68) compared with adults, where it was 38 out of 132. The bony erosion was seen more often in group 1. Surgery was done endoscopically in all the cases. The intra orbital or intra cranial extension was seen in 58 cases of group 1 and 47 cases of group 2 (p<0.001). Recurrence was seen in 18 (15 with intraorbital and 3 with intracranial extension) cases in group 1 and 13 cases (11 with intraorbital and 2 with intracranial extension) in group 2 (p<0.005). In our study, we found a higher incidence of facial deformities, proptosis, intraorbital/intracranial extension and a higher rate of recurrence in group 1, therefore, suggesting a more aggressive nature of AFS in children than adults mandating an early diagnosis, proper management and regular follow up in these cases.\n"}]}]}}

Students of either gender drawn from these schools fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criteria were interviewed using a pre-coded structured questionnaire. Along with demographic data, questions regarding frequency of Chaalia and Pan Masala use, practices of this habit in friends and family and place of procurement of these substances, were inquired. Knowledge was assessed about harmful effects and its source of information. In addition, practices in relation to that knowledge were assessed. A total of 370 students were interviewed over a period of six weeks, of which 205 (55.4%) were boys. The ages of the students were between 10 and 15 years. Thirty one percent of the fathers and 62% of the mothers were uneducated. The frequency of use of any brand of Chaalia was found to be 94% and that of Pan Masala was 73.8%. Eighty five percent of them were regular users. A large majority (88%) procured the substances themselves from near their homes. Ninety five percent of the children had friends with the same habits. Eighty four percent were using the substances in full knowledge of their families. Chaalia was considered harmful for health by 96% and Pan Masala by 60%. Good taste was cited as a reason for continuing the habit by 88.5% of the children and use by friends by 57%. Knowledge about established harmful effects was variable. Knowledge about harmful effects was high in both \"daily\" and \"less than daily users\". The frequency of habits of Chaalia and Pan Masala chewing, by school children in lower socio-economic areas is extremely high.

A total of 189 patients with chronic hepatitis B and 51 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. The study group contained 120 (63.5%) males and 69 (36.5%) females, and the control group contained 25 males (49.0%) and 26 females (51%). In general, serum BMP-7 values of patients were higher than those of controls (p = 0.001). Serum BMP-7 values of patients with liver fibrosis of stages 1, 2, 3, or 4 were higher than control values (all p values = 0.01), but the serum BMP-7 levels of patients with stage 5 fibrosis were similar to that of controls. Associations between fibrosis stage and the serum levels of BMP-7, ALT, HBVDNA, platelets, and albumin were all statistically significant (p = 0.001). The AUROC for the BMP-7 level in advanced stage fibrosis was found to be 0.23. The data were analyzed using the binary logistic regression analysis (backward stepwise method) and BMP-7, HBVDNA, and platelet levels were found to be risk factors associated with fibrosis (p values 0.031, 0.040, and 0.001, respectively). BMP-7 may play anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrogenic roles in the pathogenesis of chronic hepatitis B infection.\n"}]}]}}

To investigate the effect of a multimodal cervical physical therapy treatment on tinnitus complaints in patients with CST. Randomized controlled trial. Patients with a combination of severe subjective tinnitus (Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) All patients received cervical physical therapy for 6 weeks (12 sessions). Patients were randomized in an immediate-start therapy group (n\u00a0=\u00a019) and a 6-week delayed-start therapy group (n\u00a0=\u00a019). TFI and NBQ-scores were documented at baseline, after the wait-and-see period in the delayed-start group, after treatment and after 6 weeks follow-up. The Global Perceived Effect (GPE) was documented at all measuring moments, except at baseline. In all patients (n\u00a0=\u00a038) TFI and NBQ-scores decreased significantly after treatment (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04 and p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

Cervical physical therapy can have a positive effect on subjective tinnitus complaints in patients with a combination of tinnitus and neck complaints. Larger studies, using more responsive outcome measures, are however necessary to prove this effect. NCT02016313.\n \nTraditionally, tinnitus accompanied by hemifacial spasm has been considered a type of hyperactive neurovascular compression syndrome that is similar to hemifacial spasm alone because of the anatomically close relationship between the facial nerve and cochlear nerve as well as the hyperactive clinical nature. Participants were 29 subjects who presented with hemifacial spasm and neuroradiological evidence of vascular compression of the cranial (facial/cochlear) nerve. We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to estimate the activity of the cochlear nerve in patients with and without tinnitus on the ipsilateral side. We compared the difference in the latency and the ratio of the equivalent current dipole (ECD) strength between the ipsilateral and contralateral sides of the spasm and tinnitus. Cochlear nerve activity in patients with tinnitus was increased with a shorter latency (p\u2009=\u20090.016) and stronger ECD strength (p\u2009=\u20090.028) compared with patients without tinnitus. The MEG results from normal-hearing patients who had tinnitus accompanied by hemifacial spasm suggest that the hyperactivity of the auditory central nervous system may be a crucial pathophysiological factor in the generation of tinnitus in these patients. The neurovascular compression that causes sensory input from the pathologic facial nerve activity may contribute to this hyperactivity of the central auditory nervous system.\n"}]}]}}

There are very few studies which looked at detailed sputum and blood cell counts in a large cohort of asthmatics divided into inflammatory phenotypes. The purpose of this study was to analyze sputum cell counts, blood leukocytes and systemic inflammatory markers in these phenotypes, and investigate how those groups compared with healthy subjects. We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study on 833 asthmatics recruited from the University Asthma Clinic of Liege and compared them with 194 healthy subjects. Asthmatics were classified into inflammatory phenotypes. The total non-squamous cell count per gram of sputum was greater in mixed granulocytic and neutrophilic phenotypes as compared to eosinophilic, paucigranulocytic asthma and healthy subjects (p\u2009<\u20090.005). Sputum eosinophils (in absolute values and percentages) were increased in all asthma phenotypes including paucigranulocytic asthma, compared to healthy subjects (p\u2009<\u20090.005). Eosinophilic asthma showed higher absolute sputum neutrophil and lymphocyte counts than healthy subjects (p\u2009<\u20090.005), while neutrophilic asthmatics had a particularly low number of sputum macrophages and epithelial cells. All asthma phenotypes showed an increased blood leukocyte count compared to healthy subjects (p\u2009<\u20090.005), with paucigranulocytic asthmatics having also increased absolute blood eosinophils compared to healthy subjects (p\u2009<\u20090.005). Neutrophilic asthma had raised CRP and fibrinogen while eosinophilic asthma only showed raised fibrinogen compared to healthy subjects (p\u2009<\u20090.005). This study demonstrates that a significant eosinophilic inflammation is present across all categories of asthma, and that paucigranulocytic asthma may be seen as a low grade inflammatory disease.\n \nThe guidelines for asthma recommend that the use of anti-inflammatory therapy should be adapted to the severity of the disease. However, few data are available to assess the adequacy of the use of drugs and its influence on the control of asthma in 'real life'. The adequacy of the current use of anti-asthmatic medication according to the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines was assessed in a random sample of 400 asthmatics identified in the frame of the Italian Study on Asthma in Young Adults. Asthma severity was assessed using the GINA criteria; accordingly, a patient was classified as receiving inadequate treatment if his/her current use of drugs was lower than that suggested by the guidelines for the corresponding severity level. The absence of asthma attacks in the last 3 months was used as an indicator of the disease control. Fifty-five percent of the patients had persistent asthma. Overall, 48% (95% CI 41.2-54.8) of persistent asthmatics were receiving inadequate treatment, and 66% (95% CI 59.5-72.4) had not used their medication daily over the past 3 months. Persistent asthmatics who were inadequately treated had a significantly greater frequency of asthma attacks (geometric mean ratio 3.7; 95% CI 2.1-6.6) than those using an adequate dose of medication. Mild and moderate persistent asthmatics using an adequate medication regimen reported a low number of asthma attacks (median 0). At the multivariate analysis, a good control of the disease was positively associated with an adequate dose of anti-inflammatory medication (OR = 2.2; 95% CI 1.1-4.5) and was negatively associated with a later onset of asthma (OR = 0.96; 95% CI 0.93-0.99) and severe asthma (OR = 0.37; 95% CI 0.17-0.81). Despite the increase in the use of inhaled corticosteroids, half of the persistent asthmatics from the general population are using a medication regimen below their severity level. When the use of drugs follows the GINA guideline recommendations, a good control of asthma is also achievable in the daily management of the disease, particularly in the case of mild and moderate asthmatics.\n"}]}]}}

Retrospective review of pa - tients with MRIs demonstrating large or massive RC tears (study group-SG) and no tearing (control group-CG) was conducted. Sagittal T1W and coronal PD images of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles from each patient were selected, separated, and placed in random order. Three MSK readers reviewed the images blindly and independently and qualified the FI based on the Goutallier classification. The SG included 15 men and 15 women (mean age There was a statistically significant differ - ence in the characterization of RC FI between the sagittal and coronal planes in the setting of a large or massive tear, likely related to incomplete visualization of the musculature on sagittal imaging secondary to muscle and tendon retrac - tion and more complete visualization on coronal imaging. Awareness of this difference may allow for a more accurate characterization of the degree of fatty infiltration.\n"}]}]}}

Point-prevalence study. Department for Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery at the University Hospital of Uppsala, Uppsala, Sweden. Samples were obtained from 133 individuals, 18 men and 115 women, using imprints of each hand on blood agar and a swab from the nose. S. aureus isolates were identified by standard methods and typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. S. aureus was found on the hands of 16.7% of the men and 9.6% of the women, and in the noses of 33.3% of the men and 17.4% of the women. The risk ratio for S. aureus carriage on the hands with nasal carriage was 7.4 (95% confidence interval, 2.7 to 20.2; P < .001). Among the 14 HCWs carrying S. aureus on their hands, strain likeness to the nasal isolate was documented for 7 (50%). Half of the HCWs acquired S. aureus on the hands from patients or the environment and half did so by apparent self-inoculation from the nose. Regardless of the source of contamination, good compliance with hand hygiene is needed from all HCWs to protect patients from nosocomial infections. The moderate rate of S. aureus carriage on hands in this setting could be the result of the routine use of alcoholic hand antisepsis.\n"}]}]}}

Cox proportional hazards models with age as time-scale were used to calculate multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios for associations between type of basal insulin and risk of overall cancer, breast cancer, and seven other cancer sites. The median follow-up was 2.67 years in patients exposed to insulin glargine. Absolute event rates for all cancer in patients exposed to glargine versus other basal insulin users were 1,622 and 1,643 per 100,000 person-years, respectively. No significant association was observed between glargine exposure and overall cancer incidence after adjustment for sex, with a hazard ratio of 0.97 (95% CI 0.87-1.07), or after additional adjustment for any other hypoglycemic agent use and duration of diabetes. No increased risk of breast cancer was observed for glargine users compared with other basal insulins users, with a fully adjusted hazard ratio of 1.08 (0.72-1.62). In a large cohort of patients newly treated by basal insulin, no increased risk of any cancer was observed in insulin glargine users compared with other basal insulin users.

This study therefore prospectively assesses the impact of position emission tomography scanning on the management of primary rectal cancer. Forty-six patients with advanced primary rectal cancer referred for consideration of adjuvant preoperative therapy underwent position emission tomography scanning. The referring physicians prospectively recorded each patient's stage following conventional imaging and the proposed treatment plan prior to position emission tomography scanning. This was then compared with subsequent stage and actual management implemented, and the appropriateness of position emission tomography-induced changes was noted by subsequent clinical follow-up. The surgical management of 36 of 46 patients (78 percent) was unchanged as a result of position emission tomography, even though position emission tomography upstaged disease in 3 of 36 cases (8 percent) and downstaged disease in 5 of 36 cases (14 percent). In 8 of 46 cases (17 percent), management was altered because of the position emission tomography scan findings, including 6 cases (13 percent) in which surgery was cancelled and 2 other cases (4 percent) in which the radiotherapy field was changed. Where available, follow-up confirmed the appropriateness of position emission tomography-induced management change in each case. Two patients had a change in therapy independent of the position emission tomography scan due to clinical circumstances. Overall tumor stage was changed following position emission tomography in 18 of 46 patients (39 percent). Position emission tomography scanning appears to accurately change the stage or appropriately alter the therapy of almost a third of patients with advanced primary rectal cancer. In view of this, we suggest that position emission tomography scanning be considered part of standard workup for such patients, particularly if neoadjuvant chemoradiation is being considered as part of primary management.\n \nCompared with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) may have additional value in the assessment of primary and recurrent cervical cancer.

Both FDG-PET and MRI/CT scans were performed within 2 weeks. Patients were categorised into the following groups From February 2001 to January 2003, 219 patients (75 with primary and 144 with recurrent cervical cancer) were eligible for analysis. Sixteen had hyperglycaemic DM, 12 had euglycaemic DM and 191 were in the non-DM group. The diagnostic power of PET in the hyperglycaemic DM, euglycaemic DM and non-DM groups did not differ significantly with regard to the identification of either metastatic lesions (AUC, 0.967/0.947/0.925, P>0.05) or primary tumours/local recurrence (AUC, 0.950/0.938/0.979, P>0.05). Considering all DM patients, PET showed a significantly higher detection power than MRI/CT scans in respect of metastatic lesions (AUC=0.956 vs 0.824, P=0.012).

Individual characteristics were obtained by the observer and the education and practice level were described by the subjects. Ventilation was delivered with a manual resuscitator connected to a microspirometer and volumes were measured. Subjects completed three procedures The mean (standard deviation) volumes for the one-handed method were 592.84 ml (SD 117.39), two-handed 644.24 ml (SD 144.7) and two-handed half-compression 458.31 ml (SD 120.91) (p<0.01). Tidal volume delivered by two hands was significantly greater than that delivered by one hand (r = 0.398, p<0.01). The physical aspects including hand size, volume and grip power had no correlation with the volume delivered. There were slight increases in tidal volume with education and practice, but correlation was weak (r = 0.213, r = 0.281, r = 0.131, p<0.01).

The method used for estimating the FiN2O is based on one employed to calculate the FiO2 obtained with a nasal cannula. We assume a tidal volume of 500 ml, a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, an inspiratory time of 1 second, an expiratory time of 2 seconds, and an anatomic reservoir volume of 50 ml. The reservoir consists of the nose, the nasopharynx, and the oropharynx. Its volume is assumed to be one-third of the anatomic dead space. It is also assumed that during the last 0.5 second of expiration, there is negligible flow of expired respiratory gases. A 6 L/min flow from the cannula will completely fill the reservoir. The FiO2 or FiN2O is then calculated by assuming that during the 1 second inspiratory time period, the gases in the anatomic reservoir that are provided by the nasal cannula and a volume of air such that the sum of the components of the tidal volume equals 500 ml are inspired. Research laboratory of a university-affiliated metropolitan medical center. The calculated FiO2 values for 100% oxygen delivered by nasal cannula agree with those determined by others. The FiN2Os estimated were directly proportional to the cannula flow rate and the fraction of N2O delivered. At the maximum total flow rate considered, 6L/min flow, with 70% N2O (remainder O2) delivered to the nasal cannula, an FiN2O of only 0.21 was estimated due to the large volume of air inspired. The FiO2 under these conditions would only be 0.23. Our analysis shows that the maximum FiN2O achievable by using a nasal cannula is limited to 0.21 even with a 6 L/min flow of 70% N2O for the defined respiratory parameters.\n"}]}]}}

Published government tobacco tax documentation and statistics published by the Chinese STMA are used to analyse the interrelations among industry profits, taxes and retail price of cigarettes in China. The 2009 excise tax increase on cigarettes in China has not translated into higher retail prices because the Chinese STMA used its policy authority to ensure that retail cigarette prices did not change. The government tax increase is being collected at both the producer and wholesale levels. As a result, the 2009 excise tax increase in China has resulted in higher tax revenue for the government and lower profits for the tobacco industry, with no increase in the retail price of cigarettes for consumers. Numerous studies have found that taxation is one of the most effective policy instruments for tobacco control. However, these findings come from countries that have market economies where market forces determine prices and influence how cigarette taxes are passed to the consumers in retail prices. China's tobacco industry is not a market economy; therefore, non-market forces and the current Chinese tobacco monopoly system determine cigarette prices. The result is that tax increases do not necessarily get passed on to the retail price.\n \nThe tobacco industry claims that illicit cigarette trade in South Africa is high and rising. This is often used as an argument not to increase the tobacco excise tax or to regulate tobacco products. To determine how the tobacco industry's estimates of the size of the illicit cigarette market have changed over time. Published media articles were obtained from South African Press Cuttings; published articles and press releases were sourced from the internet. The period of interest is 1990-2012. Between 1990 and 2012 we found 90 newspaper articles and press statements that emphasised the tobacco industry's view on illicit trade. Articles that reported on action taken against illicit trade were excluded. Between 2006 and early 2011 the Tobacco Institute of Southern Africa, a body representing the interests of large cigarette companies, reported that South Africa's illicit cigarette market share was 20%. This share increased to 25% in late 2011 and 30% in 2012. In a 2012 presentation by Tobacco Institute of Southern Africa to National Treasury the illicit market share in 2008 was indicated as 7.9%, compared with claims in that year that the illicit market share was 20%. Industry findings that the illicit market decreased in 2007 and 2008 were not reported in the press. The tobacco industry has adjusted previous estimates of the illicit trade share downwards to create the impression that illicit trade is high and rising.

However, bleeding spots of esophageal varices were more frequently seen in the right anterior side (64.0%) than in others. The positive predictor for bleeding from esophageal varices was the presence of red color sign in the right anterior wall of the esophagus, and the administration of proton pomp inhibitor was the negative predictor.

Fasting capillary blood glucose \u2264 5 mmol/l appears an important indicator of preceding silent nocturnal hypoglycaemia.\n \nExtracranial internal carotid artery stenosis is a risk factor for perioperative stroke in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery (CAB). Although selective and non-selective methods of preoperative carotid screening have been advocated, it remains unclear if this screening is clinically relevant. To test whether selective carotid screening is as effective as non-selective screening in detecting significant carotid disease. The case records of patients consecutively undergoing CAB were reviewed. Patients were stratified retrospectively into high- or low-risk groups according to risk factors for significant carotid stenosis and perioperative stroke Overall, 205 consecutive patients underwent preoperative carotid screening. The prevalence of significant carotid stenosis was 5.8%. Univariate analysis confirmed that PVD (P=0.005), carotid bruit (P=0.003) and diabetes mellitus (P=0.05) were significant risk factors for stenosis. Carotid stenosis was a risk factor for stroke (P=0.03). Prevalence of carotid stenosis was higher in the high-risk group (9.1%) than the low-risk group (1.2%) (P<0.05). All concomitant or staged carotid endarterectomies/CAB (5/205) and all patients who had perioperative strokes (5/205) were in the high-risk group (P=0.01). In our cohort, selective screening of patients aged >70 years, with carotid bruit, a history of cerebrovascular disease, diabetes mellitus or PVD would have reduced the screening load by 40%, with trivial impact on surgical management or neurological outcomes.\n"}]}]}}

The aim of our study was to analyse this correlation more precisely to improve preoperative planning of the corrective surgery. From 1998 to 2009, 79 patients were operated on for Hirschsprung's disease. All available preoperative contrast enemas (n = 61) had been single blind reviewed by the same radiologist who defined the radiographic transition zone when present in vertebral level. Four groups were determined (rectal, rectosigmoid, long segment, and absence of transition zone) and by Kappa coefficient of agreement correlated to the length of aganglionosis in the pathological report. Radiological findings were concordant with the specimen in pathology in 8 cases of 19 in rectal form (42 %), in 20 cases of 35 in rectosigmoid form (57 %), in all 6 cases of long-segment form (100 %), in the 2 cases of total colonic form (100 %) with a global agreement of 58.1 %, \u03ba = 0.39 CI [0.24; 0.57]. Correlation between level of radiographic transition zone on contrast enema and length of aganglionosis remains low.

We investigated the incidence of subtrochanteric fracture in a consecutive series of 304 patients and its association with screw entry point in the lateral femoral cortex. A retrospective consecutive case series of patients treated with internal fixation for intracapsular hip fracture by our unit between January 2003 and January 2010 were included. Two authors reviewed radiographs independently to determine distal screw entry point in the lateral femoral cortex. Hickey zone 1 was an entry point above the level of the upper border of the lesser trochanter. Hickey zone 2 was defined as an entry point between the upper and lower borders of the lesser trochanter. Hickey zone 3 was an entry point below the lower border of the lesser trochanter. Clinical notes were reviewed for subsequent subtrochanteric fracture. Association between subtrochanteric fracture and distal screw entry point in the lateral femoral cortex in relation to the upper border of the lesser trochanter was determined. Two hundred and fifty-six post-operative radiographs were available for analysis. Mean patient age was 73 years (30\u201398), 75% were women. There were 24 patients with screw entry point in Hickey zone 1, 225 in Hickey zone 2, and 7 in Hickey zone 3. Two patients sustained subtrochanteric fracture. No subtrochanteric fractures occurred in patients with Hickey zone two-screw entry. Subtrochanteric fracture is rare following cannulated screw fixation of intracapsular neck of femur fracture (0.78%). In this retrospective consecutive case series, no subtrochanteric fractures occurred when the entry point of the lowest screw in the lateral femoral cortex is between the levels of the upper and lower borders of the lesser trochanter.\n"}]}]}}

Although a 5-day course of oral prednisone or prednisolone has become the most commonly used regimen, dexamethasone has also been used for a shorter duration (1-2 days) with potential for improvement in compliance and palatability. We reviewed the literature to determine if there is sufficient evidence that dexamethasone can be used as an effective alternative in the treatment of pediatric asthma exacerbations in the inpatient setting. A Medline search was conducted on the use of dexamethasone in the treatment of asthma exacerbations in children. The studies selected were clinical trials comparing the efficacy of dexamethasone with prednisone. Meta-analysis was performed examining physician revisitation rates and symptomatic return to baseline. Six completed pediatric clinical trials met the inclusion criteria. All of the pediatric trials found that prednisone is not superior to dexamethasone in treating mild to moderate asthma exacerbations. Meta-analysis demonstrated homogeneity between the dexamethasone and prednisone groups when examining symptomatic return to baseline and unplanned physician revisits after the initial emergency department encounter. Some studies found potential additional benefits of dexamethasone, including improved compliance and less vomiting. The current literature suggests that dexamethasone can be used as an effective alternative to prednisone in the treatment of mild to moderate acute asthma exacerbations in children, with the added benefits of improved compliance, palatability, and cost. However, more research is needed to examine the role of dexamethasone in hospitalized children.\n \nConcern over the safety of influenza vaccination in individuals with obstructive airways disease has contributed to suboptimal rates of vaccine uptake in this group. We investigated the safety of influenza vaccine in older people with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in a cohort from the UK General Practice Research Database (GPRD). A population based cohort study of 12,000 individuals with asthma or COPD from 432 general practices was conducted. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) were calculated for asthma or COPD diagnoses, prescriptions for oral corticosteroids, and acute exacerbations on the day of vaccination and on days 1-2 and 3-14 after vaccination compared with other time periods in the influenza season. The IRRs for asthma or COPD diagnoses and oral corticosteroid prescriptions were increased on the day of vaccination (for example, the IRR for oral corticosteroid prescriptions for subjects with asthma during the 1992-3 influenza season was 8.24 (95% confidence interval 5.54 to 12.26)). However, there was no consistent increase in the IRR of any of the outcomes on days 1-2 or 3-14 after vaccination, and most of these IRRs were close to 1. Rates of exacerbation were low and showed no consistent statistically significant increase during any risk periods. Older people with asthma or COPD commonly have diagnoses recorded or prescriptions for oral corticosteroids given on the day of influenza vaccination, but there is no increased risk of adverse acute outcomes in the first 2 weeks after vaccination. Our findings strongly suggest that influenza vaccination is safe in this population.\n"}]}]}}

The objective of this study was to describe the attendance rate and outcome of the Norwegian Breast Cancer Screening Program (NBCSP) in the Sami-speaking municipalities and a control group. A retrospective registry-based study. The 8 municipalities included in the administration area of the Sami language law (Sami) were matched with a control group of 11 municipalities (non-Sami). Population data were accessed from Statistics Norway. Data regarding invitations and outcome in the NBCSP during the period 2001-2010 was derived from the Cancer Registry of Norway (CRN). The NBCSP targets women aged 50-69 years. Rates and percentages were compared using chi-square test with a p-value<0.05 as statistical significant. The attendance rate in the NBCSP was 78% in the Sami and 75% in the non-Sami population (p< 0.01). The recall rates were 2.4 and 3.3% in the Sami and non-Sami population, respectively (p<0.01). The rate of invasive screen detected cancer was not significantly lower in the Sami group (p=0.14). The percentage of all breast cancers detected in the NBCSP among the Sami (67%) was lower compared with the non-Sami population (86%, p=0.06). Despite a lower risk of breast cancer, the Sami attended the NBCSP more frequently than the control group. The recall and cancer detection rate was lower among the Sami compared with the non-Sami group.\n \nThe aim was to determine what effect the offer of a cervical smear test when attending for breast screening has on the uptake of cervical and breast screening. The study involved randomisation to compare uptake in those women invited for cervical screening in advance with their breast screening invitation (group 1) with those invited for breast screening only and then offered a smear test upon arrival for breast screening (group 2). The main outcome measure was improvement in the uptake of cervical screening among older women without detriment to the breast screening service. The study took place at the Northern Hospital in North Manchester. Participants were 2131 women aged 50-64 years invited for breast screening at the Northern Hospital in the summer of 1990. Overall, 54% of the women who were eligible attended for breast screening, 52% attended from group 1 and 55% from group 2. Of those attending for breast screening, 957 were eligible for cervical screening and 193 (20%) had a smear test. There was a difference in the proportion tested from each group (p < 0.001), 28% had a smear test from group 1 and 13% from group 2. Forty five percent of the 193 had not had a cervical smear for at least five years. The cervical screening facility did attract some women who were overdue for a smear test and who might not normally have attended for cervical screening, and there was no evidence to suggest that it had a detrimental effect on the breast screening uptake. An advanced cervical screening invitation seemed preferable to an invitation upon arrival at the breast screening unit.\n"}]}]}}

This can be done either (i) acutely during the clamp study using high-dose insulin infusion, or (ii) slowly overnight preceding the clamp study using a low-dose insulin infusion. We assessed whether the choice of either of these methods to obtain euglycaemia biases subsequent assessment of glucose metabolism and insulin action. We studied seven obese Type 2 diabetic patients twice Basal plasma glucose levels (mean +/- sd) were 5.5 +/- 0.5 and 10.7 +/- 2.9 mmol/l in the + ON and - ON studies, respectively, and were clamped at -5.5 mmol/l. Basal rates of glucose production (GP) were similar in the + ON and - ON studies, 83 +/- 13 vs. 85 +/- 14 mg m-2 min-1 (NS), whereas basal rates of glucose disappearance (Rd) were lower in the + ON than in the - ON study, 84 +/- 8 vs. 91 +/- 11 mg m-2 min-1 (P = 0.02). During insulin infusion in the clamp period, rates of GP, 23 +/- 11 vs. 25 +/- 10 mg m-2 min-1, as well as rates of Rd, 133 +/- 32 vs. 139 +/- 37 mg m-2 min-1, were similar in the + ON and - ON studies, respectively (NS). Apart from basal rates of Rd, assessment of glucose turnover rates in euglycaemic clamp studies of Type 2 diabetic patients is not dependent on the method by which plasma glucose levels are lowered.\n"}]}]}}

Participants were patients who were likely to discuss a medication issue. The outcome measures were judgements of appropriateness made by the researchers and by two instruments From 35 cases there was agreement between the judges and the instruments in 22 cases, 16 were appropriate and 6 inappropriate. Of 10 cases classified as inappropriate by the instruments the judges thought four were appropriate. Of 18 cases classified as appropriate by the instruments, two were considered inappropriate by the judges. In seven cases the prescribing decisions could not be classified by the instruments because the decision was to not prescribe. Current measures of appropriateness of prescribing depend predominantly on pharmacological criteria, and so do not represent cases that would be judged appropriate when including the patient's views and contextual factors. If most prescribing is appropriate then use of these measures may lead to more false negatives than real negatives. The instruments should be renamed as measures of 'pharmacological appropriateness' and are useful where the incidence of this type of inappropriate prescribing is relatively high.\n \nLittle is known about the validity and reliability of expert assessments of the quality of antimicrobial prescribing, despite their importance in antimicrobial stewardship. We investigated how infectious disease doctors' assessments compared with a reference standard (modal expert opinion) and with the assessments of their colleagues. Twenty-four doctors specialized in infectious diseases or clinical microbiology (16 specialists and 8 residents) from five hospitals were asked to assess the appropriateness of antimicrobial agents prescribed for a broad spectrum of indications in 56 paper cases. They were instructed how to handle guideline applicability and deviations. We created a reference standard of antimicrobial appropriateness using the modal assessment of 16 specialists. We calculated criterion validity and interrater and intrarater overall and specific agreement with an index expert (senior infectious disease physician) and analysed the influence of doctor characteristics on validity. Specialists agreed with the reference standard in 80% of cases (range 75%-86%), with a sensitivity and specificity of 75% and 84%, respectively. This did not differ by clinical specialty, hospital or years of experience, and residents had similar results. Specialists agreed with the index expert in 76% of cases and the index expert agreed with his previous assessments in 71% of cases. Doctors specialized in infectious diseases and clinical microbiology assess the appropriateness of antimicrobials prescribed for a broad spectrum of indications with acceptable agreement and validity, regardless of their experience or hospital of employment.

Refractive errors were defined as followed The mean spherical equivalent refractive error was at least +1.22 D for all ages and both genders. The prevalence of myopia for any definition at any age was at most 2.5%, and lower in most cases. In contrast, the prevalence of hyperopia was generally over 20%, and declined slightly with age. The prevalence of astigmatism was between 6% and 11%. There was very little change in refractive error with age over this age range. Previous reports of less hyperopic mean spherical equivalent refractive error, and more myopia and less hyperopia in children of this age may be due to problems with achieving adequate cycloplegia in children with dark irises. Using up to 4 drops of 1% cyclopentolate may be necessary to accurately measure refractive error in paediatric studies of such children.

Consecutive patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia were randomized to treatment with or without insertion of an indwelling urinary catheter. All patients received spinal anesthesia with 15 to 30 mg of 0.5% bupivacaine. The catheter group was subjected to a standard postoperative protocol, with removal of the indwelling catheter within forty-eight hours postoperatively. The experimental group was monitored for urinary retention and, if necessary, had straight catheterization up to two times prior to the placement of an indwelling catheter. Two hundred patients were included in the study. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the prevalence of urinary retention, the prevalence of urinary tract infection, or the length of stay. Nine patients in the no-catheter group and three patients in the catheter group (following removal of the catheter) required straight catheterization because of urinary retention.

A total of 680 eligible cases were classified into three groups (surveillance, opportunistic, and symptomatic groups) according to their initial exposure. We used survival time, tumor morphology, and T staging as prognostic outcomes. The outcomes of screened/unscreened and sur veillance/nonsur veillance were compared with the use of the logistic regression model. The adjusted odds ratios for the screened group versus the unscreened group, with 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival time being used as outcomes, were 0.33 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21-0.52), 0.33 (95% CI, 0.21-0.53), and 0.37 (95% CI, 0.23-0.61), respectively. The adjusted odds ratios for surveillance versus nonsurveillance were 0.58 (95% CI, 0.35-0.97), 0.45 (95% CI, 0.27-0.74), and 0.44 (95% CI, 0.26-0.73). The odds ratios were even smaller when tumor morphology or T stage was taken as the main outcome. All these results were statistically significant. There were significant gradient relationships between prognostic outcomes and extent of screening history. The significant impact of ultrasonographic screening on mortality reduction was demonstrated. These findings strongly suggest that early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma by ultrasound may improve the prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.\n \nThe risk of cholangiocarcinoma in primary sclerosing cholangitis is widely recognized to be 8-30%, whereas the risk of acquiring hepatocellular carcinoma in primary sclerosing cholangitis is unknown. As in other chronic liver diseases, the presence of hepatocellular carcinoma in a patient with primary sclerosing cholangitis undergoing evaluation for orthotopic liver transplantation would clearly impact on the candidacy, diagnostic evaluation, and alternative treatment options. Thus, the aim of our study was to determine the prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients undergoing liver transplantation for primary sclerosing cholangitis. The records of the 520 patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation at our institution between 1985 and May 1995 were reviewed. Of the 134 patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis, three (2%) had hepatocellular carcinoma. In the 386 patients without primary sclerosing cholangitis undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation, 22 (6%) had hepatocellular carcinoma. Neither the duration of primary sclerosing cholangitis (range 7-23 years) nor the presence of ulcerative colitis (two of three patients) distinguished those patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis plus hepatocellular carcinoma from those with primary sclerosing cholangitis alone. None of the three patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis plus hepatocellular carcinoma had evidence for hepatitis B or C, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, or hemochromatosis. None of the tumors was of the fibrolamellar variety of hepatocellular carcinoma. The prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation is 2%. These data suggest that patients with advanced cirrhotic-stage primary sclerosing cholangitis are at increased risk for developing hepatocellular carcinoma and should be screened for hepatocellular carcinoma as well as for cholangiocarcinoma prior to orthotopic liver transplantation.\n"}]}]}}

We compared government records and self-reports of motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions in a sample of stroke survivors. The 56 participants were originally recruited for a prospective study on driving and community re-integration post-stroke; the study population consisted of moderately impaired stroke survivors without severe communication disorders who had been referred for a driving assessment. The driving records of the 56 participants for the 5 years before study entry and the 1-year study period were acquired with written consent from the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO), Canada. Self-reports of collisions and convictions were acquired via a semistructured interview and then compared with the MTO records. Forty-three participants completed the study. For 7 (13.5%) the MTO records did not match the self-reports regarding collision involvement, and for 9 (17.3%) the MTO records did not match self-reports regarding driving convictions. The kappa coefficient for the correlation between MTO records and self-reports was 0.52 for collisions and 0.47 for convictions (both in the moderate range of agreement). When both sources of data were consulted, up to 56 percent more accidents and up to 46 percent more convictions were identified in the study population in the 5 years before study entry compared to when either source was used alone. In our population of stroke survivors, self-reports of motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions differed from government records. In future studies, the use of both government and self-reported data would ensure a more accurate picture of driving safety post-stroke.\n \nESC (Electronic Stability Control) is a crash avoidance technology that reduces the likelihood of collisions involving loss of control. Although past and emerging research indicates that ESC is effective in reducing collision rates and saving lives, and its inclusion in all vehicle platforms is encouraged, drivers may demonstrate behavioral adaptation or an overreliance on ESC that could offset or reduce its overall effectiveness. The main objective of the present study was to determine whether behavioral adaptation to ESC is likely to occur upon the widespread introduction of ESC into the Canadian vehicle fleet. Secondary objectives were to confirm the results of a previous ESC public survey and to generate a baseline measure for the future assessment of planned and ongoing ESC promotional activities in Canada. Two separate telephone surveys evaluated drivers' perceptions and awareness of ESC. The first surveyed 500 randomly selected owners/drivers of passenger vehicles. The second surveyed 1017 owners/drivers of 2006-2008 ESC-equipped passenger vehicles from the provinces of Quebec and British Columbia, Canada. Though ESC drivers were much more likely than drivers of other vehicles to be aware of ESC (77% vs. 39%) and that their own vehicle was equipped with it (63% vs. 8%), 23 percent had never heard of it. Ninety percent of drivers who knew that their vehicle was equipped with ESC believed that ESC had made it safer to drive and reported being confident that ESC would work in an emergency. Twenty-three percent of ESC owners who knew their vehicle had ESC reported noticing long-lasting changes in their driving behavior since they began driving the vehicle. Collectively, results suggest that behavioral adaptation to ESC is likely in certain drivers; however, its proven effectiveness in reducing the likelihood of being involved in a serious crash probably outweighs any potential increases in unsafe driving. To fully benefit from ESC, vehicle manufacturers are encouraged to market ESC-equipped vehicles in a realistic, safe manner. Driver training and safety organizations are also encouraged to provide balanced educational information about ESC to their members.\n"}]}]}}

This study aimed to assess whether a similar outcome can be achieved by delivering retraining to patients in small groups, allowing considerable savings in the use of resources. Data were collected prospectively in a pelvic floor database. Patients received pelvic floor retraining either individually or in a small group setting and completed baseline and follow-up questionnaires. Two hundred and fifteen patients were treated, 119 individually and 96 in a small group setting. Scores before and after treatment for the two settings were compared for the Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index, the Fecal Incontinence Severity Index and the Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptoms. Additionally patients receiving group treatment completed a short questionnaire on their experience. The median change in Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index score was 5 (range -62 to 73) for individual treatment and 4 (range -41 to 47) for group treatment, both showing statistically significant improvement. However, there was no significant difference between the settings. Similar results were obtained with the Fecal Incontinence Severity Index and Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptoms scores for the faecal incontinence and obstructed defaecation subgroups respectively. The majority of patients experienced symptomatic improvement following pelvic floor retraining and there was no significant difference in the resulting improvement according to treatment setting.

We present a series of five cases of microsporidial keratitis from a single centre in southern India with microbiologic and histopathologic features. Patient charts of five cases of microsporidial stromal keratitis diagnosed between January 2002 and June 2004 were reviewed retrospectively for clinical data, microbiologic and histopathologic data. The presence of microsporidia was confirmed by special stains on corneal scrapings and/or corneal tissues, and electron microscopy. All patients were immunocompetent with a preceding history of trauma in three. Four patients presented with unilateral, small, persisting deep stromal infiltrates, of uncertain etiology, in the cornea, which were not responding to conventional antimicrobial treatment and required penetrating keratoplasty in three. Fifth case was unsuspected and underwent keratoplasty for post-traumatic scar. Three of five cases were diagnosed on corneal scrapings, prior to keratoplasty, while two were diagnosed only on histology. The microsporidia appeared as oval well defined bodies with dense staining at one pole. None of the patients showed recurrence following keratoplasty. Microsporidia, though rare, should be suspected in chronic culture-negative stromal keratitis. Organisms could lie dormant without associated inflammation.\n"}]}]}}

Nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR), which play a central role in lipid and glucose metabolism, had been hypothesized as being involved in colon cancerogenesis. In animal studies the lipid-lowering PPAR ligand bezafibrate suppressed colonic tumors. However, the effect of bezafibrate on colon cancer development in humans is unknown. Therefore, we proposed to investigate a possible preventive effect of bezafibrate on the development of colon cancer in patients with coronary artery disease during a 6-year follow-up. Our population included 3011 patients without any cancer diagnosis who were enrolled in the randomized, double blind Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention (BIP) Study. The patients received either 400 mg of bezafibrate retard (1506 patients) or placebo (1505 patients) once a day. Cancer incidence data were obtained by matching a subject's identification numbers with the National Cancer Registry. Each matched record was checked for correct identification.

The polymorphic N-acetyltransferase 2 enzyme (NAT2, E.C. 2.3.1.5) plays a key role in the transformation of HAAs to ultimate carcinogens. NAT2 enzyme activity is expressed in a genotype-dependent manner in colon epithelium. Therefore local activation of HAAs in colon, and hence increased risk to develop colon cancer, is likely to be related to high NAT2 enzyme activity. This study is aimed at analysing the association between genotypes leading to high NAT2 activity and colorectal cancer risk. Genomic DNA from 120 colorectal cancer patients and 258 healthy individuals were analysed for enzyme-inactivating mutations at the coding region of the NAT2 gene by means of a mutation-specific polymerase chain reaction. Among patients with sigmoid colon cancer, a significant excess of individuals with genotypes leading to high NAT2 activity was observed as compared both to controls and to the rest of patients with colorectal cancer (P < 0.05). Our findings, which require independent confirmation, suggest that the NAT2 genotype constitutes a secondary risk factor to develop sigmoid colon cancer.\n"}]}]}}

Although there is evidence for the influential role of transformational leadership on health outcomes, researchers have used either attitude outcomes (e.g. job satisfaction) or softer health measures, such as general well-being. Specific measures of well-being such as sleep quality have not been used, despite its association with working conditions. A longitudinal design was used to collect data from Danish healthcare workers at time 1 in 2005 (n = 447) and 18 months later at time 2 in 2007 (n = 274). Structural equation modelling was used to investigate the relationships between transformational leadership, self-efficacy and sleep quality at both time points independently (cross-sectionally) and longitudinally. For all constructs, time 2 measures were influenced by the baseline level. Direct relationships between transformational leadership and sleep quality were found. This relationship was negative cross-sectionally at both time points, but positive between baseline and follow-up. The relationship between leadership and employees' sleep quality was not mediated by employees' self-efficacy. Our results indicate that training managers in transformational leadership behaviours may have a positive impact on healthcare workers' health over time. However, more research is needed to examine the mechanisms by which transformational leadership brings about improved sleep quality; self-efficacy was not found to be the explanation.\n \nTo compare the effects of 800 mg of valerian with a placebo on sleep quality and symptom severity in people with restless legs syndrome (RLS). A prospective, triple-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel design was used to compare the efficacy of valerian with placebo on sleep quality and symptom severity in patients with RLS. Thirty-seven participants were randomly assigned to receive 800 mg of valerian or placebo for 8 weeks. The primary outcome of sleep was sleep quality with secondary outcomes including sleepiness and RLS symptom severity. Data were collected at baseline and 8 weeks comparing use of valerian and placebo on sleep disturbances (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Epworth Sleepiness Scale) and severity of RLS symptoms (International RLS Symptom Severity Scale) from 37 participants aged 36 to 65 years. Both groups reported improvement in RLS symptom severity and sleep. In a nested analysis comparing sleepy vs nonsleepy participants who received 800 mg ofvalerian (n=17), significant differences before and after treatment were found in sleepiness (P=.01) and RLS symptoms (P=.02). A strong positive association between changes in sleepiness and RLS symptom severity was found (P=.006). The results of this study suggest that the use of 800 mg of valerian for 8 weeks improves symptoms of RLS and decreases daytime sleepiness in patients that report an Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score of 10 or greater. Valerian may be an alternative treatment for the symptom management ofRLS with positive health outcomes and improved quality of life.\n"}]}]}}

Cystic neoplasms of the pancreas present a significant diagnostic dilemma in differentiating benign from premalignant or malignant variants. Since the first description of lymphoepithelial cysts in 1985, 109 cases have been reported in the literature. We describe 6 cases of this rare tumor, the preoperative imaging results, and a review the literature. Five males and one female ranging in age from 47 to 76 years underwent resection for lymphoepithelial cysts. Five patients presented with abdominal pain related to the lesion and in one patient the lesion was discovered incidentally. Four patients had elevated serum CA 19-9 levels. Pre-operative imaging with a CT scan and MRI of the abdomen typically revealed a well defined hypodense mass with Hounsfield units (HU) in the range of 15 to 20. One patient had papillary projections into the lesion. The mean size was 3.3 cm (ranging from 1.8 cm to 4 cm). All lesions were exophytic off the pancreatic parenchyma (1 cyst was located in the head of the pancreas, 2 were in the body, and 3 were in the tail region). Pre-operative EUS-guided/CT-guided needle aspiration, when performed, was not diagnostic. All patients underwent resection (one pancreaticoduodenectomy, five left pancreatectomies) to remove these cystic neoplasms. Pathology revealed a cyst lined by non-dysplastic squamous cells surrounded by sheets of benign lymphocytes. No evidence of malignancy was found. Lymphoepithelial cysts of the pancreas are rare and are characteristically seen in men. While a hypodense mass (less than 20 HU) with papillary projections should be considered suspicious for lymphoepithelial cyst, a definitive diagnosis cannot be made solely based on preoperative imaging. EUS-guided biopsy coupled with biochemical/tumor marker studies are increasingly being used as a diagnostic tool to help differentiate between the various types of cystic pancreatic neoplasms. Imaging findings of lymphoepithelial cysts are non-specific and hence surgical resection is often required to rule out the presence of a malignant or pre-malignant cystic pancreatic lesion. In true lymphoepithelial cysts, malignant transformation is not seen and patients who have these cysts are not at increased risk of developing a pancreatic malignancy.\n"}]}]}}

The Ca/PTH kinetics were compared between three groups (group I Group I had significantly lower preoperative Ca (p = 0.016) and Ca-D0 (p = 0.036) but higher PTH-D1 (p = 0.015) than groups II and III. PTH-D0, Ca-D1, and the rate of clinically significant hypocalcemia were similar in the three groups. Group I had a significantly smaller Ca drop (-0.02 vs. 0.01 and 0.02 mmol/L, p = 0.011) and a tendency for a significantly smaller PTH drop (0.4 vs. 0.5 and 1.0 pmol/L, p = 0.073) than groups II and III. PTH-D1 (OR = 1.550) and 25-OHD (OR = 0.958) were independent factors for Ca drop from day 0 to day 1. Although group I began with lower serum Ca, those patients tended to have a greater PTH response to Ca drop and so preoperative 25-OHD did not significantly affect the overall Ca kinetics from preoperative to day 1.\n \nThe effect of preoperative education on anxiety and postoperative outcomes of cardiac surgery patients remains unclear. The aim of the study was to estimate the effectiveness of a nurse-led preoperative education on anxiety and postoperative outcomes. A randomised controlled study was designed. All the patients who were admitted for elective cardiac surgery in a general hospital in Athens with knowledge of the Greek language were eligible to take part in the study. Patients in the intervention group received preoperative education by specially trained nurses. The control group received the standard information by the ward personnel. Measurements of anxiety were conducted on admission-A, before surgery-B and before discharge-C by the state-trait anxiety inventory. The sample consisted of 395 patients (intervention group Preoperative education delivered by nurses reduced anxiety and postoperative complications of patients undergoing cardiac surgery, but it was not effective in reducing readmissions or length of stay.\n"}]}]}}

The aim of this survey was to evaluate the implementation rate of the new ESC/ESH recommendations by primary care physicians and to assess the effectiveness of antihypertensive therapy. Data concerning pharmacotherapy, blood pressure (BP) measurements, and compliance with the guidelines were collected in 10,880 hypertensive patients during 3 subsequent follow-up visits. Combined antihypertensive treatment (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors with \u03b2-blocker, diuretic, or calcium-channel blocker) was used in 69.2% of the patients at baseline. A combination of \u03b2-blocker with diuretic was prescribed in 7.4% of the patients. In 71% of these patients no history of cardiovascular events was reported (myocardial infarction, revascularization, or heart failure). Diuretics were not used in 20.7% of the patients receiving a 3-drug regimen and in 6.7% of those receiving a 4-drug regimen. BP target levels set by individual physicians were frequently lower than those recommended by the guidelines. The percentage of patients who reached the recommended BP target increased during the survey to 25.3%. A combination of \u03b2-blocker and diuretic is still commonly used in the treatment of hypertension in patients without coronary artery disease and heart failure. Despite the use of combination treatment in about 90% of hypertensive patients and attempts at reaching lower target BP values than those recommended by the guidelines, treatment targets were achieved only in one-fourth of the patients.\n \nInstitutional and physician-related factors can influence the way in which physicians interpret research results. The aim of this study was to determine what physicians know about, and their opinions of, hormone treatment in breast cancer patients, and the factors comprising their medical decision-making. A questionnaire was mailed to a random sample of physicians inquiring as to their preferences with respect to adjuvant tamoxifen, and the usual duration of the treatment applied in various clinical scenarios (according to a woman's menopausal status, the oestrogen receptor status and the stage of disease). Of 500 physicians identified, 38% returned the questionnaire. Of the non-responders, a random sample of 60 physicians was interviewed by phone. The total number of available questionnaires was 250 (50%). About 3/4 of the doctors would prescribe tamoxifen in older ER+ women and 30%-40% in post-menopausal ER-patients, but only 2/5 would do so in younger ER+ women. The vast majority of physicians considered five years as standard for ER+ patients. Nevertheless, about 1/4 of the doctors chose a shorter treatment duration for node-negative, pre-menopausal patients. A minority of physicians used tamoxifen for longer than five years. Older clinicians were less likely to prescribe tamoxifen, particularly for low-risk patients. According to the data of the recent EBCTG overview, an additional 20,000 lives could be saved worldwide each year if tamoxifen were given to all early breast cancer patients with hormone-sensitive disease, irrespective of age and disease stage, and for a minimum of five years. Our study, involving a representative sample of physicians practicing in Italy, shows that tamoxifen is not used optimally, with a substantial under-use in younger women and women with node-negative disease.\n"}]}]}}

Appropriate care requires accurate physician estimates of severity. It is unknown if accuracy of physician estimates differs between black and white patients, and how this relates to asthma care disparities. We hypothesized that We conducted a cross-sectional survey among adult patients with asthma cared for in 15 managed care organizations in the United States. We collected physicians' estimates of their patients' asthma severity. Physicians' estimates of patients' asthma as being less severe than patient-reported symptoms were classified as underestimates of severity. Frequency of underestimation, asthma care, and communication. Three thousand four hundred and ninety-four patients participated (13% were black). Blacks were significantly more likely than white patients to have their asthma severity underestimated (OR = 1.39, 95% CI 1.08-1.79). Among black patients, underestimation was associated with less use of daily inhaled corticosteroids (13% vs 20%, p < .05), less physician instruction on management of asthma flare-ups (33% vs 41%, p < .0001), and lower ratings of asthma care (p = .01) and physician communication (p = .04). Biased estimates of asthma severity may contribute to racially disparate asthma care. Interventions to improve physicians' assessments of asthma severity and patient-physician communication may minimize racial disparities in asthma care.\n \nThe guidelines for asthma recommend that the use of anti-inflammatory therapy should be adapted to the severity of the disease. However, few data are available to assess the adequacy of the use of drugs and its influence on the control of asthma in 'real life'. The adequacy of the current use of anti-asthmatic medication according to the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines was assessed in a random sample of 400 asthmatics identified in the frame of the Italian Study on Asthma in Young Adults. Asthma severity was assessed using the GINA criteria; accordingly, a patient was classified as receiving inadequate treatment if his/her current use of drugs was lower than that suggested by the guidelines for the corresponding severity level. The absence of asthma attacks in the last 3 months was used as an indicator of the disease control. Fifty-five percent of the patients had persistent asthma. Overall, 48% (95% CI 41.2-54.8) of persistent asthmatics were receiving inadequate treatment, and 66% (95% CI 59.5-72.4) had not used their medication daily over the past 3 months. Persistent asthmatics who were inadequately treated had a significantly greater frequency of asthma attacks (geometric mean ratio 3.7; 95% CI 2.1-6.6) than those using an adequate dose of medication. Mild and moderate persistent asthmatics using an adequate medication regimen reported a low number of asthma attacks (median 0). At the multivariate analysis, a good control of the disease was positively associated with an adequate dose of anti-inflammatory medication (OR = 2.2; 95% CI 1.1-4.5) and was negatively associated with a later onset of asthma (OR = 0.96; 95% CI 0.93-0.99) and severe asthma (OR = 0.37; 95% CI 0.17-0.81). Despite the increase in the use of inhaled corticosteroids, half of the persistent asthmatics from the general population are using a medication regimen below their severity level. When the use of drugs follows the GINA guideline recommendations, a good control of asthma is also achievable in the daily management of the disease, particularly in the case of mild and moderate asthmatics.\n"}]}]}}

Minimally invasive techniques in foregut surgery have been suggested to cause less tissue trauma. We examined the factors associated with new-onset atrial fibrillation after foregut surgery at our institution. We retrospectively examined the records of 154 adult patients who underwent major foregut surgery which included esophagectomy, partial or total gastrectomy, redo Heller myotomy, redo or transthoracic fundoplications. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis with standard modeling techniques were performed to determine risk factors for new-onset atrial fibrillation. Of the 154 patients, 14 patients developed new-onset atrial fibrillation with a higher mean age of 67.1 years (+/-8.8 years) versus 56.4 years (+/-14.1 years) (p = 0.006). Laparoscopic (p = 0.004) and nonthoracic surgeries (p = 0.01) were associated with lower risk of atrial fibrillation. Patients with atrial fibrillation had received more fluid (6.5 +/- 2.8 liters versus 5.3 +/- 2.0 liters) and had longer operations (370 +/- 103 min versus 362 +/- 142 min), none of which were statistically significant. The average intensive care length of stay of patients was longer Laparoscopic surgery is associated with lower risk of atrial fibrillation in foregut surgery. Development of atrial fibrillation is associated with increased length of intensive care stay. We recommend a prospective trial to confirm our findings.\n \nLaparoscopic surgery is associated with well-known benefits, one of which is earlier return of bowel function. Since the laparoscopic approach to colon resections was introduced in the early 1990s, it has become the standard of care. Hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery (HALS) is a surgical approach in which dissection is facilitated by the surgeon's hand within the abdominal cavity during laparoscopy. The purpose of this study was to compare the incidence of postoperative ileus and the need for nasogastric tube (NGT) decompression in patients undergoing elective colon resections. Following institutional review board approval, we performed a retrospective review of a prospectively collected database. Included were patients who underwent elective left-sided large bowel resections between 2009 and 2012. Exclusion criteria were urgent operation, stoma creation, ASA IV classification, NGT left in place at the end of surgery, and postoperative anastomotic leakage. Patients were divided into three groups A total of 243 patients were included in this study; 73 patients underwent open surgery, 89 patients underwent HALS, and 81 patients underwent laparoscopic surgery. The proportion of patients who needed postoperative nasogastric decompression was significantly reduced in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery (3.7%) or HALS (4.5%) compared with those who underwent open resection (17.8%). The time from surgery to first flatus and first bowel movement, the time to tolerate solid diet, and the total length of postoperative hospital stay also were all significantly reduced in the laparoscopic and HALS groups compared with the open surgery group. There were no significant differences in any of these measures between the laparoscopic group and the hand-assisted group. Like laparoscopy, HALS is associated with less postoperative ileus and necessitates less NGT decompression than does open surgery.\n"}]}]}}

The authors analyzed 739 critiques-268 from 88 unfunded and 471 from 153 funded applications for grants awarded to 125 PIs (76 males, 49 females) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison between 2010 and 2014.

However, it is not known whether even occasional victimization has similar negative consequences and whether protective factors such as social support may prevent those harmful developments. The present study therefore focuses on the nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) and suicidal behavior (SB) in victims of bullying and the potentially moderating effect of parental monitoring. In all, a cross-sectional sample of 647 adolescents (mean age 12.8 years) were surveyed concerning bullying experiences, NSSI and SB, and parental monitoring. A total of 14.4% of respondents reported being a victim of frequent bullying in the past few months (with verbal and social bullying playing the most important role), which increased the risks of both NSSI (OR\u2009=\u200911.75) and SB (OR\u2009=\u20096.08). This relationship could also be shown for occasional victims of bullying (35.6%), although to a lesser extent. Parental monitoring had a significant protective effect on SB in victims of occasional bullying. However, parental monitoring did not show any protective effect in victims of repetitive bullying. Victims of bullying show a substantial risk for engaging in self-harm behavior. Therefore, the dissemination of anti-bullying programs in schools would probably also prevent such disorders. Parental participation in school-based prevention may increase its effect; this also matches the results of the present study, showing that parental monitoring may be able to buffer the negative effects of bullying victimization, at least to a certain degree.\n"}]}]}}

This study compared recognition of symbolic representation of emotions or movements in music by two groups of children with different communicative characteristics Participants listened to recorded musical excerpts conveying emotions or movements and matched them with labels. Measures relevant to auditory and/or language function were also gathered. There was no significant difference between the ASD and TD-NH groups in identification of musical emotions or movements.

During retrograde ureteroscopy, complete stone clearance was achieved in 11 patients (55%), while pushback of the whole or fragmented calculus was seen in the rest. These patients with residual calculi were later treated by extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (SWL). The stone-free rate at the end of 3 months was 85%. Three patients developed minor ureteroscopy-related complications. Complete stone clearance was achieved in all patients with antegrade ureteroscopy. No intraoperative or postoperative complications were encountered. In this series, antegrade ureteroscopy was found to be a safe and effective option for impacted upper ureteral calculi and assured better results than retrograde ureteroscopy.\n"}]}]}}

To determine the hemodynamic effect due to lung IR injury, we performed a quantitative coronary blood-flow analysis in a swine model of in situ lung ischemia and reperfusion. In 14 healthy pigs, blood flow was measured in the ascending aorta, left anterior descending (LAD), circumflex (Cx), right coronary artery (RCA), right common carotid artery (RCCA), and left internal mammary artery (LIMA), along with left-and right-ventricular pressures (LVP and RVP), aortic pressure (AoP), and pulmonary artery pressure (PAP). Cardiac Troponin (cTn), interleukin 6 and 10 (IL-6 and IL-10), and tumor necrosis factor A (TNF-A) were measured in coronary sinus blood samples. The experimental (IR) group (n=10) underwent 60 min of lung ischemia followed by 60 min of reperfusion by clamping and releasing the left pulmonary hilum. Simultaneous measurements of all parameters were made at baseline and during IR. The control group (n=4) had similar measurements without lung IR. In the IR group, total coronary flow (TCF=LAD+Cx+RCA blood-flow) decreased precipitously and significantly from baseline (113\u00b141 ml min\"1) during IR (p<0.05), with the lowest value observed at 60 min of reperfusion (-37.1%, p<0.003). Baseline cTn (0.08\u00b10.02 ng ml(-1)) increased during IR and peaked at 45 min of reperfusion (+138%, p<0.001). Baseline IL-6 (9.2\u00b12.17 pg ml(-1)) increased during IR and peaked at 60 min of reperfusion (+228%, p<0.0001). Significant LVP drop at 5 min of ischemia (p<0.05) was followed by a slow return to baseline at 45 min of ischemia. A second LVP drop occurred at reperfusion (p<0.05) and persisted. Conversely, RVP increased throughout ischemia (p<0.05) and returned toward baseline during reperfusion. Coronary blood flow and hemodynamic profile remained unchanged in the control group. IL-10 and TNF-A remained below the measurable range for both the groups. In situ lung IR has a marked negative impact on coronary blood flow, hemodynamics, and inflammatory profile. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study where coronary blood flow is directly measured during lung IR, revealing the associated increased cardiac risk.\n \nBeta-adrenergic blocking agents are the cornerstone in the treatment of coronary artery disease (CAD). The exact pathophysiologic mechanism is not clear but depends largely on the oxygen-sparing effect of the drug. Thus, the effect of metoprolol on coronary flow reserve and coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR) was determined in patients with CAD. Coronary blood flow velocity was measured with the Doppler flow wire in 23 patients (age Rate-pressure product decreased after metoprolol from 9.1 to 8.0 x 10(3) mm Hg/min (p < 0.001). Pharmacologic CFVR was 2.1 at rest and increased after metoprolol to 2.7 (p = 0.002). Likewise, postischemic CFVR increased from 2.6 to 3.3 (p < 0.001). Postischemic CFVR was significantly higher than pharmacologic CFVR before as well as after metoprolol. Coronary vascular resistance decreased after metoprolol from 3.4 +/- 2.0 to 2.3 +/- 0.7 mm Hg x s/cm (p < 0.02). The following conclusions were drawn from this study. Metoprolol is associated with a significant increase in postischemic and pharmacologic CFVR. However, postischemic CFVR is significantly higher than pharmacologic CFVR. The increase in CFVR by metoprolol can be explained by a reduction in vascular resistance. The increase in CFVR (= increased supply) and the reduction in oxygen consumption (= decreased demand) after metoprolol explain the beneficial effect of this beta-blocker in patients with CAD.\n"}]}]}}

We examined the ethical implications of cold calling in a study of subjects with defined neurotic disorders followed up 12 years after initial assessment carried out to determine outcome in terms of symptoms, social functioning, and contact with health services. The patients concerned were asked at original assessment if they would agree to be followed up subsequently and although they agreed no time limit was put on this. To decide if cold calling was ethically justifiable and, if so, to set guidelines for researchers. The study was a cohort study of patients with neurotic disorder treated initially for 10 weeks in a randomised controlled trial. At follow up by a research medical practitioner 18 of the 210 patients had died and of the remaining 192 patients 186 (97%) were seen or had a telephone interview. Four patients refused and two others did not have interviews but agreed to some data being obtained. However, only 104 patients (54%) responded to letters inviting them to make an appointment or to refuse contact and the remainder were followed up by cold calling, with most patients agreeing readily to the research interview. The findings illustrate the dilemma of the need to get the maximum possible data from such studies to achieve scientific validity (and thereby justify the ethics of the study) and the protection of subjects' privacy and autonomy. More attention needs to be paid to consent procedures if cold calling is to be defended on ethical grounds but it is unreasonable to expect this to be obtained at the beginning of a research study in a way that satisfies the requirements for informed consent. A suggested way forward is to obtain written consent for the research at the time that cold calling takes place before beginning the research.\n \nThe aim of the study was to investigate trends in cancer prognosis by examining the relationship between period of diagnosis and probability of death from cancer in a population-based cohort. Within a cohort of Japanese men and women aged 40-69 years and free of prior diagnosis of cancer and cardiovascular disease at baseline, data from 4403 patients diagnosed with cancer between 1990 and 2006 and followed up until 2012 were analyzed using survival regression models to assess the presence of an effect of the period of diagnosis (before 1998 versus after 1998) on the risk of dying from cancer. We noted a significant decrease in risk of dying from cancer among individuals diagnosed after 1998 with lung cancer (hazard ratio [HR]=0.676 [0.571-0.800]) or colorectal cancer (HR=0.801 [0.661-0.970]). A decrease in the estimated five-year probability of death from cancer was also noted between the first (before 1998) and the second (after 1998) period of diagnosis for lung and colorectal cancers (e.g., 85.4% vs. 73.3% for lung cancer and 44.6% vs. 37.7% for colorectal cancer, respectively, for stage III in men aged 60 at diagnosis). This study presented the first scientific evidence of improvement in prognosis for lung and colorectal cancer patients in a population-based cohort in Japan. Our results suggest that recent advances in cancer treatment could have influenced cancer survival differently among lung, colorectal and gastric cancers.\n"}]}]}}

Delayed resorption of foetal lung fluid after birth is considered as the main pathophysiological factor. As resorption of foetal lung fluid is a catecholamine dependent process, we aimed at investigating, whether beta1- and beta2-adrenoreceptor (ADRB1, ADRB2) polymorphisms, known to alter catecholamine activity, are operative in TTN. DNA was collected for genotyping from 73 term newborns suffering from TTN and 55 healthy controls from a Caucasian cohort. TTN infants were more likely to be male (70% vs. 49%; p < 0.05), had a lower mean birthweight (3120 +/- 450 vs. 3396 +/- 504 g; p < 0.001) and gestational age (GA) (38.4 +/- 1.2 vs. 39.4 +/- 1.3 weeks; p < 0.001) and were more often delivered by caesarean section (CS) (71% vs. 26%; p < 0.001).

Multivariate analysis provided beta1Gly49 homozygotes with higher risk for TTN (OR 18.5; 95%CI 1.5-229; p = 0.023) than beta1Ser49 allele carrier. Further analysis showed significant association of T-47C, A46G, C79G and C491T (TACC) haplotype in ADRB2 gene with TTN (p = 0.048).

The coding region and adjacent stretches of the B3AR gene was sequenced in 91 patients. In total, 1015 patients from a single academic hospital were genotyped for the presence of two single nucleotide polymorphisms. Symptom scores and parameters from pressure-flow studies were analyzed relative to genotype in the B3AR gene. No frequent novel polymorphisms were detected in the coding region. Five polymorphisms were found in the non-coding region of the gene but were in complete linkage with the 64Arg allele. Out of 32 parameters including bladder compliance, only prostate size was weakly (44 vs. 39\u2009mL) but significantly associated with the 64Arg allele, but was not mirrored by an association with prostate-specific antigen levels.

By adding brief dynamic psychotherapy focused on the psychosocial vulnerability of patients with panic disorder to an established drug treatment regimen, we hypothesized that this would result in a lower relapse rate after pharmacotherapy. Patients with panic disorder (defined by DSM-III-R) were randomized to treatment with either clomipramine for 9 months (n = 20), or clomipramine for 9 months combined with 15 weekly sessions of brief dynamic psychotherapy (n = 20). Measures of anxiety and depression were collected at intake and at regular intervals. The patients had blind follow-up interviews at 6, 12, and 18 months after beginning treatment. All patients in both groups became free of panic attacks within 26 weeks of the start of treatment. On termination of pharmacotherapy, the relapse rate was significantly higher in the clomipramine-only group during the follow-up period. There were significantly lower scores for most anxiety measures in the clomipramine plus psychotherapy group at the 9-month follow-up. The addition of brief dynamic psychotherapy to treatment with clomipramine significantly reduces the relapse rate of panic disorder compared with clomipramine treatment alone.\n"}]}]}}

The optimal time for prosthesis placement is still unclear, and its complication rate has been poorly studied in children. The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors of complications in cases of testicular prosthesis implantation in children. A monocentric, retrospective review was performed of children implanted with a testicular prosthesis between 2008 and 2014. All implantations were performed through an inguinal incision with a standardized procedure. Children were divided into two groups depending on the interval after orchiectomy Twenty-six patients (A, 15; B, 11) had a total of 38 testicular prostheses placements. Mean follow-up was 36.2 months. First surgery was performed at the mean age of 11.8 years (range 0-17.9) (A, 14.1; B, 8.1; P\u00a0=\u00a00.01) and testicular prosthesis implantation at the mean age of 14.7 years (range 9-18) (A, 14.3; B, 14.6) with a mean delay of 36.1 months (A, 1.3; B, 80.3). Indications were mainly spermatic cord torsion (27%), bilateral anorchia (27%), and testicular atrophy after cryptorchidism surgery (19.2%). Complications (10.5%) included two cases of extrusion, one infection and one migration. Patient 1 had a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia with testicle relapse 2 years after induction therapy. High-dose chemotherapy, total body irradiation and bilateral orchiectomies were performed, and bilateral prostheses were implanted 12 years after the end of chemotherapy. Complications happened 85 days after surgery. Patient 2 was followed-up for a proximal hypospadias. The tunica vaginalis flap, which was used during a redo urethroplasty, lead to testicular atrophy. Thirteen years after the last penile surgery, a testicular prosthesis was placed through an inguinal incision, and extrusion occurred 203 days after surgery. Bacterial cultures of the prostheses were sterile and histological review showed no sign of granuloma or graft rejection. The complication rate was significantly higher if the delay between the two surgeries exceeded 1 year (P\u00a0=\u00a00.01). Indications of orchiectomy, prior scrotal incision, and prosthesis size were not risk factors. Testicular prosthesis implantation was relatively safe in a pediatric cohort. The complication rate was significantly higher if the delay between the orchiectomy and the prosthetic placement exceeded 1 year. These results suggest that reducing the delay between orchiectomy and prosthesis implantation may lead to fewer complications.\n"}]}]}}

Approval of the institutional ethical review committee was not required. This was a retrospective review of 322 computed tomographic angiographic studies that were performed in patients before they underwent elective EVAR for infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. Morphologic parameters evaluated were IMA patency, origin of the IMA in relation to the aneurysm sac, diameter of the IMA, the cross-sectional area of the contrast material-enhanced aortic lumen at the level of the IMA ostium, and the number of additional patent aortic side branches from the aneurysm sac. The association of IMA type II endoleaks with each variable was analyzed by using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models. The diameter of the IMA did not influence the development of IMA type II endoleaks (P = .51). The incidence of these endoleaks was significantly higher in patients with greater cross-sectional area of the aortic lumen at the IMA ostium (P < .001). Patients with an IMA type II endoleak had significantly more patent aortic side branches before EVAR than did patients without an endoleak (3.6 \u00b1 1.7 vs 2.2 \u00b1 1.4; P < .001). According to the final logistic regression model that included cross-sectional area of the aortic lumen at the IMA and the number of aortic side branches as independent predictors, risk for IMA type II endoleaks was determined with a sensitivity of 78% (39 of 50) and a specificity of 79% (92 of 116). Cross-sectional area of the contrast-enhanced aortic lumen at the level of the IMA ostium and the number of additional patent aortic side branches are associated with the development of IMA type II endoleaks.\n \nThe rate of aortic aneurysm rupture correlates with the aneurysm's diameter, and a higher rate of rupture is observed in patients with larger aneurysms. According to the literature, contradictory results concerning the relationship between atmospheric pressure and aneurysm size have been reported. In this paper, we assessed the influence of changes in atmospheric pressure on abdominal aneurysm ruptures in relationship to the aneurysm's size. The records of 223 patients with ruptured abdominal aneurysms were evaluated. All of the patients had been admitted to the department in the period 1997-2007 from the Silesia region. The atmospheric pressures on the day of the rupture and on the days both before the rupture and between the rupture events were compared. The size of the aneurysm was also considered in the analysis. There were no statistically significant differences in pressure between the days of rupture and the remainder of the days within an analysed period. The highest frequency of the admission of patients with a ruptured aortic aneurysm was observed during periods of winter and spring, when the highest mean values of atmospheric pressure were observed; however, this observation was not statistically confirmed. A statistically non-significant trend towards the higher rupture of large aneurysms (> 7 cm) was observed in the cases where the pressure increased between the day before the rupture and the day of the rupture. This trend was particularly pronounced in patients suffering from hypertension (p = 0.1). The results of this study do not support the hypothesis that there is a direct link between atmospheric pressure values and abdominal aortic aneurysm ruptures.\n"}]}]}}

Clustering of errors within family unit was used to account for within-family correlation in unobserved characteristics that affect patient loyalty. The payer provided data from health plan administrative files, matched to U.S. Census-based characteristics of the patient's neighborhood. Patients were retrospectively attributed to health care systems based on patterns of primary care. I find significant patient loyalty, with past loyalty a very strong predictor of future relationship. Relationships were shorter when the patient's health status was complex and when the patient's care system was smaller. Population health management can be beneficial to the care system making this investment, particularly for patients exhibiting prior continuity in care system choice.

The Global Perceived Effect (GPE) was documented at all measuring moments, except at baseline. In all patients (n\u00a0=\u00a038) TFI and NBQ-scores decreased significantly after treatment (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04 and p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). NBQ-scores remained significantly lower after follow-up (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). Immediately after treatment, 53% (n\u00a0=\u00a038) experienced substantial improvement of tinnitus. This effect was maintained in 24% of patients after follow-up at six weeks. Cervical physical therapy can have a positive effect on subjective tinnitus complaints in patients with a combination of tinnitus and neck complaints. Larger studies, using more responsive outcome measures, are however necessary to prove this effect. NCT02016313.\n"}]}]}}

In order for meaningful results to be extrapolated to specific populations, the limitations of the data and linkage methodology need to be investigated and clarified. It is the objective of this study to investigate the differences in ascertainment which may arise between a hospital admission dataset and a dispensing claims dataset, using major depression in pregnancy as an example. The safe use of antidepressants in pregnancy is an ongoing issue for clinicians with around 10% of pregnant women suffer from depression. As the birth admission will be the first admission to hospital during their pregnancy for most women, their use of antidepressants, or their depressive condition, may not be revealed to the attending hospital clinicians. This may result in adverse outcomes for the mother and infant. Population-based de-identified data were provided from the Western Australian Data Linkage System linking the administrative health records of women with a delivery to related records from the Midwives' Notification System, the Hospital Morbidity Data System and the national Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme dataset. The women with depression during their pregnancy were ascertained in two ways From 2002 to 2005, there were 96698 births in WA. At least one antidepressant was dispensed to 4485 (4.6%) pregnant women. There were 3010 (3.1%) women with a comorbidity related to depression recorded on their delivery admission, or other admission to hospital during pregnancy. There were a total of 7495 pregnancies identified by either set of records. Using data linkage, we determined that these records represented 6596 individual pregnancies. Only 899 pregnancies were found in both groups (13.6% of all cases). 80% of women dispensed an antidepressant did not have depression recorded as a comorbidity on their hospital records. A simple capture-recapture calculation suggests the prevalence of depression in this population of pregnant women to be around 16%. No single data source is likely to provide a complete health profile for an individual. For women with depression in pregnancy and dispensed antidepressants, the hospital admission data do not adequately capture all cases.\n \nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) and sociodemographic parameters on depression during pregnancy. Between September 2010 and September 2011, 200 consecutive women with HG were defined as the study group and 200 consecutive pregnant women without any signs and symptoms of HG, and matched for age, parity, and gestational age were defined as the control group. The Beck depression inventory-II (BDI-II) questionnaire and sociodemographic questionnaire evaluating educational level, occupation, economic status, and obstetric history were given to all participants for self-completion. The forms were collected within 6 h of hospital admission. Groups were compared according to the presence of depression and predictors of depression were analyzed by regression analysis. Median BDI-II scores in study and control groups were 15 and 5, respectively. The difference was statistically significant (p < 0.001). In the HG group, 35.1% of patients had mild depression, 26.0% moderate, and 17.8% had severe depression, while only 5% of patients in the control group had mild depression and 95% had no depression. Multivariate analysis showed that HG, age and family relationship were related to depression during pregnancy. Moreover, depression risk was increased 76-fold in patients with HG (odds ratio = 76.000; 95% confidence interval Depression risk is increased in patients with HG, therefore not only medical therapy of HG, but also psychiatric evaluation should be considered for these patients.\n"}]}]}}

However, 12 patients in group I (12.9%) suffered postoperative ischemic stroke, a rate significantly higher than that of group II (1 patient, 1.7%; p = 0.0173). Any recurrence of PAF or atrial fibrillation with bradycardia was assessed at the time of stroke onset. Logistic regression analysis showed that the absence of warfarin therapy constituted a risk factor for post-CABG stroke associated with PAF (Odds 13.04, p = 0.027). Warfarin therapy administered concomitantly with an antiplatelet agent dramatically reduced the incidence of ischemic stroke associated with postoperative PAF.\n \nThe study was done to determine whether eptifibatide, a platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa antagonist, prevents ischemic complications following percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) in women as well as in men. Eptifibatide reduces ischemic complications after nonurgent coronary stent interventions. We compared outcomes in women (n = 562) and men (n = 1,502) enrolled in the Enhanced Suppression of the Platelet GP IIb/IIIa Receptor with Integrilin Therapy (ESPRIT) trial of double-bolus eptifibatide during PCI.

This is a cost-utility study from a health care system's perspective comparing coformulated fixed dose (FXD) strategy versus multiple free dose combination (FRC) in antiretroviral therapy. The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) was used to identify HIV/AIDS patients with \u22652 active antiretroviral medications. Patients on FXD were matched in 1:1 ratio with the FRC group using propensity scores. All medical costs excluding those paid by patients and families were included. Utility was measured using SF-6D scores from the SF-12 questionnaire. Incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs) were calculated using the mean annual estimates. A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve was determined using a Monte Carlo probabilistic simulation technique. Nine FXD antiretroviral formulations approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by 2005 was included in this study. One hundred seventy HIV/AIDS patients with \u22652 antiretroviral agents were identified from the MEPS database, of which 53% (n=92) were on FXD formulation. On matching, 70 patients from FXD had a match from the FRC group. No differences in sociodemographic and health status variables were observed between the matched groups. The mean annual cost was $15,766.15 for FXD patients and $11,875.21 for FRC patients. The mean utility gained by using FXD over FRC was 0.085; however, this difference was not statistically significant. The ICUR for the FXD treatment over FRC treatment was $45,540.49/quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed FXD to dominate FRC (>50% probability of being cost-effective) above the $40,000 threshold. Although the cost-effectiveness of a single-pill strategy was within the acceptable willingness-to-pay threshold, the QALY difference were minimal. Further research is recommended to explore the long-term impact of the strategy.\n \nPatient reported outcome studies are extremely valuable. We hypothesize that breast reduction surgery has a high satisfaction rate, and that body mass index (BMI), and the amount of breast tissue removed would not alter this outcome. The purpose of this study was to determine if there is an improvement in the quality of life in patients undergoing breast reduction surgery, and whether breast volume or patient size influences this outcome. A retrospective chart review was performed on 600 consecutive patients at a single institution from 2000 to 2010. Patients were mailed The Breast Q questionnaire to complete. Demographic, surgical, and clinical data were collected and entered into a database. Descriptive statistical analyses were conducted using SAS Software version 9.1.3 with statistical significance determined at P<0.05. A total of 178 surveys were returned and included in our study (a response rate of 29.6%). Patient data included a mean BMI of 28.3 (4.6) kg/m, and mean total amount of breast tissue removed of 1220.9 (665.4) g. The primary indications for patients having breast surgery were for symptomatic macromastia (85%), asymmetry (5.6%), and for cosmesis (2.5%). The Breast Q questionnaire demonstrated patients overwhelmingly agreed that they were satisfied with their breast surgery. The mean response was 2.8 with a standard deviation (SD) of 0.47 (where 1, disagree; 2, somewhat agree; and 3, definitely agree). Patient BMI and total amount of breast tissue removed had a statistically significant positive correlation (0.479; P<0.0001). There was no statistically significant difference between the amount of total breast tissue removed and patient response (P=0.57). The study supports a positive outcome after breast reduction surgery. Over 95% of the patients surveyed were satisfied and would do it again. It demonstrates the improvement of the patient's quality of life regardless of the amount of breast tissue removed. Furthermore, it suggests that the size and weight of the patient has no impact on this outcome. As we face new government and insurance restrictions for surgeries that have both cosmetic and reconstructive value, patient reported outcome studies may have an influence on future third-party payer.\n"}]}]}}

Fourteen reviews were identified; 147 of the 156 primary studies included in these reviews were obtained and assessed. We extracted data on whether the dimensions place of residence, race/ethnicity/culture, occupation, gender, religion, education, socioeconomic status, and social capital and networks (PROGRESS) were reported or analyzed, and whether any interventions were aimed at disadvantaged or low- and middle-income country populations. Among the dimensions of PROGRESS reported at baseline in 147 primary studies, gender (89%) was the most commonly reported, followed by education (25%) and race/ethnicity (18%). Less than 50% of the systematic reviews reported dimensions of PROGRESS even when they had been reported in the primary study. Of 147 primary studies, 6 (5%) were aimed specifically at disadvantaged populations; another 6 reported on effectiveness by at least 1 dimension of PROGRESS. Primary studies of interventions for rheumatoid arthritis generally reported few variables necessary to answer questions about health inequalities. Most CMSG systematic reviews failed to assess those variables even when described in the primary studies.

Results were then correlated with socio-economic status measured by the percentage of habitants living below the poverty level. African-American and Hispanic women generally experience higher mortality than White non-Hispanics, and these differences are especially significant in the southeast metropolitan areas and southwest border of Texas. The proportion and location of significant racial disparities however changed depending on the type of statistic (RR versus RD) and the geographic level.

Geographic regions with significant racial disparities for African-Americans and Hispanics frequently had a poverty rate above 10.00%. This study investigates both relative and absolute racial disparities in breast cancer mortality between White non-Hispanic and African-American/Hispanic women at the census tract, zip code and county levels.

The aim of our study was to identify electrophysiological parameters, by means of a transcranial magnetic stimulation approach, which might potentially express the presence of residual networks sustaining fragmentary behavioral patterns, even when no conscious behavior can be observed. We enrolled 25 severe DOC patients, following post-anoxic or traumatic brain injury and 20 healthy individuals (HC) as control group. Baseline electrophysiological evaluation evidenced, in comparison to HC, a partial preservation of cortical effective connectivity and excitability in clinically defined MCS, whereas these components were absent in clinically defined UWS. Then, we applied an anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (a-tDCS) protocol over the orbitofrontal cortex. a-tDCS was able to boost cortical connectivity and excitability in all HC, MCS, and to unmask such excitability/connectivity in some UWS patients. a-tDCS could be useful in identifying residual connectivity markers in clinically-defined UWS, who may lack of purposeful behavior as a result of a motor-output failure.\n \nTo determine the potential prognostic value of using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify patients with disorders of consciousness, who show potential for recovery.

In 14 of the 22 examined patients (VS, n=5; MCS, n=9), a significant activation of the regions of interest (ROIs) of the mental imagery paradigm could be found. All 5 patients with activation of a significant blood oxygen level dependent signal, who were in a VS at the time of the fMRI examination, reached at least an MCS at the end of the observation period. In contrast, 5 participants in a VS who failed to show activation in ROIs, did not (sensitivity 100%, specificity 100%). Six of 9 patients in an MCS with activation in ROIs emerged from an MCS.

The fMRI paradigm mental imagery displays a high concordance with the further clinical course of patients in a VS. All 5 patients in a VS who showed significant activation of ROIs had a favorable further course until the end of the observation period. We therefore propose the term \"functional minimally conscious state\" for these patients. They may benefit from rehabilitation treatment. In cases where no significant activation was seen, the method has no prognostic value. Prediction of the clinical course of patients in an MCS by fMRI was considerably less accurate than in patients in a VS.\n"}]}]}}

We reviewed charts of 856 patients with hormone receptor-positive nonmetastatic breast cancer seen at our institution between January 1999 and October 2007.

Comedication with Ca/Bis reduces the likelihood for osteoporosis and musculoskeletal symptoms. Patients who received tamoxifen before AIs were less likely to develop AI-related musculoskeletal symptoms.

To discuss whether such procedures are feasible and effective to identify asymptomatic recurrences and describe the pattern of relapse detected by procedures. The records of 282 consecutive women with recurrent endometrial cancer treated from 1986 to 2005 were retrospectively collected in 8 Italian institutions. Primary disease, clinical history, and recurrence features and data were analyzed. Thirty-five (12.4%) of 282 patients had recurrence in vaginal vault, 51 patients (18.0%) had recurrence in central pelvis, 14 patients (4.9%) had recurrence in pelvic wall, and 39 patients (13.8%) had recurrence in lymph nodes. One-hundred twenty-eight patients (45.3%) showed a distant relapse, whereas 15 patients (5.3%) developed both distant relapse and local relapse. The site of relapse influenced survival because the patients with vaginal vault recurrences lived significantly longer than the patients with recurrences in other sites. Eighty (28.4%) of the 282 patients became symptomatic and anticipated the scheduled visit, 37 (13.1 %) of the patients reported their symptoms during the follow-up meeting, and 165 (58.5 %) of the patients were asymptomatic and the diagnostic path was introduced by a planned visit or examination. Among the asymptomatic patients, the first procedure that led to further examinations was clinical visit alone for 60 (36.4%) of 165 patients, imaging for 103 patients (62.4%), and cytologic examination for 2 patients (1.2%). Symptoms at recurrence can predict survival Follow-up after endometrial cancer treatment varies in Italy. In this retrospective study, women with asymptomatic recurrence have shown a better clinical outcome compared with those with symptomatic relapse. The optimal approach is actually unknown, and guidelines comparing follow-up protocols have not been established. Prospective cost-effectiveness studies are needed.\n \nGranulosa cell tumors (GCTs) are the most common estrogen-secreting ovarian tumors; perhaps due to the persistent hyperestrogenism, a wide spectrum of associated endometrial pathologies ranging from endometrial hyperplasia to carcinoma has been documented in patients with GCTs. The aim of this study is to evaluate the incidence of endometrial pathologies in a large series of GCT patients treated in MITO centers. A retrospective multi-institutional review of patients with granulosa cell tumors of the ovary treated or referred to MITO centers was conducted. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the patient population and to assess the association of GCT and endometrial abnormalities at the time of diagnosis; multivariate regression analysis was also performed to identify independent predictors of endometrial abnormalities. A total of 150 patients with primary adult GCT was identified. During the preoperative assessment, endometrial pathology was found in 35.9% of symptomatic patients and in 90.9% of asymptomatic women with endometrial thickening at transvaginal ultrasound. At the time of surgery, hyperplasia was documented in 29.2% of patients, whereas endometrial cancer occurred in 7.5% of patients. Almost all of the patients (97.6%) with endometrial hyperplasia were older than 40years. All patients with endometrial cancer were older than 40years and postmenopausal. Endometrial carcinoma/atypical hyperplasia were commonly observed in GCT patients >40years; based on these data, endometrial sampling should be performed in symptomatic women at least 40years of age. In asymptomatic women <40years, endometrial sampling is of low yield.\n"}]}]}}

CD Fischer rats were subject to LITT of the left forebrain. Disruption of the BBB was analyzed using Evans blue and immunohistochemistry (IH). Animals were perfused with paclitaxel, and high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) was employed to analyze the content of paclitaxel in brain and plasma samples. LITT induces an opening of the BBB as demonstrated by locoregional extravasation of Evans blue, C3C, fibrinogen, and IgM. HPLC proved the passage of paclitaxel across the disrupted BBB. LITT induces a locoregional passage of chemotherapeutic agents into the brain tissue.

Only patients with isolated nasal fractures were included in the study. Patients with additional maxillofacial fractures and patients whose application time to our clinic was more than 10 days after the trauma were excluded. Patients were classified into 5 types according to their fracture. All patients underwent closed reduction and external fixation under local anesthesia. Patients were asked about their satisfaction in a survey at 28th day and sixth month after the surgery. Patients were divided into groups according to fracture type and intervention time, and the results of the survey were evaluated. Of the 43 patients included in the study, 38 were male, 5 were female, and the average age was 24.9. The average intervention time of the patients was 5.44 days. Twenty-eight (65%) of 43 patients were satisfied with the result, whereas 15 (35%) patients were not happy with their operation. In a comparison of patient satisfaction rates according to fracture type, the mild fracture group had a higher satisfaction rate compared to the severe fracture group. Closed reduction is an easy and sufficient treatment for nasal fractures, especially for mild nasal fractures. Early intervention raises the patient satisfaction rate.\n"}]}]}}

When a wide carinal fistula was found, this was mechanically occluded by Fogarty catheter and cannulated with rigid bronchoscopy.

Between February 1991 and February 2006, a consecutive series of 142 patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma (EADC) underwent esophageal resection. To reconstruct the upper gastrointestinal tract, all patients had a narrow gastric tube (greater curvature of stomach based on the right gastroepiploic artery) transposed through the posterior mediastinum to the left neck where an anastomosis to the cervical esophagus was performed. From a prospective database, 15 patients were identified to have undergone an 'open' fundoplication (transabdominal Nissen, n=11; transthoracic Belsey, n=4) from 12 to 23 years earlier. Outcomes were compared between patients with EADC who had undergone previous fundoplication, and patients with EADC who never had antireflux surgery. Gastric transposition and cervical esophagogastrostomy were technically feasible in all patients. No significant differences in outcome were found between patient groups. Gastric necrosis developed in only one patient, who had not undergone previous fundoplication. Anastomotic leak rates after esophageal resection and reconstruction were not statistically different based on whether patients had undergone previous fundoplication (2/15, 13.3%) or not (16/127, 12.6%; p=0.99). With careful attention to surgical technique, previous fundoplication does not preclude the use of stomach to reconstruct the foregut after esophageal resection, refuting the notion that previous antireflux surgery is a relative contraindication to, or alters the approach to esophageal cancer surgery.\n"}]}]}}

Sixty females had their Q angles measured in bilateral and unilateral stance. Linear regressions showed predictive equations and positive correlations for unilateral and bilateral stance Q angles (r=0.81-0.89, p<0.001). The equations generated were used to predict unilateral Q angle from bilateral Q angle measurements in 12 patients with patellofemoral joint pain. The actual unilateral Q angle measurement of the symptomatic knee was significantly greater than that predicted for each individual (p=0.01), whilst the asymptomatic knee showed no significant difference (p=0.16). This study showed a strong positive relationship between bilateral and unilateral stance Q angles which could be represented in a positive linear regression equation. The linear regression equation was then used to predict the effect on the Q angle of moving from a bilateral to a unilateral stance. It has been found previously that patients with patellofemoral joint pain on loading the limb in unilateral stance in activities such as walking and stair descent have increased knee valgus angle. The current study supports those findings indicating that when taking up unilateral stance patients with patellofemoral joint pain demonstrate greater than expected increase in Q angle which could increase loading on the patellofemoral joint.\n \nTo determine whether audiologic characteristics of unilateral hearing loss in children were associated with language, cognitive, or achievement scores. Case-control study Pediatric otolaryngology ambulatory practice Cases (n = 109) were children aged 6 to 12 years with permanent unilateral hearing loss; controls (n = 95) were siblings with normal bilateral hearing. Audiologic characteristics measured included side and severity of hearing loss and word recognition scores in quiet and in noise. Cognitive abilities were measured using the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence; reading, math, and writing achievement was measured with the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test - Second Edition - Abbreviated; and oral language skills were measured with the Oral Written and Language Scales. Children with unilateral hearing loss had worse verbal cognitive and oral language scores than children with normal hearing, but there were no differences in achievement scores. Children with profound unilateral hearing loss tended to have worse cognitive scores and had significantly lower oral language scores. Higher word recognition scores of the normal hearing ear in quiet were associated with higher cognitive, oral language, and reading achievement scores. Higher word recognition scores in noise were slightly correlated with higher oral language scores. As expected, children with unilateral hearing loss had worse language scores than their siblings with normal hearing, with trends toward worse cognitive scores. Children with profound unilateral hearing loss tended to have worse outcomes than children with normal hearing or less severe unilateral loss. However, there were no differences in outcomes between children with right or left unilateral hearing loss.\n"}]}]}}

Epidemiologic studies investigating the relationship between appendectomy and infertility or ectopic pregnancy were identified by searching the MEDLINE database from 1966 to 1997. Appropriate citations were also extracted from a manual search of the bibliographies of selected papers. Twenty-three articles were retrieved. Only 4 presented original data including comparisons to a nonexposed control group and they form the basis for this study. Because the raw data or specific techniques of data analysis were not always explicitly described, indices of risk for exposure were extracted from the data as presented and were analysed without attempting to convert them to a common measure. Articles were assessed according to the criteria of the Evidence-Based Medicine Working Group for evaluating articles on harm. Review of the literature yielded estimates of the risk of adverse fertility outcomes ranging from 1.6 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1 to 2.5) for ectopic pregnancy after an appendectomy to 4.8 (95% CI 1.5 to 14.9) for tubal infertility from perforation of the appendix. Recall bias, and poor adjustment for confounding variables in some reports, weakened the validity of the studies. The methodologic weaknesses of the studies do not permit acceptance of increased risk of tubal pregnancy or infertility as a consequence of perforation of the appendix, so a causal relationship cannot be supported by the data currently available. Only a well-designed case-control study with unbiased ascertainment of exposure and adjustment for confounding variables will provide a definitive answer.\n \nThe aim of this study is to evaluate whether closure of a tympanic membrane perforation with an intact ossicular chain results in a closure of the air-bone gap.

All patients underwent myringoplasty using temporalis fascia in an underlay technique. Comparison of the preoperative and postoperative hearing results in patients undergoing myringoplasty for chronic otitis media simplex. The mean postoperative air-bone gap (ABG) was 8.2 dB for the frequencies 0.5 to 4 kHz. Eighty-three patients (78%) showed postoperatively a mean ABG of 10 dB or lower. The ABG difference (improvement) was statistically significant for each single frequency (0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 4 kHz) (p < 0.0001). There is a linear correlation between the preoperative tympanic membrane perforation size and the postoperative ABG (p = 0.0017) for the frequencies 0.5 to 4 kHz. No statistical significant correlation was seen between the state of the middle-ear mucosa, temporal bone pneumatization, tympanometric middle-ear/mastoid volume, and the postoperative ABG. Complete ABG closure by myringoplasty could be achieved in only approximately 20% of the cases. 80% respectively presented with a mean residual ABG of 8 dB. We found a significant linear correlation between the preoperative size of the tympanic membrane perforation and the postoperative ABG, whereas mastoid volume, temporal bone pneumatization, and the condition of the mucosa did not affect the outcome.\n"}]}]}}

The purpose of this study was to explore whether remote physician-examiners can replace on-site physician-examiners in an OSCE, and to determine the feasibility of this new examination method. Forty Year 3 medical students were randomised into six reOSCE stations that were incorporated into two tracks of a 10-station traditional OSCE. For the reOSCE stations, student performance was assessed by both a local examiner (LE) in the room and a remote examiner (RE) who viewed the OSCE encounters from a distance. The primary endpoint was the correlation of scores between LEs and REs across all reOSCE stations. The secondary endpoint was a post-OSCE survey of both REs and students. Statistically significant correlations were found between LE and RE checklist scores for history taking (r = 0.64-r = 0.80), physical examination (r = 0.41-r = 0.54), and management stations (r = 0.78).

Included among the syndromes are ataques de nervios (ADN), which are reported to be bound to the Hispanic culture and closely resemble panic attacks. However, the cultural distinctiveness and phenomenology of ADN has not been adequately investigated. The current study employed an ethnically diverse study sample (N=342) of undergraduates.

In contrast to the DSM-IV's conceptualization of ADN, the rate of ADN did not significantly vary across the three main groups (African American, Caucasian, and Hispanic participants) nor did it vary based on acculturation. More consistent with the DSM-IV, the symptom comparisons indicated some differentiation between ADN and panic attacks.

Among U.S. adults with chronic disease-related functional limitations, the overall increase in CAM use from 2002 to 2007 was significant, particularly among those with changing and maintaining body position limitations.\n \nThe aim of study was to evaluate the importance of induced abortions for reproduction medicine in Czech Republic. Demographic analysis of data published by EUROSTAT and Czech statistical office. Department of Demography and Geodemography Faculty of Science, Charles University Prague. Widespread use of the liberal abortion law in socialist countries contributed to the decline of fertility rates only to the replacement level. In the Czech Republic total fertility rate dropped below 1.3 in 1995 and it did not increase above 1.5 children per woman till 2007. The increased use of modern contraceptive methods that results in a sharp decline in fertility and in a significant decrease of induced abortions can be documented. The total abortion rate fell from 1.54 abortions per a woman in 1990 to 0.34 in 2007. The proportion of women aged 15-49 years who were prescribed oral contraception increased from 4 percent in 1990 to 48 percent in 2007. An induced abortion is still used largely as a way to avoid birth of additional children by women who already have the number of children they want. This is in sharp contrast with the situation in the majority of Western European countries in which abortion is used mainly by teen-age girls whose attempts to avoid pregnancy have failed. In contrast to other demographic characteristics which classify the Czech Republic to Eastern Europe, the level of induced abortion rate is comparable with the levels observed in some Western European countries.\n"}]}]}}

Prospective, descriptive preliminary study of in vitro fertilization outcome. From July 1998 to July 1999, 224 patients underwent antral follicle assessment (follicle 2-6 mm in diameter) on baseline of the planned, stimulated in vitro fertilization cycle. The outcomes were analyzed with respect to antral follicle assessment (< or = 6 or > 6), basal cycle day 3 follicle stimulated hormone (< or = 10 or > 10 IU/L) and maternal age (< or = 35 or > 35 years). The clinical pregnancy rate was significantly higher in the group with baseline antral follicle > 6 compared to that in the group with antral follicle < or = 6 (51% vs. 19%, respectively). Controlling for patient age, and basal follicle stimulated hormone, the pregnancy rate was significantly higher in the group with antral follicle > 6 compared to that in the group with antral follicle < or = 6. The cancellation rate was significantly increased with advancing maternal age, elevated basal follicle stimulated hormone levels, and baseline antral follicle < or = 6. The cancellation rate was significantly higher in the group with antral follicle < or = 6 compared to that in the group with antral follicle > or = 6 (33% vs. 1%, respectively). In vitro fertilization outcome is strongly correlated with both maternal ages, basal cycle, day 3 follicle, stimulated hormone, and antral follicle assessment. Antral follicle assessment was a better predictor of in vitro fertilization outcome than were age or follicle stimulated hormone. Antral follicle assessment may provide a marker for ovarian age that is distinct from chronological age or hormonal markers.\n \nWe aimed to compare the rates of psychiatric morbidity in patients who had early age and late age MI in patients who have survived acute myocardial infarction? One hundred sixteen patients who were hospitalized in the coronary care unit were included in the study. Psychiatric assessment of the patients was carried out within 1-6months post-MI. Psychiatric interviews were conducted with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-I). Also used were the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and Health Anxiety Inventory (HAI). A total of 116 patients were divided into two groups according to age as an early age myocardial infarction group (EA-MI) and a late age myocardial infarction group (LA-MI). The EA-MI group included 24 patients 45years of age and under. The LA-MI group included 92 patients over 45years of age. Current psychiatric disorders, lifetime psychiatric disorders and lifetime depressive disorders were significantly more frequent in the EA-MI group than in the LA-MI group. EA-MI patients have experienced a depressive episode prior to the onset of the MI, whereas in the LA-MI group, the patients typically experienced depressive episodes after MI. Our findings suggest that depression may increase the risk of MI at an early age.\n"}]}]}}

Its prevalence is higher in developing countries and in low socioeconomic populations. We aimed at determining and comparing the prevalence of iron deficiency in an immigrant and non-immigrant population. Every child scheduled for a routine check-up at 12 months of age was allowed to participate in the study. Haemoglobin, ferritin, anthropometric data, familial and nutritional status were measured. 586 infants were eligible and 463 were included in the study as they had assessment data at 12 months. Children were divided into two groups The prevalence of iron deficiency in the immigrant population is higher than in non-immigrants. Immigration and the category of employment are risk factors for iron deficiency, as starting baby cereals before 9 months is a protective factor. Good socioeconomic conditions in Switzerland, the quality of food for pregnant women and young infants may be the explanation. A study up to five years of age is necessary before drawing general conclusions on infancy.\n"}]}]}}

In unicompartmental replacement, the other compartments and knee ligaments are largely untouched. Therefore, it was hypothesized that the knee kinematics after unicompartmental replacement may also be unchanged. To test this hypothesis, knee kinematics and quadriceps tension were recorded before and after replacement with a unicompartmental design and then with a tricompartmental design. Six human cadaver knees were tested before implantation, after implantation with a bicruciate-retaining unicompartmental knee prosthesis, and after implantation with a posterior cruciate-retaining tricompartmental knee prosthesis. The unicompartmental prosthesis was initially implanted, and it was then revised to a total condylar knee replacement. The knee kinematics were measured with use of an electromagnetic tracking device while the knee was put through dynamic simulated stair-climbing under peak flexion moments of approximately 40 N-m. Quadriceps tension was also measured for all three conditions. No significant differences in tibial axial rotation were noted between the intact and unicompartmental conditions. However, tricompartmental replacement significantly affected tibial axial rotation (p = 0.001). Femoral rollback was not significantly affected by either unicompartmental or tricompartmental arthroplasty. Quadriceps tension was also similar among all three conditions. In this in vitro cadaver study, the tricompartmental replacement significantly changed knee kinematics while the unicompartmental replacement preserved normal knee kinematics.\n \nThe posterior tibial slope influences both the natural knee stability as well as the stability and kinematics after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Exact definition of the posterior tibial slope (PTS) requires lateral radiographs of the lower limb. Only lateral knee radiographs are routinely obtained after TKA, however. The purpose of the present study therefore was to analyse the relationship between PTS measurement results on short and expanded lateral knee radiographs. The PTS was measured on 100 consecutive lateral radiographs of the lower limb using the mechanical and three diaphyseal axes with various distances below the tibial plateau. Significant differences between PTS results were found for all three diaphyseal axes, with the smallest differences and the strongest correlation for a diaphyseal axis at 16 and 20\u00a0cm below the tibial plateau. Using short distances below the tibial plateau (6 and 10\u00a0cm) resulted in an overestimation of the PTS of 3\u00b0, on average. The PTS measurements in long lateral knee radiographs are more accurate compared to short radiographs. On short lateral knee radiographs, only a estimation of the PTS can be carried out.

There are 71 previously untreated patients with cytological or histological evidence of primary lung cancer who were admitted to the oncology department between November 2013 and August 2014. Forty-five healthy individuals with age, sex and BMI matching the lung cancer patients, were recruited to take part in the study as a control group. Leptin levels were measured quantitatively by using a microELISA kit. The serum leptin levels at diagnosis were significantly lower in lung cancer patients than those in control subjects (4.75\u00b14.91 ng/ml, 9.67\u00b18.02 ng/ml; p<0.001). We did not find any significant difference in leptin values related to clinicopathological parameters such as ECOG PS, weight loss, histological type, disease stage and TNM classification. Nevertheless, we demonstrated a significant correlation between serum leptin levels and BMI in lung cancer patients (correlation coefficient Our results showed that the serum leptin level has no prognostic indications in advanced lung cancer patients. Leptin is decreased in lung cancer, and there is lack of correlation with tumour\u2011related factors including prognosis. Therefore, leptin is not a useful clinical marker in lung cancer (Tab. 2, Fig. 2, Ref. 22).\n \nThe limited information on serum leptin levels in elderly men suggests the occurrence of an age-related decrease, with disruption of the relationship between fat mass and leptin levels. A relative leptin deficiency might thus be implicated in the increase of fat mass and decrease of serum testosterone levels in elderly men. Therefore, we have reevaluated the age-related changes in serum leptin levels and their relationship with adiposity and androgen levels in a large group of community dwelling men. Serum leptin and androgen levels were measured in 271 healthy, ambulatory elderly men (median age 74 years), as well as in 61 middle-aged (median 43 years) and 40 young (median 25.5 years) controls. Adiposity was assessed by anthropometrical measurements (body mass index; BMI) and by estimation of fat mass by the bio-impedance method. Serum leptin levels, whether or not adjusted for BMI, were found to increase with age, the values tending to level off after the age of 45 years, and were strongly correlated to BMI (r = 0.77) and fat mass assessed by the bio-impedance method (r = 0.81). Linear regression analysis showed a similar slope for the relationship between BMI and serum leptin in the three age groups. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated BMI, age and serum insulin, but not serum testosterone, as significant independent correlates of serum leptin. Serum (free) testosterone levels were negatively correlated with age and serum leptin, also after partialization for BMI Ageing in men is accompanied by a rise of serum leptin levels with a maintained strong association between serum leptin and adiposity in elderly men. Testosterone does not appear to be a major determinant of serum leptin in healthy men, while leptin does emerge as a negative correlate of serum testosterone. Increased fat mass and decreased testosterone production in elderly men cannot be attributed to a relative leptin deficiency.\n"}]}]}}

The study sample included women who delivered a live singleton baby between April 2003 and March 2004. Pregnant women who made at least one ED visit for asthma were counted as cases and the rest of the women as control subjects.

In addition, a series of multivariable logistic regressions were also constructed separately for cases and controls for the following adverse delivery outcomes Among 109,173 live singleton deliveries, 530 women had visited ED due to asthma during pregnancy.

We noticed that several children undergoing laceration repair in emergency department requested to be sutured by a female physician. This study attempted to find gender preferences of children and parents for the physician in the emergency department. We undertook this study to determine whether pediatric patients or their parents have a preference for physicians of a particular gender. We also tried to determine whether they would be willing to wait longer to be seen to accommodate their choice. A total of 200 children aged between 8 and 13 years presenting to our pediatric emergency department for laceration repair were enrolled. With the knowledge and consent of their parents, the enrolled children were given a short questionnaire. They were asked, if they had a choice, would they prefer to have a male or a female doctor or would they prefer the doctor with the most experience. Their parents were also then given the questionnaire. They were also asked if they would be willing to wait longer to be seen by the doctor of their choice. The study sample comprised 200 children, 139 boys and 61 girls. Among boys, 78% (n = 109) said they would prefer a female physician. Only 21% (n = 30) preferred a male physician. Among girls, 80% (n = 49) reported they would prefer a female physician, 20% (n = 12) preferred a male physician. None of the children surveyed wanted the \"best\" physician. When the parents were surveyed, 60% (n = 120) preferred a male physician as compared with 19% (n = 38) who expressed a preference for female physician. Only 21% (n = 42) of parents desired the most experienced physician of either sex to repair the laceration. All the parents who expressed a preference for the \"most experienced\" physician said they were willing to wait (42/42) until that physician was available as compared with less than a third of parents who were willing to wait for the physician of a specific gender (44/158). Most children (79%) preferred a female physician for their sutures, whereas parents overall (60%) appeared to prefer a male physician. The children did not appear to care if the physician was the \"best.\" Surprisingly, many parents also chose physician gender rather than physician experience. One hundred percent of the parents who chose the most experienced physician were willing to wait longer to be seen as compared with 29% who preferred a physician of a particular gender.\n"}]}]}}

Although AF can have a genetic etiology, links between inherited gene defects and acquired factors such as atrial stretch have not been explored. Mutation screening of the KCNQ1, KCNE1, KCNE2, and KCNE3 genes was performed in 50 families with AF. The effects of mutant protein on cardiac I(Ks) activation were evaluated using electrophysiological studies and human atrial action potential modeling. One missense KCNQ1 mutation, R14C, was identified in 1 family with a high prevalence of hypertension. Atrial fibrillation was present only in older individuals who had developed atrial dilation and who were genotype positive. Patch-clamp studies of wild-type or R14C KCNQ1 expressed with KCNE1 in CHO cells showed no statistically significant differences between wild-type and mutant channel kinetics at baseline, or after activation of adenylate cyclase with forskolin. After exposure to hypotonic solution to elicit cell swelling/stretch, mutant channels showed a marked increase in current, a leftward shift in the voltage dependence of activation, altered channel kinetics, and shortening of the modeled atrial action potential duration. These data suggest that the R14C KCNQ1 mutation alone is insufficient to cause AF. Rather, we suggest a model in which a \"second hit\", such as an environmental factor like hypertension, which promotes atrial stretch and thereby unmasks an inherited defect in ion channel kinetics (the \"first hit\"), is required for AF to be manifested. Such a model would also account for the age-related increase in AF development.\n \nPatients with an accessory pathway (AP) have an increased propensity to develop atrial fibrillation (AF), but the mechanism is unknown. The purpose of this study was to identify crucial risk factors and to test the hypothesis that reflection and/or microreentry of atrial impulses propagating into the AP triggers AF. Five hundred thirty-four patients successfully treated with radiofrequency ablation of AP at two university hospitals were evaluated. Patients were separated into those with concealed vs those with manifest AP in terms of their propensity to develop AF. To investigate AF triggering mechanisms, linear and branched two-dimensional models of atrium-to-ventricle propagation across a heterogeneous 1 x 6 AP using human ionic kinetics were simulated. A history of AF was twice as common in patients with manifest AP vs concealed AP irrespective of AP location. AF was more likely to occur in older males and in patients with larger atria. There was no correlation between AF history and AP refractory measures. However, the electrophysiologic properties of APs seemed to fulfill the prerequisites for reflection and/or microreentry of atrially initiated impulses. In the linear AP model, repetitive atrial stimulation resulted in progressively larger delay of atrium-to-ventricle propagation across the passive segment. Eventually, sufficient time for repolarization of the atrial segment allowed for reflection of an impulse that activated the entire atrium and by wavefront-wavetail interaction with a new atrial stimulus AF reentry was initiated. Simulations using the branched model showed that microreentry at the ventricular insertion of the AP could also initiate AF via retrograde atrial activation as a result of unidirectional block at the AP-ventricle junction. Propensity for AF in patients with an AP is strongly related to preexcitation, larger atria, male gender, and older age. Reflection and microreentry at the AP may be important for AF initiation in patients with manifest (preexcited) Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Similar mechanisms also may trigger AF in patients without an AP.\n"}]}]}}

The presence of left ventricular hypertrophy was considered if left ventricular mass index was > or = 134 or 110 g/m(2) in men and women, respectively (Devereux criteria). A logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated to left ventricular hypertrophy. The prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy was 23.9% (95% CI:17.9-29.9), 25.6% in men and 22.6% in women. In the low risk group its prevalence was 20.7% and in medium risk group 29.5%. Factors associated to left ventricular hypertrophy were These findings underline the importance of performing an echocardiogram in low and high risk untreated hypertensive patients in which treatment would otherwise be delayed for even one year.\n"}]}]}}

This is a retrospective study of twenty-two cases treated with TEVAR for TAI in our department from 2009 to 2014. Aortic injury was assessed in accordance with the recommendations of the Society of Vascular Surgery. We measured the aortic arch angle and the aortic arch index, based on the initial angio-CT scan, in each of the analyzed cases. The mean aortic arch index and mean aortic arch angle were 6.8\u00a0cm and 58.3\u00b0, respectively, in the type I injury group; 4.4\u00a0cm and 45.9\u00b0 in the type III group; 3.3\u00a0cm and 37\u00b0 in the type IV group. There were substantial differences in both the aortic arch index and the aortic arch angle of the type III and IV groups. A multivariate analysis confirmed that the aortic arch angle was significantly associated with the occurrence of type III damage (OR 1.5; 95% CI 1.03-2.2). The severity of TAI is influenced by the sharpness of the aortic arch. There is an inverse relationship between the severity of aortic injury and the aortic arch index.\n \nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of our surgical strategy for acute aortic dissection based on the extent of the dissection and the site of the entry, with special emphasis on resection of all dissected aortic segments if technically possible. Between January 1995 and March 2001, 43 consecutive patients underwent operations for acute aortic dissection. In all patients the distal repair was performed under circulatory arrest without the use of an aortic cross-clamp. Fifteen patients underwent aortic arch replacement with additional reconstruction of supra-aortic vessels in 3 patients. Complete replacement of all dissected tissue could be achieved in 21 patients (group 1). Because of the distal extent of the dissection beyond the aortic arch, replacement of all the dissected tissue was not possible in 22 patients (group 2). Early mortality was 4.7% (2 patients), and the incidence of perioperative cerebrovascular events was 7.0% (3 patients). All of these events occurred in group 2 (p < 0.025). During the follow-up period of 6 years or less, 5 patients died, all from causes not related to the aorta or the aortic valve. A persisting patent false lumen was observed in 14 of the 36 surviving patients (39%). Extended replacement of the dissected ascending aorta and aortic arch can be done with good early and midterm results, even though it requires a complex surgical technique. Therefore we advocate complete replacement of the dissected parts of the aorta in all patients in whom this is technically possible.\n"}]}]}}

A retrospective chart review of gynecologic cancer patients admitted with NF from 2007 to 2011 was performed, wherein demographic, oncologic, and NF characteristics (hospitalization length, complications, and death) were collected. The Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) risk index score was calculated; low risk was considered \u2265 21. SAS 9.2 was used for statistical analyses. Eighty-three patients met the study criteria. Most (92%) were Caucasian and had advanced stage disease (71%). Primary tumors were 58% ovary, 35% endometrium, and 6% cervix. All patients were receiving chemotherapy on admission (72% for primary, 28% for recurrent disease). Forty-eight percent had a positive culture, and most (58%) positive cultures were urine. Seventy-six percent of patients were considered low risk. High-risk patients were more likely to have a severe complication (10% versus 50%, p=0.0003), multiple severe complications (3% versus 20%, p=0.0278), ICU admission (2% versus 40%, p<0.0001), overall mortality (2% versus 15%, p=0.0417), and death due to neutropenic fever (0% versus 15%, p=0.0124). MASCC had a positive predictive value of 50% and negative predictive value of 90%. The median MASCC score for all patients was 22 (range, 11-26), but the median MASCC score for those with death or a severe complication was 17 (range, 11-24). Based on this pilot data, MASCC score appears promising in determining suitability for outpatient management of NF in gynecologic oncology patients.

We aimed to determine the microbial contamination rates and evaluate the success of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in patients who received contaminated products. We analyzed microbial contamination records of HPC grafts between 2012 and 2015, retrospectively. Contamination rates of autologous donors were evaluated for at three steps A total of 445 mobilization procedures were carried out on 333 (167 autologous and 166 allogeneic) donors. The microbiological contamination of peripheral blood (323/333 donations) and bone marrow (10/333 donations) products were analyzed. Bacterial contamination was detected in 18 of 1552 (1.15 %) culture bottles of 333 donors. During the study period 248 patients underwent HCT and among these patients microbial contamination rate on sample basis was 1.3 % (16/1212). Microbial contamination detected in nine patients (7 autologous; 2 allogeneic). In 8 of 9 patients, a febrile neutropenic attack was observed. The median day for the neutropenic fever was 4 days (0-9). None of the patients died within the post-transplant 30 days who received contaminated products. The use of contaminated products with antibiotic prophylaxis may be safe in terms of the first day of fever, duration of fever, neutrophil, platelet engraftment and duration of hospitalization.\n"}]}]}}

Local recurrence rate was 5 % (five cases). Recurrence sites were the operative scare and chest wall. Factors associated with increased risk of local failure were age < or = 40 years and tumour size greater than 20mm, without statistical significance. Post-mastectomy radiotherapy should be discussed for a sub-group of node-negative patients with predictors factors of local failure such as age < or = 40 years and larger tumour size.\n \nAxillary dissection is associated with a high incidence of lymphedema, which has been brought down with the introduction of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in patients with early breast cancer. However, sentinel lymph node biopsy is not widely accepted in patients of locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) [T3N1, Any T4, Any N2-3 with no distant metastasis] after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) and these patients routinely undergo axillary lymph node clearance. Axillary reverse mapping (ARM) with blue dye has the potential to differentiate the arm lymphatics from the breast lymphatics and it can be used to decrease lymphedema in patients undergoing ALND by preserving these lymphatics. However, ARM in LABC patients is yet to be accepted as the standard of care. 51 patients of locally advanced breast carcinoma were included in the study from May 2011 to May 2012. All patients received neo-adjuvant chemotherapy followed by modified radical mastectomy. Axillary reverse mapping (ARM) was carried out using blue dye. 2 ml of methylene blue dye was injected intradermal, upper medial aspect of the ipsilateral arm. The number, size and site and distribution of lymph nodes identified were recorded and the nodes were labelled as ARM nodes and complete axillary dissection was carried out. Blue nodes were identified in 45 (88.2%) out of the 51 patients. The average number of ARM nodes identified was 4.03 \u00b1 0.28 [range 1-8]. In majority (77.8%) of the cases, nodes were located in the triangle formed by axillary vein above, below by the first intercostobrachial nerve and medially by the chest wall/serratus anterior. In patients with complete or partial response to NACT, ARM and breast axillary LN were negative in 63.3% patients whereas 36.6% had positive breast but negative ARM nodes. In this study we did not intend to preserve any ARM nodes but in 90% of these cases, at least one ARM node had to be removed or was injured during axillary clearance. ARM nodes could be identified in 15 (83.3%) out of the 18 patients with stable or progressive disease following ARM. 12 (80%) out of these 15 cases demonstrated positive ARM and breast LN whereas 3 (20%) patients had positive breast but negative ARM nodes. Skin tattooing (82.3%) was the most common complication observed in our study. Identification rates of ARM nodes can be improved by injecting the blue dye in the upper medial aspect of the arm at the time of induction. Majority of the arm nodes lie between the axillary vein and the first intercostobrachial nerve. It is difficult to preserve the ARM nodes in patients of LABC, who have had good response to NACT and in patients of LABC with poor response to NACT, the incidence of metastasis in ARM nodes is quite high. Therefore, ARM is not a feasible option in patients with locally advanced breast cancer.\n"}]}]}}

The BMD at both sites decreased precipitously within 24 months of stopping treatment, raising the question as to whether bisphosphonates can be stopped in a growing child with skeletal fragility. At age 23 months, a male toddler sustained a low trauma fracture of his right femur. Skeletal radiographs revealed generalised osteopenia with multiple vertebral body fractures. He was diagnosed with type IV osteogenesis imperfecta; however, no mutations were found in COL1A1 or COL1A2 genes. This case report presents bone densitometry data before, during and after bisphosphonate treatment. Axial QCT was main outcome from 2 years of age; DXA and pQCT were taken after age 5. QCT confirmed that he had low spinal trabecular volumetric BMD (Z-score -2.4). After 4 years of treatment his vertebral fractures had been remodelled and all bone densitometry values (QCT, DXA and pQCT) were within normal range and therefore treatment was discontinued. Shortly after this he suffered stress fractures of his left mid tibia and at the sclerotic metaphyseal line corresponding to his first APD treatment. He had marked reduction in spinal trabecular and distal radial vBMD; change in BMAD was less marked. The patient has been restarted on IV APD therapy. This case has led us to consider whether bisphosphonate therapy can be discontinued in a child with fragility fractures before his/her linear growth has ceased?\n \nThe pathogenesis of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ) is not completely understood. The most popular hypothesis has suggested that the bone turnover (BT) in the jawbone is greater than that in other sites and that this turnover will be overly suppressed by bisphosphonates. Using bone scintigraphy, a simple tool for the quantitative evaluation of bone metabolism and blood flow, the goals of the present study were to determine whether the rate of bone remodeling is greater in the jaw and whether the bone BT in the jaw is differentially altered after bisphosphonate intake compared with that in other skeletal sites. The bone scintigraphies of 90 female patients with breast cancer were retrospectively analyzed (n\u00a0= 45 with bisphosphonate intake; n\u00a0= 45 without bisphosphonate intake [control group]). All patients in the study group had undergone bone scintigraphy before therapy and during the treatment (course after 12 and 24\u00a0months). The data were quantitatively analyzed using 6 predetermined regions of interest. The bone BT of the mandible was similar to that of the femur and significantly reduced compared with that of the maxilla (P < .01). None of the investigated bone regions (including the mandible and maxilla) were significantly altered after bisphosphonate administration (P > .05). The finding that the mandible had significantly lower bone BT than that of the maxilla and that two thirds of BRONJ cases occur in the mandible were inconsistent with the investigated hypothesis. Furthermore, the bone BT in the jawbone was not overly suppressed by bisphosphonates. Thus, it is unlikely that over suppression of bone BT is the exclusive causation playing a role in the pathomechanism of BRONJ.\n"}]}]}}

At our institution, a regional anesthesia program was instituted for patients undergoing surgery for hip fracture. This retrospective cohort review examines the effects of regional anesthesia (from mainly after July 2007) vs general anesthesia (mainly prior to July 2007) on morbidity, mortality and hospitalization costs. This retrospective cohort study involved data collection from electronic and paper charts of 308 patients who underwent surgery for hip fracture from September 2006 to December 2008. Data on postoperative morbidity, in-patient mortality, and cost of hospitalization (as estimated from data on hospital charges) were collected and analyzed. Seventy-three patients received regional anesthesia and 235 patients received general anesthesia. During July 2007, approximately halfway through the study period, a regional anesthesia and analgesia program was introduced. The average cost of hospitalization in patients who received surgery for hip fracture was no different between patients who receive regional or general anesthesia ($16,789 + 631 vs $16,815 + 643, respectively, P = 0.9557). Delay in surgery and intensive care unit (ICU) admission resulted in significantly higher hospitalization costs. Age, male gender, African American race and ICU admission were associated with increased in-hospital mortality. In-hospital mortality and rates of readmission are not statistically different between the two anesthesia groups. There is no difference in postoperative morbidity, rates of rehospitalization, in-patient mortality or hospitalization costs in geriatric patients undergoing regional or general anesthesia for repair of hip fracture. Delay in surgery beyond 3 days and ICU admission both increase cost of hospitalization.\n \nSurgical patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are at increased risk of perioperative complications. In this study, we sought to quantify the benefit of avoiding general anesthesia in this patient population. Data from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database (2005-2010) were used for this review. Patients who met the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program definition for COPD and underwent surgery under general, spinal, epidural, or peripheral nerve block anesthesia were included in this study. For each primary current procedural terminology code with \u2265 1 general and \u2265 1 regional (spinal, epidural, or peripheral nerve block) anesthetic, regional patients were propensity score--matched to general anesthetic patients. Propensity scoring was calculated using all available demographic and comorbidity data. This match yielded 2644 patients who received regional anesthesia and 2644 matched general anesthetic patients. These groups were compared for morbidity and mortality. Groups were well matched on demographics, comorbidities, and type of surgery. Compared with matched patients who received regional anesthesia, patients who received general anesthesia had a higher incidence of postoperative pneumonia (3.3% vs 2.3%, P = 0.0384, absolute difference with 95% confidence interval = 1.0% [0.09, 1.88]), prolonged ventilator dependence (2.1% vs 0.9%, P = 0.0008, difference = 1.2% [0.51, 1.84]), and unplanned postoperative intubation (2.6% vs 1.8%, P = 0.0487, difference = 0.8% [0.04, 1.62]). Composite morbidity was 15.4% in the general group versus 12.6% (P = 0.0038, difference = 2.8% [0.93, 4.67]). Composite morbidity not including pulmonary complications was 13.0% in the general group versus 11.1% (P = 0.0312, difference = 1.9% [0.21, 3.72]). Thirty-day mortality was similar (2.7% vs 3.0%, P = 0.6788, difference = 0.3% [-1.12, 0.67]). As a test for validity, we found a positive association between pulmonary end points because patients with 1 pulmonary complication were significantly more likely to have additional pulmonary complications. The use of regional anesthesia in patients with COPD is associated with lower incidences of composite morbidity, pneumonia, prolonged ventilator dependence, and unplanned postoperative intubation.\n"}]}]}}

There were no significant differences in bile duct injury or postoperative complications between the groups. The length of preoperative, postoperative, and total hospital stay was longer before 2008. ELC is a safe and effective therapeutic strategy for AC. The Tokyo guidelines resulted in a significant increase in the number of ELCs being performed and significantly reduced preoperative and total hospital stay without increasing intra- and postoperative complications. Importantly, ELC reduced medical costs, which is crucial for a country with limited resources, such as Tunisia.\n"}]}]}}

Twenty-seven healthy normal glucose-tolerant humans with either a previous diagnosis of gestational diabetes or having two parents with Type 2 diabetes and 27 healthy adults who had no history of diabetes were recruited. Maximal oxygen uptake was assessed using an incremental exercise test to exhaustion. Skin microvascular function was assessed using laser Doppler techniques as the maximum skin hyperaemic response to a thermal stimulus (maximum hyperaemia) and the forearm skin blood flow response to the iontophoretic application of acetylcholine (ACh) and sodium nitroprusside. Maximal oxygen uptake was not significantly different in the 'at-risk' group compared with healthy controls. Maximum hyperaemia was reduced in those 'at risk' (1.29 +/- 0.30 vs. 1.46 +/- 0.33 V, P = 0.047); however, the peak response to acetylcholine or sodium nitroprusside did not differ in the two groups.

Construct validity of the EQ-5D was assessed according to relationships with MacNew subscales by using Spearman rank correlation and multiple linear regression analyses. One hundred and twenty-two patients responded to the instruments. Mean age was 62.9\u00b19.3 years and male gender (88 or 72.1%) was dominant. Mean score of the EQ-5D index was 0.79\u00b10.32, while the global score of MacNew was 5.01\u00b11.16. The correlation coefficients of the EQ-5D index score with the MacNew subscales ranged from 0.557 to 0.721, with EQ-5D VAS score ranging from 0.297 to 0.484 (p<0.001 for all of them). According to the stepwise regression model MacNew global score was found to be significantly effective factor on EQ-5D index score (\u03b2 =0.188; 95% CI The Turkish version of the EQ-5D-based utility score seems to be a valid instrument in the assessment of quality of life studies in patients with acute coronary syndrome.\n \nThe Tokyo guidelines for diagnostic criteria and severity assessment of acute cholecystitis (AC), published in 2007, recommend early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (ELC) be done as soon as possible after the onset of symptoms. We conducted this study to analyze the changes in the therapeutic strategy for AC in a surgical center in Tunisia after the Tokyo guidelines were published. Between January, 2005 and January, 2013, 649 patients underwent cholecystectomy for AC at the Department of Surgery, Mohamed Tahar Maamouri Hospital in Nabeul, Tunisia. The study period was subdivided into before (n\u00a0=\u00a0192) and after (n\u00a0=\u00a0457) the publication of the Tokyo guidelines, that is, prior to and including 2007, and from 2008 onward, respectively. We reviewed patient records retrospectively to collect demographic data, biochemical data, radiological findings, and postoperative outcomes. All these factors were compared between the groups. The duration of symptoms before surgery was significantly longer before 2008 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.018). ELC was significantly more frequent after 2008 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). Laparoscopic surgery was converted to open surgery in 16.1\u00a0% of patients before 2008 vs. 7.8\u00a0% of patients after 2008 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). There were no significant differences in bile duct injury or postoperative complications between the groups. The length of preoperative, postoperative, and total hospital stay was longer before 2008. ELC is a safe and effective therapeutic strategy for AC. The Tokyo guidelines resulted in a significant increase in the number of ELCs being performed and significantly reduced preoperative and total hospital stay without increasing intra- and postoperative complications. Importantly, ELC reduced medical costs, which is crucial for a country with limited resources, such as Tunisia.\n"}]}]}}

Perinatal characteristics, major morbidity and case mix adjusted mortality were compared between 1879 rural and 6775 urban infants <32 weeks gestational age, born in 1992-2002 and admitted to all 10 neonatal intensive care units in NSW and ACT. Rural mothers were more likely to be teenaged, indigenous, and to have had a previous premature birth, prolonged ruptured membrane, and antenatal corticosteroid. Urban mothers were more likely to have had assisted conception and a caesarean section. More urban (93% v 83%) infants were born in a tertiary obstetric hospital. Infants of rural residence had a higher mortality (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07 to 1.48, p = 0.005).

Ninety-six Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 2 (groups E and L). Each group was further subdivided into 6 subgroups (EA1, EA2, EA3, EB1, EB2, EB3, LA1, LA2, LA3, LB1, LB2, LB3), each containing 8 rats. Intestinal anastomosis was performed by polyglactin 910 sutures in A subgroups and with ethyl-2-cyanoacrylate in B subgroups. The anastomosis was end to end in A1 and B1, side to side in A2 and B2, and end to side in A3 and B3. Time for anastomosis performance (AT) was recorded. In group E, bursting pressures and hydroxyproline levels were determined on the second postoperative day, whereas in group L, the same measurements were made on the sixth postoperative day. One-way analysis of variance was used for analyses of variance in the groups. Quantitative data were analyzed with Student's t test. P value was considered significant at less than .05. There was no significant difference between bursting pressures of subgroup pairs on both postoperative days 2 and 6. Hydroxyproline levels and AT were significantly better in B subgroups.

No perfect method exists for accurate and reliable avoidance of these catastrophes. This study aimed to study the usefulness of routine intraoperative endoscopy (RIOE) by comparing the surgical outcomes for RIOE patients with those for selective intraoperative endoscopy (SIOE) patients. A retrospective chart review was performed for consecutive patients who underwent elective laparoscopic colorectal resections with distal anastomosis between January 2004 and May 2007. One surgeon performed RIOE, whereas the other three surgeons performed SIOE as necessary. All the abnormalities of IOE patients were managed with a subsequent salvage procedure, and the postoperative outcomes were compared between the RIOE and SIOE groups. The study included 107 patients in the RIOE group and 137 patients in the SIOE group. Abnormalities were detected in 11 RIOE patients (10.3%) (six with staple line bleeding, three with positive air leak test results, and two with additional pathology identified). All but one abnormality was laparoscopically managed without conversion to laparotomy. Whereas one patient experienced postoperative staple line bleeding that required a second operation, the remaining 10 patients recovered uneventfully. The mean hospital stay was 6 days (range, 4-9) days. The RIOE group had overall rates of 0% for anastomotic leakage and 0.9% for staple line bleeding. Intraoperative endoscopies were performed for 30 (21.9%) of the 137 patients in the SIOE group. The postoperative outcomes comparison between the RIOE and SIOE groups showed a tendency toward more overall anastomotic complications (0.9% vs. 5.1%) in the SIOE group, which due to the small sample size did not translate into significant differences in terms of staple line bleeding and anastomotic leakage. There also were no significant differences in other outcomes such as ileus, abdominal or pelvic sepsis, reoperation, positive distal margin, distance from distal margins, length of hospital stay, or mortality. Routine IOE for patients undergoing elective laparoscopic colorectal surgery with distal anastomosis can detect abnormalities at or around the anastomosis. Although the RIOE group had fewer postoperative anastomotic complications, due to the small sample size, the 5.7-fold increase in anastomotic failure did not translate into significantly better postoperative outcomes than the SIOE group experienced. A larger-scale single or multicenter prospective randomized study or a metaanalysis including similar studies is necessary for further investigation of this issue.\n"}]}]}}

Specimens were micro-computed tomography imaged to evaluate trabecular thickness, trabecular number, trabecular separation, bone volume density (BV/TV), BMD, and cortical thickness. Miniscrews 1.4 mm in diameter and 6 mm long were inserted into the bone blocks, and primary stability was evaluated by insertion torque (IT), mini-implant mobility (PTV), and pull-out strength (PS). Intergroup comparison showed lower levels of primary stability when the BMD of trabecular bone was lower and in the absence of cortical bone (P\u2264.05). The Pearson correlation test showed correlation between trabecular number, trabecular thickness, BV/TV, trabecular BMD, total BMD, and IT, PTV, and PS. There was correlation between cortical thickness and IT and PS (P\u2264.05). Cancellous bone plays an important role in primary stability of mini-implants in the presence or absence of cortical bone.\n \nThe aim of this retrospective study was to determine the need for bone grafting in the surgical treatment of displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures.

Three hundred ninety patients with displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures that were treated with plate osteosynthesis from December 2002 to December 2010 were reviewed. Two hundred two patients (group A) were treated by osteosynthesis with autologous bone grafting, and 188 patients (group B) were treated by osteosynthesis without bone grafting. One hundred eighty-one patients with an AO type 73-C1 fracture (Sanders type II), 182 patients with an AO type 73-C2 fracture (Sanders type III), and 27 patients with an AO type 73-C3 fracture (Sanders type IV) were included in this study.

The loss of Bohler's angle after 2 years was significantly lower in group A (mean 3.5\u00b0; 95 % CI 0.8\u00b0-6.2\u00b0) than in group B (mean 6.2\u00b0; 95 % CI 1.0\u00b0-11.2\u00b0). The average change in the crucial angle and the average change in calcaneal height were not statistically significant for either group.

We therefore sought to perform a population-level assessment for the presence of a July effect in this field. We used the Nationwide Inpatient Sample to abstract data on patients undergoing 1 of 8 major cancer surgeries at academic medical centres between Jan. 1, 1999, and Dec. 30, 2009. The primary outcomes examined were postoperative complications and in-hospital mortality. Univariate analyses and subsequently multivariate analyses, controlling for patient and hospital characteristics, were performed to identify whether the time of surgery was an independent predictor of outcome after major cancer surgery. On univariate analysis, the overall postoperative complication rate, as well as genitourinary and hematologic complications specifically, was higher in July than the rest of the year. However, on multivariate analysis, only hematologic complications were significantly higher in July, with no difference in overall postoperative complication rate or in-hospital mortality for all 8 surgeries considered separately or together.

The endpoints measured were postoperative morbidity, length of stay and readmission rates. Both groups were similar in terms of patient demographics, diagnosis, and nature of surgery performed. In the study group, 61% of patients underwent elective surgery compared with 62% in the control group. The incidence of postoperative morbidity in the study group was 20% compared with 33% in the control group (p = 0.003).

The patients concerned were asked at original assessment if they would agree to be followed up subsequently and although they agreed no time limit was put on this. To decide if cold calling was ethically justifiable and, if so, to set guidelines for researchers. The study was a cohort study of patients with neurotic disorder treated initially for 10 weeks in a randomised controlled trial. At follow up by a research medical practitioner 18 of the 210 patients had died and of the remaining 192 patients 186 (97%) were seen or had a telephone interview. Four patients refused and two others did not have interviews but agreed to some data being obtained. However, only 104 patients (54%) responded to letters inviting them to make an appointment or to refuse contact and the remainder were followed up by cold calling, with most patients agreeing readily to the research interview. The findings illustrate the dilemma of the need to get the maximum possible data from such studies to achieve scientific validity (and thereby justify the ethics of the study) and the protection of subjects' privacy and autonomy. More attention needs to be paid to consent procedures if cold calling is to be defended on ethical grounds but it is unreasonable to expect this to be obtained at the beginning of a research study in a way that satisfies the requirements for informed consent. A suggested way forward is to obtain written consent for the research at the time that cold calling takes place before beginning the research.\n"}]}]}}

In fact, data from the era of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) suggest that clinical examination of the axilla is falsely positive in as many as 30% of cases. Here we report the results of SLN biopsy in a selected group of breast cancer patients with palpable axillary nodes classified as either moderately or highly suspicious for metastasis. Among 2,027 consecutive SLN biopsy procedures performed by two experienced surgeons, clinically suspicious axillary nodes were identified in 106, and categorized as group 1 (asymmetric enlargement of the ipsilateral axillary nodes moderately suspicious for metastasis, n = 62) and group 2 (clinically positive axillary nodes highly suspicious for metastasis, n = 44). Clinical examination of the axilla was inaccurate in 41% of patients (43 of 106) overall, and was falsely positive in 53% of patients (33 of 62) with moderately suspicious nodes and 23% of patients (10 of 44) with highly suspicious nodes. False-positive results were less frequent with larger tumor size (p = 0.002) and higher histologic grade (p = 0.002), but were not associated with age, body mass index, or a previous surgical biopsy. Clinical axillary examination in breast cancer is subject to false-positive results, and is by itself insufficient justification for axillary lymph node dissection. If other means of preoperative assessment such as palpation- or image-guided fine needle aspiration are negative or indeterminate, then SLN biopsy deserves wider consideration as an alternative to routine axillary lymph node dissection in the clinically node-positive setting.\n \nAxillary nodal status is one of the most important prognostic factors in breast cancer. In the present study we used it to determine the predictors of axillary lymph node metastases in breast cancer and to determine if there is a group of patients in whom minimal axillary surgery is indicated. This article reports a retrospective study of 953 patients with T1 and T2 invasive breast carcinomas seen in the University Malaya Medical Centre between January 2001 and December 2005, where axillary dissection was done. Of the 953 patients, 283 (29.7%) had breast-conserving surgery, and the rest had mastectomies. In this series, 463 patients (48.6%) were younger than 50 years of age; 365 patients (38.3%) had lymph node involvement. The Malays tend to have more axillary node metastases (45.1%) than the Chinese (36.9%); however, there was no significant relationship between age and race and lymph node involvement. Some 23.9% of grade 1 cancers were node positive, compared to 42.9% of grade 2/3 cancers. Tumor size ranged from 0.2 cm to 5 cm; 55.5% of tumors were T2 (>2-5 cm). There were only 13 (1.4%) T1a tumors (>0.1-0.5 cm). Node involvement was documented in 7.7% of T1a tumors, 12.3% of T1b tumors (>0.5-1 cm), 29.2% of T1c tumors, and 48.2% of T2 tumors. In patients who had no lymphovascular invasion (LVI), 24.4% had axillary node metastases, compared with 52.2% of patients where LVI was reported. On univariate analysis, our study found that tumor diameter>2 cm, presence of lymphovascular invasion, and higher tumor grade (2&3) were factors significantly associated with a higher risk of nodal metastases. On multivariate analysis, however, only lymphovascular invasion and tumor size were independent predictors based on the logistic regression. In T1 tumors, axillary lymph node dissection will overtreat almost 75% of cases; therefore a sentinel lymph node biopsy is justified in these tumors. Sentinel lymph node biopsy has been shown to reduce the complications of formal axillary dissection, such as shoulder stiffness, pain, and lymphedema. In patients with T2 tumors, where almost 45% have lymph node involvement, sentinel node biopsy may not be cost effective.\n"}]}]}}

After a thorough history and physical examination, a retinal examination was performed by an ophthalmologist. If findings were positive, further investigation was undertaken to rule out systemic disorder or child abuse. One child was found with unilateral retinal haemorrhages following an episode of a simple febrile convulsion. A thorough investigation uncovered no other reason for this finding.

Patients (n = 408) who had previously received both dilated direct ophthalmoscopy by a diabetologist and retinal photography graded by a diabetologist within 3 months of each other were included. The results of the other screening modality were not available to the grader/screener. The first 308 patients were consecutive attendees at the clinic who fulfilled the study criteria and 100 were selected because they were identified as having potential STDED by either one of these modalities. An ophthalmologist using slit lamp biomicroscopy then examined patients identified with potential STDED. In 357 (88%) patients there was agreement between the two modalities about whether referral to an ophthalmologist was required (kappa 0.62). Retinal photography identified 38 patients for referral to ophthalmology which ophthalmoscopy missed. Of these, the ophthalmologist agreed that STDED was present in 32 (84%) and four patients required early laser. Ophthalmoscopy identified 13 patients for referral who were not identified by photography. Of these, the ophthalmologist agreed with the diabetologist that STDED was present in seven (54%) and one patient required early laser. Ophthalmoscopy may identify the occasional patient with diabetes who has STDED which is missed by retinal photography. For a systematic retinal screening programme, adding ophthalmoscopy to retinal photography will increase false-positive referrals and is likely to detect only a few extra patients requiring laser.\n"}]}]}}

This can be done either (i) acutely during the clamp study using high-dose insulin infusion, or (ii) slowly overnight preceding the clamp study using a low-dose insulin infusion. We assessed whether the choice of either of these methods to obtain euglycaemia biases subsequent assessment of glucose metabolism and insulin action. We studied seven obese Type 2 diabetic patients twice Basal plasma glucose levels (mean +/- sd) were 5.5 +/- 0.5 and 10.7 +/- 2.9 mmol/l in the + ON and - ON studies, respectively, and were clamped at -5.5 mmol/l. Basal rates of glucose production (GP) were similar in the + ON and - ON studies, 83 +/- 13 vs. 85 +/- 14 mg m-2 min-1 (NS), whereas basal rates of glucose disappearance (Rd) were lower in the + ON than in the - ON study, 84 +/- 8 vs. 91 +/- 11 mg m-2 min-1 (P = 0.02). During insulin infusion in the clamp period, rates of GP, 23 +/- 11 vs. 25 +/- 10 mg m-2 min-1, as well as rates of Rd, 133 +/- 32 vs. 139 +/- 37 mg m-2 min-1, were similar in the + ON and - ON studies, respectively (NS). Apart from basal rates of Rd, assessment of glucose turnover rates in euglycaemic clamp studies of Type 2 diabetic patients is not dependent on the method by which plasma glucose levels are lowered.\n"}]}]}}

Of these, physical mobility (P = 0.05), energy (P = 0.01), role functioning (P = 0.04), physical functioning (P = 0.03), and breathlessness (P = 0.02) were significant at baseline. However, at follow-up assessment there was no significant difference between patient groups nor did any consistent pattern emerge.

It is unclear whether HIV-infected individuals receive the same care for lung cancer as immunocompetent patients because of comorbidities, the potential for interaction between antiretroviral agents and cancer chemotherapy, and concerns regarding complications related to treatment or infection. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of HIV infection on receipt of guidance-concordant care, and its impact on overall survival among non-small cell lung cancer Medicare beneficiaries. The study design was a matched case-control design where each HIV patient was matched by age group, sex, race, and lung cancer stage at diagnosis with 20 controls randomly selected among those who were not HIV infected. The patients included in this study were Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer between 1998 and 2007, who qualified for Medicare on the basis of age and were 65 years of age or older at the time of lung cancer diagnosis. HIV infection status was based on Medicare claims data. A total of 174 HIV cases and 3480 controls were included in the analysis. Odds ratios for receiving guidance-concordant care and hazard ratios for overall survival were estimated. HIV infection was not independently associated with the receipt of guidance-concordant care. Among stage I/II patients, median survival times were 26 and 43 months, respectively, for those with and without HIV infection (odds ratio=1.48, P=0.021). HIV infection was not associated with receipt of guidance-concordant care but reduced survival in early-stage patients.\n"}]}]}}

Bone marrow chimeras were generated before inducing liver failure to trace bone marrow-derived cells.

Cellular hypertrophy was the predominant way of liver mass regeneration in models applying retrorsine. Retrorsine pretreatment did not affect sensitivity for carbon tetrachloride. A multilineage inflammatory infiltrate was observed in rats whether pretreated with retrorsine or not.

After risk adjustment, the variable \"individual hospital\" demonstrated the strongest association with likelihood for FTR (likelihood ratio=39.1; p<0.001). Overall risk-adjusted mortality, cardiac arrest, and FTR rates varied across hospitals and did not correlate. High-performing hospitals with lowest FTR rates accrued longer postoperative and intensive care unit stays after the index operation (2 to 3 days; p<0.001). Significant hospital variation exists in cardiac surgical mortality and FTR rates after cardiac arrest.

Childbirth significantly affects puerpera's physical, psychological and social domains of quality of life. Under the circumstance of increasing high caesarean section rate in rural China, the impact of delivery mode on postnatal quality of life remains unclear. Cross-sectional study design. Women residing in rural areas and in their 0-12 months after childbirth from 30 rural townships participated in a household survey. A structured questionnaire was used to evaluate women's socio-demographic characteristics, previous pregnant experiences, foetal characteristics and use of maternal health services. The scale for rural postnatal quality of life was adopted to assess postnatal quality of life from six dimensions The overall caeserean section rate was 70\u00b70% (962/1375), and most of them (59\u00b77%) were selected by maternal request. None of six dimensions and total score of quality of life displayed significant difference between women with normal delivery and cesaerean section. It was found that postnatal home visit related to good postnatal quality of life and lower husband education level, male gender of infant were associated with poor quality of life. Delivery mode did not affect postpartum quality of life in rural China. Socio-cultural determinants may contribute more in influencing postnatal quality of life. Null findings in impact of delivery mode on postpartum quality of life may cause more difficulties in maternal decision-making for vaginal delivery in rural China. The importance of postnatal home visit could justify available and quality postnatal care in improving postpartum quality of life. Further research needs to explore the effective prevention programmes, especially attention for parenting boys.\n \nTo evaluate the construct validity of the Turkish version of the EQ-5D in patients with acute coronary syndrome. The study was conducted as a cross-sectional study at the Trakya University Hospital between February and May 2008. All patients completed the Turkish version of the EQ-5D and MacNew heart-related quality of life scale. Construct validity of the EQ-5D was assessed according to relationships with MacNew subscales by using Spearman rank correlation and multiple linear regression analyses. One hundred and twenty-two patients responded to the instruments. Mean age was 62.9\u00b19.3 years and male gender (88 or 72.1%) was dominant. Mean score of the EQ-5D index was 0.79\u00b10.32, while the global score of MacNew was 5.01\u00b11.16. The correlation coefficients of the EQ-5D index score with the MacNew subscales ranged from 0.557 to 0.721, with EQ-5D VAS score ranging from 0.297 to 0.484 (p<0.001 for all of them). According to the stepwise regression model MacNew global score was found to be significantly effective factor on EQ-5D index score (\u03b2 =0.188; 95% CI The Turkish version of the EQ-5D-based utility score seems to be a valid instrument in the assessment of quality of life studies in patients with acute coronary syndrome.\n"}]}]}}

In most cases no abnormality is found. The main objective of this study was to explore the role of uterine natural killer (uNK) cells and their regulatory cytokine IL-15 in irregular bleeding in HT users. This was a prospective observational study conducted between 2002 and 2004. The study was conducted in a tertiary referral menopause clinic at King Edward Memorial Hospital, Western Australia. Patients included 117 postmenopausal women taking combined HT. Outpatient endometrial biopsies were taken during and outside bleeding episodes. The relationship between endometrial uNK cells (CD56+) and bleeding patterns was measured. We also addressed the impact of HT exposure on uNK cell populations, the relationship between endometrial IL-15 expression and uNK cell populations, and killer Ig like receptor genotype in subjects with irregular bleeding. Endometrial CD56+ uNK cells were significantly increased in biopsies obtained during bleeding episodes (P < 0.001), compared with HT users with no bleeding. The highest level of IL-15 expression was also seen in biopsies taken during bleeding. No clear relationship between killer Ig like receptor genotype and bleeding on HT was observed. Little is known about the mechanisms underlying irregular bleeding in HT users. This is the first report of uNK cells and their association with regulating cytokines in postmenopausal endometrium and demonstrates a possible mechanism by which HT may induce irregular bleeding.\n \nThe reported frequency of malignant or premalignant changes confined to endometrial polyps (EP) is 0.5-6%. The management of atypical endometrial hyperplasia (AEH) confined to EP is not yet established. Recently, an alternative pathological nomenclature has emerged using the term endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia (EIN) instead of atypia. The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety of conservative hysteroscopic resection of endometrial polyps with AEH or EIN. Retrospective cohort study of all cases of hysteroscopic resections of EP was performed at a single center between the years 2000-2011. All patients with a pathologic diagnosis of AEH in EP were included. A post-hoc revision of the pathologic specimens was made according to the EIN classification. Of the 32 patients with AEH in EP, 25 had normal endometrial curetting. Even with AEH confined to EP, 12 cases (48%) showed AEH (11 cases) or carcinoma (1 case) in the hysterectomy specimens. EIN in EP (14 cases) was correlated with 57% of diagnosis of EIN or carcinoma in the uterus; whereas in the absence of EIN in EP only 1 of 9 cases showed EIN in the final pathologic specimen (p=0.002), and none with carcinoma, which yields a PPV of 14% and a NPV of 100%. The diagnosis of EIN in EP may be a better predictor than AEH for endometrial involvement with malignant or pre-malignant neoplasms. The safety of conservative hysteroscopic resection of EP with AEH/EIN is questioned.\n"}]}]}}

We evaluated in both groups the complete disappearance of the cystic portion of the thyroid nodule on follow-up ultrasonography (first follow-up ultrasonography; mean, 4.6 months in group A; mean, 4.4 months in group B) (chi-square test), side effects or complications during and after the procedure (chi-square test), and the total procedure time (Student t test). Most patients showed complete disappearance of the cystic portion of the thyroid nodule (group A, n = 29; group B, n = 28), and they revealed no recurrence on follow-up ultrasonography. There was no statistical difference in the success rates between group A and group B (P > .05). Pain, the most common side effect, and other mild side effects or complications occurred in small numbers of patients in each group, but there was no significant difference in side effects or complications between the 2 groups (P > .05), except for intracystic hemorrhage (P < .05) and the complaint of all group B patients due to a double puncture (P < .001).

Percutaneous ethanol injection without aspiration of ethanol-mixed fluid seems to be the preferable method of treatment of benign cystic thyroid nodules from the perspective of both the physician and the patient.\n \nThyroid nodules are common, and of those biopsied by fine-needle aspiration (FNA), the majority will be benign colloid nodules (BCN). Current guidelines suggest these BCN should be followed by ultrasonographic examination (US) every 3 years, with no endpoint specified. This study evaluated if long-term follow-up of benign thyroid nodules was associated with change in treatment or improvement in diagnosing a missed malignancy compared with short-term follow-up. All patients with FNA-based diagnosis of BCN at our institution from 1998 to 2009 were identified. Patients observed after the diagnosis were divided into short-term follow-up (<3 years) and long-term follow-up (\u22653 years). Rates of repeat FNA, thyroidectomy, and malignancy detection were compared. Of 738 patients with BCN, 92 patients underwent thyroid resection after the initial US. Six hundred forty-six patients were observed, of which 366 returned for 1 or more follow-up US Long-term follow-up of patients with BCN is associated with increased repeat FNA and US without improvement in the malignancy detection rate.

It offers an excellent weight loss and resolution of comorbidities in the short term with a very low incidence of complications. However, the ever present risk of a staple line leak is still a major concern. Since 2005, data from obese patients that undergo bariatric procedures in Germany are prospectively registered in an online database and analyzed at the Institute of Quality Assurance in Surgical Medicine. For the current analysis, all patients that had undergone primary sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity within a 7-year period were considered. Using the GBSR, data from 5.400 LSGs were considered for analysis. Staple line leak rate decreased during the study period from 6.5 to 1.4 %. Male gender, higher BMI, concomitant sleep apnea, conversion to laparotomy, longer operation time, use of both buttresses and oversewing, and the occurrence of intraoperative complications were associated with a significantly higher leakage rate. On multivariate analysis, operation time and year of procedure only had a significant impact on staple line leak rate. The results of the current study demonstrated that there are factors that increase the risk of a leakage which would enable surgeons to define risk groups, to more carefully select patients, and to offer a closer follow-up during the postoperative course with early recognition and adequate treatment. All future efforts should be focused on a further reduction of serious complications to make the LSG a widely accepted and safer procedure.\n \nAnastomotic complications such as leakage and bleeding remain among the most serious complications of laparoscopic colorectal surgery. No perfect method exists for accurate and reliable avoidance of these catastrophes. This study aimed to study the usefulness of routine intraoperative endoscopy (RIOE) by comparing the surgical outcomes for RIOE patients with those for selective intraoperative endoscopy (SIOE) patients. A retrospective chart review was performed for consecutive patients who underwent elective laparoscopic colorectal resections with distal anastomosis between January 2004 and May 2007. One surgeon performed RIOE, whereas the other three surgeons performed SIOE as necessary. All the abnormalities of IOE patients were managed with a subsequent salvage procedure, and the postoperative outcomes were compared between the RIOE and SIOE groups. The study included 107 patients in the RIOE group and 137 patients in the SIOE group. Abnormalities were detected in 11 RIOE patients (10.3%) (six with staple line bleeding, three with positive air leak test results, and two with additional pathology identified). All but one abnormality was laparoscopically managed without conversion to laparotomy. Whereas one patient experienced postoperative staple line bleeding that required a second operation, the remaining 10 patients recovered uneventfully. The mean hospital stay was 6 days (range, 4-9) days. The RIOE group had overall rates of 0% for anastomotic leakage and 0.9% for staple line bleeding. Intraoperative endoscopies were performed for 30 (21.9%) of the 137 patients in the SIOE group. The postoperative outcomes comparison between the RIOE and SIOE groups showed a tendency toward more overall anastomotic complications (0.9% vs. 5.1%) in the SIOE group, which due to the small sample size did not translate into significant differences in terms of staple line bleeding and anastomotic leakage. There also were no significant differences in other outcomes such as ileus, abdominal or pelvic sepsis, reoperation, positive distal margin, distance from distal margins, length of hospital stay, or mortality. Routine IOE for patients undergoing elective laparoscopic colorectal surgery with distal anastomosis can detect abnormalities at or around the anastomosis. Although the RIOE group had fewer postoperative anastomotic complications, due to the small sample size, the 5.7-fold increase in anastomotic failure did not translate into significantly better postoperative outcomes than the SIOE group experienced. A larger-scale single or multicenter prospective randomized study or a metaanalysis including similar studies is necessary for further investigation of this issue.\n"}]}]}}

One hundred and eighty-two patients diagnosed between 1998 and 2002 as having chronic functional somatic symptoms and 182 controls matched by age, sex, socioeconomic status, and practice were included. Data on comorbidity, referrals, diagnostic tests, and hospital admissions over a period of 10 years prior to the diagnosis were collected. Medication use and number of visits to the general practitioner (GP) were extracted from the moment computerised registration was started. In the 10 years before the diagnosis of chronic functional somatic symptoms, significantly more patients than controls presented functional somatic symptoms in at least two body systems, and used more somatic and psychotropic drugs. They visited the GP twice as much, statistically had significantly more psychiatric morbidity, and were referred more often to mental health workers and somatic specialists. The number of patients undergoing diagnostic tests was higher for patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms than for controls, but hospital admissions rates were equal. Patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms have a great diversity of functional somatic symptoms. They use more somatic and psychotropic drugs than controls in the years before diagnosis. Moreover, they show high rates of referrals and psychiatric morbidity. The diversity of symptoms of patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms supports the concept that symptoms do not cluster in well defined distinct syndromes.

In this way the effect of the admission period on various problems was determined. In 2011 there were 139 admissions to the MPU with a wide variation of somatic and psychiatric diagnoses. The average admission period was 9 days. Global clinical evaluation of the treatment goals set for somatic and psychiatric conditions showed that more than 90% and 85% of the treatment goals, respectively, were completely achieved. HoNOS scores showed a reduction in severity of both psychiatric and somatic problems. The total HoNOS-core was significantly reduced by nearly 3.5 points - a large effect size. The MPU has succeeded in its goal to deliver integral care to a very diverse group of patients with somatic and psychiatric co-morbidities. It is able to offer care to a vulnerable patient group in which it can be presumed that treatment on a non-integrated unit could not have been delivered or not delivered adequately, due to the complexity of their somatic and behavioural problems.\n"}]}]}}

Incomplete bladder emptying may be related to bladder-sphincter dyssynergia. Ultrasonography and uroflowmetry are used in the initial evaluation of many children with voiding dysfunction. We determine in children with voiding dysfunction whether incomplete bladder emptying has an important role in the pathogenesis of urinary tract infections and whether abnormal ultrasonography or uroflowmetry can predict which children are at increased risk of recurrent UTIs. In this retrospective cohort study charts of 148 consecutive patients diagnosed with voiding dysfunction were reviewed for information regarding residual urine volumes on initial post-void ultrasound and the number of urinary tract infections on followup. Initial uroflowmetry curves were blindly reevaluated for this study. Considerable (greater than 10% predicted) post-void residual urine volumes were seen on 15% of ultrasounds, and 78% of uroflowmetry studies were characterized as abnormal. The volume of residual urine (corrected for age) showed a positive correlation with the number of UTIs occurring after the initial visit (r = 0.3, p <0.002). There was no correlation between an abnormal uroflow pattern and number of subsequent UTIs. Although increased residual urine on post-void ultrasound increases the risk of UTI recurrence in children with voiding dysfunction, it does not allow accurate identification of specific children at risk.\n \nTo determine the relationship between obesity and febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) in young children. We reviewed all medical records of children aged\u00a0<3\u00a0years who visited our institution for febrile\u00a0UTIs and infant national health checkups (controls) between January 2008 and February 2012. All subjects were subcategorized into 3 groups of lean, overweight, and obese using weight-for-length measurements. The effect of obesity on UTI risk was evaluated and odds ratios were calculated. We analyzed 465 patients with UTIs and 812 controls. The proportion of overweight and obese children was higher in patients with UTIs (22.8%) and acute pyelonephritis (APN; 31.1%) compared with those in the control (11.7%; P\u00a0<.05). After adjusting for age and gender, the odds ratio (OR) of UTI in obese relative to lean children was 1.84 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-3.05) and that of APN was 2.43 (95% CI, 1.27-4.62). The OR of APN in overweight relative to lean children was 1.96 (95% CI, 1.11-3.46). After adjusting for age, the OR of APN in obese relative to lean boys was 2.74 (95% CI, 1.11-6.77) and that in overweight to lean girls was 2.48 (95% CI, 1.05-5.83). Within patients with UTIs, compared with lean children, the obese showed a longer duration of fever and a higher frequency of APN and the overweight had a higher incidence of hydronephrosis (P\u00a0<.05). Obesity may be associated with higher odds of a febrile UTI and APN in young children.\n"}]}]}}

The objective of this study was to analyze the change in the health of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Part A (hospital insurance) between 2008 and 2010 by comparing the prevalence of 11 chronic conditions. We conducted descriptive analyses using the 2008 and 2010 Chronic Conditions Public Use Files, which are newly available from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and have administrative (claims) data on 100% of the Medicare fee-for-service population. We examined the data by age, sex, and dual eligibility (eligibility for both Medicare and Medicaid). Medicare Part A beneficiaries had more chronic conditions on average in 2010 than in 2008. The percentage increase in the average number of chronic conditions was larger for dual-eligible beneficiaries (2.8%) than for nondual-eligible beneficiaries (1.2%). The prevalence of some chronic conditions, such as congestive heart failure, ischemic heart disease, and stroke/transient ischemic attack, decreased. The deterioration of average health was due to other chronic conditions Analyzing the prevalence of 11 chronic conditions by using Medicare claims data provides a monitoring tool that can guide health care providers and policy makers in devising strategies to address chronic conditions and rising health care costs.\n \nDiagnostic imaging services have been repeatedly targeted as a source of excess health care expenditure. In particular, MRI is considered a high-tech and high-cost imaging service that saw rapid increases in utilization in the early 2000s. However, the most recent trends in the utilization of MR are not known. The aim of this study was to quantify trends in MR utilization overall and by body system from 1998 to 2010 in the Medicare population. Medicare Part B data sets were obtained for 1998 to 2010 for all MR examinations performed in the Medicare population. Using Current Procedural Terminology codes, the total volume and utilization rates of all MR examinations were tabulated for each year of the study period. MR volume was then categorized by body system. The utilization rate of MR examinations in the Medicare population was 73 per 1,000 beneficiaries in 1998, increased to a peak of 189 in 2008, and decreased to 183 in 2010. The compound annual growth rate from 1998 to 2008 was 10%. The utilization rate in 2010 represents a decrease of 3.1% from the 2009 utilization rate. The most frequently imaged body section in every year was the head, which accounted for 2,404,250 examinations in 2010, 37.3% of all MR examinations in that year. The overall MRI utilization rate sharply increased from 1998 until 2008 but then decreased in each of the next 2 years. A similar trend was noted for MR examinations performed in most body sections. These trends are likely to be the result of a number of possible causative factors.\n"}]}]}}

The three midwife obstetric units (MOUs) in a health district of Mpumalanga were included in the study. Two MOUs enrolled in the PEP and the third did not. A 'before-and-after' study design was used to assess any changes in practice, and to monitor whether any changes occurred in the district during the time of the study; data were also collected at the third MOU. Data were collected by scoring of the obstetric files after the patient had delivered. We ascertained whether the obstetric history, syphilis testing, blood group testing, haemoglobin measurement and uterine growth assessment were performed during antenatal care along with whether appropriate action was taken. For intrapartum care, estimation of fetal weight, the performance of pelvimetry, blood pressure monitoring, urine testing, evaluation of head above pelvis, fetal heart rate monitoring, monitoring of contractions and plotting of cervical dilatation, and whether the appropriate actions were taken, were assessed. Eight of the 13 midwives at the two MOUs completed the PEP and all demonstrated an improvement in knowledge. Case notes of 303 patients from the various clinics were studied. There was no change in the referral patterns of any of the clinics during the study period. The obstetric history was well documented, but in no group was there a satisfactory response to a detected problem; appropriate action was taken in between 0% and 12% of cases. Syphilis testing was performed in 56-82% of cases, with no difference between the groups. The haemoglobin level was measured in only 4-15% of patients, with no difference before or after completion of the PEP. Where a problem in uterine growth was detected, an appropriate response occurred in 0-8% of patients and no difference before or after completion of the PEP was ascertained. In all groups, estimation of fetal weight and pelvimetry were seldom performed, the urine and fetal heart rate documentation were moderately well done and the blood pressure monitoring, assessment of head above pelvis, monitoring of contractions and plotting of cervical dilatation were usually performed. No differences before or after the PEP were detected. Where problems were detected, appropriate actions taken during labour improved, but not significantly. Completion of the obstetric manual of the PEP improved the knowledge of the midwives but no alteration in practice was detected.\n \nThe aims of the study were to find out the maternal and perinatal outcome of early onset severe preeclampsia (PE) in a tertiary care center in a developing country like India and to determine whether expectant management in such a setup improves the perinatal outcome. It was a retrospective study. All women with early PE were admitted stabilized and evaluated. Expectant management was given whenever there was no indication for eminent delivery. The perinatal outcome of the expectant group was compared with that of the aggressive group, and appropriate statistical analysis was carried out. A total of 106 women were admitted with severe PE, 61 were treated aggressively, and 45 were stable enough to receive expectant management. The total days gained on expectant management was 7 days. Perinatal mortality was 31.13%. Perinatal outcome of the expectant and aggressive management groups did not differ (P = 0.141); there was no increase in maternal complications on expectant management. There were 2 cases of maternal mortality in the aggressively managed group. Perinatal mortality in severe PE is high. There was no increase in maternal morbidity on expectant management; however, there was no difference in perinatal mortality on expectant management.\n"}]}]}}

A total of 1369 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer underwent radical prostatectomy by a single surgeon between 1991 and 2001. A subset of 203 patients (14.9%), who had undergone at least one prior benign prostate biopsy for a rising prostate-specific antigen and/or abnormal digital rectal examination, constituted our study population. A total of 1115 patients with no prior biopsy represented our control group. After prostatectomy, patients were evaluated at 6-month intervals for biochemical evidence of recurrence, defined as a prostate-specific antigen level of 0.5 ng/mL or greater. Patients with a prior benign biopsy had more favorable pathologic features with more organ-confined (74% versus 64%; P <0.001) and less margin-positive (9.8% versus 18%) disease. Only 24 patients (12%) in the study group (versus 20% in control group; P = 0.01) had eventual evidence of biochemical failure. Kaplan-Meier analyses suggested that patients with prior benign biopsies have improved biochemical disease-free survival, especially for those with more aggressive disease (Gleason sum 7 or greater; P <0.01). Overall, patients in the study group had lower probability (odds ratio 0.57, P <0.001) of biochemical failure compared with those in the control group.

Study 1. We recruited 24 patients awaiting standard 12-core TRUS-guided biopsies of the prostate to undergo PHS immediately beforehand. We compared PHS with the TRUS-guided biopsy results in terms of their ability to detect cancer within the whole prostate and to localize it to the correct side and to the correct region of the prostate. Lesions that were suspicious on PHS were biopsied separately. Study 2. We recruited 57 patients awaiting TTB to have PHS beforehand. We compared PHS with the TTB pathology results in terms of their ability to detect prostate cancer within the whole gland and to localize it to the correct side and to the correct sextant of the prostate. Study 3. We recruited 24 patients awaiting radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer to undergo preoperative PHS. We compared PHS with standardized pathological analysis of the whole-mount prostatectomy specimens in terms of their measurement of total tumour volume within the prostate, tumour volume within prostate sextants and volume of index lesions identified by PHS. The PHS-targeted biopsies had an overall cancer detection rate of 38.1%, compared with 62.5% with standard TRUS-guided biopsies. The sensitivity and specificity of PHS for localizing tumour to the correct prostate sextant, compared with standard TRUS-guided biopsies, were 100 and 5.9%, respectively. The PHS-targeted biopsies had an overall cancer detection rate of 13.4% compared with 54.4% for standard TTB. PHS had a sensitivity and specificity for cancer detection in the posterior gland of 100 and 13%, respectively, and for the anterior gland, 6 and 82%, respectively. We found no correlation between total tumour volume estimates from PHS and radical prostatectomy pathology (Pearson correlation coefficient -0.096). Sensitivity and specificity of PHS for detecting tumour foci \u22650.2\u2009mL in volume were 63 and 53%. These three independent studies in 105 patients suggest that PHS does not reliably identify and characterize prostate cancer in the routine clinical setting.\n"}]}]}}

Between 1990 and 2004, 89 patients (49 male and 40 female) each with a pulmonary hydatid cyst were treated surgically. The patients were divided into two groups based on whether capitonnage was carried out (group 1, n = 44) or not (group 2, n = 45). Cystotomy and the closure of the bronchial openings were carried out in both groups. The results were assessed in two groups during a 1 year follow-up period. The groups were comparable with regards to their clinical, operative and demographic characteristics. There was no mortality, and no significant difference in hospitalisation time between the two groups. It was 8.2 +/- 3.2 days for group 1 and 8 +/- 3.1 days for group 2 (P = 0.89). The most serious complications were restricted bronchopleural fistula (only one patient in group 2), empyema (only one patient in group 1 and two patients in group 2), and prolonged air leak (five patients in group 1 and six patients in group 2).

The purposes of this study were to (1) explore predictive factors of functional level at discharge, (2) evaluate 1-year mortality after hip fracture compared with that of the general population, and (3) evaluate the affect of early functional outcome on 1-year mortality in patients operated on for hip fractures. A total of 228 consecutive patients (average age, 77.6 \u00b1 7.4 years) with hip fractures who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled in an open, prospective, observational cohort study. Functional level at discharge was measured with the motor Functional Independence Measure (FIM) score, which is the most widely accepted functional assessment measure in use in the rehabilitation community. Mortality rates in the study population were calculated in absolute numbers and as the standardized mortality ratio. Multivariate regression analysis was used to explore predictive factors for motor FIM score at discharge and for 1-year mortality adjusted for important baseline variables. Age, health status, cognitive level, preinjury functional level, and pressure sores after hip fracture surgery were independently related to lower discharge motor FIM scores. At 1-year followup, 57 patients (25%; 43 women and 14 men) had died. The 1-year hip fracture mortality rate compared with that of the general population was 31% in our population versus 7% for men and 23% in our population versus 5% for women 65 years or older. The 1-year standardized mortality rate was 341.3 (95% CI, 162.5-520.1) for men and 301.6 (95% CI, 212.4-391.8) for women, respectively. The all-cause mortality rate observed in this group was higher in all age groups and in both sexes when compared with the all-cause age-adjusted mortality of the general population. Motor FIM score at discharge was the only independent predictor of 1-year mortality after hip fracture. Functional level at discharge is the main determinant of long-term mortality in patients with hip fracture. Motor FIM score at discharge is a reliable predictor of mortality and can be recommended for clinical use.\n"}]}]}}

The majority of patients did not return into mental health care (86\u00a0%). Patients with a shorter duration of treatment (5-250\u00a0min; 251-500\u00a0min and 751-1000\u00a0min) were slightly more likely to return (reference group The results suggest that a longer duration of treatment may prevent return into mental health care in some groups. However, because of the design of the study, no causal inference can be drawn. Further research, preferably in a RCT, is needed to determine whether the trend towards lower intensity treatments is associated with repeated mental health care use.\n"}]}]}}

One mechanism proposed for this association is that green space provides a venue for, and therefore encourages, physical activity. It has also been suggested that socio-economic health inequalities may be narrower in greener areas because of the equalised opportunity for physical activity green spaces provide. However, research exploring associations between the availability of green space and physical activity has produced mixed results. Limits to the assessment of the type and amount of physical activity which occurs specifically in green space may account for these mixed findings. This observational study was therefore concerned with the extent to which green space is a venue for physical activity and whether this could account for narrower socio-economic health inequalities in greener neighbourhoods. Secondary analysis of cross sectional data on 3679 adults (16+) living in urban areas across Scotland matched with a neighbourhood level measure of green space availability. Associations between green space availability and both total physical activity, and activity specifically within green space, were explored using logistic regression models. Interactions between socio-economic position and physical activity were assessed. All models adjusted for age, sex and household income. The availability of green space in a neighbourhood was not associated with total physical activity or that specifically in green space. There was no evidence that income-related inequalities in physical activity within green space were narrower in greener areas of Scotland. Physical activity may not be the main mechanism explaining the association between green space and health in Scotland. The direct effect of perceiving a natural environment on physiological and psychological health may offer an alternative explanation.\n"}]}]}}

The aim of the present study was to describe the prevalence and severity of FI among nursing home residents, and to investigate factors associated with FI. This was a cross-sectional study conducted in nursing homes in Ostrava, Czech Republic. Demographics and comorbidities were extracted from medical records of nursing homes. Data regarding incontinence were obtained via face-to-face interviews with residents or extracted from registered nurses' accounts (regarding residents with severe cognitive impairment). In total, 588 nursing home residents were enrolled into the study. FI was noted in 336 (57.1%) participating residents. The majority of FI residents (57.8%) reported FI episodes several times a week; daily FI episodes were found in 22.9% of the FI residents. The mean Cleveland Clinic Incontinence Score in FI residents was 17.2\u00b11.8 (mean\u00b1SD). Factors associated with FI (statistically significant) were poor general health status (\u22654 comorbidities), urinary incontinence, cognitive-function impairment (dementia), decreased mobility, and length of nursing home residency. There was no association between FI and age, sex, body mass index, or living with/without a partner. Our data indicate that FI is still a serious health problem-FI currently affects more than half of the nursing home residents in Ostrava, Czech Republic. The study outcomes (revealed high prevalence and seriousness of FI) emphasize the importance of close monitoring and appropriately managing FI in nursing home residents.\n \nThe Tokyo guidelines for diagnostic criteria and severity assessment of acute cholecystitis (AC), published in 2007, recommend early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (ELC) be done as soon as possible after the onset of symptoms. We conducted this study to analyze the changes in the therapeutic strategy for AC in a surgical center in Tunisia after the Tokyo guidelines were published. Between January, 2005 and January, 2013, 649 patients underwent cholecystectomy for AC at the Department of Surgery, Mohamed Tahar Maamouri Hospital in Nabeul, Tunisia. The study period was subdivided into before (n\u00a0=\u00a0192) and after (n\u00a0=\u00a0457) the publication of the Tokyo guidelines, that is, prior to and including 2007, and from 2008 onward, respectively. We reviewed patient records retrospectively to collect demographic data, biochemical data, radiological findings, and postoperative outcomes. All these factors were compared between the groups. The duration of symptoms before surgery was significantly longer before 2008 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.018). ELC was significantly more frequent after 2008 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). Laparoscopic surgery was converted to open surgery in 16.1\u00a0% of patients before 2008 vs. 7.8\u00a0% of patients after 2008 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). There were no significant differences in bile duct injury or postoperative complications between the groups. The length of preoperative, postoperative, and total hospital stay was longer before 2008. ELC is a safe and effective therapeutic strategy for AC. The Tokyo guidelines resulted in a significant increase in the number of ELCs being performed and significantly reduced preoperative and total hospital stay without increasing intra- and postoperative complications. Importantly, ELC reduced medical costs, which is crucial for a country with limited resources, such as Tunisia.\n"}]}]}}

Using koilocytosis as a marker, the rate of \"active\" cervical lesions was compared with the rate of \"non active\" cervical lesions in patients with \"active\" versus \"non active\" vaginal lesions. Finally, the rates of mild and severe cervical lesions were compared among each group of VAIN (low-grade, high-grade, with or without koilocytosis). In patients with mild vaginal lesions, mild cervical lesions were significantly more frequent than severe cervical lesions. In patients with \"active\" vaginal lesions the rate of \"active\" cervical lesions was significantly higher than \"non active\" cervical lesions.

Women undergoing a hysterectomy for the above indication at the Northern Gynaecological Cancer Centre over a period of 10 years (1992-2001) were identified from a prospectively collected database. Case notes were then reviewed and women undergoing hysterectomy for other indications were excluded. Relevant demographic and clinical data were then extracted. 33 patients meeting the above criteria were identified. The overall hysterectomy rate for this indication was 0.73%. 20 out of the 33 women had significant pathology on the hysterectomy specimen. 95% of these had high-grade disease with one having a Stage 1A1 squamous carcinoma. None of the patients required more radical treatment than a simple hysterectomy. There were no major complications following the hysterectomy. Positive endocervical margins on the previous loop specimen (P = 0.05) was an important correlating factor predicting the presence of CIN on the hysterectomy specimen. One out of the thirty hysterectomies (3.3%) performed using the vaginal route had incomplete excision compared to one of three (33%) using the abdominal route. Hysterectomy was successful in treating 85.2% of the women; only 4 women subsequently developed vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia. Simple hysterectomy appears to be a suitable diagnostic and treatment option for women with recurrent high-grade cytological abnormalities where further loop treatment is technically not possible. Incomplete excision at the endocervical margin on the previous loop specimen was the main factor associated with the presence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia at hysterectomy.\n"}]}]}}

Conventional screening criteria are too limiting and exclude suitable heart donors. Echocardiography is now widely available and is a reliable tool to assess left ventricular dysfunction in brain-dead donors. Yet few data are available on the degree of left ventricular dysfunction where a transplantation is possible. Fifty-five potential brain-dead heart donors (age 38 +/- 11 years) were prospectively evaluated by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) before harvesting. Fractional area change (FAC) was used to assess left ventricular function in potential brain-dead donors. Transplanted hearts were evaluated on the fifth postoperative day. The transplantation was considered a success if the recipient was alive, not retransplanted, without an assistance device or an epinephrine infusion of more than 1 mg/h and showed an ejection fraction above 40%. Of the 55 potential heart donors, 20 exhibited an FAC of less than 50%. Forty hearts were harvested, 36 of which were successfully transplanted. Nine patients had an FAC below 50% (group H2) and 27 had an FAC over 50% (group H1). Four patients died TEE is useful to assess left ventricular function in potential brain-dead donors. An FAC less than 50% is present in 36% of potential heart donors. Because left ventricular dysfunction is often reversible shortly after transplantation, an FAC below 50% may not necessarily preclude the use of hearts for transplantation.\n \nPatients presenting with stroke or transient cerebral ischemic episodes often undergo transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) as part of their initial evaluation. Previous studies have demonstrated that TEE is superior to transthoracic echocardiography for the detection of potential cardiac sources of embolism. In our institution, this scenario now represents the most frequent reason for requesting TEE. For the most part, these TEE examinations are ordered by a neurologist, and transthoracic echocardiography is not performed beforehand. Over a 2-year period, TEE was requested for 137 patients at our institution for the evaluation of a cerebral ischemic event. The complete hospital chart was available for review in 106 of these patients, and they form the study group. All patients underwent TEE using either a biplane or omniplane transducer, with Doppler color flow imaging and saline contrast administration performed in every case. Studies were reviewed for the presence of possible cardiac or aortic sources of cerebral emboli, and hospital charts were reviewed to collect clinical information. A potential cardiovascular embolic source was detected in 35% of patients. Abnormalities were discovered in 53% (16/30) of patients with atrial fibrillation vs 28% (21/76) of patients in sinus rhythm (P < .001). Both patients who had left atrial thrombus and 12 of 13 with left atrial spontaneous contrast had atrial fibrillation (P < .001). Protruding aortic atherosclerotic debris was the most frequent abnormality among patients in sinus rhythm. It may not be cost-effective to perform TEE as a routine diagnostic procedure in patients presenting with cerebral ischemic events. Most patients with atrial fibrillation are candidates for empiric warfarin sodium therapy, and patients in sinus rhythm usually have findings for which there is no recommended therapy or for which only aspirin is indicated.\n"}]}]}}

Group 2 received a 1 mg/kg dose of 0.9% sodium chloride by the intraperitoneal route for 10 min before pneumoperitoneum. Groups 3 and 4 received 6 and 12 mg/kg edaravone, respectively, by the intraperitoneal route for 10 min before pneumoperitoneum. After 60 min of pneumoperitoneum, the gas was deflated. Immediately after the reperfusion period, both ovaries were excised for histological scoring, caspase-3 immunohistochemistry and biochemical evaluation including glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. Also, total antioxidant capacity (TAC) was measured in plasma samples to evaluate the antioxidant effect of edaravone. Ovarian sections in the saline group revealed higher scores for follicular degeneration and edema (p < 0.0001) when compared with the sham group. Administration of different doses of edaravone in rats significantly prevented degenerative changes in the ovary (p < 0.0001). Caspase-3 expression was only detected in the ovarian surface epithelium in all groups, and there was a significant difference between the treatment groups and the saline group (p < 0.0001). Treatment of rats with edaravone reduced caspase-3 expression in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, biochemical measurements of oxidative stress markers (MDA, GSH and TAC) revealed that prophylactic edaravone treatment attenuated oxidative stress induced by I/R injury.

The present study was conducted at Dumlupinar University Medical Faculty and a total of 28 Sprague-Dawley rats were included. The experimental animals were allocated into four groups having seven rats each. Groups 1 and 2 served as controls, where the rats in Group 1 did not receive any intervention and Group 2 received intravaginal saline. Groups 3 and 4 received intravaginal or perineal talc application, respectively. Talc was applied for 3 months on a daily basis. Histopathological changes in the peritoneum and female genital system were evaluated. For statistical analyses, Fisher's exact test was carried out using SPSS. In both the groups exposed to talc (Groups 3 and 4), evidence of foreign body reaction and infection, along with an increase in inflammatory cells, were found in all the genital tissues. Genital infection was observed in 12 rats in the study group and 2 rats in the control group. Neoplastic change was not found. However, there was an increase in the number of follicles in animals exposed to talc. No peritoneal change was observed. In the groups not exposed to talc, similar infectious findings were found, but there was a statistically significant difference between the groups (Groups 1 and 2 vs. Groups 3 and 4, P > 0.05). Neoplastic change was also not observed in these groups. Four groups were compared in terms of neoplastic effects and infections. In Groups 1, 5 rats were normal, two developed vulvovaginitis and endometritis with overinfection (in both ovaries), and one developed salpingitis (in both fallopian tubes), that is, infection was found in a total of two rats. In Group 2, only one experimental animal had endometritis. All the animals in Groups 3 and 4 developed infections. Talc has unfavorable effects on the female genital system.

The lace plant (Aponogeton madagascariensis) produces perforations in its leaves through PCD. The leaves of the plant consist of a latticework of longitudinal and transverse veins enclosing areoles. PCD occurs in the cells at the center of these areoles and progresses outwards, stopping approximately five cells from the vasculature. The role of mitochondria during PCD has been recognized in animals; however, it has been less studied during PCD in plants. The following paper elucidates the role of mitochondrial dynamics during developmentally regulated PCD in vivo in A. madagascariensis. A single areole within a window stage leaf (PCD is occurring) was divided into three areas based on the progression of PCD; cells that will not undergo PCD (NPCD), cells in early stages of PCD (EPCD), and cells in late stages of PCD (LPCD). Window stage leaves were stained with the mitochondrial dye MitoTracker Red CMXRos and examined. Mitochondrial dynamics were delineated into four categories (M1-M4) based on characteristics including distribution, motility, and membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m). A TUNEL assay showed fragmented nDNA in a gradient over these mitochondrial stages. Chloroplasts and transvacuolar strands were also examined using live cell imaging. The possible importance of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) formation during PCD was indirectly examined via in vivo cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment. This treatment resulted in lace plant leaves with a significantly lower number of perforations compared to controls, and that displayed mitochondrial dynamics similar to that of non-PCD cells. Results depicted mitochondrial dynamics in vivo as PCD progresses within the lace plant, and highlight the correlation of this organelle with other organelles during developmental PCD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of mitochondria and chloroplasts moving on transvacuolar strands to form a ring structure surrounding the nucleus during developmental PCD. Also, for the first time, we have shown the feasibility for the use of CsA in a whole plant system. Overall, our findings implicate the mitochondria as playing a critical and early role in developmentally regulated PCD in the lace plant.\n \nThe hypothesis was tested that pectin content and methylation degree participate in regulation of cell wall mechanical properties and in this way may affect tissue growth and freezing resistance over the course of plant cold acclimation and de-acclimation. Experiments were carried on the leaves of two double-haploid lines of winter oil-seed rape (Brassica napus subsp. oleifera), differing in winter survival and resistance to blackleg fungus (Leptosphaeria maculans). Plant acclimation in the cold (2 degrees C) brought about retardation of leaf expansion, concomitant with development of freezing resistance. These effects were associated with the increases in leaf tensile stiffness, cell wall and pectin contents, pectin methylesterase (EC 3.1.1.11) activity and the low-methylated pectin content, independently of the genotype studied. However, the cold-induced modifications in the cell wall properties were more pronounced in the leaves of the more pathogen-resistant genotype. De-acclimation promoted leaf expansion and reversed most of the cold-induced effects, with the exception of pectin methylesterase activity. The results show that the temperature-dependent modifications in pectin content and their methyl esterification degree correlate with changes in tensile strength of a leaf tissue, and in this way affect leaf expansion ability and its resistance to freezing and to fungus pathogens.\n"}]}]}}

In this study, visual acuity measured with the Snellen E was compared to the Landolt C acuity. 100 patients (age 8 - 90 years, median 60.5 years) with various eye disorders, among them 39 with amblyopia due to strabismus, and 13 healthy volunteers were tested.

However, few data are available to assess the adequacy of the use of drugs and its influence on the control of asthma in 'real life'. The adequacy of the current use of anti-asthmatic medication according to the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines was assessed in a random sample of 400 asthmatics identified in the frame of the Italian Study on Asthma in Young Adults. Asthma severity was assessed using the GINA criteria; accordingly, a patient was classified as receiving inadequate treatment if his/her current use of drugs was lower than that suggested by the guidelines for the corresponding severity level. The absence of asthma attacks in the last 3 months was used as an indicator of the disease control. Fifty-five percent of the patients had persistent asthma. Overall, 48% (95% CI 41.2-54.8) of persistent asthmatics were receiving inadequate treatment, and 66% (95% CI 59.5-72.4) had not used their medication daily over the past 3 months. Persistent asthmatics who were inadequately treated had a significantly greater frequency of asthma attacks (geometric mean ratio 3.7; 95% CI 2.1-6.6) than those using an adequate dose of medication. Mild and moderate persistent asthmatics using an adequate medication regimen reported a low number of asthma attacks (median 0). At the multivariate analysis, a good control of the disease was positively associated with an adequate dose of anti-inflammatory medication (OR = 2.2; 95% CI 1.1-4.5) and was negatively associated with a later onset of asthma (OR = 0.96; 95% CI 0.93-0.99) and severe asthma (OR = 0.37; 95% CI 0.17-0.81). Despite the increase in the use of inhaled corticosteroids, half of the persistent asthmatics from the general population are using a medication regimen below their severity level. When the use of drugs follows the GINA guideline recommendations, a good control of asthma is also achievable in the daily management of the disease, particularly in the case of mild and moderate asthmatics.\n \nPassive smoking is a major cause of respiratory morbidity in children. However, few studies give accurate estimates of the health effects of passive smoking in children with asthma using an objective measure of exposure. The effects of passive smoking using salivary cotinine levels to measure exposure were investigated. A sample of 438 children aged 2-12 years with asthma who had a parent who smoked were recruited in Tayside and Fife, Scotland. Health service contacts for asthma, assessed from GP case records, were used as a proxy for morbidity. A weak U-shaped relationship was found between the salivary cotinine level and health service contacts for asthma High levels of parental smoking in the home are associated with a reduction in health care contacts for asthma. This could be due to a lack of awareness of asthma symptoms among heavy smokers or a reluctance to visit the GP. Children with asthma who have parents who smoke heavily may not be receiving adequate management.\n"}]}]}}

This study examined the long-term outcome of TERPT versus conventional transabdominal (ABD) pull-through for HD. Records of 41 patients more than 3 years old who underwent a pull-through for HD (TERPT, n = 20; ABD, n = 21) were reviewed, and their families were thoroughly interviewed and scored via a 15-item post-pull-through long-term outcome questionnaire. Patients were operated on between the years 1995 and 2003. During this time, our group transitioned from the ABD to the TERPT technique. Total scoring ranged from 0 to 40 Overall scores were similar. However, continence score was significantly better in the ABD group, and the stool pattern score was better in the TERPT group. A significant difference in age at interview between the 2 groups was noted; we therefore reanalyzed the data controlling for age, and this showed that age did not significantly affect the long-term scoring outcome between groups. Our long-term study showed significantly better (2-fold) results regarding the continence score for the abdominal approach compared with the transanal pull-through. The stool pattern and enterocolitis scores were somewhat better for the TERPT group. These findings raise an important issue about the current surgical management of HD; however, more cases will need to be studied before a definitive conclusion can be drawn.\n \nTo examine the progress of the airway obstruction over time in children with cerebral palsy (CP) and the timing of any interventions. The medical notes of patients with CP younger than 16 years admitted with airway obstruction to a tertiary referral Pediatric Otolaryngology Center from 2006 to 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. The gender, age of referral, co-morbidities, type of surgical intervention and age this was performed and the time interval between sequential surgeries were documented. Fifteen children with CP and airway obstruction were admitted, eight boys and seven girls with an average age of referral 8 years (range 3-13.3 years). Adenotonsillectomy was performed in 11/15 patients at a mean age of 9.1 years (range 4.5-14 years). Tracheostomy was performed in 8/15 children at an average age of 11.6 years (range 7.5-15 years). Seven out of 11 patients having undergone adenotonsillectomy, required tracheostomy after an average time interval of 1.9 years (range 0.5-3.5 years). Tracheostomy was performed in 80% of referred patients with CP older than 10 years, while surgical intervention was uncommon in children younger than 5 years. There was a statistically significant correlation between the age of the children and the performance of a tracheostomy (Pearson's correlation coefficient 0.68, p = 0.005). The severity of the airway obstruction in children with CP tends to increase with age. We postulate that this increase results from worsening hypotonia of pharyngeal musculature. Children with CP and severe upper airway obstruction are likely to require tracheostomy as they grow older.\n"}]}]}}

Relatively little attention has been paid to whether the sex of the physician affects the rates of cancer screening among women. We examined differences between male and female physicians in the frequency of screening mammograms and Pap smears among women patients enrolled in a large Midwestern health plan. We identified claims for mammography and Pap tests submitted by primary care physicians for 97,962 women, 18 to 75 years of age, who were enrolled in the health plan in 1990. The sex of the physician was manually coded, and the physician's age was obtained from the state licensing board. After identifying a principal physician for each woman, we calculated the frequency of mammography and Pap smears for each physician, using the number of women in his or her practice during 1990 as the denominator. Using unconditional logistic regression, we also calculated the odds ratio of having a Pap smear or mammogram for women patients with female physicians as compared with those with male physicians, controlling for the physician's and the patient's age. Crude rates for Pap smears and mammography were higher for the patients of female than male physicians in most age groups of physicians. The largest differences between female and male physicians were in the rates of Pap smears among the youngest physicians. For the subgroup of women enrolled in the health plan for a year who saw only one physician, after adjustment for the patient's age and the physician's age and specialty, the odds ratio for having a Pap smear was 1.99 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.72 to 2.30) for the patients of female physicians as compared with those of male physicians. For women 40 years old and older, the odds ratio for having a mammogram was 1.41 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.22 to 1.63). For both Pap smears and mammography, the differences between female and male physicians in screening rates were much more pronounced in internal medicine and family practice than in obstetrics and gynecology. Women are more likely to undergo screening with Pap smears and mammograms if they see female rather than male physicians, particularly if the physician is an internist or family practitioner.\n \nFew studies have explored health care market structure and colorectal cancer (CRC) screening test use, and little is known whether market factors contribute to racial/ethnic screening disparities. We investigated whether HMO market level factors, controlling for individual covariates, differentially impact Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) subjects' access to CRC screening compared with white subjects. We used random intercept hierarchical models to predict CRC test use. Individual-level survey data was linked to market data by metropolitan statistical areas from InterStudy. Insured first-degree relatives, ages 40-80, of a random sample of colorectal cancer cases identified from the California Cancer Registry Dependent variables were receipt of (1) annual fecal occult blood test only; (2) sigmoidoscopy in the past 5 years; (3) colonoscopy in the past 10 years; and (4) any of these tests over the recommended time interval. Market characteristics were HMO penetration, HMO competition, and proportion of staff/group/network HMOs. Market characteristics were as important as individual-level characteristics for AAPI but not for white subjects. Among AAPI subjects, a 10% increase in the percent of group/staff/network model HMO was associated with a reduction in colonoscopy use (28.9% to 20.5%) and in receipt of any of the CRC tests (53.2% to 45.4%). The prevailing organizational structure of a health care market confers a penalty on access to CRC test use among high-risk AAPI subjects but not among high-risk white subjects. Identifying the differential effect of market structure on race/ethnicity can potentially reduce the cancer burden among disadvantaged racial groups.\n"}]}]}}

Indications included evaluation anemia/gastrointestinal bleed, small bowel IBD and dilation of strictures. Video-capsule endoscopy (VCE) was used prior to DBE in 43 of the 66 patients prior to DBE evaluation. The mean age was 62 years. Thirty-two patients were female, 15 were African-American; 44 antegrade and 44 retrograde DBEs were performed. The mean time per antegrade DBE was 107.4\u00b130.0 minutes with a distance of 318.4\u00b1152.9 cm reached past the pylorus. The mean time per lower DBE was 100.7\u00b127.3 minutes with 168.9\u00b1109.1 cm meters past the ileocecal valve reached. Endoscopic therapy in the form of electrocautery to ablate bleeding sources was performed in 20 patients (30.3%), biopsy in 17 patients (25.8%) and dilation of Crohn's-related small bowel strictures in 4 (6.1%). 43 VCEs with pathology noted were performed prior to DBE, with findings endoscopically confirmed in 32 cases (74.4%). In 3 cases the DBE showed findings not noted on VCE.

We hope this will encourage prospective data collection, improvement of care and initiate strategies to establish best practice in this area. This was a retrospective study of patients who underwent emergency laparotomy from June 2010 to May 2012. The primary end point of the study was 30-day mortality, age-related 30-day mortality and 1-year all-cause mortality. 477 laparotomies were performed in 446 patients. 57% were aged <70 and 43% aged >70 years. 30-day mortality was 12, 4% in those aged <70 years and 22% in those >70 years (p < 0.001). 1-year mortality was 25, 15% in those aged under 70 years and 38% in those aged >70 years (p < 0.001). Emergency laparotomy carries a high rate of mortality, especially in those over the age of 70 years, and more needs to be done to improve outcomes, particularly in this group. This could involve increasing acute surgical care manpower, early recognition of patients requiring emergency surgery, development of clear management protocols for such patients or perhaps even considering centralisation of emergency surgical services to specialist centres with multidisciplinary teams involving emergency surgeons and care of the elderly physicians in hospital and related community outreach services for post-discharge care.\n \nHip fractures in the elderly are followed by considerable risk of functional decline and mortality. The purposes of this study were to (1) explore predictive factors of functional level at discharge, (2) evaluate 1-year mortality after hip fracture compared with that of the general population, and (3) evaluate the affect of early functional outcome on 1-year mortality in patients operated on for hip fractures. A total of 228 consecutive patients (average age, 77.6 \u00b1 7.4 years) with hip fractures who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled in an open, prospective, observational cohort study. Functional level at discharge was measured with the motor Functional Independence Measure (FIM) score, which is the most widely accepted functional assessment measure in use in the rehabilitation community. Mortality rates in the study population were calculated in absolute numbers and as the standardized mortality ratio. Multivariate regression analysis was used to explore predictive factors for motor FIM score at discharge and for 1-year mortality adjusted for important baseline variables. Age, health status, cognitive level, preinjury functional level, and pressure sores after hip fracture surgery were independently related to lower discharge motor FIM scores. At 1-year followup, 57 patients (25%; 43 women and 14 men) had died. The 1-year hip fracture mortality rate compared with that of the general population was 31% in our population versus 7% for men and 23% in our population versus 5% for women 65 years or older. The 1-year standardized mortality rate was 341.3 (95% CI, 162.5-520.1) for men and 301.6 (95% CI, 212.4-391.8) for women, respectively. The all-cause mortality rate observed in this group was higher in all age groups and in both sexes when compared with the all-cause age-adjusted mortality of the general population. Motor FIM score at discharge was the only independent predictor of 1-year mortality after hip fracture. Functional level at discharge is the main determinant of long-term mortality in patients with hip fracture. Motor FIM score at discharge is a reliable predictor of mortality and can be recommended for clinical use.\n"}]}]}}

We investigated a dataset of 1002 respondents aged 18 years and over from the Japanese World Health Survey, which collected information through face-to-face interview from 2002 to 2003. The ordered probit model and the Compound Hierarchical Ordered Probit (CHOPIT) model, which incorporated anchoring vignettes, were employed to estimate and compare associations of sleep and energy with socio-demographic and life-style factors before and after adjustment for differences in response category cut-points for each individual. The prevalence of self-reported problems with sleep and energy was 53 %. Without correction of cut-point shifts, age, sex, and the number of comorbidities were significantly associated with a greater severity of sleep-related problems. After correction, age, the number of comorbidities, and regular exercise were significantly associated with a greater severity of sleep-related problems; sex was no longer a significant factor. Compared to the ordered probit model, the CHOPIT model provided two changes with a subtle difference in the magnitude of regression coefficients after correction for reporting heterogeneity. Sleep disorders are common in the general adult population of Japan. Correction for reporting heterogeneity using anchoring vignettes is not a necessary tool for proper management of sleep and energy related problems among Japanese adults. Older age, gender differences in communicating sleep-related problems, the presence of multiple morbidities, and regular exercise should be the focus of policies and clinical practice to improve sleep and energy management in Japan.\n \nThe National Kidney Foundation recommends reporting estimates of glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) rather than timed urine collections. When 2 of the 3 major hospitals in our region began reporting eGFR at different times we recognized a natural experiment. We conducted a retrospective, observational study at the 3 major hospitals in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Data were collected on the frequency of timed urines during a 41/2-year period. Regression analysis was used to study the association of the rate of ordering timed urines adjusted for other factors. There was a marked drop in the rate of ordering of timed urines at all 3 hospitals from a mean of 21.8 per 1000 admissions in the first 4 quarter years of the study to 10.9 in the last 4 (15th-18th) quarter years. The drop began before the reporting of eGFR at any hospital. The reporting of eGFR had a small effect (-1.7 per 1000 hospital admissions) that was not statistically significant (P = 0.15). There has been a marked drop in the ordering of timed urines in our region. The decline began before the reporting of eGFR at 2 of the hospitals and therefore is attributable to other factors.\n"}]}]}}

We assessed the traditional cardiovascular risk factors, the CCA IMT, and the local stiffness with Quality Arterial Stiffness technology, based on Radio frequency signal (RFQAS-ESAOTE, Italy).

Basic clinical and biochemical parameters and oxLDL level were measured in 70 patients at baseline and after 2 years of the study. In addition, an ultrasonographic study was performed to assess the carotid intima media thickness (IMT). Patients did not differ according to basic clinical and biochemical parameters at the beginning and after 2 years of the study. IMT increased (p=0.000001) whereas oxLDL level decreased (p=0.00001) in DM1 patients during 2 years. Multivariate regression analysis showed that oxLDL independently influences IMT in DM1 patients (\u03b2=0.454, R2=0.35). Further, positive correlations between oxLDL value and LDL-C concentration (r=0.585, p<0.05, n=70) and between oxLDL level and apo-B concentration have been established (r=0.610, p<0.05, n=70). Moreover, patients with chronic microvascular complications showed a higher value of IMT in comparison with patients without them (p=0.003). Our results provide the evidence that oxLDL accelerates atherosclerotic plaque formation and may contribute to the development of microvascular complications in DM1.\n"}]}]}}

The users of the short stay ward were children of young age less than 2 years, with stay greater than 23 hours reported in only 1% of all admissions to the short stay ward. The rate of patient admission to an in-hospital bed was low, (4% [Westmead Hospital] compared to 6% [New Children's Hospital]), with the number of unscheduled visits within 72 hours of short stay ward discharge less than 1%. There were no adverse events reported at either short stay ward, with parental satisfaction high. The short stay ward was developed through reallocation of resources from within the hospital to the short stay ward. This resulted in estimated savings of $1/2 million (Westmead Hospital) to $2.3 million (New Children's Hospital) to the hospital, due to more efficient bed usage. This data demonstrates the robust nature of the short stay ward. At these two very different institutions we have shown improved bed efficient and patient care in a cost-effective way. We have also reported on greater parental satisfaction and early return of the child with their family to the community.\n"}]}]}}

Dependent variables were traffic fatality and severe injury rates per population and vehicle fleet. Independent variables were Empirical estimates from instrumental variables suggest that the enactment of the traffic law reform in interaction with number of traffic tickets per police officer is significantly associated with a decrease of 8% in traffic fatalities and 7% in severe injuries. Piecewise regression model results for the 2007-2012 period suggest that police traffic enforcement reduced traffic fatalities by 59% and severe injuries by 37%. Findings suggest that traffic law reforms in order to have an effect on both traffic fatality and injury rates reduction require changes in police enforcement practices.

To maintain safe and independent transport, mobility is important for all individuals, but especially for older drivers. The objective of this study was to investigate whether automatic transmission, compared with manual transmission, may improve the driving behavior of older drivers. In total, 31 older drivers (mean age 75.2 years) and 32 younger drivers - used as a control group (mean age 39.2 years) - were assessed twice on the same fixed route; once in a car with manual transmission and once in a car with automatic transmission. The cars were otherwise identical. The driving behavior was assessed with the Ryd On-Road Assessment driving protocol. Time to completion of left turns (right-hand side driving) and the impact of a distraction task were measured. The older group had more driving errors than the younger group, in both the manual and the automatic transmission car. However, and contrary to the younger drivers, automatic transmission improved the older participants' driving behavior as demonstrated by safer speed adjustment in urban areas, greater maneuvering skills, safer lane position and driving in accordance with the speed regulations. Switching to automatic transmission may be recommended for older drivers as a means to maintain safe driving and thereby the quality of their transport mobility.\n"}]}]}}

We performed a 6-year (2006 to 2011) retrospective review of all trauma patients with blunt abdominal solid organ injuries. Patients were matched using propensity score matching in a 2:1:1 (early:intermediate:late) for age, gender, systolic blood pressure, Glasgow Coma Scale, Injury Severity Score, and type and grade of organs injured. Our primary outcome measures were A total of 116 patients (58 early, 29 intermediate, and 29 late) were included. There were no differences in age (P\u00a0=\u00a0.5), Injury Severity Score (P\u00a0=\u00a0.6), type (P\u00a0=\u00a0.1), and grade of injury of the organ (P\u00a0=\u00a0.6) between the 3 groups.

The few available data suggest that tapering or even stopping heparinization is feasible and the HeprAN membrane with grafted heparin was developed to decrease heparin dose.

We investigated the role of routine laboratory parameters in distinguishing NASH from ASH. Liver biopsies performed at our hospital over a 10-year period were reviewed, 95 patients with steatohepatitis identified and their data prior to biopsy reevaluated. The diagnosis NASH or ASH was assigned (other liver diseases excluded) on the basis of the biopsy and history of alcohol consumption (< 140 g/week). Logistic regression models were used for analysis. NASH was diagnosed in 58 patients (61%; 30 f) and ASH in 37 (39%; 9 f). High-grade fibrosis (59% vs. 19%, P < 0.0001) and an AST/ALT ratio > 1 (54.1% vs 20.7%, P = 0.0008) were more common in ASH. The MCV was elevated in 53% of ASH patients and normal in all NASH patients (P < 0.0001). Multivariate analysis identified the MCV (P = 0.0013), the AST/ALT ratio (P = 0.011) and sex (P = 0.0029) as relevant regressors (aROC = 0.92). The AST/ALT ratio (P < 0.0001) and age (P = 0.00049) were independent predictors of high-grade fibrosis. Differences in MCV were more marked in high-grade fibrosis. Higher MCVs and AST/ALT ratios in ASH reflect the severity of underlying liver disease and do not differentiate NASH from ASH. Instead, these biomarkers might prove useful in guiding selection of patients for liver biopsy and in targeting therapy.\n \nThyroid hormones play an important role in the regulation of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, both of which are affected in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Anecdotally, we have observed that a number of patients with NASH carried a diagnosis of hypothyroidism. However, it is unknown if thyroid dysfunction plays any role in the pathogenesis of NASH. To further investigate this observation, we conducted a case-control study to determine the association between hypothyroidism and NASH. Cases were defined as patients with well-documented NASH attending hepatology clinics at Indiana University Hospital from January 1, 1995 to December 31, 2000. Age, gender, race, and body-weight matched individuals seen during the same period in the general medical clinics served as controls. Patients with a previous diagnosis of hypothyroidism who are currently on synthetic T4 replacement were considered to be \"hypothyroid\". The strength of association was assessed by logistic regression analysis after controlling for the frequency of diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. One hundred seventy-four patients with NASH (cases) and 442 controls were included. The mean age of cohort was 49 +/- 13 years, 59% were female, and 98% were white. The prevalence of hypothyroidism in patients with NASH was 15% was significantly higher than in the controls (7.2%, P < 0.001). By multivariate analysis, the prevalence of hypothyroidism in the NASH group was significantly higher than in control group (OR These data suggest that hypothyroidism is associated with human NASH.

The health survey 1984-86 addressed all inhabitants > or = 20 years of age in Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag county, Norway; 76,885 (90.3%) of the eligible population participated in answering the question on diabetes. All inhabitants in the municipality answering \"yes\" to the question on diabetes (n = 169) and the persons with the same sex born closest before and after each diabetic patient and answering \"no\" to the diabetes question (n = 338) were included. A very thorough search was made in the medical files of the general practitioners in the municipality for corresponding information. Compared to the files, diabetes was verified in 163 out of the 169. The commonest cause of discrepancy was renal glycosuria. One out of the 338 registered non-diabetic persons was found to have diabetes. Diabetic patients tended to overestimate diabetes duration significantly. Insulin treatment was verified in 19/20 (95%) and treatment with oral hypoglycaemic agents in all 44 with an affirmative questionnaire answer. A negative answer on insulin and oral hypoglycaemic agents was verified in 100% and 99% respectively.

The aim of this study was to compare quality of life related to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in patients who underwent intra-thoracic stomach repair with and without fundoplication. We proposed that the group without a fundoplication would have poorer quality of life due to continued symptoms. All patients undergoing foregut surgery at the Creighton University Esophageal Center are entered in a prospectively maintained database. The database was queried to identify patients who underwent surgery for a near complete (>75\u00a0% of stomach in chest) intra-thoracic stomach with gastric volvulus between 2004 and 2013. A questionnaire was derived from the Quality of Life in Reflux and Dyspepsia and Frequency Scale for Symptoms of GERD questionnaires to assess for symptoms related to reflux, and this questionnaire was administered by phone. A total of 150 patients underwent repair of ITS\u00a0during the study period. A total of 109 patients had ITS repair with fundoplication, while 41 had only ITS repair. Follow-up was available in 54\u00a0% of patients in the fundoplication group (median follow-up of 5.2\u00a0years) and in 49\u00a0% of patients in the non-fundoplication group (median follow-up of 4\u00a0years). Significantly, more patients woke up at night (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and found themselves coughing around mealtime (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) in the fundoplication group. Patients in the non-fundoplication group had significantly more daytime reflux (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). Despite these symptoms, only one patient in the fundoplication group and no patients in the non-fundoplication group admitted that these symptoms were severe enough to severely affect their quality of life. All other patients contacted felt satisfied, and >80\u00a0% rated their quality of life as either good or excellent.

A questionnaire on US education and bedside US use was pilot tested and given to EM residents. The primary outcomes included the number of US examinations performed, scope of bedside US applications, barriers to residents' US education, and US use in the emergency department. The secondary outcomes were factors that would impact residents' US education. The outcomes were compared between residency programs with and without EUS fellowships. A total of 244 EM residents participated in this study. Thirty percent (95% confidence interval, 24%-35%) reported they had performed more than 150 scans. Residents in programs with EUS fellowships reported performing more scans than those in programs without fellowships (P = .04). Significant differences were noted in most applications of bedside US between residency programs with and without fellowships (P < .05).

This can be done either (i) acutely during the clamp study using high-dose insulin infusion, or (ii) slowly overnight preceding the clamp study using a low-dose insulin infusion. We assessed whether the choice of either of these methods to obtain euglycaemia biases subsequent assessment of glucose metabolism and insulin action. We studied seven obese Type 2 diabetic patients twice Basal plasma glucose levels (mean +/- sd) were 5.5 +/- 0.5 and 10.7 +/- 2.9 mmol/l in the + ON and - ON studies, respectively, and were clamped at -5.5 mmol/l. Basal rates of glucose production (GP) were similar in the + ON and - ON studies, 83 +/- 13 vs. 85 +/- 14 mg m-2 min-1 (NS), whereas basal rates of glucose disappearance (Rd) were lower in the + ON than in the - ON study, 84 +/- 8 vs. 91 +/- 11 mg m-2 min-1 (P = 0.02).

A retrospective analysis of the medical notes of all children surgically treated at the authors' center between 1979 and 1991 was undertaken. Criteria for inclusion were absence of surgical complications, unremarkable clinical examination, and normal bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, albumin, international normalized prothrombin ratio, and platelet count. Of 244 children surgically treated during the observation period, the authors identified 28 (11%) adolescents (14 male) who fulfilled the entry criteria. Their median age was 13.4 years (range, 10.2-22.2 years). Twenty-six with type 3 EHBA had conventional KP, whereas 2 underwent modified operations. The corrective surgery was performed at a median age of 58 days (range, 20-99 days). Median time of complete clearance of jaundice from the date of KP was 75 days (range, 21-339 days). Twelve (43%) patients had history of cholangitis at a median age of 3.4 years. The liver histologic findings were suggestive of mild to moderate fibrosis in 54.2% and cirrhosis in 40.7% of the patients who underwent biopsy. No child had gastrointestinal bleeding during follow-up. Thirteen (46%) patients had an elective esophagogastroduodenoscopy, which was normal in all. Twenty-six (93%) patients were in mainstream education, whereas the remaining two (7%) attended special school because of reasons unrelated to liver disease. A sizable proportion of children with EHBA avoid significant chronic liver disease and its complications 10 years or more after conventional surgical correction and have an excellent quality of life. Their good outcome is not hampered by isolated episodes of ascending cholangitis. Whether or not the residual histologic damage will become symptomatic during their lifetime remains to be established.\n \nTo assess and compare the value of split-liver transplantation (SLT) and living-related liver transplantation (LRT).

The combination of SLT and LRT has abolished deaths on the waiting list, thus raising the question whether living donor liver transplantation is still necessary. Outcomes and postoperative liver function of 43 primary LRT patients were compared with those of 49 primary SLT patients (14 ex situ, 35 in situ) with known graft weight performed between April 1996 and December 2000. Survival rates were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. After a median follow-up of 35 months, actual patient survival rates were 82% in the SLT group and 88% in the LRT group. Actual graft survival rates were 76% and 81%, respectively. The incidence of primary nonfunction was 12% in the SLT group and 2.3% in the LRT group. Liver function parameters (prothrombin time, factor V, bilirubin clearance) and surgical complication rates did not differ significantly. In the SLT group, mean cold ischemic time was longer than in the LRT group. Serum values of alanine aminotransferase during the first postoperative week were significantly higher in the SLT group. In the LRT group, there were more grafts with signs of fatty degeneration than in the SLT group. The short- and long-term outcomes after LRT and SLT did not differ significantly. To avoid the risk for the donor in LRT, SLT represents the first-line therapy in pediatric liver transplantation in countries where cadaveric organs are available. LRT provides a solution for urgent cases in which a cadaveric graft cannot be found in time or if the choice of the optimal time point for transplantation is vital.\n"}]}]}}

The roles of attitudes toward contraception, pregnancy and fertility remain relatively unexplored. Knowledge of contraceptive methods and attitudes about contraception, pregnancy, childbearing and fertility were assessed among 602 unmarried women aged 18-29 at risk for unintended pregnancy who participated in the 2009 National Survey of Reproductive and Contraceptive Knowledge. The contribution of attitudes to racial and ethnic disparities in effective method use was assessed via mediation analysis, using a series of regression models. Blacks and Latinas were more likely than whites to believe that the government encourages contraceptive use to limit minority populations (odds ratio, 2.5 for each). Compared with white women, Latinas held more favorable attitudes toward pregnancy (2.5) and childbearing (coefficient, 0.3) and were more fatalistic about the timing of pregnancy (odds ratio, 2.3); blacks were more fatalistic about life in general (2.0). Only one attitude, skepticism that the government ensures contraceptive safety, was associated with contraceptive use (0.7), but this belief did not differ by race or ethnicity. Although blacks and Latinas used less effective methods than whites (0.3 and 0.4, respectively), attitudes did not explain disparities. Lower contraceptive knowledge partially explained Latinas' use of less effective methods. Providing basic information about effective methods might help to decrease ethnic disparities in use. Research should examine other variables that might account for these disparities, including health system characteristics and provider behavior.\n"}]}]}}

In the current study we evaluated the association of direct ipsilateral adrenal invasion with outcome to determine if reclassification of these tumors as pT4 would improve the accuracy of the current tumor classification. We studied 424 patients who underwent nephrectomy and adrenalectomy for unilateral, sporadic, pT3 or pT4 RCC between 1970 and 2000 at the Mayo Clinic. Cancer specific survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cancer specific survival for the 22 patients with pT3a or pT3b tumors that directly invaded the ipsilateral adrenal gland was significantly worse compared with that of patients with pT3a (p <0.001) or pT3b (p = 0.011) disease that did not invade the adrenal gland. There was no significant difference in the 5-year cancer specific survival between the patients with pT3a or pT3b tumors that directly invaded the ipsilateral adrenal gland and patients with pT4 tumors (cancer specific survival rates of 20% and 14%, respectively, p = 0.490). Although rare, RCC with direct ipsilateral adrenal invasion behaves more aggressively than tumors involving perinephric or renal sinus fat. We believe that RCC tumors with direct adrenal invasion should be classified as pT4.\n \nTo determine the value of ipsilateral adrenalectomy with radical nephrectomy, by investigating the clinical aspects of adrenal involvement and adrenocortical function in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The demographic, clinical and pathological data of adrenal involvement were reviewed in 247 patients with RCC. To evaluate adrenocortical function, 14 patients (adrenalectomy in eight, adrenal-sparing in six) had a rapid adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test before and 2 weeks after surgery. There was adrenal involvement with RCC in seven of the 247 (2.8%) patients (a solitary adrenal metastatic tumour in four and direct extension into the adrenal gland in three). All adrenal involvement was detectable on abdominal computed tomography before surgery, and these patients had a large primary renal tumour of > pT2 and/or distant metastasis. Plasma cortisol levels declined significantly more in response to the rapid ACTH stimulation test in those treated by adrenalectomy than in those with spared adrenal glands at 2 weeks after surgery (P < 0.05), while there was no significant difference between the groups before surgery. These results suggest that unconditional ipsilateral adrenalectomy with radical nephrectomy for RCC should be avoidable, and thus preserve the reserve of adrenocortical function, as preoperative imaging, especially thin-slice multidetector helical computed tomography, can detect adrenal involvement with RCC in most cases. Unilateral adrenalectomy might cause an irreversible impairment of the reserve of adrenocortical function.\n"}]}]}}

This study aimed to investigate the influence rural placement and rural background had on students' intentions to live and work in a rural or remote location after graduation. Between January 2005 and December 2006, 336 students participated in the placement program. Students were requested to complete a survey at the completion of their placement. A response rate of 239 was achieved (71%). The survey measured students' stated rural career intentions and rural background status according to location of primary and secondary school attendance. A demographic analysis of respondents was undertaken and results cross tabulated according to the rural, remote and metropolitan area (RRMA) classification system. Statistical analyses, including paired t-tests and a Wilcoxon signed rank test, were conducted to compare reported mean intention to practise rurally both prior to and after placement. The results from this survey show that rural placements in the undergraduate health science programs have a predominantly positive influence on students' intention to work in a rural community post-graduation. While these findings were significant for the disciplines of nursing, medicine and allied health, the results were not significant for pharmacy students. Students' average intention to practise rurally significantly increased after the placement for students from RRMA classifications 1 and 3-5. The value of rural placements as a method for increasing health science students' intentionality to take up rural practice as a positive and viable career option is considerable.\n \nThe burden of maternal mortality in sub-Saharan Africa is very high. In Ghana maternal mortality ratio was 380 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2013. Skilled birth attendance has been shown to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity, yet in 2010 only 68 percent of mothers in Ghana gave birth with the assistance of skilled birth attendants. In 2005, the Ghana Health Service piloted a strategy that involved using the integrated Community-based Health Planning and Services (CHPS) program and training Community Health Officers (CHOs) as midwives to address the gap in skilled attendance in rural Upper East Region (UER). The study assesses the feasibility of and extent to which the skilled delivery program has been implemented as an integrated component of the existing CHPS, and documents the benefits and challenges of the integrated program. We employed an intrinsic case study design with a qualitative methodology. We conducted 41 in-depth interviews with health professionals and community stakeholders. We used a purposive sampling technique to identify and interview our respondents. The CHO-midwives provide integrated services that include skilled delivery in CHPS zones. The midwives collaborate with District Assemblies, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and communities to offer skilled delivery services in rural communities. They refer pregnant women with complications to district hospitals and health centers for care, and there has been observed improvement in the referral system. Stakeholders reported community members' access to skilled attendants at birth, health education, antenatal attendance and postnatal care in rural communities. The CHO-midwives are provided with financial and non-financial incentives to motivate them for optimal work performance. The primary challenges that remain include inadequate numbers of CHO-midwives, insufficient transportation, and infrastructure weaknesses. Our study demonstrates that CHOs can successfully be trained as midwives and deployed to provide skilled delivery services at the doorsteps of rural households. The integration of the skilled delivery program with the CHPS program appears to be an effective model for improving access to skilled birth attendance in rural communities of the UER of Ghana.\n"}]}]}}

Half of those casualties are expected to require immediate medical treatment. This study was performed to evaluate the efficacy of the current readiness guidelines based on the epidemiology of encountered HMCIs. A retrospective study of HMCIs was recorded in the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) home front command and the Israeli National Trauma Registry (ITR) between November 2000 and June 2003. An HMCI is defined by the Emergency and Disaster Medicine Division in the Israeli Ministry of Health as >or=10 casualties or >or=4 suffering from injuries with an ISS>or=16 arriving to a single hospital. The study includes a total of 32 attacks, resulting in 62 HMCIs and 1292 casualties. The mean number of arriving casualties to a single hospital was 20.8+/-13.3 (range 4-56, median 16.5). In 95% of the HMCIs the casualty load was <or=52. Based on severity scores and ED discharges 1022 (79.2%) casualties did not necessitate immediate medical treatment. Hospital preparedness can be better defined by a fixed number of casualties rather than a percentile of its bed capacity. Only 20% of the arriving casualties will require immediate medical treatment.

Data were collected as part of The Baby's Breath Project, a hospital-based SHSe intervention trial targeting parents with a high-risk infant in the NICU who reported a smoker in the household (N = 99). Measures of sociodemographics, smoking, home and car smoking bans, and depression were collected. Overall, 26% of all families with a high-risk infant in the NICU reported a household smoker. Almost half of the families with a smoker reported an annual income of less than $25,000. 46.2% of families reported having a total smoking ban in place in both their homes and cars. Only 27.8% families earning less than $25,000 reported having a total smoking ban in place relative to almost 60% of families earning more (p < .01). African American and Caucasian families were less likely to have a smoking ban compared with Hispanics (p < .05). Mothers who reported no smoking ban were more depressed than those who had a household smoking ban (p < .02). The most disadvantaged families were least likely to have protective health behaviors in place to reduce SHSe and, consequently, are most at-risk for tobacco exposure and subsequent tobacco-related health disparities.

To evaluate whether racial disparities exist in the proportion of extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants rehospitalized prior to 18 months corrected age and the causes of rehospitalization. The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neonatal Research Network database was used to identify all ELBW infants (n=2446) who were born between November 1, 1998 and May 31, 2000 at the 14 participating centers and discharged alive (n=1591). Infants were seen at 18-22 months corrected age for followup. Data related to maternal variables, race, socioeconomic status, medical morbidities, insurance, and rehospitalizations were recorded from the medical record and parent interview. Logistic regression analyses were used to examine the relationship of race/ethnicity and rehospitalization while controlling for gestational age, gender, center, maternal education, family income, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), necrotizing enterocolitis, ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) prophylaxis, and insurance type. In all, 1405 (88%) infants were evaluated at followup. The racial distribution of infants admitted, discharged, seen at followup, and rehospitalized were similar. Rehospitalization occurred at least once in 49% of the infants. In the logistic regression analyses, race was not a significant predictor for rehospitalization. The odds of rehospitalization were related to low family income, type of insurance, BPD, VP shunt, RSV prophylaxis, and center. Race was not a predominant variable in the risk of rehospitalization in this cohort of ELBW infants. Medical morbidities and low family income appear to be the major risk factors for rehospitalization.\n"}]}]}}

In a randomized, double-blind multicenter trial, 322 patients with predominantly New York Heart Association class II or III congestive heart failure and left ventricular ejection fractions of 35% or less, who were stabilized on a diuretic, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, and digoxin, were treated with 100 mg flosequinan once daily, 75 mg flosequinan twice daily, or matching placebo. Efficacy was evaluated with serial measurements of treadmill exercise time, responses to the Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire (LWHF), and clinical assessments during a baseline phase and a 16-week treatment period. After 16 weeks, 100 mg flosequinan once daily produced a significant increment in median exercise time (64 seconds at 16 weeks) compared with placebo (5 seconds), whereas the higher-dose flosequinan group did not show a statistically significant increase. Flosequinan (100 mg once daily) also improved the overall LWHF score significantly compared with placebo; both active therapies decreased the physical component, but 75 mg flosequinan twice daily was associated with a trend toward worsening of the emotional component.

The ability to recognize different optotypes differs even if their critical details appear under the same visual angle. Since optotypes are evaluated on individuals with good visual acuity and without eye disorders, differences in the lower visual acuity range cannot be excluded. In this study, visual acuity measured with the Snellen E was compared to the Landolt C acuity. 100 patients (age 8 - 90 years, median 60.5 years) with various eye disorders, among them 39 with amblyopia due to strabismus, and 13 healthy volunteers were tested. Charts with the Snellen E and the Landolt C (Precision Vision) which mimic the ETDRS charts were used to assess visual acuity. Three out of 5 optotypes per line had to be correctly identified, while wrong answers were monitored. In the group of patients, the eyes with the lower visual acuity, and the right eyes of the healthy subjects, were evaluated. Differences between Landolt C acuity (LR) and Snellen E acuity (SE) were small. The mean decimal values for LR and SE were 0.25 and 0.29 in the entire group and 0.14 and 0.16 for the eyes with strabismus amblyopia. The mean difference between LR and SE was 0.55 lines in the entire group and 0.55 lines for the eyes with strabismus amblyopia, with higher values of SE in both groups. The results of the other groups were similar with only small differences between LR and SE. Using the charts described, there was only a slight overestimation of visual acuity by the Snellen E compared to the Landolt C, even in strabismus amblyopia. Small differences in the lower visual acuity range have to be considered.\n"}]}]}}

This study evaluated the effectiveness of morphine loading in a postoperative thoracic epidural analgesic regimen of patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) with levobupivacaine combined with continuously administered epidural morphine in this patient group. In this prospective randomized controlled trial, 48 superobese patients (body mass index of \u2265 50 kg/m(2)) undergoing open bariatric surgery were randomly allocated to three groups of 16 patients each. Postoperatively, all groups received a continuous epidural morphine infusion of 0.2 mg/h with 0.1 % levobupivacaine via PCEA. Group A did not receive intraoperative epidural morphine loading, while groups B and C received an intraoperative 1- and 2-mg morphine bolus, respectively. Levobupivacaine consumption via PCEA (primary outcome), pain scores at rest and on cough, the time to return of bowel function and ambulation, and arterial blood gas levels (secondary outcomes) were recorded. The increase in perioperative morphine administration (groups B and C) led to a significantly prolonged return to normal bowel function and delayed ambulation (P<0.05 to 0.01, respectively), without an improvement in postoperative analgesia or a reduction in local anesthetic consumption. Although the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was high in all groups, no respiratory depression was observed. Thoracic PCEA with 0.1 % levobupivacaine combined with continuous epidural morphine administration of 0.2 mg/h without morphine loading is an effective postoperative analgesic regimen that provides adequate pain control, early ambulation, and early return of bowel function in superobese patients, particularly those with OSA.\n \nSocial and cultural factors combined with little information may prevent the diffusion of epidural analgesia for pain relief during childbirth. The present study was launched contemporarily to the implementation of analgesia for labor in our Department in order to perform a 2 years audit on its use. The goal is to evaluate the epidural acceptance and penetration into hospital practice by women and care givers and safety and efficacy during childbirth. This audit cycle measured epidural analgesia performance against 4 standards During the audit period epidural analgesia increased from 15.5% of all labors in the first trimester of the study to 51% in the last trimester (p < 0.005). Satisfaction levels reported by patients and care givers were good. A hierarchical clustering analysis identified two clusters based on VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) time course Present audit shows that the process of implementation of labor analgesia was quick, successful and safe, notwithstanding the identification of one cluster of women with suboptimal response to epidural analgesia that need to be further studies, overall pregnant womens'adhesion to labor analgesia was satisfactory.\n"}]}]}}

The authors evaluated HER2 immunoreactivity using immunohistochemical staining and explored the influence of pathological parameters and HER2 immunoreactivity on progression-free survival (PFS) and disease-specific overall survival (OS) using univariate and multivariate Cox's analyses. Urothelial carcinoma of the bladder had a significantly higher frequency of HER2 immunoreactivity than that of the upper urinary tract (60.7 vs. 20.7%, p < 0.0001). Overall, nodal status was a strong and independent prognostic indicator for clinical outcome. The HER2 immunoreactivity was significantly associated with PFS (p = 0.02) and disease-specific OS (p = 0.005) in advanced urothelial carcinoma patients. As for patients with adjuvant M-VEC, HER2 immunoreactivity was a significant prognostic factor for PFS (p = 0.03) and disease-specific OS (p = 0.02) using univariate analysis, but not multivariate analysis, and not for patients receiving watchful waiting. HER2 immunoreactivity might have a limited prognostic value for advanced urothelial carcinoma patients with adjuvant M-VEC.\n \nIt has been demonstrated that there are a lot of different prognostic factors which are worthy of consideration whereas diabetes mellitus (DM) has not been clearly or consistently identified as a prognostic value in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic significance of the characteristics of patients in advanced NSCLC. Specifically, we investigated the impact of DM for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients receiving first-line platinum-based doublets chemotherapy. We retrospectively reviewed 442 patients with advanced NSCLC. DM and other potential prognostic variables were chosen for analysis in this study. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify prognostic factors associated with survival. The results of univariate analysis for OS were identified as having prognostic significance In conclusion, DM at the time of diagnosis was associated with the negative prognostic importance for PFS and OS in the advanced stage patients who were receiving first-line platinum-based doublets chemotherapy. In addition poor performance status and advanced stage were identified as negative prognostic factors.\n"}]}]}}

We studied the frequencies of TNF-\u03b1-308 gene polymorphism in 90 male subjects (60 subjects with COPD and 30 healthy smokers) in a Caucasian population. There was no significant difference in the frequency of G/G and G/A gene polymorphisms in the COPD group compared with control subjects (p>0.05). We compared COPD patients as G/A gene polymorphism and G/G gene polymorphism; the PFTs and BMI before and after one year were not statistically significant (p>0.05). Also, the exacerbation and hospitalization data of COPD patients were not significant between these groups. In conclusion, there was no difference between smoking-related COPD and the control group according to TNF \u03b1-308 gene polymorphism in a Caucasian population. In addition, it was shown that important determinants of prognosis of COPD such as FEV1, BMI, COPD exacerbation and hospitalization were not associated with TNF-\u03b1-308 gene polymorphism.\n \nCurrent guidelines recommend spirometry to confirm a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). To investigate whether a self-reported diagnosis of COPD is associated with prior spirometry and whether a correct diagnosis of COPD is more likely when spirometry was performed. We used data from the population-based Austrian Burden of Obstructive Lung Disease (BOLD) study. Participants were aged >40 years and completed post-bronchodilator spirometry. Reported COPD diagnosis and reported prior lung function test were based on questionnaire. Persistent airflow limitation was defined as post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second/forced vital capacity ratio <0.7, corresponding with COPD Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) grade I+, and GOLD grade II+ was also investigated. A correct diagnosis of COPD was defined as a reported physician's diagnosis of COPD and the presence of persistent airflow limitation. 68 (5.4%) of 1,258 participants reported a prior physician's diagnosis of COPD. Of these, only 17 (25.0%) reported a lung function test within the past 12 months and 46 (67.6%) at any time in the past. The likelihood for a correct COPD GOLD grade I+ diagnosis was similar among subjects reporting a lung function test during the last 12 months (likelihood ratio 2.07, 95% CI 0.89 to 5.50) and those not reporting a lung function during the last 12 months (likelihood ratio 2.78, 95% CI 1.58 to 4.87). Similar likelihood ratios were seen when GOLD grade II+ was investigated and when lung function was reported at any time in the past. One-third of subjects with a reported diagnosis of COPD never had a lung function test. When spirometry was reported, this did not increase the likelihood of a correct COPD diagnosis.\n"}]}]}}

In order to compare adipocytes resulting from the differentiation of preadipocytes with those of purified adipose tissue, we implanted them in 10 nude mice. The preadipocytes were implanted using a collagen scaffold as intermediary and the adipose tissue following the plastic surgery protocol described by SR Coleman. After 8 weeks, tissue fragments were explanted and analysed after staining with HPS, Oil Red O and labelling with human anti-vimentin antibodies. The scaffold seeded with preadipocytes had the macroscopic appearance of adipose tissue with peripheral neovascularisation. The preadipocytes had been transformed into mature adipocytes. Purified adipose tissue also presented peripheral neovascularisation. Numerous mature adipocytes were found. There was an abundant murine extracellular matrix since anti-vimentin labelling was negative.

All rats were sacrificed on postoperative day 7, and liver injury was assessed by measuring alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels. Protein synthetic ability was determined based albumin levels and liver regeneration by the mitotic index (MI). The AST and ALT values of group II rats were significantly higher than those of group I, but not those of group III. Rats treated with doxorubicin and HBO (groups II and III) showed slightly but not significant differences in albumin levels than those subjected to only RPVL or sham-operated. The MI was significantly increased in groups I, II, and III, with the MI of group III rats significantly higher than those of group I rats.

An equal distribution of community (n = 8) and university programs (n = 9) was sampled. Prior to the initiation of the 80-hour workweek, residency programs emphasized weekly didactic sessions given by attending physicians (88%), mock orals (88%), and conventional journal club (76%). After the 80-hour workweek was implemented, the education curriculum most often consisted of didactic sessions by attending (100%), mock orals (88%), and simulation laboratories (75%).

Children performed a simple repetitive motor task during intermittent photic stimulation (IPS). All episodes of PPR not associated with obvious clinical change (as observed by the technologist or reported by the patient) were analyzed for this study. The average time interval between two successive motor responses across a PPR (test time) was compared to the average time interval between two successive motor responses during IPS not associated with PPR (control time) using Wilcoxon signed ranks test. 21 children who had PPR successfully completed the MRT. The difference between the mean durations was 0.894 s (p=0.002). More than 50% increase compared to the control time was considered a delay in MRT during PPR. 10 children showed slowing of MRT during PPR. By definition, acute behavioral change during generalized epileptiform discharges represent provoked seizures. Detecting subclinical seizures can have important safety implications in children (skiing, skating and driving) with PPR on EEG, but no clinical seizures. We recommend MRT during IPS.\n"}]}]}}

The ability of TCD recorded in the first 24 hours of hospital admission to detect high-risk vasospasm patients for SAH with low clinical severity helps decide the most efficient patient destination. During the first three days the MV/24h is of value but not the absolute figure of the MV. In contrast, between the 4th and 14th day after SAH, the absolute figure of MV was useful to predict vasospasm.\n \nWith the advancement of an aging society in the world, an increasing number of elderly patients have been hospitalized due to aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). There is no study that compares the elderly cases of aSAH who receive the definitive treatment with those who treated conservatively. The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of the definitive surgery for the acute subarachnoid cases aged 80 or older. We reviewed 500 consecutive cases with acute aSAH with surgical indication for aneurysm repair. Inoperable cases such as dead-on-arrival and the cases with both pupils dilated were excluded. We compared the cases aged 80 or older that received clipping or coil embolization with the controls that the family selected conservative treatment. 69 cases were included in this study (ranged 80-98, male:female=9:60). 56 cases (81.2%) had an aneurysm in the anterior circulation. 23 cases received clipping, 20 cases coil embolization and 26 cases treated conservatively. The cases with aneurysm repair showed significantly better clinical outcome than the controls, while World Federation of Neurological Surgeons (WFNS) grade on admission and premorbid modified Rankin Scale showed no difference between them. Better prognosis was obtained when ruptured aneurysm was repaired in the elderly than it was treated conservatively. From the results of this study, we should not hesitate to offer the definitive surgery for the elderly with aSAH.\n"}]}]}}

Primary care providers (PCPs) working in safety-net settings may have less experience treating survivors, and little is known about their knowledge and views on survivorship care. The current study was performed to determine the knowledge, attitudes, and confidence of PCPs in the safety net at delivering care to survivors of breast cancer. A modified version of the National Cancer Institute's Survey of Physician Attitudes Regarding Care of Cancer Survivors was given to providers at 2 county hospitals and 5 associated clinics (59 providers). Focus groups were held to understand barriers to survivorship care. Although the majority of providers believed PCPs have the skills necessary to provide cancer-related follow-up, the vast majority were not comfortable providing these services themselves. Providers were adherent to American Society of Clinical Oncology recommendations for mammography (98%) and physical examination (87%); less than one-third were guideline-concordant for laboratory testing and only 6 providers (10%) met all recommendations. PCPs universally requested additional training on clinical guidelines and the provision of written survivorship care plans before transfer. Concerns voiced in qualitative sessions included unfamiliarity with the management of endocrine therapy and confusion regarding who would be responsible for certain aspects of care. Safety-net providers currently lack knowledge of and confidence in providing survivorship care to patients with breast cancer. Opportunities exist for additional training in evidence-based guidelines and improved coordination of care between PCPs and oncology specialists.\n \nTo assess trends in the involvement of US physicians with managed care. Comparison of data from 2 consecutive rounds of a national survey. Longitudinal data were obtained from the 1996/1997 (n = 12,528) and the 1998/1999 (n = 12,304) rounds of the Community Tracking Study (CTS) Physician Survey, a large, ongoing nationally representative survey of US physicians involved in patient care. Indicators used to assess involvement with managed care included global measures of managed care participation, risk contracting, exposure to financial incentives, and impact of care management tools. Changes in these measures over the 2 study periods are reported. Analyses were conducted for all physicians, as well as for primary care physicians (PCPs) and specialists separately. The percentage of practice revenue derived from managed care increased only modestly over the study period (from 42% to 45%). Mean numbers of managed care contracts per physician increased minimally (from 12 to 13). Trends in acceptance of capitation and exposure to financial incentives remained stable over the study period. Among PCPs, employment in staff/group health maintenance organizations declined slightly, whereas gatekeeping function increased modestly. Among care management tools, only treatment guidelines had a significantly increased impact on medical practice, primarily among PCPs (from 46% to 52%; P < .001). Many aspects of managed care leveled off between 1996 and 1999 in ways not accurately reflected by plan enrollment patterns. This \"flattening of the curve\" trend appears to hold generally across multiple measures. A stalling of the managed care \"revolution,\" if it is sustained, may portend future escalation in healthcare costs.\n"}]}]}}

As in other chronic liver diseases, the presence of hepatocellular carcinoma in a patient with primary sclerosing cholangitis undergoing evaluation for orthotopic liver transplantation would clearly impact on the candidacy, diagnostic evaluation, and alternative treatment options. Thus, the aim of our study was to determine the prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients undergoing liver transplantation for primary sclerosing cholangitis. The records of the 520 patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation at our institution between 1985 and May 1995 were reviewed. Of the 134 patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis, three (2%) had hepatocellular carcinoma. In the 386 patients without primary sclerosing cholangitis undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation, 22 (6%) had hepatocellular carcinoma. Neither the duration of primary sclerosing cholangitis (range 7-23 years) nor the presence of ulcerative colitis (two of three patients) distinguished those patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis plus hepatocellular carcinoma from those with primary sclerosing cholangitis alone. None of the three patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis plus hepatocellular carcinoma had evidence for hepatitis B or C, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, or hemochromatosis. None of the tumors was of the fibrolamellar variety of hepatocellular carcinoma. The prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation is 2%. These data suggest that patients with advanced cirrhotic-stage primary sclerosing cholangitis are at increased risk for developing hepatocellular carcinoma and should be screened for hepatocellular carcinoma as well as for cholangiocarcinoma prior to orthotopic liver transplantation.\n \nThe purpose of this study is to examine whether or not well differentiated (w-d) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is indeed clinically early cancer. Seventy six patients with solitary small HCCs up to 3 cm in diameter, who underwent hepatectomy, were observed for at least 2 years for possible recurrence. These patients were divided into two groups The histological analysis revealed that w-d HCCs had lower incidences of fibrous capsule formation (P<0.01), when compared to l-d HCCs. There were no significant differences in the incidence of intrahepatic metastasis, or portal vein invasion. In a resected specimen of w-d HCC, barium sulfate and gelatin were injected into portal vein and a transparent specimen was made. The transparent specimen showed that the portal vein in the tumor seemed to be intact. Microscopically, cancer cell infiltration into the fibrous frame of the portal tract was present. There were no significant differences in the disease free survival between the two groups. An analysis of tumor volume doubling time in recurrent foci suggested that minute cancerous foci had been present at the time of operation. W-d HCCs were clinically demonstrated not to be early cancer, because there was no significant difference in disease free survival between the patients with w-d and l-d HCCs.\n"}]}]}}

Retrospective cohort study. Three northern California family planning clinics. All women with abnormal Pap smear results referred for initial colposcopy and a random sample of those referred for repeated Pap smear. Medical records were located and reviewed for 90 of 107 women referred for colposcopy and 153 of 225 women referred for repeated Pap smears. Routine clinic protocols for follow-up--telephone call, letter, or certified letter--were applied without regard to the type of abnormality seen on a Pap smear or recommended examination. Documented adherence to follow-up within 8 months of an abnormal result. Attempts to contact the patients for follow-up, adherence to follow-up recommendations, and patient characteristics were abstracted from medical records. The probability of adherence to follow-up vs the number of follow-up attempts was modeled with survival analysis. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine multivariate relationships related to adherence. The rate of overall adherence to follow-up recommendations was 56.0% (136/243). Adherence to a second colposcopy was not significantly different from that to a repeated Pap smear (odds ratio, 1.40; 95% confidence interval, 0.80-2.46). The use of as many as 3 patient reminders substantially improved adherence to follow-up. Women without insurance and women attending 1 of the 3 clinics were less likely to adhere to any follow-up recommendation (hazard ratio for no insurance, 0.43 [95% confidence interval, 0.20-0.93], and for clinic, 0.35 [95% confidence interval, 0.15-0.73]). Adherence to follow-up was low in this family planning clinic population, no matter what type of follow-up was advised. Adherence was improved by the use of up to 3 reminders. Allocating resources to effective methods for improving adherence to follow-up of abnormal results may be more important than which follow-up procedure is recommended.\n \nThe 2001 American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology Consensus Guidelines recommend that women who have Papanicolaou (Pap) smears diagnosed as atypical squamous cells (ASC), cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) (ASC-H) should be referred for immediate colposcopic examination. The objective of this pilot study was to evaluate whether reflex human papillomavirus (HPV)-DNA testing performed on smears diagnosed as ASC-H may obviate the need for immediate colposcopic examination. All ThinPrep Pap smears that were diagnosed as ASC-H or atypical squamous metaplastic cells (ASMT) between 2001-2003 and that had HPV-DNA testing and subsequent histologic and/or cytologic follow-up were evaluated. Those smears that were diagnosed as ASMT were reviewed and reclassified under the 2001 Bethesda System as either ASC of undetermined significance (ASCUS) or ASC-H. Smears that were diagnosed as ASCUS were excluded from the study. The study included of 48 smears that were diagnosed as ASC-H. All patients with biopsy-proven HSIL had positive high-risk (HR)-HPV results (100% negative predictive value). Approximately 80% of patients with ASC-H who had biopsy-proven, low-grade intraepithelial lesion on follow-up had positive HR-HPV results. Among the patients who had ASC-H with negative follow-up, 50% had positive HR-HPV results, and 50% had negative HR-HPV results. Among patients with ASC-H, a negative HR-HPV result was found to be an excellent predictor of the absence of HSIL. The results of this pilot study suggested that HPV-DNA testing may serve as a means to better select which patients with ASC-H on Pap smear should undergo colposcopic examination. This approach potentially may reduce medical costs and eliminate the need for routine colposcopic examination among patients with ASC-H Pap smears.\n"}]}]}}

The traditional cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide-based method was modified for DNA isolation from pollen. Taxon-specific DNA sequences were identified via bioinformatics or literature searches and were PCR amplified from the matching allergenic taxa; based on the sequences of PCR products, complementary or degenerate TaqMan probes were developed. The accuracy of the quantitative real-time PCR assay was tested on 3 plant species. The setup of a modified DNA extraction protocol allowed us to achieve good-quality pollen DNA. Taxon-specific nuclear gene fragments were identified and sequenced. Designed primer pairs and probes identified selected pollen taxa, mostly at the required classification level. Pollen was properly identified even when collected on routine aerobiological tape. Preliminary quantification assays on pollen grains were successfully performed on test species and in mixes. The real-time PCR approach revealed promising results in pollen identification and quantification, even when analyzing pollen mixes. Future perspectives could concern the development of multiplex real-time PCR for the simultaneous detection of different taxa in the same reaction tube and the application of high-throughput molecular methods.\n \nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the relative frequencies of sensitisation to four common inhalant allergens in two atopic populations suffering from asthma and/or rhinitis.

At both time periods patients with inhalant allergy and visiting our outpatient clinic were included. Quantification of IgE to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, birch, timothy grass, and mugwort was performed via the Phadebas RAST technique (Pharmacia, Brussels, Belgium). In patients suffering from respiratory allergy the frequency of birch pollen sensitisation significantly increased from 13% in the period 1975-1979 to 34% in the period 1992-1995. In contrast, the frequency of house dust mite, timothy grass pollen, and mugwort pollen sensitisation remained almost unchanged. The increase was not associated with an increase in the birch pollen count. Birch pollen hypersensitivity has almost tripled among atopic subjects during the last 2 decades. The exact mechanisms for this increase remain to be evaluated.\n"}]}]}}

Sixteen had hyperglycaemic DM, 12 had euglycaemic DM and 191 were in the non-DM group. The diagnostic power of PET in the hyperglycaemic DM, euglycaemic DM and non-DM groups did not differ significantly with regard to the identification of either metastatic lesions (AUC, 0.967/0.947/0.925, P>0.05) or primary tumours/local recurrence (AUC, 0.950/0.938/0.979, P>0.05).

Histologic and ultrastructural studies of normal corneas showed significant differences in the direction of collagen fibrils and/or the degree of lamellar interweaving in Bowman's layer, the anterior third of the corneal stroma, the posterior two-thirds of the corneal stroma, and Descemet's membrane. Cohesive tensile strength testing directly supported these morphologic findings as the stronger, more rigid regions of the cornea were located anteriorly and peripherally. This suggests that PRK and ASA, and secondarily SBK, should be biomechanically safer than conventional LASIK with regard to risk for causing keratectasia after surgery. Because adult human corneal stromal wounds heal slowly and incompletely, all excimer laser keratorefractive surgical techniques still have some distinct disadvantages due to inadequate reparative wound healing. Despite reducing some of the risk for corneal haze compared to conventional PRK, ASA cases still can develop corneal haze or breakthrough haze from the hypercellular fibrotic stromal scarring. In contrast, similar to conventional LASIK, SBK still has the short- and long-term potential for interface wound complications from the hypocellular primitive stromal scar. Ophthalmic pathology and basic science research show that SBK and ASA are improvements in excimer laser keratorefractive surgery compared to conventional LASIK or PRK, particularly with regard to maintaining corneal biomechanics and perhaps moderately reducing the risk of corneal haze. However, most of the disadvantages caused by wound healing issues remain.\n \nMicrocirculation and oxygen supply in cervical skin were measured with an optical, noninvasive method in patients with or without radiotherapy before neck dissection.

Parameters were evaluated for differences between patients with irradiation (24) and without (67) and patients with wound healing disorders (25) and without (66) (univariate or multivariate statistical analyses). Velocity at 2 mm was lower in irradiated skin (P = .016). Flow at 2 mm was higher in patients with wound healing disorders (P = .018). High flow values could help to identify patients at risk for cervical wound healing disorders.\n"}]}]}}

The study took place at a quaternary referral center that specializes in pelvic exenteration. Patients referred for pelvic exenteration from October 1994 to November 2012 were reviewed. Patients who did and did not receive radiotherapy as part of their primary rectal cancer treatment were compared. The main outcomes of interest were resection margins, overall survival, disease-free survival, and surgical morbidities. There were 108 patients, of which 87 were eligible for analysis. Patients who received radiotherapy for their primary rectal cancer (n = 41) required more radical exenterations (68% vs 44%; p = 0.020), had lower rates of clear resection margins (63% vs 87%; p = 0.010), had increased rates of surgical complications per patient (p = 0.014), and had a lower disease-free survival (p = 0.022). Overall survival and disease-free survival in patients with clear margins were also lower in the primary irradiated patients (p = 0.049 and p < 0.0001). This difference in survival persisted in multivariate analysis that corrected for T and N stages of the primary tumor.

Patients who previously received radiotherapy for primary rectal cancer treatment have worse oncologic outcomes than those who had not received radiotherapy after pelvic exenteration for locally recurrent rectal cancer.\n \nThe aim of this study was to examine the incidence of coexisting colorectal cancer in ulcerative colitis in a population of patients undergoing ileal pouch anal anastomosis. The frequency of rectal cancer in this population, surgical intervention, general outcomes and cancer recurrence are described. Data on 1850 patients undergoing restorative proctocolectomy from 1983 to 2001 were reviewed. Information was gathered from data in the department's pelvic pouch database, as well as pathology and surgical reports. Follow-up questionnaires routinely sent to patients as part of the database were included in the analysis to determine current functional status. Mean follow-up period was 7.5 years after surgery. Seventy patients had coexisting colorectal cancer at time of IPAA. 7 (10%) of cancers were incidental. Pre-operative duration of disease was 18.6 years. Twenty-six of the cancers were rectal cancers. The most common form of anastomosis in the rectal cancers was mucosectomy, especially in pre-operatively known rectal cancer or low lying dysplasia. Preferred surgical technique for rectal cancer in mucosal ulcerative colitis (UC) included high ligation of mesenteric vessels with radical colectomy and taped occlusion of the rectum with irrigation of the rectal stump with Turnbull solution prior to mucosectomy. Patients with Stage 3 cancers received postoperative chemotherapy. Post-operative radiation therapy was not commonly recommended. Five of 70 patients were deceased from metastatic colon cancer; 55 patients were confirmed alive with good to excellent pouch function with a follow-up range of 1-17 years. Restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis is a successful surgical approach for patients with coexisting colorectal cancer in UC. When the appropriate surgical technique is used in patients with colon or rectal cancer, along with adjuvant chemotherapy when appropriate, prognosis and function is very good.\n"}]}]}}

A total of 360 core needle biopsies was obtained from 169 breast lesions in 146 patients. Additional open breast biopsy was performed in 111 women (127/169 breast lesions); the remaining 42 lesions were followed up for at least 24 months. 3D ultrasound visualization of the needle in the postfiring position was used to classify the biopsy as central, marginal or outside the lesion.

A median of two core samples per lesion provided for all the lesions a sensitivity for malignancy of 96.9%, specificity of 100%, false-positive rate of 0% and false-negative rate of 3.1%, and for the excised lesions a sensitivity of 96.5%, specificity of 100%, false-positive rate of 0%, false-negative rate of 3.5% and an underestimation rate of 3.4%. 3D ultrasound validation of the postfiring needle position is an efficient adjunct to ultrasound-guided LCNB.

The aim of the study was to determine the feasibility of real-time 3D transesophageal echocardiography (RT 3D TEE) as the first-choice technique for noninvasive evaluation of the coronary ostium during TAVI. Retrospective study. University hospital. Fifty patients underwent MDCT the evening before surgery. RT 3D TEE was performed intraoperatively before valve deployment. The dataset from both of these examinations was digitally stored and evaluated. MDCT was performed in nonanesthetized patients; however, in the RT 3D TEE group, general anesthesia was established. The distances from the right coronary artery and the left coronary artery ostium were measured retrospectively. Bland-Altman Plots and linear regression analysis showed excellent correlation between the 2 methodologies; intraobserver and interobserver variance were calculated using analysis of variance. Krippendorff's \u03b1 indicated excellent agreement between the 2 observers (0.96 and 0.98) as well as between RT 3D TEE and MDCT (0.97 and 0.98). The observations showed that RT 3D TEE reliably can measure the coronary ostium distance from the aortic annulus. It is feasible and an alternative method for evaluating these measurements and thereby preventing contrast exposure during MDCT, which may jeopardize the safety of patients with pre-existing renal disease.\n"}]}]}}

Recurrence of groin metastases in vulvar cancer patients is assumed to be lethal. It is unknown if early detection of relapse and multimodal treatment strategies improve the outcome of patients with groin recurrence. Multicenter retrospective cohort study of patients with recurrent vulvar cancer who presented with groin and/or pelvic lymph node metastases between 2000 and 2014 at 3 tertiary referral hospitals. Our primary outcome was to assess survival after groin recurrence of vulvar cancer and the influence of multimodal treatment. All analyses were done using Stata 12 (Stata Corporation, College Station, Tex). Hazard ratios (HRs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals were calculated using a Cox proportional hazards model. We identified 30 patients with a median time from diagnosis to groin recurrence of 10 months. The median follow-up of patients who were alive at the time of analysis was 22 months (range, 9-123 months). A Kaplan-Meier estimate showed an overall survival rate of 50% after 7 years. Patients with multimodal groin relapse treatment performed better than those with single-mode treatment (HR, 0.25; P = 0.037). Lymph node metastases at diagnosis were also associated with lower survival (HR, 6.11; P = 0.020). We observed a trend toward lower survival with a tumor size greater than T1 (HR, 2.55; P = 0.111). The time from diagnosis to groin recurrence had no influence on survival (HR, 0.99; P = 0.561). Close follow-up visits for at least 2 years are important to detect recurrent disease in groin and pelvic lymph nodes. Treatment of recurrent groin metastases should no longer be considered as a palliative situation--given that one half of the patients will have long-term survival after multimodal treatment strategies.\n \nSynchronous liver metastases (SLM) occur in 20% of colorectal cancers (CRC). Resection of SLM and CLC can be undertaken at different centres (separate management, SM) or at the same centre (global management, GM). Retrospective study of SLM and CRC resections carried out during 01/2000 - 12/2006 by SM or GM, using a combined or delayed strategy. Morphologic characteristics and type of CRC and SLM resection were similar for the GM (n = 45) or SM (n = 66) groups. In patients with delayed liver resection (62 SM, 17 GM), chemotherapy prior to liver surgery was used in 92% and 38% of SM and GM patients (P < 0.0001) and the median delay between procedures was 212 and 182 days, respectively (P = 0.04). First step of liver resection was more often performed during colorectal surgery in the GM group (62 vs. 6% for SM, P < 0.0001) and the mean number of procedures (CRC+SLM) was lower (1.6 vs. 2.3, P = 0.003). Three-month mortality was 3% for GM and 0% for SM (n.s.). Overall survival rates were 67% and 51% for SM and GM at 3 years (n.s.), and 35 and 31% at 5 years (n.s.). Disease-free survival to 5 years was higher in SM patients (14% vs. 11%, P = 0.009). GM of CRC and SLM was associated with fewer procedures but did not influence overall survival. SM was associated with a longer delay and increased use of chemotherapy between procedures, suggesting that more rigorous selection of SM patients for surgery may explain the higher disease-free survival after SLM resection.\n"}]}]}}

However, eye movement closely interacts with motion perception. The known eye-tracking difficulties in schizophrenia patients may interact with their motion perception. Two speed discrimination experiments were conducted in a within-subject design. In experiment 1, the stimulus duration was 150 msec to minimize the chance of eye-tracking occurrence. In experiment 2, the duration was increased to 300 msec, increasing the possibility of eye movement intrusion. Regular eye-tracking performance was evaluated in a third experiment. At 150 msec, speed discrimination thresholds did not differ between schizophrenia patients (n = 38) and control subjects (n = 33). At 300 msec, patients had significantly higher thresholds than control subjects (p = .03). Furthermore, frequencies of eye tracking during the 300 msec stimulus were significantly correlated with speed discrimination in control subjects (p = .01) but not in patients, suggesting that eye-tracking initiation may benefit control subjects but not patients. The frequency of eye tracking during speed discrimination was not significantly related to regular eye-tracking performance. Speed discrimination, per se, is not impaired in schizophrenia patients. The observed abnormality appears to be a consequence of impairment in generating or integrating the feedback information from eye movements. This study introduces a novel approach to motion perception studies and highlights the importance of concurrently measuring eye movements to understand interactions between these two systems; the results argue for a conceptual revision regarding motion perception abnormality in schizophrenia.\n \nEpisodic memory is significantly impaired in people with schizophrenia. The precise cause of this impairment has yet to be determined, as the formation of episodic memories is dependent on other processes, some of which also show impairment in schizophrenia. One such process is closure, that is, the filling-in of missing information. Failure to close adequately incomplete stimuli may cause people with schizophrenia to store inadequate or piecemeal representations in memory. Forty people with schizophrenia and 21 healthy comparison subjects participated in the study. The experiment was divided into six blocks, each of which involved both an encoding and a recognition phase. During the encoding phase, 20 figures were presented sequentially and participants had to determine whether each was symmetric or asymmetric. These figures were either complete or fragmented at three different levels. In subsequent recognition phase, 40 abstract figures (20 new and 20 old) were presented. All figures were complete in this phase. Memory performance of both groups was affected similarly by fragmentation, with an additional increase in performance afforded by a slight fragmentation for participants with schizophrenia. Slight fragmentation may have induced a perceptual difficulty that was mild enough to increase visual processing without compromising it. Closure was thus not involved in the episodic memory deficit of people with schizophrenia.\n"}]}]}}

We present results of per-oral transgastric splenectomy in a porcine model. The goal of this study was to determine the technical feasibility of per-oral transgastric splenectomy using a flexible endoscope. We performed acute experiments on 50-kg pigs. All animals were fed liquids for 3 days prior to procedure. The procedures were performed under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation. The flexible endoscope was passed per orally into the stomach and puncture of the gastric wall was performed with a needle knife. The puncture was extended to create a 1.5-cm incision using a pull-type sphincterotome, and a double-channel endoscope was advanced into the peritoneal cavity. The peritoneal cavity was insufflated with air through the endoscope. The spleen was visualized. The splenic vessels were ligated with endoscopic loops and clips, and then mesentery was dissected using electrocautery. Endoscopic splenectomy was performed on six pigs. There were no complications during gastric incision and entrance into the peritoneal cavity. Visualization of the spleen and other intraperitoneal organs was very good. Ligation of the splenic vessels and mobilization of the spleen were achieved using commercially available devices and endoscopic accessories. Transgastric endoscopic splenectomy in a porcine model appears technically feasible. Additional long-term survival experiments are planned.\n \nThe British Committee for Standards in Haematology currently recommends concomitant splenectomy in children with mild hereditary spherocytosis (HS) undergoing cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstones. However, splenectomy is associated with a risk of life-threatening infection, particularly in young children. The aim of this study was to audit the outcome of the practice of uncoupling splenectomy and cholecystectomy in such patients. Children referred with symptomatic gallstones complicating HS between April 1999 and April 2009 were prospectively identified and reviewed retrospectively. During this period, the policy was to undertake concomitant splenectomy only if indicated for haematological reasons and not simply because of planned cholecystectomy. A total of 16 patients (mean age 10.4, range 3.7 to 16 years, 11 women) with HS and symptomatic gallstones underwent cholecystectomy. Three patients subsequently required a splenectomy for haematological reasons 0.8-2.5 years after cholecystectomy; all three splenectomies were performed laparoscopically. There were no postoperative complications in the 16 patients; postoperative hospital stay was 1-3 days after either cholecystectomy or splenectomy. The 13 children with a retained spleen remain under regular review by a haematologist (median follow-up 4.6, range 0.5 to 10.6 years) and are well and transfusion independent. The advice to perform a concomitant splenectomy in children with mild HS undergoing cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstones needs revisiting. In the era of minimal access surgery, the need for splenectomy in such children should be judged on its own merits.\n"}]}]}}

We highlighted the majority of the plants commonly involved with the female reproductive system including This study is a narrative review of studies of plants that are possible alternative treatments for FSD. The species described have clinical and popular uses in different cultures as well as medical indications for female reproductive disturbances, mainly in climacteric women. We have also analyzed the evidence level of clinical studies. The main outcome assessed is the efficacy of plants in improving the symptoms of FSD. There is little evidence from the literature to recommend the use of medicinal plants when treating FSD. The majority of studies with a strong level of evidence are associated with the treatment of the vasomotor symptoms of menopause. Ferula hermonis, Angelica sinensis, and Gingko biloba may be suggested for arousal disorder studies. Cimicifuga racemosa, Trifolium pratense, and Vitex agnus-castus may be recommended for several FSD. Humulus lupulus and Tribulus terrestris may help with desire disorder studies. Lepidium meyenii should be studied further. Studies of these plants indicate that they may be useful as a possible alternative and/or complementary approach for studies aimed at the treatment of FSD. At this time, however, this review cannot recommend a plant that has a strong enough level of evidence for treatment of FSD.

It is generally agreed that PM impairment occurs in patients with prefrontal lobes damage. To evaluate if there is a causal role of a deficit of executive abilities (failures of planning, set-shifting, selective attention, or working memory) over the PM impairment. We report a detailed investigation of PM and executive abilities in two patients with posttraumatic damage to prefrontal lobes who complained from a reduced compliance with appointments and daily routines. Laboratory tests confirmed a difficulty in fulfilling delayed intentions in response to the occurrence of critical events and elapsed time. In one patient, PM impairment was associated with poor performance on tests investigating planning, working memory, and mental shifting. The other patient performed in the normal range on all executive tests. Despite the frequent claim of a dependence of PM deficits from executive dysfunction, the reported cases demonstrate that this is not necessarily the case. The results are discussed in the light of current hypotheses relating PM impairment to other deficits that commonly occur as a result of damage to the prefrontal lobes.\n"}]}]}}

The control group is made up of 91 transplants, matched with those from the study group, whose donor and recipient were younger than 60 years. There were no differences between groups with regard to recipient age, sex, cause of death and renal function of the donor, hepatitis C and cytomegalovirus serologies, cold ischemia time, tubular necrosis, immediate diuresis, need for dialysis, human leukocyte antigen incompatibilities, hypersensitized patients, acute rejection, waiting time on dialysis, and days of admission.

In addition, coinfection of CMV and IE has not been reported. Therefore, the current study was initiated to determine whether CMV infection is a risk factor for developing of IE after kidney transplantation. In a retrospectively study, we analyzed the medical records of 3700 kidney recipients at two transplant centers in Iran, between January 2000 and June 2008 for infective endocarditis. During the study, 15 patients with IE hospitalized in our centers were included. The predominant causative microorganisms (60%) were group D non-enterococcal streptococci and enterococci. Patient survival rate in all recipients was 66% at 6 months. Data analysis showed no significant differences in 6 months patient survival from hospitalization between both groups with and without CMV infection (P=0.2). The presentation time of infective endocarditis in recipients with CMV coinfection was more likely to be early when compared to CMV negative coinfection patients (P=0.03). The present study indicates that CMV infection may lead to predispose to infective endocarditis after kidney transplantation. Rapid diagnosis, effective treatment, and prompt recognition of complications in kidney transplant recipients are essential to good patient outcome.\n"}]}]}}

In 2005, the Ghana Health Service piloted a strategy that involved using the integrated Community-based Health Planning and Services (CHPS) program and training Community Health Officers (CHOs) as midwives to address the gap in skilled attendance in rural Upper East Region (UER). The study assesses the feasibility of and extent to which the skilled delivery program has been implemented as an integrated component of the existing CHPS, and documents the benefits and challenges of the integrated program. We employed an intrinsic case study design with a qualitative methodology. We conducted 41 in-depth interviews with health professionals and community stakeholders. We used a purposive sampling technique to identify and interview our respondents. The CHO-midwives provide integrated services that include skilled delivery in CHPS zones. The midwives collaborate with District Assemblies, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and communities to offer skilled delivery services in rural communities. They refer pregnant women with complications to district hospitals and health centers for care, and there has been observed improvement in the referral system. Stakeholders reported community members' access to skilled attendants at birth, health education, antenatal attendance and postnatal care in rural communities. The CHO-midwives are provided with financial and non-financial incentives to motivate them for optimal work performance. The primary challenges that remain include inadequate numbers of CHO-midwives, insufficient transportation, and infrastructure weaknesses. Our study demonstrates that CHOs can successfully be trained as midwives and deployed to provide skilled delivery services at the doorsteps of rural households. The integration of the skilled delivery program with the CHPS program appears to be an effective model for improving access to skilled birth attendance in rural communities of the UER of Ghana.\n \nTo determine the impact of Florida's Medicaid Demonstration 4 years post-implementation on per member per month (PMPM) Medicaid expenditures and whether receiving care through HMOs versus provider service networks (PSNs) in the Demonstration was associated with PMPM expenditures. Florida Medicaid claims from two fiscal years prior to implementation of the Demonstration (FY0405, FY0506) and the first four fiscal years after implementation (FY0607-FY0910) from two urban Demonstration counties and two urban non-Demonstration counties. A difference-in-difference approach was used to compare changes in enrollee expenditures before and after implementation of the Demonstration overall and specifically for HMOs and PSNs. Claims data were extracted for enrollees in the Demonstration and non-Demonstration counties and collapsed into monthly amounts (N = 26,819,987 person-months). Among SSI enrollees, the Demonstration resulted in lower increases in PMPM expenditures over time ($40) compared with the non-Demonstration counties ($186), with Demonstration PSNs lowering PMPM expenditures by $7 more than HMOs. Savings were also seen among TANF enrollees but to a lesser extent. The Medicaid Demonstration in Florida appears to result in lower PMPM expenditures. Demonstration PSNs generated slightly greater reductions in expenditures compared to Demonstration HMOs. PSNs appear to be a promising model for delivering care to Medicaid enrollees.\n"}]}]}}

The prevalence of significant carotid stenosis was 5.8%. Univariate analysis confirmed that PVD (P=0.005), carotid bruit (P=0.003) and diabetes mellitus (P=0.05) were significant risk factors for stenosis.

Both off- and on-pump procedures produced excellent early clinical results with low mortality. An advantage of an off-pump operation was less postoperative morbidity; however, less complete revascularization introduced uncertainty about late results. A disadvantage of on-pump bypass was higher morbidity that seemed attributable to cardiopulmonary bypass.\n"}]}]}}

Based on the preoperative clinical stage assessed by computed tomography (CT), loss of DKK3 expression was predominantly associated with worse prognosis in patients with clinically node-negative advanced gastric cancer (AGC). The combination of DKK3 expression status and CT increased the accuracy of CT staging for predicting lymph node involvement from 71.5 to 80.0% in AGC patients. Loss of DKK3 protein expression was significantly associated with poor survival in patients with gastric cancer and was strongly correlated with the TNM stage. DKK3 might be a potential biomarker of lymph node involvement that can improve the predictive power of CT.\n"}]}]}}

We performed a 6-year (2006 to 2011) retrospective review of all trauma patients with blunt abdominal solid organ injuries. Patients were matched using propensity score matching in a 2:1:1 (early:intermediate:late) for age, gender, systolic blood pressure, Glasgow Coma Scale, Injury Severity Score, and type and grade of organs injured. Our primary outcome measures were A total of 116 patients (58 early, 29 intermediate, and 29 late) were included. There were no differences in age (P\u00a0=\u00a0.5), Injury Severity Score (P\u00a0=\u00a0.6), type (P\u00a0=\u00a0.1), and grade of injury of the organ (P\u00a0=\u00a0.6) between the 3 groups. There were 67 liver (43.2%), 63 spleen (40.6%), 49 kidney (31.6%), and 24 multiple solid organ (15.4%) injuries. There was no difference in operative intervention (P\u00a0=\u00a0.8) and postprophylaxis blood transfusion (P\u00a0=\u00a0.3) between the 3 groups. Early enoxaparin-based anticoagulation may be a safe option in trauma patients with blunt solid organ injury. This study showed no significant correlation between early anticoagulation and development of bleeding complications.\n \nPrior studies have demonstrated that transfusion of older stored blood is associated with an increased risk of multiple organ failure, infection, and death. These reports were primarily comprised of severely injured patients, and it remains unknown whether this phenomenon is observed in relatively less injured patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between the age of stored blood and the morbidity and mortality in a mild to moderately injured patient cohort. Blunt trauma patients with Injury Severity Score <25 admitted to a Trauma Intensive Care Unit during 7.5 years who received no blood during the first 48 hours of hospitalization were selected for inclusion. Patients who died within 48 hours of admission were excluded from analysis. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for the association between morbidity or mortality and the age and amount of blood transfused (>48 hours postadmission), adjusted for age, sex, injury severity, thoracic injury, mechanical ventilation, and transfusion volume. During 7.5 years, 1,624 patients met the study criteria. The mean Injury Severity Score was 14.4. Receipt of blood stored beyond 2 weeks was associated with mortality (OR 1.12 [CI 1.02-1.23]), renal failure (OR 1.18 [CI 1.07-1.29]), and pneumonia (OR 1.10 [CI 1.04-1.17]). No such associations were identified, however, concerning the transfusion of blood with a lesser storage age. In a mild to moderately injured intensive care unit patient cohort, the receipt of blood stored beyond 2 weeks was independently associated with mortality, renal failure, and pneumonia. The deleterious effect of older blood on patient outcome does not appear to be limited to the severely injured.\n"}]}]}}

In a preliminary observational study, we explored whether clinical outcome is improved in patients who are on treatment with statins when stroke occurs. We conducted a population-based case-referent study of 25- to 74-year-old stroke patients with, for each case of a patient who was on statin treatment at the onset of stroke (n=125), 2 referent patients who were not treated with statins but were matched for age, gender, year of onset, and stroke subtype (n=250). The unadjusted odds ratio for early discharge to home (versus late discharge or death) was 1.41 (95% CI 0.91 to 2.17) when patients on statin treatment were compared with referent stroke patients not on statins. Prognostic factors were, in general, more unfavorable among patients on statins. When this was adjusted for in a logistic regression model, the use of statins was a moderately strong but statistically nonsignificant predictor of discharge to home (multiple-adjusted odds ratio 1.42, 95% CI 0.90 to 2.22).

Negative binomial and logit models were fitted given that count and categorical variables were employed as outcome measures, respectively. Regardless of socio-economic and demographic factors, women enrolled in the NHIS make more antenatal visits compared with those not enrolled; however, there was no statistical association with the timing of the crucial first visit.

Earlier studies reported a higher incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) associated with cemented prostheses in elective total hip or knee arthroplasty. In addition, the hypercoagulable state after a traumatic femoral neck fracture and possible thrombogenic properties of bone cement could put these patients at greater risk for thromboembolism. We aimed to compare the incidence of DVT and progression to pulmonary embolism (PE) or mortality in cemented and uncemented hemiarthroplasty. The data of 271 patients treated with cemented or uncemented hemiarthroplasty after a traumatic displaced femoral neck fracture was retrospectively analysed for the incidence of DVT. The level of thrombosis, progression to PE and mortality were compared. There were 133 (49.1%) patients with cemented hemiarthroplasty, while 138 (50.9%) had uncemented hemiarthroplasty. The patients had an average age of 76.6 (range 53-99) years and 11 (4.1%) patients had DVT. There were no significant differences in development of DVT, level of thrombosis, PE and mortality regardless of whether a cemented or an uncemented prosthesis was used. Cemented hemiarthroplasty is not associated with higher risks of DVT, PE or mortality in patients with traumatic displaced femoral neck fracture.

Substitution with androgens at physiological levels improves sexual function in women who experience decreased sexual desire and androgen deficiency from surgical menopause, pituitary disease, and age-related decline in androgen production in the ovaries. Measuring bioactive testosterone is difficult and new methods have been proposed, including measuring the primary androgen metabolite androsterone glucuronide (ADT-G). The aim of this study was to investigate a possible correlation between serum levels of androgens and sexual desire in women and whether the level of ADT-G is better correlated than the level of circulating androgens with sexual desire. This was a cross-sectional study including 560 healthy women aged 19-65 years divided into three age groups. Correlations were considered to be statistically significant at P<0.05. Sexual desire was determined as the total score of the sexual desire domain of the Female Sexual Function Index. Total testosterone (TT), calculated free testosterone (FT), androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), and ADT-G were analyzed using mass spectrometry. Sexual desire correlated overall with FT and androstenedione in the total cohort of women. In a subgroup of women aged 25-44 years with no use of systemic hormonal contraception, sexual desire correlated with TT, FT, androstenedione, and DHEAS. In women aged 45-65 years, androstenedione correlated with sexual desire. No correlations between ADT-G and sexual desire were identified. In the present study, FT and androstenedione were statistically significantly correlated with sexual desire in the total cohort of women. ADT-G did not correlate more strongly than circulating androgens with sexual desire and is therefore not superior to measuring circulating androgens by mass spectrometry.\n \nScreening mammogram can decrease the mortality of breast cancer. Studies show that women avoid mammogram because of fear of pain, diagnosis, and radiation. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a radiolucent pad (MammoPad; Hologic Inc, Bedford [MA], US) during screening mammogram to reduce pain in Chinese patients and the possibility of glandular dose reduction. This case series was conducted in a private hospital in Hong Kong. Between November 2011 and January 2012, a total of 100 Chinese patients were recruited to our study. Left mammogram was performed without MammoPad and served as a control. Right mammogram was performed with the radiolucent MammoPad. All patients were then requested to complete a simple questionnaire. The degree of pain and discomfort was rated on a 0-10 numeric analogue scale. Significant reduction in discomfort was defined as a decrease of 10% or more. Of the 100 patients enrolled in this study, 66.3% of women reported at least a 10% reduction in the level of discomfort with the use of MammoPad. No statistical differences between age, breast size, and the level of discomfort were found. The use of MammoPad significantly reduced the level of discomfort experienced during mammography. Radiation dose was also reduced.\n"}]}]}}

The objective of the current study was to determine whether the survival of women with recurrent breast cancer has improved from 1974 to 2000. The authors analyzed the survival experience of 834 women who developed recurrent breast cancer between November 1974 and December 2000. All patients had been treated previously with adjuvant anthracycline-based protocols. Patients were divided into five consecutive groups based on year of breast cancer recurrence, and survival was compared across the five groups. Because some prognostic variables were divided unevenly divided among the cohorts, a multivariate model was created to determine the association of year of recurrence and survival after accounting for other prognostic factors. In the unadjusted analysis, there was a statistically significant improvement in survival across the five groups, and the more recent cohorts had longer survival (P < 0.001). Other variables that predicted longer survival after breast cancer recurrence included smaller initial tumor size, lower stage of disease, fewer lymph nodes involved, longer disease-free interval, estrogen receptor-positive tumors, and nonvisceral dominant site of disease recurrence. In the multivariate analysis, which adjusted for these prognostic factors, year of recurrence was associated with a trend toward improved survival, with a 1% reduction in risk for each increasing year. For these cohorts of patients, the authors present data suggesting that the prognosis for patients with recurrent breast cancer improved between 1974 and 2000.\n"}]}]}}

Patients were then assigned a Clinical Peripherality Index score based on the postcode of their GP's practice to define rurality. Patient data were compared across the six defined levels of clinical peripherality by ANOVA. Mean patient age was 73 \u00b1 13 years, and 336 (54%) were male. The peak gradient across the valve was 41.1 \u00b1 26.7 mmHg. There was no association between the level of clinical peripherality and the stage of aortic stenosis at presentation, age or gender (all  >0.05). There was no urban-rural gradient in the severity of aortic stenosis at presentation in this remote Scottish cohort. This suggests that patients with this condition in remote areas do not present later in their disease trajectory.\n"}]}]}}

The research is a cross-sectional study conducted among 104 patients with cardiomyopathy diagnosis and patients at risk for cardiomyopathy. Patients completed 3 different questionnaires Forty-eight patients had a diagnosis of primary or secondary cardiomyopathy, and 56 patients, with conditions predisposing to cardiomyopathy. Eighty-five percent of the considered population is surfing the Internet to obtain nonspecific information about health in general, and the 65% use it to look specifically for heart disease. For both groups of patients with cardiomyopathy and at risk for cardiomyopathy, online health information seeking behavior is associated with substantially lower state anxiety levels (P = .041). Web use, as a source of health information, has been shown to be associated with anxiety reduction in patients with or at risk for cardiomyopathy, suggesting that Internet technology can be a useful instrument due to its informational power and its potentially therapeutic value.\n \nTreatment of rectal cancer in North America has been associated with lower rates of sphincter-preserving surgery in comparison with other regions. It is unclear if these lower rates are due to patient, tumor, or treatment factors; thus, the potential to increase the use of sphincter-preserving surgery is unknown. The aim of this study is to identify the factors associated with the use of sphincter-preserving surgery and to quantify the potential for an increase in sphincter preservation. This population-based retrospective cohort study used patient-level data collected through a comprehensive, standardized review of hospital inpatient and outpatient medical records and cancer center charts. This study was conducted in all hospitals providing rectal cancer surgery in a Canadian province. All patients with a new diagnosis of rectal cancer from July 1, 2002 to June 30, 2006 who underwent potentially curative radical surgery were included. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with receiving a permanent colostomy. Patients were categorized as having received an appropriate or potentially inappropriate colostomy based on a priori determined patient, tumor, operative, and pathologic criteria. Of 466 patients who underwent radical surgery, 48% received a permanent colostomy. There was significant variation in the rate of sphincter-preserving surgery among the 10 hospitals that provided rectal cancer care (12%-73%, p = 0.0001). On multivariate analysis, male sex, low tumor height, and increasing tumor stage were associated with the receipt of a permanent colostomy. Among patients who received a permanent stoma, 65 of 224 (29%) patients received a potentially inappropriate stoma. On multivariate analysis, male sex and treatment in a medium- or low-volume hospital was associated with the receipt of a potentially inappropriate colostomy. This study was limited by its retrospective design. These data suggest that the receipt of a permanent colostomy by many patients with rectal cancer may be inappropriate, and there is potential to increase the use of sphincter-preserving surgery in patients with rectal cancer.\n"}]}]}}

The aim of this study is to determine predictors of early alcohol use that can easily be detected in Preventive Child Healthcare (PCH). We obtained data from the first two waves on 1261 Dutch adolescents who participated in TRAILS (TRacking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey) at ages 10-14 years and from the PCH records regarding ages 4-10 years. Early adolescence alcohol use (age 10-14 years) was defined as alcohol use at least once at ages 10-12 years (wave 1) and at least once in the previous 4 weeks at ages 12-14 years (wave 2). Predictors of early alcohol use concerned parent and teacher reports at wave 1 and PCH registrations, regarding the child's psychosocial functioning, and parental and socio-demographic characteristics. A total of 17.2% of the adolescents reported early alcohol use. Predictors of early alcohol use were teacher-reported aggressive behaviour [odds ratios (OR); 95% confidence interval (CI) A limited set of factors was predictive for early alcohol use. Use of this set may improve the detection of early adolescence alcohol use in PCH.\n \nComorbid major depression (MD) and alcohol use disorder (AUD), particularly in adolescents, have been shown to be associated with poorer subsequent MD outcomes. Longitudinal data were used to model associations between a four-level classification of MD/AUD during the period 15-18 years (neither; MD-only; AUD-only; comorbid MD/AUD) and MD over the period 18-35 years. These associations were then adjusted for confounding by a series of factors measured in childhood. The three disorder groups had rates of adult MD during the period 18-35 years that were significantly (p<.05) higher than that of the group with no disorder. Furthermore, those in the comorbid MD/AUD group had significantly (p <.05) higher rates of adult MD than those in the AUD-only group, and marginally (p <.10) higher rates of adult MD than those in the MD-only group. After adjustment for confounding, the difference in rates of adult MD between the MD-only group and the MD/AUD group were no longer statistically significant. The factors that explained the associations were gender, childhood behavior problems, and exposure to physical and sexual abuse. The data were obtained by self-report, and may have been subject to biases. The results of these analyses suggest that marginally higher rates of depression to age 35 amongst the comorbid MD/AUD group were explained by increased exposure to adverse childhood circumstances amongst members of the comorbid group. Adolescent MD/AUD comorbidity is likely to be a risk marker, rather than a causal factor in subsequent MD.\n"}]}]}}

The purpose of this study was to determine if there is an improvement in the quality of life in patients undergoing breast reduction surgery, and whether breast volume or patient size influences this outcome. A retrospective chart review was performed on 600 consecutive patients at a single institution from 2000 to 2010. Patients were mailed The Breast Q questionnaire to complete. Demographic, surgical, and clinical data were collected and entered into a database. Descriptive statistical analyses were conducted using SAS Software version 9.1.3 with statistical significance determined at P<0.05. A total of 178 surveys were returned and included in our study (a response rate of 29.6%). Patient data included a mean BMI of 28.3 (4.6) kg/m, and mean total amount of breast tissue removed of 1220.9 (665.4) g. The primary indications for patients having breast surgery were for symptomatic macromastia (85%), asymmetry (5.6%), and for cosmesis (2.5%). The Breast Q questionnaire demonstrated patients overwhelmingly agreed that they were satisfied with their breast surgery. The mean response was 2.8 with a standard deviation (SD) of 0.47 (where 1, disagree; 2, somewhat agree; and 3, definitely agree). Patient BMI and total amount of breast tissue removed had a statistically significant positive correlation (0.479; P<0.0001). There was no statistically significant difference between the amount of total breast tissue removed and patient response (P=0.57). The study supports a positive outcome after breast reduction surgery. Over 95% of the patients surveyed were satisfied and would do it again. It demonstrates the improvement of the patient's quality of life regardless of the amount of breast tissue removed. Furthermore, it suggests that the size and weight of the patient has no impact on this outcome. As we face new government and insurance restrictions for surgeries that have both cosmetic and reconstructive value, patient reported outcome studies may have an influence on future third-party payer.\n \nThe aim of study was to evaluate the importance of induced abortions for reproduction medicine in Czech Republic. Demographic analysis of data published by EUROSTAT and Czech statistical office. Department of Demography and Geodemography Faculty of Science, Charles University Prague. Widespread use of the liberal abortion law in socialist countries contributed to the decline of fertility rates only to the replacement level. In the Czech Republic total fertility rate dropped below 1.3 in 1995 and it did not increase above 1.5 children per woman till 2007. The increased use of modern contraceptive methods that results in a sharp decline in fertility and in a significant decrease of induced abortions can be documented. The total abortion rate fell from 1.54 abortions per a woman in 1990 to 0.34 in 2007. The proportion of women aged 15-49 years who were prescribed oral contraception increased from 4 percent in 1990 to 48 percent in 2007. An induced abortion is still used largely as a way to avoid birth of additional children by women who already have the number of children they want. This is in sharp contrast with the situation in the majority of Western European countries in which abortion is used mainly by teen-age girls whose attempts to avoid pregnancy have failed. In contrast to other demographic characteristics which classify the Czech Republic to Eastern Europe, the level of induced abortion rate is comparable with the levels observed in some Western European countries.\n"}]}]}}

A significant reduction in the \"no-flow-time\", quantitatively better chest compressions and an improved quality of ventilation can be demonstrated during CPR using supraglottic airway devices (SADs). Previous studies have demonstrated the ability of inexperienced persons to operate SADs after brief instruction. The aim of this pilot study was to determine whether an instruction manual consisting of four diagrams enables laypersons to operate a Laryngeal Mask Supreme\u00ae (LMAS) in the manikin. An instruction manual of four illustrations with speech bubbles displaying the correct use of the LMAS was designed. Laypersons were handed a bag containing a LMAS, a bag mask valve device (BMV), a syringe prefilled with air and the instruction sheet, and were asked to perform and ventilate the manikin as displayed. Time to ventilation was recorded and degree of success evaluated. A total of 150 laypersons took part. Overall 145 participants (96.7%) inserted the LMAS in the manikin in the right direction. The device was inserted inverted or twisted in 13 (8.7%) attempts. Eight (5.3%) individuals recognized this and corrected the position. Within the first 2 minutes 119 (79.3%) applicants were able to insert the LMAS and provide tidal volumes greater than 150 ml (estimated dead space). Time to insertion and first ventilation was 83.2 \u00b1 29 s. No significant difference related to previous BLS training (P = 0.85), technical education (P = 0.07) or gender could be demonstrated (P = 0.25). In manikin laypersons could insert LMAS in the correct direction after onsite instruction by a simple manual with a high success rate. This indicates some basic procedural understanding and intellectual transfer in principle. Operating errors (n = 91) were frequently not recognized and corrected (n = 77). Improvements in labeling and the quality of instructional photographs may reduce individual error and may optimize understanding.\n \nPropofol has been found to depress the laryngeal reflexes. We studied whether this property could be utilized to relieve laryngeal spasm. This study was conducted over a period of 3 years, and included children aged 3-10 years, ASA status I and II. Most of the children were undergoing minor surgical procedures, under general anaesthesia with Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA trade mark ) and caudal epidural analgesia. During this period, 20 patients developed laryngeal spasm on removal of the LMA at the end of surgery. Initially, they all were treated with 100% O2, with gentle positive pressure ventilation. Out of 20 patients, seven responded well with 100% O2 and gentle positive pressure ventilation. The remaining 13 were treated with a small dose of propofol (0.8 mg.kg-1 body weight). Laryngeal spasm was relieved successfully in 10 patients and three patients required intubation to improve their oxygenation. Propofol in a small dose (0.8 mg.kg-1 body weight) was a useful drug to relieve laryngeal spasm in most children (76.9%) following the removal of the LMA. Because it was not found to be effective in all patients, succinylcholine still has a role to play in critical conditions. However, we recommend propofol as a suitable alternative for relieving laryngeal spasm in situations where succinylcholine is contraindicated.\n"}]}]}}

The sample comprised of 100 autopsy specimens from South Indian population. INA was measured using software-aided processing of digital photographs. Length of the ISON was measured on each side using Vernier calipers. RAPL of the OC was noted during dissection. These were analysed with statistical methods. RAPL of OC was found to be prefixed in 24\u00a0%, normofixed in 65\u00a0% and postfixed in 11\u00a0%. The INA had an overall mean of 69.9\u00b0 (SD 9.29\u00b0). ANOVA confirmed statistically significant difference in INA among different groups; the corresponding mean value for the group was as follows The INA is wider when OC is prefixed, intermediate when normofixed and narrowed when postfixed. This observation throws light on the possibility of using INA as a marker of RAPL of OC. As INA can be measured in axial MRI sections, it can be used in differentiation of the cases with prefixed OC from others during pre-operative work up for pituitary surgeries and to identify individuals 'at risk' during subfrontal approach for pituitary lesions.\n"}]}]}}

Length of hospital stay (P\u2009=\u20090.0001) was longer and postoperative complications were more common in the elder patients. The clinical presentation of acute diverticulitis does not seem to be worse in the young population. Younger patients tend to have a more severe presentation on CT scan and more readmissions, but this did not translate to a more severe disease course.\n"}]}]}}

A sub-analysis pairing the groups by age and sex in a 1:1 ratio was carried out to reduce bias. A total of 336 patients infected with Helicobacter pylori were compared with 242 non-infected patients. The prevalence of infection in the patients with dyspeptic symptoms and no endoscopically detectable lesions was 58%. The initial analysis showed that the cases with dyspepsia and Helicobacter pylori infection were more frequently associated with overweight, obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, and metabolic syndrome, but the paired analysis nullified all these differences.

The sample consisted of 91 children and their parents being seen in the Pediatric Gastroenterology Clinic for concerns unrelated to overweight. Weight and height of the children were measured, and body mass index (BMI) was calculated. The children's BMI percentiles were categorized as underweight (<15th), normal (15th-85th), overweight (85th-95th), and obese (95th and above). The attending physician independently completed the body image and description scale and indicated the figure that most accurately represented the patient without reference to BMI standards. Accuracy of the patients', parents', and doctors' estimates were statistically compared. The sample population consisted of 6.4% underweight, 70.5% normal weight, 7.7% overweight, and 15.4% obese. Forty-four percent of parents underestimated children's body size using word descriptions and 47% underestimated using figures. Forty percent of the children underestimated their own body size using descriptions and 43% underestimated using figures. The physicians in this study had a higher percentage of correct estimates; however, they underestimated 33% of the patients using both word descriptions and figures. Some obese children were not recognized, and several average children were perceived as underweight. Many children underestimated their degree of overweight. Their parents and even their attending physicians shared this misperception. This study demonstrates the need to further educate physicians to recognize obesity and overweight so that they can counsel children and their families.\n"}]}]}}

We have studied 14 patients with CNFPAs. The response of alpha-SU to the administration of TRH was studied in each patient before the surgery. alpha-SU blood serum level increase over 50% of the baseline level after TRH treatment was considered to be significant. The patients were divided into 2 groups, each including 7 subjects. The first group included the patients with gonadotropinomas (tumors immunopositive for FSH and/or LH or their free subunits). The second group included the patients with adenomas immunonegative for gonadotropins and alpha-SU. The basal level of alpha-SU was elevated over the upper limit of normal range in two patients of the first group (gonadotroph adenomas) and in one in the second group. All but one patient from the first group and none of seven patients with tumors immunonegative for FSH, LH or alpha-SU, had a significant alpha-SU (over 50%) response to TRH. In three of seven patients with gonadotropins immunonegative tumors a decrease of alpha-SU serum level after TRH was observed.

We investigated for the first time whether in vitro combinations of 2ME with various chemotherapeutic compounds may result in an additive inhibitory effect on the proliferation of human ovary cancer cells. As a model two different human ovary cancer cell lines were used. All cell lines were incubated with equimolar concentrations of 2ME (0.8-25 microM) and the chemotherapeutics epirubicine, doxorubicine, paclitaxel, docetaxel, carboplatin, vinorelbine, 5-fluorouracil and mafosfamide. Proliferation was measured after four days using the ATP-chemosensitivity test. For both ovary cancer cell lines a significant additive effect of 2ME with epirubicine and carboplatin was observed at the lower concentration range of these chemotherapeutic substances. 2ME is able to enhance the antiproliferative activity of certain chemotherapeutics at pharmacological relevant concentrations. This estradiol metabolite is currently in a phase II trial in patients with refractary metastatic breast cancer and the tolerability has been shown to be very good. The combination of 2ME with chemotherapeutics may therefore offer a new clinically relevant treatment regimen for hormone-dependent cancer.\n \nSurgical excision of ovarian endometriomas in patients desiring pregnancy has recently been criticized because of the risk of damage to healthy ovarian tissue and consequent reduction of ovarian reserve. A correct diagnosis in cases not scheduled for surgery is therefore mandatory in order to avoid unexpected ovarian cancer misdiagnosis. Endometriosis is often associated with high levels of CA125. This marker is therefore not useful for discriminating ovarian endometrioma from ovarian malignancy. The aim of this study was to establish if the serum marker CA72-4 could be helpful in the differential diagnosis between ovarian endometriosis and epithelial ovarian cancer. Serums CA125 and CA72-4 were measured in 72 patients with ovarian endometriomas and 55 patients with ovarian cancer. High CA125 concentrations were observed in patients with ovarian endometriosis and in those with ovarian cancer. A marked difference in CA72-4 values was observed between women with ovarian cancer (71.0%) and patients with endometriosis (13.8%) (P < 0.0001). This study suggests that CA72-4 determination can be useful to confirm the benign nature of ovarian endometriomas in women with high CA125 levels.\n"}]}]}}

Assessing joint lines (JLs) by means of bony landmarks is inadvisable because of large variations in human anatomy. Because of the inherent symmetry of the human body, we hypothesised that JLs may be directly assessed by measuring the distances from the bony landmarks to the JL of the contralateral knee by means of radiographic images. Using scaled weight-bearing radiographs in anteroposterior view of both knees, two independent observers measured the distances from the fibular head, the medial and lateral epicondyle, and the adductor tubercle to the JL. A two-sided p value of \u22640.05 was considered statistically significant. Two hundred knees of 100 patients (50 men and 50 women) were examined. For the fibular head, the mean difference between the treated and the control knee was 0.0 mm with narrow confidence limits ranging from -1.1 to 1.1. As a new assessment method, we have suggested to assess the JL by means of radiographs of the contralateral knee. The most precise parameter was found to be the distance between the fibular head and the JL. The level of arthritis, age, gender, visibility of the landmarks, and misalignment did not influence measurement accuracy. This parameter is the first tibia-related landmark for assessing the JL, which advantageously corresponds to the tibia-first technique in revision surgery.

Prospectively, 50 knees were operated by total knee arthroplasty using a navigation-assisted gap-balancing technique. The offset-type-force-controlled-spreader-system was used for gap measurements. This commercially available instrument allows controllable tension in patella-reduced position. The mediolateral gaps of knee extension (0\u00b0) and flexion (90\u00b0) angle were recorded in three different patella positions; reduced, subluxated and everted. Any gap differences of more than 3 mm were considered as a meaningful difference. Correlation between the difference with the demographic data, preoperative radiologic alignment and intraoperative data was analysed. For statistical analysis, ANOVA and Pearson's correlation test were used. The gaps in patella eversion demonstrated smaller gaps both in knee extension and flexion position compared to the gaps of patella reduction position. The amount of decreased gaps was more definite in knee flexion position. Statistically significant difference was observed for the lateral gap of patella eversion compared to gap of patella reduction in knee flexion position (p < 0.05). There were notable cases of variability in knee flexion position. Significant portion of 12 (24 %) knees of patella subluxation and 33 (66 %) knees of patella evertion demonstrated either increased or decreased gaps in knee flexion position compared to the gaps of patella reduction position. The gaps in patella eversion demonstrated smaller gaps both in knee extension and flexion position compared to the gaps of patella reduction position. The amount of decreased gaps was more definite in knee flexion position. Therefore, the intraoperative patellar positioning has influence on the measurement of the joint gap. Keeping the patella in reduced position is important during gap balancing. I.\n"}]}]}}

Patients were divided into two groups, according to whether they had received an all-polyethylene inlay component (Inlay group) or a metal-backed onlay component (Onlay group). We explored the magnitude of mechanical alignment correction obtained in both groups. Mean postoperative mechanical alignment was significantly closer to neutral in the Onlay group (mean=2.8\u00b0; 95% CI=2.4\u00b0, 3.2\u00b0) compared to the Inlay group (mean=3.9\u00b0; 95% CI=3.4\u00b0, 4.4\u00b0) (R2=0.65; P=0.003), adjusting for gender, BMI, age, side and preoperative mechanical alignment (Fig. 2). Further exploration revealed that the thickness of the tibial polyethyelene insert had a significant effect on postoperative alignment when added to the model (R2=0.68; P=0.01). Patients who received a metal-backed Onlay tibial component obtained better postoperative mechanical alignment compared to those who received all-polyethylene Inlay prostheses. The thicker overall construct of Onlay prostheses appears to be an important determinant of postoperative alignment.

Exact definition of the posterior tibial slope (PTS) requires lateral radiographs of the lower limb. Only lateral knee radiographs are routinely obtained after TKA, however. The purpose of the present study therefore was to analyse the relationship between PTS measurement results on short and expanded lateral knee radiographs. The PTS was measured on 100 consecutive lateral radiographs of the lower limb using the mechanical and three diaphyseal axes with various distances below the tibial plateau. Significant differences between PTS results were found for all three diaphyseal axes, with the smallest differences and the strongest correlation for a diaphyseal axis at 16 and 20\u00a0cm below the tibial plateau. Using short distances below the tibial plateau (6 and 10\u00a0cm) resulted in an overestimation of the PTS of 3\u00b0, on average. The PTS measurements in long lateral knee radiographs are more accurate compared to short radiographs. On short lateral knee radiographs, only a estimation of the PTS can be carried out.

All these variables were submitted to univariate and multivariate analysis to establish their impact on survival. Only tumour size appeared to be significantly different between the 3 groups. On univariate analysis, invasion of the perirenal fat, lymph node involvement, distant metastases and VEGF expression were significantly associated with survival (p < 0.01). On multivariate analysis, lymph node involvement, distant metastases and VEGF expression (OR 6.07) were identified as independent predictive factors of survival.

Associations with outcome were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression. There were 531 deaths from RCC at a median of 1.5 years following nephrectomy. Patients with pT3b RCC and level I, II or III tumor thrombus were significantly more likely to die of RCC compared to patients with pT3b RCC and level 0 tumor thrombus (risk ratio 1.62, p <0.001). Patients with peripheral perinephric or renal sinus fat invasion were also more likely to die of RCC compared to patients without fat invasion (risk ratio 1.87, p <0.001).

This reclassification significantly improved prediction of death from RCC compared with the current classification (c indexes of 0.61 versus 0.55, respectively).

A high proportion of cases were unemployed (39.4%, n = 106). Cases were also more likely to be single compared to the general population (74.2% vs 55.5%). Self-destructive behaviour was evident in 77% of deaths (n = 206). Alcohol and drug use are important contributory factors to injury and poisoning deaths. More research is needed into the effects of unemployment and being single on the health of young men, and to investigate the motivations behind risk taking and self-destructive behaviour.\n \nThe incidence of HIV and STIs increased among men who have sex with men (MSM) visiting our STI clinic in Amsterdam. Interestingly, HIV increased mainly among older (> or =35 years) MSM, whereas infection rates of rectal gonorrhoea increased mainly in younger men. To explore this discrepancy we compared trends in STIs and HIV in a cohort of young HIV negative homosexual men from 1984 until 2002. The study population included 863 men enrolled at < or =30 years of age from 1984 onward in the Amsterdam Cohort Studies (ACS). They had attended at least one of the 6 monthly follow up ACS visits at which they completed a questionnaire (including self reported gonorrhoea and syphilis episodes) and were tested for syphilis and HIV. Yearly trends in HIV and STI incidence and risk factors were analysed using Poisson regression. Mean age at enrollment was 25 years. The median follow up time was 4 years. Until 1995 trends in HIV and STI incidence were concurrent, however since 1995 there was a significant (p<0.05) increase in syphilis (0 to 1.4/100 person years (PY)) and gonorrhoea incidence (1.1 to 6.0/100 PY), but no change in HIV incidence (1.1 and 1.3/100 PY). The incidence of syphilis and gonorrhoea has increased among young homosexual men since 1995, while HIV incidence has remained stable. Increasing STI incidence underscores the potential for HIV spread among young homosexual men. However, several years of increasing STIs without HIV, makes the relation between STI incidence and HIV transmission a subject for debate.\n"}]}]}}

This approach is controversial, with critics highlighting the temporary nature of remissions and the potential for adverse effects. There have been few reports of the long-term outcome of those patients who do respond. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical outcome of all patients treated with cyclosporin at our institution over the past five years. We conducted a retrospective study of 46 patients who presented to a tertiary referral center. Initial responders were those who avoided colectomy; a sustained response was defined as a remission that lasted while the patient was taking oral cyclosporin and for three months after this therapy was discontinued. Thirty-two (69 percent) of 46 patients had an initial response to therapy, and 50 percent met criteria for a sustained response. Eleven of 23 sustained responders subsequently relapsed. At a mean of 22 months' follow-up, 26 percent of patients remain well and have never relapsed. Serious infective complications occurred in two patients, possibly attributable to therapy. No factors predictive of a likely response were identifiable on retrospective analysis. This study confirms the efficacy of cyclosporin in the management of severe ulcerative colitis. Although many initial responders subsequently relapse, such patients may benefit from having even a short time to adjust to the need for surgery. A substantial minority (26 percent) of all patients treated remain in long-term remission.\n \nTo determine whether successful completion of the Perinatal Education Programme (PEP) improves obstetric practice. The three midwife obstetric units (MOUs) in a health district of Mpumalanga were included in the study. Two MOUs enrolled in the PEP and the third did not. A 'before-and-after' study design was used to assess any changes in practice, and to monitor whether any changes occurred in the district during the time of the study; data were also collected at the third MOU. Data were collected by scoring of the obstetric files after the patient had delivered. We ascertained whether the obstetric history, syphilis testing, blood group testing, haemoglobin measurement and uterine growth assessment were performed during antenatal care along with whether appropriate action was taken. For intrapartum care, estimation of fetal weight, the performance of pelvimetry, blood pressure monitoring, urine testing, evaluation of head above pelvis, fetal heart rate monitoring, monitoring of contractions and plotting of cervical dilatation, and whether the appropriate actions were taken, were assessed. Eight of the 13 midwives at the two MOUs completed the PEP and all demonstrated an improvement in knowledge. Case notes of 303 patients from the various clinics were studied. There was no change in the referral patterns of any of the clinics during the study period. The obstetric history was well documented, but in no group was there a satisfactory response to a detected problem; appropriate action was taken in between 0% and 12% of cases. Syphilis testing was performed in 56-82% of cases, with no difference between the groups. The haemoglobin level was measured in only 4-15% of patients, with no difference before or after completion of the PEP. Where a problem in uterine growth was detected, an appropriate response occurred in 0-8% of patients and no difference before or after completion of the PEP was ascertained. In all groups, estimation of fetal weight and pelvimetry were seldom performed, the urine and fetal heart rate documentation were moderately well done and the blood pressure monitoring, assessment of head above pelvis, monitoring of contractions and plotting of cervical dilatation were usually performed. No differences before or after the PEP were detected. Where problems were detected, appropriate actions taken during labour improved, but not significantly. Completion of the obstetric manual of the PEP improved the knowledge of the midwives but no alteration in practice was detected.\n"}]}]}}

In earlier work from this unit, we used correlations between autoCPAP pressure and both OSA severity and obesity, to construct an algorithm to estimate the fixed CPAP pressure a patient required for subsequent clinical use. We wished to discover if these relationships could be reliably extended to a much more obese group. We performed a prospective cohort study in an obese population. Measurements of obesity were made, OSA severity was recorded, and the 95th centile autoCPAP pressure was recorded during 1\u00a0week of autoCPAP. Spearman's rank correlation was performed between measurements of obesity and autoCPAP pressure, and between OSA severity and autoCPAP pressure. Fifty-four obese individuals (median body mass index (BMI) 43.0\u00a0kg/m(2)), 52\u00a0% of whom had OSA (apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI)\u2009\u2265\u200915), had a median 95th centile autoCPAP pressure of 11.8\u2009cmH2O. We found no significant correlation between autoCPAP pressure and neck circumference, waist circumference or BMI. There was a moderate correlation between autoCPAP pressure and OSA severity (AHI r\u2009=\u20090.34, p\u2009=\u20090.02; oxygen desaturation index (ODI) r\u2009=\u20090.48, p\u2009<\u20090.001). In this population, neither BMI nor neck circumference nor waist circumference is predictive of autoCPAP pressure. Therefore, the previously derived algorithm does not adequately predict the fixed CPAP pressure for subsequent clinical use in these obese individuals. In addition, some subjects without OSA generated high autoCPAP pressures, and thus, the correlation between OSA severity and autoCPAP pressure was only moderate.\n \nTo investigate polysomnographic and anthropomorphic factors predicting need of high optimal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Retrospective data analysis. Three hundred fifty-three consecutive obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients who had a successful manual CPAP titration in our sleep disorders unit. The mean optimal CPAP was 9.5 +/- 2.4 cm H2O. The optimal CPAP pressure increases with an increase in OSA severity from 7.79 +/- 2.2 in the mild, to 8.7 +/- 1.8 in the moderate, and to 10.1 +/- 2.3 cm H2O in the severe OSA group. A high CPAP was defined as the mean + 1 standard deviation (SD; > or =12 cm H2O). The predictor variables included apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), age, sex, body mass index (BMI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT). High CPAP was required in 2 (6.9%), 6 (5.8%), and 63 (28.6%) patients with mild, moderate, and severe OSA, respectively. On univariate analysis, AHI, BMI, ESS score, and the proportion of males were significantly higher in those needing high CPAP. They also have a lower MSLT mean. On logistic regression, the use of high CPAP was 5.90 times more frequent (95% confidence interval 2.67-13.1) in severe OSA patients after adjustment for the other variables. The area under the receiver operator curve was 72.4%, showing that the model was adequate. Severe OSA patients are much more likely to need high CPAP levels. However, because of the low positive predictive value (only 28.6%), the clinical value of such information is limited. ESS and MSLT did not increase the predictive value for the need for high CPAP.\n"}]}]}}

Risks for sonographic short cervical length and recurrent SPTB were compared between women based on the clinical presentation of their prior preterm birth. Log-linear regression was used to control for confounders. Of 522 patients included in this study, 96 (18.4%) had prior ACD, 246 (47.1%) had prior PPROM, and 180 (34.5%) had prior PTL. Recurrent PTB occurred in 55.2% of patients with a history of ACD compared with 27.2% of those with PPROM and 32.2% with PTL (P = .001). The mean gestational age at delivery was significantly lower for those with a history of ACD (34.0 weeks) compared with women with prior PPROM (37.2 weeks) or PTL (37.0 weeks) (P = .001). The lowest mean cervical length prior to 24 weeks was significantly shorter in patients with a history of advanced cervical dilation when compared with the other clinical presentations. Patients with a history of ACD are at an increased risk of having recurrent preterm birth and cervical shortening in a subsequent pregnancy compared with women with prior preterm birth associated PPROM or PTL.\n \nIt is stated commonly that the earlier in pregnancy bacterial vaginosis is diagnosed, the greater is the increase in risk of preterm birth compared with women without bacterial vaginosis. However, this contention is based on small numbers of women. In this analysis of 12,937 women who were screened for bacterial vaginosis as part of a previously conducted clinical trial, the odds ratio of preterm birth (<7 weeks of gestation) for asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis-positive versus bacterial vaginosis-negative women was evaluated among women who were screened from 8 to 22 weeks of gestation. The odds ratio of preterm birth among bacterial vaginosis-positive versus bacterial vaginosis-negative women ranged from 1.1 to 1.6 and did not vary significantly according to the gestational age at which bacterial vaginosis was screened. The odds ratio for preterm birth did not vary significantly by gestational age at diagnosis when bacterial vaginosis was subdivided into Gram stain score 7 to 8 or 9 to 10. Although bacterial vaginosis was associated with an increased risk of preterm birth, the gestational age at which bacterial vaginosis was screened for and diagnosed did not influence the increase.\n"}]}]}}

This can be done either (i) acutely during the clamp study using high-dose insulin infusion, or (ii) slowly overnight preceding the clamp study using a low-dose insulin infusion. We assessed whether the choice of either of these methods to obtain euglycaemia biases subsequent assessment of glucose metabolism and insulin action. We studied seven obese Type 2 diabetic patients twice Basal plasma glucose levels (mean +/- sd) were 5.5 +/- 0.5 and 10.7 +/- 2.9 mmol/l in the + ON and - ON studies, respectively, and were clamped at -5.5 mmol/l. Basal rates of glucose production (GP) were similar in the + ON and - ON studies, 83 +/- 13 vs. 85 +/- 14 mg m-2 min-1 (NS), whereas basal rates of glucose disappearance (Rd) were lower in the + ON than in the - ON study, 84 +/- 8 vs. 91 +/- 11 mg m-2 min-1 (P = 0.02).

Because lysosomotropic amines can suppress major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigen presentation, their mechanism of action is potentially different from current immune suppressant drugs used to control GVHD such as cyclosporine. We investigated the use of cyclosporine and the lysosomotropic amines chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in combination for additive or synergistic immunosuppression on T-cell responses in vitro to MiHC and MHC in mice. We found that similar concentrations of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine suppress the T-cell response to MiHC in mice (C57BL/6 anti-BALB.B) and that lysosomotropic amines in combination with cyclosporine result in synergistic suppression of a proliferative response to MiHC. Similar suppression and synergy appear to be present in an alloreactive response (C57BL/6 anti-BALB/c). Direct inhibition by chloroquine of T-cell proliferative responses induced by anti-CD3epsilon in the absence of antigen-presenting cells is present at higher concentrations than that required to suppress responses to MiHC or MHC. Chloroquine appears to induce decreased T-cell viability at high concentrations. This effect does not appear to be due to decreased T-cell production of interleukin-2 or interferon-gamma. At lower concentrations (<25 microg/ml), chloroquine can also decrease the ability of antigen-presenting cells to stimulate an a C57BL/6 anti-BALB/c T-cell response and can inhibit MHC class II expression after activation with lipopolysaccharide. Lysosomotropic amines in combination with cyclosporine appear to be synergistic in the suppression of T-cell proliferation to MiHC and MHC. Use of chloroquine in combination with cyclosporine may result in improved control of GVHD.\n \nAn association between posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) and cyclosporine A (CsA) and OKT3 has often been postulated on the basis of retrospective studies, although a randomized study with PTLD as the endpoint will probably never be performed. Because focus on PTLD coincided with the use of these drugs, a bias could be suspected. In a retrospective, nonrandomized study, we reevaluated all lymphoma-like lesions arising in kidney-transplant patients grafted at our center during 1969 to 1998 and observed up to 2002. Case pathology was reviewed, and an association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection (and latency pattern) was assessed. We did not find any significant difference in the incidence of PTLDs when comparing the prednisolone/azathioprine, and CsA eras (P=0.89), the periods before or after OKT3 (P=0.61), and those before or after antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) (P=0.22). Occurrence time was shorter in the CsA (P=0.059), OKT3 (P=0.007), and ALG (P=0.007) eras. In the OKT3 era, 182 patients received, and 224 did not receive, OKT3; after the same observation time, there had been eight and five PTLDs, respectively (P=0.34). The use of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) was associated with a reduction in the number of PTLDs (P=0.01). EBV was detected in 16 of 21 (76%) cases. We found no evidence to implicate any one drug regime preferentially in the development of PTLDs. The risk of developing PTLD seems to be a result of the whole transplantation process, which includes the antigenicity of the foreign graft, the immunosuppression resulting in inadequate cytotoxic T-cell activity, and the result of EBV infection.

The analysis is based on 122 of 143 previously untreated patients with NPC treated with radiation therapy at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center between 1983 and 1992. Excluded were 4 patients treated with palliative intent, 4 children, 12 patients not staged with CT, and 1 patient who died of a cerebrovascular accident prior to completion of treatment. The stage distribution was as follows The overall actuarial 2- and 5-year survival rates were 78 and 68%, respectively. Forty-nine patients (40%) had disease recurrence. Thirty-three (27%) had local regional failures; 19 at the primary site only, 8 in the neck and 6 in both. Local failure occurred in 31% of patients staged T4 compared to 13% of T1-T3 (p = 0.007). Sixteen patients failed at distant sites alone. Among Stage IV patients the 5-year actuarial rates for patients who did and did not receive induction chemotherapy were as follows While not providing conclusive evidence, this single institution experience suggests that neoadjuvant chemotherapy for Stage IV NPC patients improves both survival and disease control. Recurrence within the irradiated volume was the most prevalent mode of failure and future studies will evaluate regimens to enhance local regional control.\n \nPatients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) eligible for extrapleural pneumonectomy (EPP) may benefit from induction chemotherapy (CT) as historically described, or from induction-accelerated hemithoracic intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) as a potential alternative. However, the impact of the type of induction therapy on postoperative morbidity and mortality remains unknown. We performed a retrospective study including every patient who underwent EPP for MPM in our institution between January 2001 and December 2014. Patients without induction treatment (n = 7) or undergoing both induction CT and IMRT (n = 2) were then excluded. The remaining patients (study group) were divided according to the type of induction treatment in Group 1-CT and Group 2-IMRT. Major complications were defined by complications of Grade 3 or higher according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 4.0 guidelines. Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion was analysed as a number of packs, and dichotomized as <3 vs \u22653 packs. Plasma and platelet transfusion were analysed as a number of units, and dichotomized as no transfusion versus any plasma or platelet transfusion. Altogether, 126 patients (mean age 61.3 \u00b1 8.1 years, males 82.5%, right side 60.3%, 90-day mortality rate 4.8%) accounted for the study group. Sixty-four patients were included in Group 1-CT and 62 patients were included in Group 2-IMRT. When compared with Group 1-CT, Group 2-IMRT was characterized by older patients (59.3 \u00b1 9.2 vs 63.3 \u00b1 8.3 years, P = 0.012), more right-sided resections (46.8 vs 74.1%, P = 0.003), more advanced disease (pathological stage IV In this large single-centre series of EPP for MPM, the implementation of induction IMRT was not associated with any significant increase in the surgical risks above and beyond induction CT. The switch from induction CT to induction IMRT was associated with resection in older patients with more advanced tumours, less transfusion requirements, comparable postoperative morbidity and 90-day mortality.\n"}]}]}}

Age at presentation, physical examination, ultrasonographic and intraoperative findings were recorded. Patients were followed after initial surgical intervention to determine the likelihood of developing a subsequent hydrocele or hernia. Thirty-seven patients were identified as presenting with neonatal torsion. Age of presentation averaged 3.5 days (range 1-14 days). Left-sided pathology was seen more commonly than the right, with a 25:12 distribution. All torsed testicles were nonviable. Twenty-two patients were noted to have a contralateral hydrocele at presentation. All hydroceles were opened through a scrotal approach at the time of contralateral scrotal fixation. No patient underwent an inguinal exploration to examine for a patent process vaginalis. None of the patients who presented with a hydrocele have developed a clinical hydrocele or hernia after an average 7.5 years (range 4.3-11.2) follow-up. We have demonstrated that approaching a contralateral hydrocele in cases of neonatal testicular torsion solely through a scrotal incision is safe and effective. Inguinal exploration was not performed in our study and our long-term results demonstrate that such an approach would have brought no additional benefit. In avoiding an inguinal approach we did not subject our patients to unnecessary risk of testicular or vasal injury. Contralateral hydrocele is commonly seen in cases of neonatal testicular torsion. In our experience this is a condition of minimal clinical significance and does not warrant formal inguinal exploration for treatment. This conservative management strategy minimizes the potential of contralateral spermatic cord injury in the neonate. The aims of the study were met.\n \nThe absence of a testis occurs for various reasons in children, but testicular prosthesis implantation in children is uncommon. The optimal time for prosthesis placement is still unclear, and its complication rate has been poorly studied in children. The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors of complications in cases of testicular prosthesis implantation in children. A monocentric, retrospective review was performed of children implanted with a testicular prosthesis between 2008 and 2014. All implantations were performed through an inguinal incision with a standardized procedure. Children were divided into two groups depending on the interval after orchiectomy Twenty-six patients (A, 15; B, 11) had a total of 38 testicular prostheses placements. Mean follow-up was 36.2 months. First surgery was performed at the mean age of 11.8 years (range 0-17.9) (A, 14.1; B, 8.1; P\u00a0=\u00a00.01) and testicular prosthesis implantation at the mean age of 14.7 years (range 9-18) (A, 14.3; B, 14.6) with a mean delay of 36.1 months (A, 1.3; B, 80.3). Indications were mainly spermatic cord torsion (27%), bilateral anorchia (27%), and testicular atrophy after cryptorchidism surgery (19.2%). Complications (10.5%) included two cases of extrusion, one infection and one migration. Patient 1 had a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia with testicle relapse 2 years after induction therapy. High-dose chemotherapy, total body irradiation and bilateral orchiectomies were performed, and bilateral prostheses were implanted 12 years after the end of chemotherapy. Complications happened 85 days after surgery. Patient 2 was followed-up for a proximal hypospadias. The tunica vaginalis flap, which was used during a redo urethroplasty, lead to testicular atrophy. Thirteen years after the last penile surgery, a testicular prosthesis was placed through an inguinal incision, and extrusion occurred 203 days after surgery. Bacterial cultures of the prostheses were sterile and histological review showed no sign of granuloma or graft rejection. The complication rate was significantly higher if the delay between the two surgeries exceeded 1 year (P\u00a0=\u00a00.01). Indications of orchiectomy, prior scrotal incision, and prosthesis size were not risk factors. Testicular prosthesis implantation was relatively safe in a pediatric cohort. The complication rate was significantly higher if the delay between the orchiectomy and the prosthetic placement exceeded 1 year. These results suggest that reducing the delay between orchiectomy and prosthesis implantation may lead to fewer complications.\n"}]}]}}

Adult patients with chronic anal fissure were randomly assigned to undergo lateral internal sphincterotomy to the level of the dentate line or to the level of the fissure apex. The patients were reexamined on postoperative Days 1, 7, 14, 28, and then at 2 and 12 months. The time required for relief of pain postoperatively was 2.08 +/- 1.44 days in the dentate line group, which was significantly shorter than that for the fissure apex group (4.72 +/- 4.86 days; P = 0.002). Objective healing was achieved in 23.7 percent and 17.6 percent at 14 days, 97.4 percent and 88.2 percent at 28 days, and 100 percent and 97.7 percent at 2 months in the dentate line and fissure apex groups, respectively (P > 0.05 for all comparisons). Only sphincterotomy up to the dentate line caused a significant change in anal incontinence (P = 0.016). Both groups had significantly lower anal resting pressures at 4 months postoperatively, compared with their corresponding preoperative levels (P = 0.005 and P = 0.007). The postoperative resting pressures did not differ significantly between the two groups (P = 0.273). By 12 months postoperatively, no treatment failures or recurrences were noted in the dentate line group (100 percent healing rate). In the fissure apex group, there was one nonhealing case and four recurrences, resulting in a 13.2 percent rate of treatment failure (P = 0.058). Sphincterotomy up to the dentate line provided a faster and definitive healing within the time limits of this study, but it was associated with a significant alteration in anal continence. In turn, sphincterotomy up to the fissure apex was free of significant disturbance of continence, but its healing effect was slower and it was prone to an insignificantly higher rate of treatment failure.\n \nComparison of characteristic features, radiology, management and recurrence pattern of fungal sinusitis between children and adults. A prospective study conducted in the department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh in which all the cases presenting with the features of allergic fungal sinusitis (AFS) between January 2000 and January 2005 were enrolled. These cases were divided into two groups, group 1 comprised of cases with age less than 15 years and group 2 with age more than 15 years. Detailed history, physical examination and nasal endoscopic examination and computed tomography (CT) scan of the paranasal sinuses was done in all the cases. The cases with prior history of sinonasal surgery were excluded from the study. All patients refractory to medical management were subjected to endoscopic sinus surgery. All the cases were followed up for a period ranging from 6 to 39 months to see for the recurrence. The data of both the groups was analysed statistically using chi square test. The study population comprised of 200 cases, with 68 cases in group 1 and 132 cases in group 2. The most common symptom in both the groups was presence of nasal obstruction. The children had higher incidence of having unilateral disease (46 out of 68) compared with adults, where it was 38 out of 132. The bony erosion was seen more often in group 1. Surgery was done endoscopically in all the cases. The intra orbital or intra cranial extension was seen in 58 cases of group 1 and 47 cases of group 2 (p<0.001). Recurrence was seen in 18 (15 with intraorbital and 3 with intracranial extension) cases in group 1 and 13 cases (11 with intraorbital and 2 with intracranial extension) in group 2 (p<0.005). In our study, we found a higher incidence of facial deformities, proptosis, intraorbital/intracranial extension and a higher rate of recurrence in group 1, therefore, suggesting a more aggressive nature of AFS in children than adults mandating an early diagnosis, proper management and regular follow up in these cases.\n"}]}]}}

A total of 370 students were interviewed over a period of six weeks, of which 205 (55.4%) were boys. The ages of the students were between 10 and 15 years. Thirty one percent of the fathers and 62% of the mothers were uneducated. The frequency of use of any brand of Chaalia was found to be 94% and that of Pan Masala was 73.8%. Eighty five percent of them were regular users. A large majority (88%) procured the substances themselves from near their homes. Ninety five percent of the children had friends with the same habits.

The protein has been studied in the context of liver fibrosis and regeneration. The aim of the present study was to explore any possible association between fibrosis levels (as revealed by liver biopsy) and serum BMP-7 levels. A total of 189 patients with chronic hepatitis B and 51 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. The study group contained 120 (63.5%) males and 69 (36.5%) females, and the control group contained 25 males (49.0%) and 26 females (51%). In general, serum BMP-7 values of patients were higher than those of controls (p = 0.001). Serum BMP-7 values of patients with liver fibrosis of stages 1, 2, 3, or 4 were higher than control values (all p values = 0.01), but the serum BMP-7 levels of patients with stage 5 fibrosis were similar to that of controls. Associations between fibrosis stage and the serum levels of BMP-7, ALT, HBVDNA, platelets, and albumin were all statistically significant (p = 0.001). The AUROC for the BMP-7 level in advanced stage fibrosis was found to be 0.23. The data were analyzed using the binary logistic regression analysis (backward stepwise method) and BMP-7, HBVDNA, and platelet levels were found to be risk factors associated with fibrosis (p values 0.031, 0.040, and 0.001, respectively). BMP-7 may play anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrogenic roles in the pathogenesis of chronic hepatitis B infection.\n"}]}]}}

To investigate the effect of a multimodal cervical physical therapy treatment on tinnitus complaints in patients with CST. Randomized controlled trial. Patients with a combination of severe subjective tinnitus (Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) All patients received cervical physical therapy for 6 weeks (12 sessions). Patients were randomized in an immediate-start therapy group (n\u00a0=\u00a019) and a 6-week delayed-start therapy group (n\u00a0=\u00a019). TFI and NBQ-scores were documented at baseline, after the wait-and-see period in the delayed-start group, after treatment and after 6 weeks follow-up. The Global Perceived Effect (GPE) was documented at all measuring moments, except at baseline. In all patients (n\u00a0=\u00a038) TFI and NBQ-scores decreased significantly after treatment (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04 and p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

Larger studies, using more responsive outcome measures, are however necessary to prove this effect. NCT02016313.\n \nTraditionally, tinnitus accompanied by hemifacial spasm has been considered a type of hyperactive neurovascular compression syndrome that is similar to hemifacial spasm alone because of the anatomically close relationship between the facial nerve and cochlear nerve as well as the hyperactive clinical nature. Participants were 29 subjects who presented with hemifacial spasm and neuroradiological evidence of vascular compression of the cranial (facial/cochlear) nerve. We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to estimate the activity of the cochlear nerve in patients with and without tinnitus on the ipsilateral side. We compared the difference in the latency and the ratio of the equivalent current dipole (ECD) strength between the ipsilateral and contralateral sides of the spasm and tinnitus. Cochlear nerve activity in patients with tinnitus was increased with a shorter latency (p\u2009=\u20090.016) and stronger ECD strength (p\u2009=\u20090.028) compared with patients without tinnitus. The MEG results from normal-hearing patients who had tinnitus accompanied by hemifacial spasm suggest that the hyperactivity of the auditory central nervous system may be a crucial pathophysiological factor in the generation of tinnitus in these patients. The neurovascular compression that causes sensory input from the pathologic facial nerve activity may contribute to this hyperactivity of the central auditory nervous system.\n"}]}]}}

There are very few studies which looked at detailed sputum and blood cell counts in a large cohort of asthmatics divided into inflammatory phenotypes. The purpose of this study was to analyze sputum cell counts, blood leukocytes and systemic inflammatory markers in these phenotypes, and investigate how those groups compared with healthy subjects. We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study on 833 asthmatics recruited from the University Asthma Clinic of Liege and compared them with 194 healthy subjects. Asthmatics were classified into inflammatory phenotypes. The total non-squamous cell count per gram of sputum was greater in mixed granulocytic and neutrophilic phenotypes as compared to eosinophilic, paucigranulocytic asthma and healthy subjects (p\u2009<\u20090.005). Sputum eosinophils (in absolute values and percentages) were increased in all asthma phenotypes including paucigranulocytic asthma, compared to healthy subjects (p\u2009<\u20090.005). Eosinophilic asthma showed higher absolute sputum neutrophil and lymphocyte counts than healthy subjects (p\u2009<\u20090.005), while neutrophilic asthmatics had a particularly low number of sputum macrophages and epithelial cells. All asthma phenotypes showed an increased blood leukocyte count compared to healthy subjects (p\u2009<\u20090.005), with paucigranulocytic asthmatics having also increased absolute blood eosinophils compared to healthy subjects (p\u2009<\u20090.005). Neutrophilic asthma had raised CRP and fibrinogen while eosinophilic asthma only showed raised fibrinogen compared to healthy subjects (p\u2009<\u20090.005). This study demonstrates that a significant eosinophilic inflammation is present across all categories of asthma, and that paucigranulocytic asthma may be seen as a low grade inflammatory disease.\n \nThe guidelines for asthma recommend that the use of anti-inflammatory therapy should be adapted to the severity of the disease. However, few data are available to assess the adequacy of the use of drugs and its influence on the control of asthma in 'real life'. The adequacy of the current use of anti-asthmatic medication according to the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines was assessed in a random sample of 400 asthmatics identified in the frame of the Italian Study on Asthma in Young Adults. Asthma severity was assessed using the GINA criteria; accordingly, a patient was classified as receiving inadequate treatment if his/her current use of drugs was lower than that suggested by the guidelines for the corresponding severity level. The absence of asthma attacks in the last 3 months was used as an indicator of the disease control. Fifty-five percent of the patients had persistent asthma. Overall, 48% (95% CI 41.2-54.8) of persistent asthmatics were receiving inadequate treatment, and 66% (95% CI 59.5-72.4) had not used their medication daily over the past 3 months. Persistent asthmatics who were inadequately treated had a significantly greater frequency of asthma attacks (geometric mean ratio 3.7; 95% CI 2.1-6.6) than those using an adequate dose of medication. Mild and moderate persistent asthmatics using an adequate medication regimen reported a low number of asthma attacks (median 0). At the multivariate analysis, a good control of the disease was positively associated with an adequate dose of anti-inflammatory medication (OR = 2.2; 95% CI 1.1-4.5) and was negatively associated with a later onset of asthma (OR = 0.96; 95% CI 0.93-0.99) and severe asthma (OR = 0.37; 95% CI 0.17-0.81).

Retrospective review of pa - tients with MRIs demonstrating large or massive RC tears (study group-SG) and no tearing (control group-CG) was conducted. Sagittal T1W and coronal PD images of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles from each patient were selected, separated, and placed in random order. Three MSK readers reviewed the images blindly and independently and qualified the FI based on the Goutallier classification. The SG included 15 men and 15 women (mean age There was a statistically significant differ - ence in the characterization of RC FI between the sagittal and coronal planes in the setting of a large or massive tear, likely related to incomplete visualization of the musculature on sagittal imaging secondary to muscle and tendon retrac - tion and more complete visualization on coronal imaging. Awareness of this difference may allow for a more accurate characterization of the degree of fatty infiltration.\n"}]}]}}

Samples were obtained from 133 individuals, 18 men and 115 women, using imprints of each hand on blood agar and a swab from the nose. S. aureus isolates were identified by standard methods and typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. S. aureus was found on the hands of 16.7% of the men and 9.6% of the women, and in the noses of 33.3% of the men and 17.4% of the women. The risk ratio for S. aureus carriage on the hands with nasal carriage was 7.4 (95% confidence interval, 2.7 to 20.2; P < .001). Among the 14 HCWs carrying S. aureus on their hands, strain likeness to the nasal isolate was documented for 7 (50%). Half of the HCWs acquired S. aureus on the hands from patients or the environment and half did so by apparent self-inoculation from the nose. Regardless of the source of contamination, good compliance with hand hygiene is needed from all HCWs to protect patients from nosocomial infections. The moderate rate of S. aureus carriage on hands in this setting could be the result of the routine use of alcoholic hand antisepsis.\n"}]}]}}

Cox proportional hazards models with age as time-scale were used to calculate multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios for associations between type of basal insulin and risk of overall cancer, breast cancer, and seven other cancer sites. The median follow-up was 2.67 years in patients exposed to insulin glargine. Absolute event rates for all cancer in patients exposed to glargine versus other basal insulin users were 1,622 and 1,643 per 100,000 person-years, respectively. No significant association was observed between glargine exposure and overall cancer incidence after adjustment for sex, with a hazard ratio of 0.97 (95% CI 0.87-1.07), or after additional adjustment for any other hypoglycemic agent use and duration of diabetes. No increased risk of breast cancer was observed for glargine users compared with other basal insulins users, with a fully adjusted hazard ratio of 1.08 (0.72-1.62). In a large cohort of patients newly treated by basal insulin, no increased risk of any cancer was observed in insulin glargine users compared with other basal insulin users.

This study therefore prospectively assesses the impact of position emission tomography scanning on the management of primary rectal cancer. Forty-six patients with advanced primary rectal cancer referred for consideration of adjuvant preoperative therapy underwent position emission tomography scanning. The referring physicians prospectively recorded each patient's stage following conventional imaging and the proposed treatment plan prior to position emission tomography scanning. This was then compared with subsequent stage and actual management implemented, and the appropriateness of position emission tomography-induced changes was noted by subsequent clinical follow-up. The surgical management of 36 of 46 patients (78 percent) was unchanged as a result of position emission tomography, even though position emission tomography upstaged disease in 3 of 36 cases (8 percent) and downstaged disease in 5 of 36 cases (14 percent). In 8 of 46 cases (17 percent), management was altered because of the position emission tomography scan findings, including 6 cases (13 percent) in which surgery was cancelled and 2 other cases (4 percent) in which the radiotherapy field was changed. Where available, follow-up confirmed the appropriateness of position emission tomography-induced management change in each case. Two patients had a change in therapy independent of the position emission tomography scan due to clinical circumstances. Overall tumor stage was changed following position emission tomography in 18 of 46 patients (39 percent). Position emission tomography scanning appears to accurately change the stage or appropriately alter the therapy of almost a third of patients with advanced primary rectal cancer. In view of this, we suggest that position emission tomography scanning be considered part of standard workup for such patients, particularly if neoadjuvant chemoradiation is being considered as part of primary management.\n \nCompared with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) may have additional value in the assessment of primary and recurrent cervical cancer.

Sixteen had hyperglycaemic DM, 12 had euglycaemic DM and 191 were in the non-DM group. The diagnostic power of PET in the hyperglycaemic DM, euglycaemic DM and non-DM groups did not differ significantly with regard to the identification of either metastatic lesions (AUC, 0.967/0.947/0.925, P>0.05) or primary tumours/local recurrence (AUC, 0.950/0.938/0.979, P>0.05). Considering all DM patients, PET showed a significantly higher detection power than MRI/CT scans in respect of metastatic lesions (AUC=0.956 vs 0.824, P=0.012). In comparison with its accuracy in non-DM patients, the accuracy of PET in cervical cancer patients with mild to moderate DM was not significantly reduced.\n"}]}]}}

Individual characteristics were obtained by the observer and the education and practice level were described by the subjects. Ventilation was delivered with a manual resuscitator connected to a microspirometer and volumes were measured. Subjects completed three procedures The mean (standard deviation) volumes for the one-handed method were 592.84 ml (SD 117.39), two-handed 644.24 ml (SD 144.7) and two-handed half-compression 458.31 ml (SD 120.91) (p<0.01).

The method used for estimating the FiN2O is based on one employed to calculate the FiO2 obtained with a nasal cannula. We assume a tidal volume of 500 ml, a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, an inspiratory time of 1 second, an expiratory time of 2 seconds, and an anatomic reservoir volume of 50 ml. The reservoir consists of the nose, the nasopharynx, and the oropharynx. Its volume is assumed to be one-third of the anatomic dead space. It is also assumed that during the last 0.5 second of expiration, there is negligible flow of expired respiratory gases. A 6 L/min flow from the cannula will completely fill the reservoir. The FiO2 or FiN2O is then calculated by assuming that during the 1 second inspiratory time period, the gases in the anatomic reservoir that are provided by the nasal cannula and a volume of air such that the sum of the components of the tidal volume equals 500 ml are inspired. Research laboratory of a university-affiliated metropolitan medical center. The calculated FiO2 values for 100% oxygen delivered by nasal cannula agree with those determined by others. The FiN2Os estimated were directly proportional to the cannula flow rate and the fraction of N2O delivered. At the maximum total flow rate considered, 6L/min flow, with 70% N2O (remainder O2) delivered to the nasal cannula, an FiN2O of only 0.21 was estimated due to the large volume of air inspired. The FiO2 under these conditions would only be 0.23. Our analysis shows that the maximum FiN2O achievable by using a nasal cannula is limited to 0.21 even with a 6 L/min flow of 70% N2O for the defined respiratory parameters.\n"}]}]}}

Published government tobacco tax documentation and statistics published by the Chinese STMA are used to analyse the interrelations among industry profits, taxes and retail price of cigarettes in China. The 2009 excise tax increase on cigarettes in China has not translated into higher retail prices because the Chinese STMA used its policy authority to ensure that retail cigarette prices did not change. The government tax increase is being collected at both the producer and wholesale levels. As a result, the 2009 excise tax increase in China has resulted in higher tax revenue for the government and lower profits for the tobacco industry, with no increase in the retail price of cigarettes for consumers. Numerous studies have found that taxation is one of the most effective policy instruments for tobacco control. However, these findings come from countries that have market economies where market forces determine prices and influence how cigarette taxes are passed to the consumers in retail prices. China's tobacco industry is not a market economy; therefore, non-market forces and the current Chinese tobacco monopoly system determine cigarette prices. The result is that tax increases do not necessarily get passed on to the retail price.\n \nThe tobacco industry claims that illicit cigarette trade in South Africa is high and rising. This is often used as an argument not to increase the tobacco excise tax or to regulate tobacco products. To determine how the tobacco industry's estimates of the size of the illicit cigarette market have changed over time. Published media articles were obtained from South African Press Cuttings; published articles and press releases were sourced from the internet. The period of interest is 1990-2012. Between 1990 and 2012 we found 90 newspaper articles and press statements that emphasised the tobacco industry's view on illicit trade. Articles that reported on action taken against illicit trade were excluded. Between 2006 and early 2011 the Tobacco Institute of Southern Africa, a body representing the interests of large cigarette companies, reported that South Africa's illicit cigarette market share was 20%. This share increased to 25% in late 2011 and 30% in 2012. In a 2012 presentation by Tobacco Institute of Southern Africa to National Treasury the illicit market share in 2008 was indicated as 7.9%, compared with claims in that year that the illicit market share was 20%. Industry findings that the illicit market decreased in 2007 and 2008 were not reported in the press. The tobacco industry has adjusted previous estimates of the illicit trade share downwards to create the impression that illicit trade is high and rising. If previous estimates by the tobacco industry were incorrect the credibility of current estimates should be questioned.\n"}]}]}}

Although most published evidence has failed to support this hypothesis, this concept remains firmly embedded in clinical practice and often prevents patients and professionals from optimizing overnight insulin. Previous observational data found lower fasting glucose was associated with nocturnal hypoglycaemia, but did not assess the probability of infrequent individual episodes of rebound hypoglycaemia. We analysed continuous glucose monitoring data to explore its prevalence. We analysed data from 89 patients with Type 1 diabetes who participated in the UK Hypoglycaemia study. We compared fasting capillary glucose following nights with and without nocturnal hypoglycaemia (sensor glucose < 3.5 mmol/l). Fasting capillary blood glucose was lower after nights with hypoglycaemia than without [5.5 (3.0) vs. 14.5 (4.5) mmol/l, P < 0.0001], and was lower on nights with more severe nocturnal hypoglycaemia [5.5 (3.0) vs. 8.2 (2.3) mmol/l; P = 0.018 on nights with nadir sensor glucose of < 2.2 mmol/l vs. 3.5 mmol/l]. There were only two instances of fasting capillary blood glucose > 10 mmol/l after nocturnal hypoglycaemia, both after likely treatment of the episode. When fasting capillary blood glucose is < 5 mmol/l, there was evidence of nocturnal hypoglycaemia on 94% of nights. Our data indicate that, in clinical practice, the Somogyi effect is rare. Fasting capillary blood glucose \u2264 5 mmol/l appears an important indicator of preceding silent nocturnal hypoglycaemia.\n \nExtracranial internal carotid artery stenosis is a risk factor for perioperative stroke in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery (CAB). Although selective and non-selective methods of preoperative carotid screening have been advocated, it remains unclear if this screening is clinically relevant. To test whether selective carotid screening is as effective as non-selective screening in detecting significant carotid disease. The case records of patients consecutively undergoing CAB were reviewed. Patients were stratified retrospectively into high- or low-risk groups according to risk factors for significant carotid stenosis and perioperative stroke Overall, 205 consecutive patients underwent preoperative carotid screening. The prevalence of significant carotid stenosis was 5.8%. Univariate analysis confirmed that PVD (P=0.005), carotid bruit (P=0.003) and diabetes mellitus (P=0.05) were significant risk factors for stenosis. Carotid stenosis was a risk factor for stroke (P=0.03). Prevalence of carotid stenosis was higher in the high-risk group (9.1%) than the low-risk group (1.2%) (P<0.05). All concomitant or staged carotid endarterectomies/CAB (5/205) and all patients who had perioperative strokes (5/205) were in the high-risk group (P=0.01). In our cohort, selective screening of patients aged >70 years, with carotid bruit, a history of cerebrovascular disease, diabetes mellitus or PVD would have reduced the screening load by 40%, with trivial impact on surgical management or neurological outcomes.\n"}]}]}}

All available preoperative contrast enemas (n = 61) had been single blind reviewed by the same radiologist who defined the radiographic transition zone when present in vertebral level. Four groups were determined (rectal, rectosigmoid, long segment, and absence of transition zone) and by Kappa coefficient of agreement correlated to the length of aganglionosis in the pathological report. Radiological findings were concordant with the specimen in pathology in 8 cases of 19 in rectal form (42 %), in 20 cases of 35 in rectosigmoid form (57 %), in all 6 cases of long-segment form (100 %), in the 2 cases of total colonic form (100 %) with a global agreement of 58.1 %, \u03ba = 0.39 CI [0.24; 0.57].

We investigated the incidence of subtrochanteric fracture in a consecutive series of 304 patients and its association with screw entry point in the lateral femoral cortex. A retrospective consecutive case series of patients treated with internal fixation for intracapsular hip fracture by our unit between January 2003 and January 2010 were included. Two authors reviewed radiographs independently to determine distal screw entry point in the lateral femoral cortex. Hickey zone 1 was an entry point above the level of the upper border of the lesser trochanter. Hickey zone 2 was defined as an entry point between the upper and lower borders of the lesser trochanter. Hickey zone 3 was an entry point below the lower border of the lesser trochanter. Clinical notes were reviewed for subsequent subtrochanteric fracture. Association between subtrochanteric fracture and distal screw entry point in the lateral femoral cortex in relation to the upper border of the lesser trochanter was determined. Two hundred and fifty-six post-operative radiographs were available for analysis. Mean patient age was 73 years (30\u201398), 75% were women. There were 24 patients with screw entry point in Hickey zone 1, 225 in Hickey zone 2, and 7 in Hickey zone 3. Two patients sustained subtrochanteric fracture. No subtrochanteric fractures occurred in patients with Hickey zone two-screw entry. Subtrochanteric fracture is rare following cannulated screw fixation of intracapsular neck of femur fracture (0.78%). In this retrospective consecutive case series, no subtrochanteric fractures occurred when the entry point of the lowest screw in the lateral femoral cortex is between the levels of the upper and lower borders of the lesser trochanter.\n"}]}]}}

Although a 5-day course of oral prednisone or prednisolone has become the most commonly used regimen, dexamethasone has also been used for a shorter duration (1-2 days) with potential for improvement in compliance and palatability. We reviewed the literature to determine if there is sufficient evidence that dexamethasone can be used as an effective alternative in the treatment of pediatric asthma exacerbations in the inpatient setting. A Medline search was conducted on the use of dexamethasone in the treatment of asthma exacerbations in children. The studies selected were clinical trials comparing the efficacy of dexamethasone with prednisone. Meta-analysis was performed examining physician revisitation rates and symptomatic return to baseline. Six completed pediatric clinical trials met the inclusion criteria. All of the pediatric trials found that prednisone is not superior to dexamethasone in treating mild to moderate asthma exacerbations. Meta-analysis demonstrated homogeneity between the dexamethasone and prednisone groups when examining symptomatic return to baseline and unplanned physician revisits after the initial emergency department encounter. Some studies found potential additional benefits of dexamethasone, including improved compliance and less vomiting. The current literature suggests that dexamethasone can be used as an effective alternative to prednisone in the treatment of mild to moderate acute asthma exacerbations in children, with the added benefits of improved compliance, palatability, and cost. However, more research is needed to examine the role of dexamethasone in hospitalized children.\n \nConcern over the safety of influenza vaccination in individuals with obstructive airways disease has contributed to suboptimal rates of vaccine uptake in this group. We investigated the safety of influenza vaccine in older people with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in a cohort from the UK General Practice Research Database (GPRD). A population based cohort study of 12,000 individuals with asthma or COPD from 432 general practices was conducted. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) were calculated for asthma or COPD diagnoses, prescriptions for oral corticosteroids, and acute exacerbations on the day of vaccination and on days 1-2 and 3-14 after vaccination compared with other time periods in the influenza season. The IRRs for asthma or COPD diagnoses and oral corticosteroid prescriptions were increased on the day of vaccination (for example, the IRR for oral corticosteroid prescriptions for subjects with asthma during the 1992-3 influenza season was 8.24 (95% confidence interval 5.54 to 12.26)). However, there was no consistent increase in the IRR of any of the outcomes on days 1-2 or 3-14 after vaccination, and most of these IRRs were close to 1. Rates of exacerbation were low and showed no consistent statistically significant increase during any risk periods. Older people with asthma or COPD commonly have diagnoses recorded or prescriptions for oral corticosteroids given on the day of influenza vaccination, but there is no increased risk of adverse acute outcomes in the first 2 weeks after vaccination. Our findings strongly suggest that influenza vaccination is safe in this population.\n"}]}]}}

A retrospective registry-based study. The 8 municipalities included in the administration area of the Sami language law (Sami) were matched with a control group of 11 municipalities (non-Sami). Population data were accessed from Statistics Norway. Data regarding invitations and outcome in the NBCSP during the period 2001-2010 was derived from the Cancer Registry of Norway (CRN). The NBCSP targets women aged 50-69 years. Rates and percentages were compared using chi-square test with a p-value<0.05 as statistical significant. The attendance rate in the NBCSP was 78% in the Sami and 75% in the non-Sami population (p< 0.01). The recall rates were 2.4 and 3.3% in the Sami and non-Sami population, respectively (p<0.01). The rate of invasive screen detected cancer was not significantly lower in the Sami group (p=0.14). The percentage of all breast cancers detected in the NBCSP among the Sami (67%) was lower compared with the non-Sami population (86%, p=0.06). Despite a lower risk of breast cancer, the Sami attended the NBCSP more frequently than the control group. The recall and cancer detection rate was lower among the Sami compared with the non-Sami group.\n \nThe aim was to determine what effect the offer of a cervical smear test when attending for breast screening has on the uptake of cervical and breast screening. The study involved randomisation to compare uptake in those women invited for cervical screening in advance with their breast screening invitation (group 1) with those invited for breast screening only and then offered a smear test upon arrival for breast screening (group 2). The main outcome measure was improvement in the uptake of cervical screening among older women without detriment to the breast screening service. The study took place at the Northern Hospital in North Manchester. Participants were 2131 women aged 50-64 years invited for breast screening at the Northern Hospital in the summer of 1990. Overall, 54% of the women who were eligible attended for breast screening, 52% attended from group 1 and 55% from group 2. Of those attending for breast screening, 957 were eligible for cervical screening and 193 (20%) had a smear test. There was a difference in the proportion tested from each group (p < 0.001), 28% had a smear test from group 1 and 13% from group 2. Forty five percent of the 193 had not had a cervical smear for at least five years. The cervical screening facility did attract some women who were overdue for a smear test and who might not normally have attended for cervical screening, and there was no evidence to suggest that it had a detrimental effect on the breast screening uptake. An advanced cervical screening invitation seemed preferable to an invitation upon arrival at the breast screening unit.\n"}]}]}}

This can be done either (i) acutely during the clamp study using high-dose insulin infusion, or (ii) slowly overnight preceding the clamp study using a low-dose insulin infusion. We assessed whether the choice of either of these methods to obtain euglycaemia biases subsequent assessment of glucose metabolism and insulin action. We studied seven obese Type 2 diabetic patients twice Basal plasma glucose levels (mean +/- sd) were 5.5 +/- 0.5 and 10.7 +/- 2.9 mmol/l in the + ON and - ON studies, respectively, and were clamped at -5.5 mmol/l. Basal rates of glucose production (GP) were similar in the + ON and - ON studies, 83 +/- 13 vs. 85 +/- 14 mg m-2 min-1 (NS), whereas basal rates of glucose disappearance (Rd) were lower in the + ON than in the - ON study, 84 +/- 8 vs. 91 +/- 11 mg m-2 min-1 (P = 0.02). During insulin infusion in the clamp period, rates of GP, 23 +/- 11 vs. 25 +/- 10 mg m-2 min-1, as well as rates of Rd, 133 +/- 32 vs. 139 +/- 37 mg m-2 min-1, were similar in the + ON and - ON studies, respectively (NS). Apart from basal rates of Rd, assessment of glucose turnover rates in euglycaemic clamp studies of Type 2 diabetic patients is not dependent on the method by which plasma glucose levels are lowered.\n"}]}]}}

Participants were patients who were likely to discuss a medication issue. The outcome measures were judgements of appropriateness made by the researchers and by two instruments From 35 cases there was agreement between the judges and the instruments in 22 cases, 16 were appropriate and 6 inappropriate. Of 10 cases classified as inappropriate by the instruments the judges thought four were appropriate. Of 18 cases classified as appropriate by the instruments, two were considered inappropriate by the judges. In seven cases the prescribing decisions could not be classified by the instruments because the decision was to not prescribe. Current measures of appropriateness of prescribing depend predominantly on pharmacological criteria, and so do not represent cases that would be judged appropriate when including the patient's views and contextual factors. If most prescribing is appropriate then use of these measures may lead to more false negatives than real negatives. The instruments should be renamed as measures of 'pharmacological appropriateness' and are useful where the incidence of this type of inappropriate prescribing is relatively high.\n \nLittle is known about the validity and reliability of expert assessments of the quality of antimicrobial prescribing, despite their importance in antimicrobial stewardship. We investigated how infectious disease doctors' assessments compared with a reference standard (modal expert opinion) and with the assessments of their colleagues. Twenty-four doctors specialized in infectious diseases or clinical microbiology (16 specialists and 8 residents) from five hospitals were asked to assess the appropriateness of antimicrobial agents prescribed for a broad spectrum of indications in 56 paper cases. They were instructed how to handle guideline applicability and deviations. We created a reference standard of antimicrobial appropriateness using the modal assessment of 16 specialists. We calculated criterion validity and interrater and intrarater overall and specific agreement with an index expert (senior infectious disease physician) and analysed the influence of doctor characteristics on validity. Specialists agreed with the reference standard in 80% of cases (range 75%-86%), with a sensitivity and specificity of 75% and 84%, respectively. This did not differ by clinical specialty, hospital or years of experience, and residents had similar results. Specialists agreed with the index expert in 76% of cases and the index expert agreed with his previous assessments in 71% of cases. Doctors specialized in infectious diseases and clinical microbiology assess the appropriateness of antimicrobials prescribed for a broad spectrum of indications with acceptable agreement and validity, regardless of their experience or hospital of employment.

Children were recruited for a trial of a home-based amblyopia screening kit in Guangzhou preschools, during which cycloplegic refractions were measured in both eyes of 2480 children. Cycloplegic refraction (from 3 to 4 drops of 1% cyclopentolate to ensure abolition of the light reflex) was measured by both autorefraction and retinoscopy. Refractive errors were defined as followed The mean spherical equivalent refractive error was at least +1.22 D for all ages and both genders. The prevalence of myopia for any definition at any age was at most 2.5%, and lower in most cases. In contrast, the prevalence of hyperopia was generally over 20%, and declined slightly with age. The prevalence of astigmatism was between 6% and 11%. There was very little change in refractive error with age over this age range. Previous reports of less hyperopic mean spherical equivalent refractive error, and more myopia and less hyperopia in children of this age may be due to problems with achieving adequate cycloplegia in children with dark irises. Using up to 4 drops of 1% cyclopentolate may be necessary to accurately measure refractive error in paediatric studies of such children. Our results suggest that children from all ethnic groups may follow a similar pattern of early refractive development, with little myopia and a hyperopic mean spherical equivalent over +1.00 D up to the age of 5-6 years in most conditions.\n \nThe objective of this randomized prospective study was to determine whether a urinary catheter is necessary for all patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia. Consecutive patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia were randomized to treatment with or without insertion of an indwelling urinary catheter. All patients received spinal anesthesia with 15 to 30 mg of 0.5% bupivacaine. The catheter group was subjected to a standard postoperative protocol, with removal of the indwelling catheter within forty-eight hours postoperatively. The experimental group was monitored for urinary retention and, if necessary, had straight catheterization up to two times prior to the placement of an indwelling catheter. Two hundred patients were included in the study. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the prevalence of urinary retention, the prevalence of urinary tract infection, or the length of stay. Nine patients in the no-catheter group and three patients in the catheter group (following removal of the catheter) required straight catheterization because of urinary retention. Three patients in the catheter group and no patient in the no-catheter group had development of urinary tract infection. Patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia appear to be at low risk for urinary retention. Thus, a routine indwelling catheter is not required for such patients.\n"}]}]}}

A total of 680 eligible cases were classified into three groups (surveillance, opportunistic, and symptomatic groups) according to their initial exposure. We used survival time, tumor morphology, and T staging as prognostic outcomes. The outcomes of screened/unscreened and sur veillance/nonsur veillance were compared with the use of the logistic regression model. The adjusted odds ratios for the screened group versus the unscreened group, with 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival time being used as outcomes, were 0.33 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21-0.52), 0.33 (95% CI, 0.21-0.53), and 0.37 (95% CI, 0.23-0.61), respectively. The adjusted odds ratios for surveillance versus nonsurveillance were 0.58 (95% CI, 0.35-0.97), 0.45 (95% CI, 0.27-0.74), and 0.44 (95% CI, 0.26-0.73). The odds ratios were even smaller when tumor morphology or T stage was taken as the main outcome. All these results were statistically significant. There were significant gradient relationships between prognostic outcomes and extent of screening history. The significant impact of ultrasonographic screening on mortality reduction was demonstrated. These findings strongly suggest that early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma by ultrasound may improve the prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.\n \nThe risk of cholangiocarcinoma in primary sclerosing cholangitis is widely recognized to be 8-30%, whereas the risk of acquiring hepatocellular carcinoma in primary sclerosing cholangitis is unknown. As in other chronic liver diseases, the presence of hepatocellular carcinoma in a patient with primary sclerosing cholangitis undergoing evaluation for orthotopic liver transplantation would clearly impact on the candidacy, diagnostic evaluation, and alternative treatment options. Thus, the aim of our study was to determine the prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients undergoing liver transplantation for primary sclerosing cholangitis. The records of the 520 patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation at our institution between 1985 and May 1995 were reviewed. Of the 134 patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis, three (2%) had hepatocellular carcinoma. In the 386 patients without primary sclerosing cholangitis undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation, 22 (6%) had hepatocellular carcinoma. Neither the duration of primary sclerosing cholangitis (range 7-23 years) nor the presence of ulcerative colitis (two of three patients) distinguished those patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis plus hepatocellular carcinoma from those with primary sclerosing cholangitis alone. None of the three patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis plus hepatocellular carcinoma had evidence for hepatitis B or C, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, or hemochromatosis. None of the tumors was of the fibrolamellar variety of hepatocellular carcinoma. The prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation is 2%. These data suggest that patients with advanced cirrhotic-stage primary sclerosing cholangitis are at increased risk for developing hepatocellular carcinoma and should be screened for hepatocellular carcinoma as well as for cholangiocarcinoma prior to orthotopic liver transplantation.\n"}]}]}}

We compared government records and self-reports of motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions in a sample of stroke survivors. The 56 participants were originally recruited for a prospective study on driving and community re-integration post-stroke; the study population consisted of moderately impaired stroke survivors without severe communication disorders who had been referred for a driving assessment. The driving records of the 56 participants for the 5 years before study entry and the 1-year study period were acquired with written consent from the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO), Canada. Self-reports of collisions and convictions were acquired via a semistructured interview and then compared with the MTO records. Forty-three participants completed the study. For 7 (13.5%) the MTO records did not match the self-reports regarding collision involvement, and for 9 (17.3%) the MTO records did not match self-reports regarding driving convictions. The kappa coefficient for the correlation between MTO records and self-reports was 0.52 for collisions and 0.47 for convictions (both in the moderate range of agreement). When both sources of data were consulted, up to 56 percent more accidents and up to 46 percent more convictions were identified in the study population in the 5 years before study entry compared to when either source was used alone. In our population of stroke survivors, self-reports of motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions differed from government records. In future studies, the use of both government and self-reported data would ensure a more accurate picture of driving safety post-stroke.\n \nESC (Electronic Stability Control) is a crash avoidance technology that reduces the likelihood of collisions involving loss of control. Although past and emerging research indicates that ESC is effective in reducing collision rates and saving lives, and its inclusion in all vehicle platforms is encouraged, drivers may demonstrate behavioral adaptation or an overreliance on ESC that could offset or reduce its overall effectiveness. The main objective of the present study was to determine whether behavioral adaptation to ESC is likely to occur upon the widespread introduction of ESC into the Canadian vehicle fleet. Secondary objectives were to confirm the results of a previous ESC public survey and to generate a baseline measure for the future assessment of planned and ongoing ESC promotional activities in Canada. Two separate telephone surveys evaluated drivers' perceptions and awareness of ESC. The first surveyed 500 randomly selected owners/drivers of passenger vehicles. The second surveyed 1017 owners/drivers of 2006-2008 ESC-equipped passenger vehicles from the provinces of Quebec and British Columbia, Canada. Though ESC drivers were much more likely than drivers of other vehicles to be aware of ESC (77% vs. 39%) and that their own vehicle was equipped with it (63% vs. 8%), 23 percent had never heard of it. Ninety percent of drivers who knew that their vehicle was equipped with ESC believed that ESC had made it safer to drive and reported being confident that ESC would work in an emergency. Twenty-three percent of ESC owners who knew their vehicle had ESC reported noticing long-lasting changes in their driving behavior since they began driving the vehicle. Collectively, results suggest that behavioral adaptation to ESC is likely in certain drivers; however, its proven effectiveness in reducing the likelihood of being involved in a serious crash probably outweighs any potential increases in unsafe driving. To fully benefit from ESC, vehicle manufacturers are encouraged to market ESC-equipped vehicles in a realistic, safe manner. Driver training and safety organizations are also encouraged to provide balanced educational information about ESC to their members.\n"}]}]}}

This study aimed to assess whether a similar outcome can be achieved by delivering retraining to patients in small groups, allowing considerable savings in the use of resources. Data were collected prospectively in a pelvic floor database. Patients received pelvic floor retraining either individually or in a small group setting and completed baseline and follow-up questionnaires. Two hundred and fifteen patients were treated, 119 individually and 96 in a small group setting. Scores before and after treatment for the two settings were compared for the Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index, the Fecal Incontinence Severity Index and the Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptoms. Additionally patients receiving group treatment completed a short questionnaire on their experience. The median change in Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index score was 5 (range -62 to 73) for individual treatment and 4 (range -41 to 47) for group treatment, both showing statistically significant improvement. However, there was no significant difference between the settings. Similar results were obtained with the Fecal Incontinence Severity Index and Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptoms scores for the faecal incontinence and obstructed defaecation subgroups respectively. The majority of patients experienced symptomatic improvement following pelvic floor retraining and there was no significant difference in the resulting improvement according to treatment setting.

Patient charts of five cases of microsporidial stromal keratitis diagnosed between January 2002 and June 2004 were reviewed retrospectively for clinical data, microbiologic and histopathologic data. The presence of microsporidia was confirmed by special stains on corneal scrapings and/or corneal tissues, and electron microscopy. All patients were immunocompetent with a preceding history of trauma in three. Four patients presented with unilateral, small, persisting deep stromal infiltrates, of uncertain etiology, in the cornea, which were not responding to conventional antimicrobial treatment and required penetrating keratoplasty in three. Fifth case was unsuspected and underwent keratoplasty for post-traumatic scar. Three of five cases were diagnosed on corneal scrapings, prior to keratoplasty, while two were diagnosed only on histology. The microsporidia appeared as oval well defined bodies with dense staining at one pole. None of the patients showed recurrence following keratoplasty. Microsporidia, though rare, should be suspected in chronic culture-negative stromal keratitis. Organisms could lie dormant without associated inflammation.\n"}]}]}}

Nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR), which play a central role in lipid and glucose metabolism, had been hypothesized as being involved in colon cancerogenesis. In animal studies the lipid-lowering PPAR ligand bezafibrate suppressed colonic tumors. However, the effect of bezafibrate on colon cancer development in humans is unknown. Therefore, we proposed to investigate a possible preventive effect of bezafibrate on the development of colon cancer in patients with coronary artery disease during a 6-year follow-up. Our population included 3011 patients without any cancer diagnosis who were enrolled in the randomized, double blind Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention (BIP) Study. The patients received either 400 mg of bezafibrate retard (1506 patients) or placebo (1505 patients) once a day. Cancer incidence data were obtained by matching a subject's identification numbers with the National Cancer Registry. Each matched record was checked for correct identification.

The polymorphic N-acetyltransferase 2 enzyme (NAT2, E.C. 2.3.1.5) plays a key role in the transformation of HAAs to ultimate carcinogens. NAT2 enzyme activity is expressed in a genotype-dependent manner in colon epithelium. Therefore local activation of HAAs in colon, and hence increased risk to develop colon cancer, is likely to be related to high NAT2 enzyme activity. This study is aimed at analysing the association between genotypes leading to high NAT2 activity and colorectal cancer risk. Genomic DNA from 120 colorectal cancer patients and 258 healthy individuals were analysed for enzyme-inactivating mutations at the coding region of the NAT2 gene by means of a mutation-specific polymerase chain reaction. Among patients with sigmoid colon cancer, a significant excess of individuals with genotypes leading to high NAT2 activity was observed as compared both to controls and to the rest of patients with colorectal cancer (P < 0.05). Our findings, which require independent confirmation, suggest that the NAT2 genotype constitutes a secondary risk factor to develop sigmoid colon cancer.\n"}]}]}}

Although there is evidence for the influential role of transformational leadership on health outcomes, researchers have used either attitude outcomes (e.g. job satisfaction) or softer health measures, such as general well-being. Specific measures of well-being such as sleep quality have not been used, despite its association with working conditions. A longitudinal design was used to collect data from Danish healthcare workers at time 1 in 2005 (n = 447) and 18 months later at time 2 in 2007 (n = 274). Structural equation modelling was used to investigate the relationships between transformational leadership, self-efficacy and sleep quality at both time points independently (cross-sectionally) and longitudinally. For all constructs, time 2 measures were influenced by the baseline level. Direct relationships between transformational leadership and sleep quality were found. This relationship was negative cross-sectionally at both time points, but positive between baseline and follow-up. The relationship between leadership and employees' sleep quality was not mediated by employees' self-efficacy. Our results indicate that training managers in transformational leadership behaviours may have a positive impact on healthcare workers' health over time. However, more research is needed to examine the mechanisms by which transformational leadership brings about improved sleep quality; self-efficacy was not found to be the explanation.\n \nTo compare the effects of 800 mg of valerian with a placebo on sleep quality and symptom severity in people with restless legs syndrome (RLS).

Thirty-seven participants were randomly assigned to receive 800 mg of valerian or placebo for 8 weeks. The primary outcome of sleep was sleep quality with secondary outcomes including sleepiness and RLS symptom severity. Data were collected at baseline and 8 weeks comparing use of valerian and placebo on sleep disturbances (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Epworth Sleepiness Scale) and severity of RLS symptoms (International RLS Symptom Severity Scale) from 37 participants aged 36 to 65 years. Both groups reported improvement in RLS symptom severity and sleep. In a nested analysis comparing sleepy vs nonsleepy participants who received 800 mg ofvalerian (n=17), significant differences before and after treatment were found in sleepiness (P=.01) and RLS symptoms (P=.02). A strong positive association between changes in sleepiness and RLS symptom severity was found (P=.006). The results of this study suggest that the use of 800 mg of valerian for 8 weeks improves symptoms of RLS and decreases daytime sleepiness in patients that report an Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score of 10 or greater. Valerian may be an alternative treatment for the symptom management ofRLS with positive health outcomes and improved quality of life.\n"}]}]}}

One patient had papillary projections into the lesion. The mean size was 3.3 cm (ranging from 1.8 cm to 4 cm). All lesions were exophytic off the pancreatic parenchyma (1 cyst was located in the head of the pancreas, 2 were in the body, and 3 were in the tail region). Pre-operative EUS-guided/CT-guided needle aspiration, when performed, was not diagnostic. All patients underwent resection (one pancreaticoduodenectomy, five left pancreatectomies) to remove these cystic neoplasms. Pathology revealed a cyst lined by non-dysplastic squamous cells surrounded by sheets of benign lymphocytes. No evidence of malignancy was found. Lymphoepithelial cysts of the pancreas are rare and are characteristically seen in men. While a hypodense mass (less than 20 HU) with papillary projections should be considered suspicious for lymphoepithelial cyst, a definitive diagnosis cannot be made solely based on preoperative imaging. EUS-guided biopsy coupled with biochemical/tumor marker studies are increasingly being used as a diagnostic tool to help differentiate between the various types of cystic pancreatic neoplasms. Imaging findings of lymphoepithelial cysts are non-specific and hence surgical resection is often required to rule out the presence of a malignant or pre-malignant cystic pancreatic lesion. In true lymphoepithelial cysts, malignant transformation is not seen and patients who have these cysts are not at increased risk of developing a pancreatic malignancy.\n"}]}]}}

The study compared the postoperative Ca/PTH kinetics between different preoperative 25-OHD levels. A total of 281 patients who underwent a total thyroidectomy were analyzed. Serum Ca was measured preoperatively within 1 h after surgery (Ca-D0) and on the following morning (Ca-D1).

The aim of this survey was to evaluate the implementation rate of the new ESC/ESH recommendations by primary care physicians and to assess the effectiveness of antihypertensive therapy. Data concerning pharmacotherapy, blood pressure (BP) measurements, and compliance with the guidelines were collected in 10,880 hypertensive patients during 3 subsequent follow-up visits. Combined antihypertensive treatment (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors with \u03b2-blocker, diuretic, or calcium-channel blocker) was used in 69.2% of the patients at baseline. A combination of \u03b2-blocker with diuretic was prescribed in 7.4% of the patients. In 71% of these patients no history of cardiovascular events was reported (myocardial infarction, revascularization, or heart failure). Diuretics were not used in 20.7% of the patients receiving a 3-drug regimen and in 6.7% of those receiving a 4-drug regimen. BP target levels set by individual physicians were frequently lower than those recommended by the guidelines. The percentage of patients who reached the recommended BP target increased during the survey to 25.3%. A combination of \u03b2-blocker and diuretic is still commonly used in the treatment of hypertension in patients without coronary artery disease and heart failure. Despite the use of combination treatment in about 90% of hypertensive patients and attempts at reaching lower target BP values than those recommended by the guidelines, treatment targets were achieved only in one-fourth of the patients.\n \nInstitutional and physician-related factors can influence the way in which physicians interpret research results. The aim of this study was to determine what physicians know about, and their opinions of, hormone treatment in breast cancer patients, and the factors comprising their medical decision-making. A questionnaire was mailed to a random sample of physicians inquiring as to their preferences with respect to adjuvant tamoxifen, and the usual duration of the treatment applied in various clinical scenarios (according to a woman's menopausal status, the oestrogen receptor status and the stage of disease). Of 500 physicians identified, 38% returned the questionnaire. Of the non-responders, a random sample of 60 physicians was interviewed by phone. The total number of available questionnaires was 250 (50%). About 3/4 of the doctors would prescribe tamoxifen in older ER+ women and 30%-40% in post-menopausal ER-patients, but only 2/5 would do so in younger ER+ women. The vast majority of physicians considered five years as standard for ER+ patients. Nevertheless, about 1/4 of the doctors chose a shorter treatment duration for node-negative, pre-menopausal patients. A minority of physicians used tamoxifen for longer than five years. Older clinicians were less likely to prescribe tamoxifen, particularly for low-risk patients. According to the data of the recent EBCTG overview, an additional 20,000 lives could be saved worldwide each year if tamoxifen were given to all early breast cancer patients with hormone-sensitive disease, irrespective of age and disease stage, and for a minimum of five years. Our study, involving a representative sample of physicians practicing in Italy, shows that tamoxifen is not used optimally, with a substantial under-use in younger women and women with node-negative disease.\n"}]}]}}

Appropriate care requires accurate physician estimates of severity. It is unknown if accuracy of physician estimates differs between black and white patients, and how this relates to asthma care disparities. We hypothesized that We conducted a cross-sectional survey among adult patients with asthma cared for in 15 managed care organizations in the United States. We collected physicians' estimates of their patients' asthma severity. Physicians' estimates of patients' asthma as being less severe than patient-reported symptoms were classified as underestimates of severity. Frequency of underestimation, asthma care, and communication. Three thousand four hundred and ninety-four patients participated (13% were black). Blacks were significantly more likely than white patients to have their asthma severity underestimated (OR = 1.39, 95% CI 1.08-1.79). Among black patients, underestimation was associated with less use of daily inhaled corticosteroids (13% vs 20%, p < .05), less physician instruction on management of asthma flare-ups (33% vs 41%, p < .0001), and lower ratings of asthma care (p = .01) and physician communication (p = .04). Biased estimates of asthma severity may contribute to racially disparate asthma care. Interventions to improve physicians' assessments of asthma severity and patient-physician communication may minimize racial disparities in asthma care.\n \nThe guidelines for asthma recommend that the use of anti-inflammatory therapy should be adapted to the severity of the disease. However, few data are available to assess the adequacy of the use of drugs and its influence on the control of asthma in 'real life'. The adequacy of the current use of anti-asthmatic medication according to the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines was assessed in a random sample of 400 asthmatics identified in the frame of the Italian Study on Asthma in Young Adults. Asthma severity was assessed using the GINA criteria; accordingly, a patient was classified as receiving inadequate treatment if his/her current use of drugs was lower than that suggested by the guidelines for the corresponding severity level. The absence of asthma attacks in the last 3 months was used as an indicator of the disease control. Fifty-five percent of the patients had persistent asthma. Overall, 48% (95% CI 41.2-54.8) of persistent asthmatics were receiving inadequate treatment, and 66% (95% CI 59.5-72.4) had not used their medication daily over the past 3 months. Persistent asthmatics who were inadequately treated had a significantly greater frequency of asthma attacks (geometric mean ratio 3.7; 95% CI 2.1-6.6) than those using an adequate dose of medication. Mild and moderate persistent asthmatics using an adequate medication regimen reported a low number of asthma attacks (median 0). At the multivariate analysis, a good control of the disease was positively associated with an adequate dose of anti-inflammatory medication (OR = 2.2; 95% CI 1.1-4.5) and was negatively associated with a later onset of asthma (OR = 0.96; 95% CI 0.93-0.99) and severe asthma (OR = 0.37; 95% CI 0.17-0.81). Despite the increase in the use of inhaled corticosteroids, half of the persistent asthmatics from the general population are using a medication regimen below their severity level. When the use of drugs follows the GINA guideline recommendations, a good control of asthma is also achievable in the daily management of the disease, particularly in the case of mild and moderate asthmatics.\n"}]}]}}

Minimally invasive techniques in foregut surgery have been suggested to cause less tissue trauma. We examined the factors associated with new-onset atrial fibrillation after foregut surgery at our institution. We retrospectively examined the records of 154 adult patients who underwent major foregut surgery which included esophagectomy, partial or total gastrectomy, redo Heller myotomy, redo or transthoracic fundoplications. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis with standard modeling techniques were performed to determine risk factors for new-onset atrial fibrillation. Of the 154 patients, 14 patients developed new-onset atrial fibrillation with a higher mean age of 67.1 years (+/-8.8 years) versus 56.4 years (+/-14.1 years) (p = 0.006). Laparoscopic (p = 0.004) and nonthoracic surgeries (p = 0.01) were associated with lower risk of atrial fibrillation. Patients with atrial fibrillation had received more fluid (6.5 +/- 2.8 liters versus 5.3 +/- 2.0 liters) and had longer operations (370 +/- 103 min versus 362 +/- 142 min), none of which were statistically significant. The average intensive care length of stay of patients was longer Laparoscopic surgery is associated with lower risk of atrial fibrillation in foregut surgery. Development of atrial fibrillation is associated with increased length of intensive care stay. We recommend a prospective trial to confirm our findings.\n \nLaparoscopic surgery is associated with well-known benefits, one of which is earlier return of bowel function. Since the laparoscopic approach to colon resections was introduced in the early 1990s, it has become the standard of care. Hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery (HALS) is a surgical approach in which dissection is facilitated by the surgeon's hand within the abdominal cavity during laparoscopy. The purpose of this study was to compare the incidence of postoperative ileus and the need for nasogastric tube (NGT) decompression in patients undergoing elective colon resections. Following institutional review board approval, we performed a retrospective review of a prospectively collected database. Included were patients who underwent elective left-sided large bowel resections between 2009 and 2012. Exclusion criteria were urgent operation, stoma creation, ASA IV classification, NGT left in place at the end of surgery, and postoperative anastomotic leakage. Patients were divided into three groups A total of 243 patients were included in this study; 73 patients underwent open surgery, 89 patients underwent HALS, and 81 patients underwent laparoscopic surgery. The proportion of patients who needed postoperative nasogastric decompression was significantly reduced in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery (3.7%) or HALS (4.5%) compared with those who underwent open resection (17.8%). The time from surgery to first flatus and first bowel movement, the time to tolerate solid diet, and the total length of postoperative hospital stay also were all significantly reduced in the laparoscopic and HALS groups compared with the open surgery group. There were no significant differences in any of these measures between the laparoscopic group and the hand-assisted group. Like laparoscopy, HALS is associated with less postoperative ileus and necessitates less NGT decompression than does open surgery.\n"}]}]}}

However, it is not known whether even occasional victimization has similar negative consequences and whether protective factors such as social support may prevent those harmful developments. The present study therefore focuses on the nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) and suicidal behavior (SB) in victims of bullying and the potentially moderating effect of parental monitoring. In all, a cross-sectional sample of 647 adolescents (mean age 12.8 years) were surveyed concerning bullying experiences, NSSI and SB, and parental monitoring. A total of 14.4% of respondents reported being a victim of frequent bullying in the past few months (with verbal and social bullying playing the most important role), which increased the risks of both NSSI (OR\u2009=\u200911.75) and SB (OR\u2009=\u20096.08). This relationship could also be shown for occasional victims of bullying (35.6%), although to a lesser extent. Parental monitoring had a significant protective effect on SB in victims of occasional bullying. However, parental monitoring did not show any protective effect in victims of repetitive bullying. Victims of bullying show a substantial risk for engaging in self-harm behavior. Therefore, the dissemination of anti-bullying programs in schools would probably also prevent such disorders. Parental participation in school-based prevention may increase its effect; this also matches the results of the present study, showing that parental monitoring may be able to buffer the negative effects of bullying victimization, at least to a certain degree.\n"}]}]}}

Among subfertile women, one-third were overweight or obese, and some had other lifestyle factors with known adverse effects on fertility such as use of tobacco. Overweight and obese women adjusted their habits but did not reduce their body mass index. Women of fertile age would benefit from preconception counseling, and the treatment of infertility should routinely offer interventions for lifestyle changes.\n"}]}]}}

The patients were evaluated 3 months after lithotripsy with a simple abdominal X-ray and a kidney ultrasound scan. The success of the treatment, removal of all fragments, was correlated with renal anatomical factors measured in the pre-treatment intravenous urography Three months after SWL treatment, 39 patients were stone-free (NR group) and 39 had residual fragments (R group). Both groups presented no differences in relation to infundibulopelvic angle, width and length of the lower calyceal infundibulum, length/width ratio of the lower infundibulum or number of lower calyces. Height of the infundibulum, described as the distance between the line passing through the lowest part of the calyx containing the calculus and the highest point of the lower lip of renal pelvis, was the only parameter in which significant differences (p = 0.002) were found between the NR and R groups. Lower Infundibular height could be a good measurement tool for deciding which patients with lower calyceal lithiasis would benefit from SWL treatment.

From September 1996 to February 1998, ureteroscopy was offered to 43 patients. Of these, retrograde ureteroscopy was done in 20 patients, while antegrade ureteroscopy was performed in 23 patients. All these patients were followed up to evaluate the immediate and long-term success of the procedure. The incidence and nature of complications were also noted. During retrograde ureteroscopy, complete stone clearance was achieved in 11 patients (55%), while pushback of the whole or fragmented calculus was seen in the rest. These patients with residual calculi were later treated by extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (SWL). The stone-free rate at the end of 3 months was 85%. Three patients developed minor ureteroscopy-related complications. Complete stone clearance was achieved in all patients with antegrade ureteroscopy. No intraoperative or postoperative complications were encountered. In this series, antegrade ureteroscopy was found to be a safe and effective option for impacted upper ureteral calculi and assured better results than retrograde ureteroscopy.\n"}]}]}}

To determine the hemodynamic effect due to lung IR injury, we performed a quantitative coronary blood-flow analysis in a swine model of in situ lung ischemia and reperfusion. In 14 healthy pigs, blood flow was measured in the ascending aorta, left anterior descending (LAD), circumflex (Cx), right coronary artery (RCA), right common carotid artery (RCCA), and left internal mammary artery (LIMA), along with left-and right-ventricular pressures (LVP and RVP), aortic pressure (AoP), and pulmonary artery pressure (PAP). Cardiac Troponin (cTn), interleukin 6 and 10 (IL-6 and IL-10), and tumor necrosis factor A (TNF-A) were measured in coronary sinus blood samples. The experimental (IR) group (n=10) underwent 60 min of lung ischemia followed by 60 min of reperfusion by clamping and releasing the left pulmonary hilum. Simultaneous measurements of all parameters were made at baseline and during IR. The control group (n=4) had similar measurements without lung IR. In the IR group, total coronary flow (TCF=LAD+Cx+RCA blood-flow) decreased precipitously and significantly from baseline (113\u00b141 ml min\"1) during IR (p<0.05), with the lowest value observed at 60 min of reperfusion (-37.1%, p<0.003). Baseline cTn (0.08\u00b10.02 ng ml(-1)) increased during IR and peaked at 45 min of reperfusion (+138%, p<0.001). Baseline IL-6 (9.2\u00b12.17 pg ml(-1)) increased during IR and peaked at 60 min of reperfusion (+228%, p<0.0001). Significant LVP drop at 5 min of ischemia (p<0.05) was followed by a slow return to baseline at 45 min of ischemia. A second LVP drop occurred at reperfusion (p<0.05) and persisted. Conversely, RVP increased throughout ischemia (p<0.05) and returned toward baseline during reperfusion. Coronary blood flow and hemodynamic profile remained unchanged in the control group. IL-10 and TNF-A remained below the measurable range for both the groups. In situ lung IR has a marked negative impact on coronary blood flow, hemodynamics, and inflammatory profile. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study where coronary blood flow is directly measured during lung IR, revealing the associated increased cardiac risk.\n \nBeta-adrenergic blocking agents are the cornerstone in the treatment of coronary artery disease (CAD). The exact pathophysiologic mechanism is not clear but depends largely on the oxygen-sparing effect of the drug. Thus, the effect of metoprolol on coronary flow reserve and coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR) was determined in patients with CAD. Coronary blood flow velocity was measured with the Doppler flow wire in 23 patients (age Rate-pressure product decreased after metoprolol from 9.1 to 8.0 x 10(3) mm Hg/min (p < 0.001). Pharmacologic CFVR was 2.1 at rest and increased after metoprolol to 2.7 (p = 0.002). Likewise, postischemic CFVR increased from 2.6 to 3.3 (p < 0.001). Postischemic CFVR was significantly higher than pharmacologic CFVR before as well as after metoprolol. Coronary vascular resistance decreased after metoprolol from 3.4 +/- 2.0 to 2.3 +/- 0.7 mm Hg x s/cm (p < 0.02). The following conclusions were drawn from this study. Metoprolol is associated with a significant increase in postischemic and pharmacologic CFVR. However, postischemic CFVR is significantly higher than pharmacologic CFVR. The increase in CFVR by metoprolol can be explained by a reduction in vascular resistance. The increase in CFVR (= increased supply) and the reduction in oxygen consumption (= decreased demand) after metoprolol explain the beneficial effect of this beta-blocker in patients with CAD.\n"}]}]}}

We examined the ethical implications of cold calling in a study of subjects with defined neurotic disorders followed up 12 years after initial assessment carried out to determine outcome in terms of symptoms, social functioning, and contact with health services. The patients concerned were asked at original assessment if they would agree to be followed up subsequently and although they agreed no time limit was put on this. To decide if cold calling was ethically justifiable and, if so, to set guidelines for researchers. The study was a cohort study of patients with neurotic disorder treated initially for 10 weeks in a randomised controlled trial. At follow up by a research medical practitioner 18 of the 210 patients had died and of the remaining 192 patients 186 (97%) were seen or had a telephone interview. Four patients refused and two others did not have interviews but agreed to some data being obtained. However, only 104 patients (54%) responded to letters inviting them to make an appointment or to refuse contact and the remainder were followed up by cold calling, with most patients agreeing readily to the research interview. The findings illustrate the dilemma of the need to get the maximum possible data from such studies to achieve scientific validity (and thereby justify the ethics of the study) and the protection of subjects' privacy and autonomy. More attention needs to be paid to consent procedures if cold calling is to be defended on ethical grounds but it is unreasonable to expect this to be obtained at the beginning of a research study in a way that satisfies the requirements for informed consent. A suggested way forward is to obtain written consent for the research at the time that cold calling takes place before beginning the research.\n \nThe aim of the study was to investigate trends in cancer prognosis by examining the relationship between period of diagnosis and probability of death from cancer in a population-based cohort. Within a cohort of Japanese men and women aged 40-69 years and free of prior diagnosis of cancer and cardiovascular disease at baseline, data from 4403 patients diagnosed with cancer between 1990 and 2006 and followed up until 2012 were analyzed using survival regression models to assess the presence of an effect of the period of diagnosis (before 1998 versus after 1998) on the risk of dying from cancer. We noted a significant decrease in risk of dying from cancer among individuals diagnosed after 1998 with lung cancer (hazard ratio [HR]=0.676 [0.571-0.800]) or colorectal cancer (HR=0.801 [0.661-0.970]). A decrease in the estimated five-year probability of death from cancer was also noted between the first (before 1998) and the second (after 1998) period of diagnosis for lung and colorectal cancers (e.g., 85.4% vs. 73.3% for lung cancer and 44.6% vs. 37.7% for colorectal cancer, respectively, for stage III in men aged 60 at diagnosis). This study presented the first scientific evidence of improvement in prognosis for lung and colorectal cancer patients in a population-based cohort in Japan. Our results suggest that recent advances in cancer treatment could have influenced cancer survival differently among lung, colorectal and gastric cancers.\n"}]}]}}

As resorption of foetal lung fluid is a catecholamine dependent process, we aimed at investigating, whether beta1- and beta2-adrenoreceptor (ADRB1, ADRB2) polymorphisms, known to alter catecholamine activity, are operative in TTN. DNA was collected for genotyping from 73 term newborns suffering from TTN and 55 healthy controls from a Caucasian cohort. TTN infants were more likely to be male (70% vs. 49%; p < 0.05), had a lower mean birthweight (3120 +/- 450 vs. 3396 +/- 504 g; p < 0.001) and gestational age (GA) (38.4 +/- 1.2 vs. 39.4 +/- 1.3 weeks; p < 0.001) and were more often delivered by caesarean section (CS) (71% vs. 26%; p < 0.001).

Multivariate analysis provided beta1Gly49 homozygotes with higher risk for TTN (OR 18.5; 95%CI 1.5-229; p = 0.023) than beta1Ser49 allele carrier. Further analysis showed significant association of T-47C, A46G, C79G and C491T (TACC) haplotype in ADRB2 gene with TTN (p = 0.048). We conclude that beta1Gly49 homozygosity and TACC haplotype of ADRB2 gene, both loss-of-function genetic variations, may predispose to TTN.\n \nAs the presence of a Trp64Arg polymorphism of the gene encoding the \u03b2(3)-adrenoceptor (B3AR) has been linked to the presence of overactive bladder, we investigated whether additional polymorphisms are detectable in this gene and explore their relationships parameters related to lower urinary tract function. The coding region and adjacent stretches of the B3AR gene was sequenced in 91 patients. In total, 1015 patients from a single academic hospital were genotyped for the presence of two single nucleotide polymorphisms. Symptom scores and parameters from pressure-flow studies were analyzed relative to genotype in the B3AR gene. No frequent novel polymorphisms were detected in the coding region. Five polymorphisms were found in the non-coding region of the gene but were in complete linkage with the 64Arg allele. Out of 32 parameters including bladder compliance, only prostate size was weakly (44 vs. 39\u2009mL) but significantly associated with the 64Arg allele, but was not mirrored by an association with prostate-specific antigen levels.

By adding brief dynamic psychotherapy focused on the psychosocial vulnerability of patients with panic disorder to an established drug treatment regimen, we hypothesized that this would result in a lower relapse rate after pharmacotherapy. Patients with panic disorder (defined by DSM-III-R) were randomized to treatment with either clomipramine for 9 months (n = 20), or clomipramine for 9 months combined with 15 weekly sessions of brief dynamic psychotherapy (n = 20). Measures of anxiety and depression were collected at intake and at regular intervals. The patients had blind follow-up interviews at 6, 12, and 18 months after beginning treatment. All patients in both groups became free of panic attacks within 26 weeks of the start of treatment. On termination of pharmacotherapy, the relapse rate was significantly higher in the clomipramine-only group during the follow-up period. There were significantly lower scores for most anxiety measures in the clomipramine plus psychotherapy group at the 9-month follow-up. The addition of brief dynamic psychotherapy to treatment with clomipramine significantly reduces the relapse rate of panic disorder compared with clomipramine treatment alone.\n"}]}]}}

The optimal time for prosthesis placement is still unclear, and its complication rate has been poorly studied in children. The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors of complications in cases of testicular prosthesis implantation in children. A monocentric, retrospective review was performed of children implanted with a testicular prosthesis between 2008 and 2014. All implantations were performed through an inguinal incision with a standardized procedure. Children were divided into two groups depending on the interval after orchiectomy Twenty-six patients (A, 15; B, 11) had a total of 38 testicular prostheses placements. Mean follow-up was 36.2 months. First surgery was performed at the mean age of 11.8 years (range 0-17.9) (A, 14.1; B, 8.1; P\u00a0=\u00a00.01) and testicular prosthesis implantation at the mean age of 14.7 years (range 9-18) (A, 14.3; B, 14.6) with a mean delay of 36.1 months (A, 1.3; B, 80.3). Indications were mainly spermatic cord torsion (27%), bilateral anorchia (27%), and testicular atrophy after cryptorchidism surgery (19.2%). Complications (10.5%) included two cases of extrusion, one infection and one migration. Patient 1 had a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia with testicle relapse 2 years after induction therapy. High-dose chemotherapy, total body irradiation and bilateral orchiectomies were performed, and bilateral prostheses were implanted 12 years after the end of chemotherapy. Complications happened 85 days after surgery. Patient 2 was followed-up for a proximal hypospadias. The tunica vaginalis flap, which was used during a redo urethroplasty, lead to testicular atrophy. Thirteen years after the last penile surgery, a testicular prosthesis was placed through an inguinal incision, and extrusion occurred 203 days after surgery. Bacterial cultures of the prostheses were sterile and histological review showed no sign of granuloma or graft rejection. The complication rate was significantly higher if the delay between the two surgeries exceeded 1 year (P\u00a0=\u00a00.01). Indications of orchiectomy, prior scrotal incision, and prosthesis size were not risk factors. Testicular prosthesis implantation was relatively safe in a pediatric cohort. The complication rate was significantly higher if the delay between the orchiectomy and the prosthetic placement exceeded 1 year. These results suggest that reducing the delay between orchiectomy and prosthesis implantation may lead to fewer complications.\n"}]}]}}

Approval of the institutional ethical review committee was not required. This was a retrospective review of 322 computed tomographic angiographic studies that were performed in patients before they underwent elective EVAR for infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. Morphologic parameters evaluated were IMA patency, origin of the IMA in relation to the aneurysm sac, diameter of the IMA, the cross-sectional area of the contrast material-enhanced aortic lumen at the level of the IMA ostium, and the number of additional patent aortic side branches from the aneurysm sac. The association of IMA type II endoleaks with each variable was analyzed by using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models. The diameter of the IMA did not influence the development of IMA type II endoleaks (P = .51). The incidence of these endoleaks was significantly higher in patients with greater cross-sectional area of the aortic lumen at the IMA ostium (P < .001). Patients with an IMA type II endoleak had significantly more patent aortic side branches before EVAR than did patients without an endoleak (3.6 \u00b1 1.7 vs 2.2 \u00b1 1.4; P < .001). According to the final logistic regression model that included cross-sectional area of the aortic lumen at the IMA and the number of aortic side branches as independent predictors, risk for IMA type II endoleaks was determined with a sensitivity of 78% (39 of 50) and a specificity of 79% (92 of 116). Cross-sectional area of the contrast-enhanced aortic lumen at the level of the IMA ostium and the number of additional patent aortic side branches are associated with the development of IMA type II endoleaks.\n \nThe rate of aortic aneurysm rupture correlates with the aneurysm's diameter, and a higher rate of rupture is observed in patients with larger aneurysms. According to the literature, contradictory results concerning the relationship between atmospheric pressure and aneurysm size have been reported. In this paper, we assessed the influence of changes in atmospheric pressure on abdominal aneurysm ruptures in relationship to the aneurysm's size. The records of 223 patients with ruptured abdominal aneurysms were evaluated. All of the patients had been admitted to the department in the period 1997-2007 from the Silesia region. The atmospheric pressures on the day of the rupture and on the days both before the rupture and between the rupture events were compared. The size of the aneurysm was also considered in the analysis. There were no statistically significant differences in pressure between the days of rupture and the remainder of the days within an analysed period. The highest frequency of the admission of patients with a ruptured aortic aneurysm was observed during periods of winter and spring, when the highest mean values of atmospheric pressure were observed; however, this observation was not statistically confirmed. A statistically non-significant trend towards the higher rupture of large aneurysms (> 7 cm) was observed in the cases where the pressure increased between the day before the rupture and the day of the rupture. This trend was particularly pronounced in patients suffering from hypertension (p = 0.1). The results of this study do not support the hypothesis that there is a direct link between atmospheric pressure values and abdominal aortic aneurysm ruptures.\n"}]}]}}

Relationships were shorter when the patient's health status was complex and when the patient's care system was smaller.

To identify distinctive features in patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms, and to determine whether these symptoms support the hypothesis of the existence of specific somatic syndromes. Observational study, with a comparison control group. Four primary care practices affiliated with the University of Nijmegen in the Netherlands. One hundred and eighty-two patients diagnosed between 1998 and 2002 as having chronic functional somatic symptoms and 182 controls matched by age, sex, socioeconomic status, and practice were included. Data on comorbidity, referrals, diagnostic tests, and hospital admissions over a period of 10 years prior to the diagnosis were collected. Medication use and number of visits to the general practitioner (GP) were extracted from the moment computerised registration was started. In the 10 years before the diagnosis of chronic functional somatic symptoms, significantly more patients than controls presented functional somatic symptoms in at least two body systems, and used more somatic and psychotropic drugs. They visited the GP twice as much, statistically had significantly more psychiatric morbidity, and were referred more often to mental health workers and somatic specialists. The number of patients undergoing diagnostic tests was higher for patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms than for controls, but hospital admissions rates were equal. Patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms have a great diversity of functional somatic symptoms. They use more somatic and psychotropic drugs than controls in the years before diagnosis. Moreover, they show high rates of referrals and psychiatric morbidity. The diversity of symptoms of patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms supports the concept that symptoms do not cluster in well defined distinct syndromes. Therefore, patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms should preferably not be classified into medical subspecialty syndromes.\n \nTinnitus can be related to many different aetiologies such as hearing loss or a noise trauma, but it can also be related to the somatosensory system of the cervical spine, called cervicogenic somatic tinnitus (CST). Case studies suggest a positive effect of cervical spine treatment on tinnitus complaints in patients with CST, but no experimental studies are available. To investigate the effect of a multimodal cervical physical therapy treatment on tinnitus complaints in patients with CST. Randomized controlled trial. Patients with a combination of severe subjective tinnitus (Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) All patients received cervical physical therapy for 6 weeks (12 sessions). Patients were randomized in an immediate-start therapy group (n\u00a0=\u00a019) and a 6-week delayed-start therapy group (n\u00a0=\u00a019). TFI and NBQ-scores were documented at baseline, after the wait-and-see period in the delayed-start group, after treatment and after 6 weeks follow-up. The Global Perceived Effect (GPE) was documented at all measuring moments, except at baseline. In all patients (n\u00a0=\u00a038) TFI and NBQ-scores decreased significantly after treatment (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04 and p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). NBQ-scores remained significantly lower after follow-up (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). Immediately after treatment, 53% (n\u00a0=\u00a038) experienced substantial improvement of tinnitus. This effect was maintained in 24% of patients after follow-up at six weeks. Cervical physical therapy can have a positive effect on subjective tinnitus complaints in patients with a combination of tinnitus and neck complaints. Larger studies, using more responsive outcome measures, are however necessary to prove this effect. NCT02016313.\n"}]}]}}

In order for meaningful results to be extrapolated to specific populations, the limitations of the data and linkage methodology need to be investigated and clarified. It is the objective of this study to investigate the differences in ascertainment which may arise between a hospital admission dataset and a dispensing claims dataset, using major depression in pregnancy as an example. The safe use of antidepressants in pregnancy is an ongoing issue for clinicians with around 10% of pregnant women suffer from depression. As the birth admission will be the first admission to hospital during their pregnancy for most women, their use of antidepressants, or their depressive condition, may not be revealed to the attending hospital clinicians. This may result in adverse outcomes for the mother and infant. Population-based de-identified data were provided from the Western Australian Data Linkage System linking the administrative health records of women with a delivery to related records from the Midwives' Notification System, the Hospital Morbidity Data System and the national Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme dataset. The women with depression during their pregnancy were ascertained in two ways From 2002 to 2005, there were 96698 births in WA. At least one antidepressant was dispensed to 4485 (4.6%) pregnant women. There were 3010 (3.1%) women with a comorbidity related to depression recorded on their delivery admission, or other admission to hospital during pregnancy. There were a total of 7495 pregnancies identified by either set of records. Using data linkage, we determined that these records represented 6596 individual pregnancies. Only 899 pregnancies were found in both groups (13.6% of all cases). 80% of women dispensed an antidepressant did not have depression recorded as a comorbidity on their hospital records. A simple capture-recapture calculation suggests the prevalence of depression in this population of pregnant women to be around 16%. No single data source is likely to provide a complete health profile for an individual. For women with depression in pregnancy and dispensed antidepressants, the hospital admission data do not adequately capture all cases.\n \nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) and sociodemographic parameters on depression during pregnancy. Between September 2010 and September 2011, 200 consecutive women with HG were defined as the study group and 200 consecutive pregnant women without any signs and symptoms of HG, and matched for age, parity, and gestational age were defined as the control group. The Beck depression inventory-II (BDI-II) questionnaire and sociodemographic questionnaire evaluating educational level, occupation, economic status, and obstetric history were given to all participants for self-completion. The forms were collected within 6 h of hospital admission. Groups were compared according to the presence of depression and predictors of depression were analyzed by regression analysis. Median BDI-II scores in study and control groups were 15 and 5, respectively. The difference was statistically significant (p < 0.001). In the HG group, 35.1% of patients had mild depression, 26.0% moderate, and 17.8% had severe depression, while only 5% of patients in the control group had mild depression and 95% had no depression. Multivariate analysis showed that HG, age and family relationship were related to depression during pregnancy. Moreover, depression risk was increased 76-fold in patients with HG (odds ratio = 76.000; 95% confidence interval Depression risk is increased in patients with HG, therefore not only medical therapy of HG, but also psychiatric evaluation should be considered for these patients.\n"}]}]}}

This is a cost-utility study from a health care system's perspective comparing coformulated fixed dose (FXD) strategy versus multiple free dose combination (FRC) in antiretroviral therapy. The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) was used to identify HIV/AIDS patients with \u22652 active antiretroviral medications. Patients on FXD were matched in 1:1 ratio with the FRC group using propensity scores. All medical costs excluding those paid by patients and families were included. Utility was measured using SF-6D scores from the SF-12 questionnaire. Incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs) were calculated using the mean annual estimates. A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve was determined using a Monte Carlo probabilistic simulation technique. Nine FXD antiretroviral formulations approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by 2005 was included in this study. One hundred seventy HIV/AIDS patients with \u22652 antiretroviral agents were identified from the MEPS database, of which 53% (n=92) were on FXD formulation. On matching, 70 patients from FXD had a match from the FRC group. No differences in sociodemographic and health status variables were observed between the matched groups. The mean annual cost was $15,766.15 for FXD patients and $11,875.21 for FRC patients. The mean utility gained by using FXD over FRC was 0.085; however, this difference was not statistically significant. The ICUR for the FXD treatment over FRC treatment was $45,540.49/quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed FXD to dominate FRC (>50% probability of being cost-effective) above the $40,000 threshold. Although the cost-effectiveness of a single-pill strategy was within the acceptable willingness-to-pay threshold, the QALY difference were minimal. Further research is recommended to explore the long-term impact of the strategy.\n \nPatient reported outcome studies are extremely valuable. We hypothesize that breast reduction surgery has a high satisfaction rate, and that body mass index (BMI), and the amount of breast tissue removed would not alter this outcome. The purpose of this study was to determine if there is an improvement in the quality of life in patients undergoing breast reduction surgery, and whether breast volume or patient size influences this outcome. A retrospective chart review was performed on 600 consecutive patients at a single institution from 2000 to 2010. Patients were mailed The Breast Q questionnaire to complete. Demographic, surgical, and clinical data were collected and entered into a database. Descriptive statistical analyses were conducted using SAS Software version 9.1.3 with statistical significance determined at P<0.05. A total of 178 surveys were returned and included in our study (a response rate of 29.6%). Patient data included a mean BMI of 28.3 (4.6) kg/m, and mean total amount of breast tissue removed of 1220.9 (665.4) g. The primary indications for patients having breast surgery were for symptomatic macromastia (85%), asymmetry (5.6%), and for cosmesis (2.5%). The Breast Q questionnaire demonstrated patients overwhelmingly agreed that they were satisfied with their breast surgery. The mean response was 2.8 with a standard deviation (SD) of 0.47 (where 1, disagree; 2, somewhat agree; and 3, definitely agree). Patient BMI and total amount of breast tissue removed had a statistically significant positive correlation (0.479; P<0.0001). There was no statistically significant difference between the amount of total breast tissue removed and patient response (P=0.57). The study supports a positive outcome after breast reduction surgery. Over 95% of the patients surveyed were satisfied and would do it again. It demonstrates the improvement of the patient's quality of life regardless of the amount of breast tissue removed. Furthermore, it suggests that the size and weight of the patient has no impact on this outcome. As we face new government and insurance restrictions for surgeries that have both cosmetic and reconstructive value, patient reported outcome studies may have an influence on future third-party payer.\n"}]}]}}

Fourteen reviews were identified; 147 of the 156 primary studies included in these reviews were obtained and assessed. We extracted data on whether the dimensions place of residence, race/ethnicity/culture, occupation, gender, religion, education, socioeconomic status, and social capital and networks (PROGRESS) were reported or analyzed, and whether any interventions were aimed at disadvantaged or low- and middle-income country populations. Among the dimensions of PROGRESS reported at baseline in 147 primary studies, gender (89%) was the most commonly reported, followed by education (25%) and race/ethnicity (18%). Less than 50% of the systematic reviews reported dimensions of PROGRESS even when they had been reported in the primary study. Of 147 primary studies, 6 (5%) were aimed specifically at disadvantaged populations; another 6 reported on effectiveness by at least 1 dimension of PROGRESS. Primary studies of interventions for rheumatoid arthritis generally reported few variables necessary to answer questions about health inequalities. Most CMSG systematic reviews failed to assess those variables even when described in the primary studies.

Results were then correlated with socio-economic status measured by the percentage of habitants living below the poverty level. African-American and Hispanic women generally experience higher mortality than White non-Hispanics, and these differences are especially significant in the southeast metropolitan areas and southwest border of Texas.

The aim of our study was to identify electrophysiological parameters, by means of a transcranial magnetic stimulation approach, which might potentially express the presence of residual networks sustaining fragmentary behavioral patterns, even when no conscious behavior can be observed. We enrolled 25 severe DOC patients, following post-anoxic or traumatic brain injury and 20 healthy individuals (HC) as control group. Baseline electrophysiological evaluation evidenced, in comparison to HC, a partial preservation of cortical effective connectivity and excitability in clinically defined MCS, whereas these components were absent in clinically defined UWS. Then, we applied an anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (a-tDCS) protocol over the orbitofrontal cortex. a-tDCS was able to boost cortical connectivity and excitability in all HC, MCS, and to unmask such excitability/connectivity in some UWS patients. a-tDCS could be useful in identifying residual connectivity markers in clinically-defined UWS, who may lack of purposeful behavior as a result of a motor-output failure.\n \nTo determine the potential prognostic value of using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify patients with disorders of consciousness, who show potential for recovery.

In 14 of the 22 examined patients (VS, n=5; MCS, n=9), a significant activation of the regions of interest (ROIs) of the mental imagery paradigm could be found. All 5 patients with activation of a significant blood oxygen level dependent signal, who were in a VS at the time of the fMRI examination, reached at least an MCS at the end of the observation period. In contrast, 5 participants in a VS who failed to show activation in ROIs, did not (sensitivity 100%, specificity 100%). Six of 9 patients in an MCS with activation in ROIs emerged from an MCS.

The fMRI paradigm mental imagery displays a high concordance with the further clinical course of patients in a VS. All 5 patients in a VS who showed significant activation of ROIs had a favorable further course until the end of the observation period. We therefore propose the term \"functional minimally conscious state\" for these patients. They may benefit from rehabilitation treatment. In cases where no significant activation was seen, the method has no prognostic value. Prediction of the clinical course of patients in an MCS by fMRI was considerably less accurate than in patients in a VS.\n"}]}]}}

We reviewed charts of 856 patients with hormone receptor-positive nonmetastatic breast cancer seen at our institution between January 1999 and October 2007. A total of 316 patients met the inclusion criteria of treatment with one of the AIs for > or = 3 months and availability of a dualenergy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) during this treatment. Arthralgia, generalized bone pain and/or myalgia, bone fracture after beginning AIs, any tamoxifen treatment, and Ca/Bis therapy were recorded. Our study demonstrates a significant association between symptoms and DEXA-BMD results (P < .001). Similarly, the group receiving tamoxifen before AIs had fewer patients with arthralgia or generalized bone pain/myalgia or bone fracture (P < .001). Furthermore, the group receiving AIs plus Ca/Bis had more patients without musculoskeletal symptoms and had fewer fractures. Finally, the group receiving steroidal AIs compared with nonsteroidal AIs had more patients with arthralgia or generalized bone pain and/or myalgia, and bone fractures (P < .001). Patients on AIs who develop osteoporosis are at increased risk of musculoskeletal symptoms and bone fracture. Comedication with Ca/Bis reduces the likelihood for osteoporosis and musculoskeletal symptoms. Patients who received tamoxifen before AIs were less likely to develop AI-related musculoskeletal symptoms. We recommend that patients on AIs should be offered Ca/Bis to reduce the incidence of musculoskeletal symptoms and fracture, especially if patients are receiving steroidal AI and/or did not receive tamoxifen before AIs.\n \nThe aim of the present study was to provide a description of the impact of setting on the diagnostic case mix that is identified in consecutive patients presenting with chest pain. A cross-sectional study was carried out of patients presenting with chest pain according to setting Gastrointestinal disorders, musculoskeletal problems and psychopathology are identified more frequently in general practice; and serious lung diseases and cardiovascular diseases in the hospital ED. Within the hospital, there is a strong trend towards increasing frequency of serious cardiovascular diseases including unstable angina (P = 0.01) from self-referred to referred patients and those rushed in by ambulance. The opposite trend was identified for respiratory (P = 0.02) and musculoskeletal (P = 0.07) diseases. The diagnostic case mix in self-referred patients tends to be more similar to the other groups of hospital patients than to patients in general practice. There is a large difference between the diagnostic case mix presented in general practice compared with the ED and among referral-related subgroups within the hospital emergency department.\n"}]}]}}

To discuss whether such procedures are feasible and effective to identify asymptomatic recurrences and describe the pattern of relapse detected by procedures. The records of 282 consecutive women with recurrent endometrial cancer treated from 1986 to 2005 were retrospectively collected in 8 Italian institutions. Primary disease, clinical history, and recurrence features and data were analyzed. Thirty-five (12.4%) of 282 patients had recurrence in vaginal vault, 51 patients (18.0%) had recurrence in central pelvis, 14 patients (4.9%) had recurrence in pelvic wall, and 39 patients (13.8%) had recurrence in lymph nodes. One-hundred twenty-eight patients (45.3%) showed a distant relapse, whereas 15 patients (5.3%) developed both distant relapse and local relapse. The site of relapse influenced survival because the patients with vaginal vault recurrences lived significantly longer than the patients with recurrences in other sites. Eighty (28.4%) of the 282 patients became symptomatic and anticipated the scheduled visit, 37 (13.1 %) of the patients reported their symptoms during the follow-up meeting, and 165 (58.5 %) of the patients were asymptomatic and the diagnostic path was introduced by a planned visit or examination. Among the asymptomatic patients, the first procedure that led to further examinations was clinical visit alone for 60 (36.4%) of 165 patients, imaging for 103 patients (62.4%), and cytologic examination for 2 patients (1.2%). Symptoms at recurrence can predict survival Follow-up after endometrial cancer treatment varies in Italy. In this retrospective study, women with asymptomatic recurrence have shown a better clinical outcome compared with those with symptomatic relapse. The optimal approach is actually unknown, and guidelines comparing follow-up protocols have not been established. Prospective cost-effectiveness studies are needed.\n \nGranulosa cell tumors (GCTs) are the most common estrogen-secreting ovarian tumors; perhaps due to the persistent hyperestrogenism, a wide spectrum of associated endometrial pathologies ranging from endometrial hyperplasia to carcinoma has been documented in patients with GCTs. The aim of this study is to evaluate the incidence of endometrial pathologies in a large series of GCT patients treated in MITO centers. A retrospective multi-institutional review of patients with granulosa cell tumors of the ovary treated or referred to MITO centers was conducted. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the patient population and to assess the association of GCT and endometrial abnormalities at the time of diagnosis; multivariate regression analysis was also performed to identify independent predictors of endometrial abnormalities. A total of 150 patients with primary adult GCT was identified. During the preoperative assessment, endometrial pathology was found in 35.9% of symptomatic patients and in 90.9% of asymptomatic women with endometrial thickening at transvaginal ultrasound. At the time of surgery, hyperplasia was documented in 29.2% of patients, whereas endometrial cancer occurred in 7.5% of patients. Almost all of the patients (97.6%) with endometrial hyperplasia were older than 40years. All patients with endometrial cancer were older than 40years and postmenopausal. Endometrial carcinoma/atypical hyperplasia were commonly observed in GCT patients >40years; based on these data, endometrial sampling should be performed in symptomatic women at least 40years of age. In asymptomatic women <40years, endometrial sampling is of low yield.\n"}]}]}}

We address the question of whether LITT-induced locoregional disruption of the BBB could possibly allow a locoregional passage of chemotherapeutic agents into brain tissue to treat malignant glioma. CD Fischer rats were subject to LITT of the left forebrain. Disruption of the BBB was analyzed using Evans blue and immunohistochemistry (IH). Animals were perfused with paclitaxel, and high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) was employed to analyze the content of paclitaxel in brain and plasma samples. LITT induces an opening of the BBB as demonstrated by locoregional extravasation of Evans blue, C3C, fibrinogen, and IgM. HPLC proved the passage of paclitaxel across the disrupted BBB. LITT induces a locoregional passage of chemotherapeutic agents into the brain tissue. This is of potential interest for the treatment of brain tumors.\n \nThis study aims to evaluate the efficacy of closed reduction and the effects of timing and fracture types on patient satisfaction. Only patients with isolated nasal fractures were included in the study. Patients with additional maxillofacial fractures and patients whose application time to our clinic was more than 10 days after the trauma were excluded. Patients were classified into 5 types according to their fracture. All patients underwent closed reduction and external fixation under local anesthesia. Patients were asked about their satisfaction in a survey at 28th day and sixth month after the surgery. Patients were divided into groups according to fracture type and intervention time, and the results of the survey were evaluated. Of the 43 patients included in the study, 38 were male, 5 were female, and the average age was 24.9. The average intervention time of the patients was 5.44 days. Twenty-eight (65%) of 43 patients were satisfied with the result, whereas 15 (35%) patients were not happy with their operation. In a comparison of patient satisfaction rates according to fracture type, the mild fracture group had a higher satisfaction rate compared to the severe fracture group. Closed reduction is an easy and sufficient treatment for nasal fractures, especially for mild nasal fractures. Early intervention raises the patient satisfaction rate.\n"}]}]}}

When a wide carinal fistula was found, this was mechanically occluded by Fogarty catheter and cannulated with rigid bronchoscopy.

Between February 1991 and February 2006, a consecutive series of 142 patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma (EADC) underwent esophageal resection. To reconstruct the upper gastrointestinal tract, all patients had a narrow gastric tube (greater curvature of stomach based on the right gastroepiploic artery) transposed through the posterior mediastinum to the left neck where an anastomosis to the cervical esophagus was performed. From a prospective database, 15 patients were identified to have undergone an 'open' fundoplication (transabdominal Nissen, n=11; transthoracic Belsey, n=4) from 12 to 23 years earlier. Outcomes were compared between patients with EADC who had undergone previous fundoplication, and patients with EADC who never had antireflux surgery. Gastric transposition and cervical esophagogastrostomy were technically feasible in all patients. No significant differences in outcome were found between patient groups. Gastric necrosis developed in only one patient, who had not undergone previous fundoplication. Anastomotic leak rates after esophageal resection and reconstruction were not statistically different based on whether patients had undergone previous fundoplication (2/15, 13.3%) or not (16/127, 12.6%; p=0.99). With careful attention to surgical technique, previous fundoplication does not preclude the use of stomach to reconstruct the foregut after esophageal resection, refuting the notion that previous antireflux surgery is a relative contraindication to, or alters the approach to esophageal cancer surgery.\n"}]}]}}

Sixty females had their Q angles measured in bilateral and unilateral stance. Linear regressions showed predictive equations and positive correlations for unilateral and bilateral stance Q angles (r=0.81-0.89, p<0.001). The equations generated were used to predict unilateral Q angle from bilateral Q angle measurements in 12 patients with patellofemoral joint pain. The actual unilateral Q angle measurement of the symptomatic knee was significantly greater than that predicted for each individual (p=0.01), whilst the asymptomatic knee showed no significant difference (p=0.16). This study showed a strong positive relationship between bilateral and unilateral stance Q angles which could be represented in a positive linear regression equation. The linear regression equation was then used to predict the effect on the Q angle of moving from a bilateral to a unilateral stance. It has been found previously that patients with patellofemoral joint pain on loading the limb in unilateral stance in activities such as walking and stair descent have increased knee valgus angle. The current study supports those findings indicating that when taking up unilateral stance patients with patellofemoral joint pain demonstrate greater than expected increase in Q angle which could increase loading on the patellofemoral joint.\n \nTo determine whether audiologic characteristics of unilateral hearing loss in children were associated with language, cognitive, or achievement scores. Case-control study Pediatric otolaryngology ambulatory practice Cases (n = 109) were children aged 6 to 12 years with permanent unilateral hearing loss; controls (n = 95) were siblings with normal bilateral hearing. Audiologic characteristics measured included side and severity of hearing loss and word recognition scores in quiet and in noise. Cognitive abilities were measured using the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence; reading, math, and writing achievement was measured with the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test - Second Edition - Abbreviated; and oral language skills were measured with the Oral Written and Language Scales. Children with unilateral hearing loss had worse verbal cognitive and oral language scores than children with normal hearing, but there were no differences in achievement scores. Children with profound unilateral hearing loss tended to have worse cognitive scores and had significantly lower oral language scores. Higher word recognition scores of the normal hearing ear in quiet were associated with higher cognitive, oral language, and reading achievement scores. Higher word recognition scores in noise were slightly correlated with higher oral language scores. As expected, children with unilateral hearing loss had worse language scores than their siblings with normal hearing, with trends toward worse cognitive scores. Children with profound unilateral hearing loss tended to have worse outcomes than children with normal hearing or less severe unilateral loss. However, there were no differences in outcomes between children with right or left unilateral hearing loss.\n"}]}]}}

Epidemiologic studies investigating the relationship between appendectomy and infertility or ectopic pregnancy were identified by searching the MEDLINE database from 1966 to 1997. Appropriate citations were also extracted from a manual search of the bibliographies of selected papers. Twenty-three articles were retrieved. Only 4 presented original data including comparisons to a nonexposed control group and they form the basis for this study. Because the raw data or specific techniques of data analysis were not always explicitly described, indices of risk for exposure were extracted from the data as presented and were analysed without attempting to convert them to a common measure. Articles were assessed according to the criteria of the Evidence-Based Medicine Working Group for evaluating articles on harm. Review of the literature yielded estimates of the risk of adverse fertility outcomes ranging from 1.6 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1 to 2.5) for ectopic pregnancy after an appendectomy to 4.8 (95% CI 1.5 to 14.9) for tubal infertility from perforation of the appendix. Recall bias, and poor adjustment for confounding variables in some reports, weakened the validity of the studies. The methodologic weaknesses of the studies do not permit acceptance of increased risk of tubal pregnancy or infertility as a consequence of perforation of the appendix, so a causal relationship cannot be supported by the data currently available. Only a well-designed case-control study with unbiased ascertainment of exposure and adjustment for confounding variables will provide a definitive answer.\n \nThe aim of this study is to evaluate whether closure of a tympanic membrane perforation with an intact ossicular chain results in a closure of the air-bone gap.

All patients underwent myringoplasty using temporalis fascia in an underlay technique. Comparison of the preoperative and postoperative hearing results in patients undergoing myringoplasty for chronic otitis media simplex. The mean postoperative air-bone gap (ABG) was 8.2 dB for the frequencies 0.5 to 4 kHz. Eighty-three patients (78%) showed postoperatively a mean ABG of 10 dB or lower. The ABG difference (improvement) was statistically significant for each single frequency (0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 4 kHz) (p < 0.0001). There is a linear correlation between the preoperative tympanic membrane perforation size and the postoperative ABG (p = 0.0017) for the frequencies 0.5 to 4 kHz. No statistical significant correlation was seen between the state of the middle-ear mucosa, temporal bone pneumatization, tympanometric middle-ear/mastoid volume, and the postoperative ABG. Complete ABG closure by myringoplasty could be achieved in only approximately 20% of the cases. 80% respectively presented with a mean residual ABG of 8 dB. We found a significant linear correlation between the preoperative size of the tympanic membrane perforation and the postoperative ABG, whereas mastoid volume, temporal bone pneumatization, and the condition of the mucosa did not affect the outcome.\n"}]}]}}

We developed a remote examiner OSCE (reOSCE) that was integrated into a traditional OSCE to establish whether remote examination technology may be used to bridge this gap. The purpose of this study was to explore whether remote physician-examiners can replace on-site physician-examiners in an OSCE, and to determine the feasibility of this new examination method. Forty Year 3 medical students were randomised into six reOSCE stations that were incorporated into two tracks of a 10-station traditional OSCE. For the reOSCE stations, student performance was assessed by both a local examiner (LE) in the room and a remote examiner (RE) who viewed the OSCE encounters from a distance. The primary endpoint was the correlation of scores between LEs and REs across all reOSCE stations. The secondary endpoint was a post-OSCE survey of both REs and students. Statistically significant correlations were found between LE and RE checklist scores for history taking (r = 0.64-r = 0.80), physical examination (r = 0.41-r = 0.54), and management stations (r = 0.78). Correlations between LE and RE global ratings were more varied (r = 0.21-r = 0.77). Correlations on three of the six stations reached significance. Qualitative analysis of feedback from REs and students showed high acceptance of the reOSCE despite technological issues. This preliminary study demonstrated that OSCE ratings by LEs and REs were reasonably comparable when using checklists. Remote examination may be a feasible and acceptable way of assessing students' clinical skills, but further validity evidence will be required before it can be recommended for use in high-stakes examinations.\n"}]}]}}

Included among the syndromes are ataques de nervios (ADN), which are reported to be bound to the Hispanic culture and closely resemble panic attacks. However, the cultural distinctiveness and phenomenology of ADN has not been adequately investigated. The current study employed an ethnically diverse study sample (N=342) of undergraduates. Participants completed a number of measures that assessed acculturation, syndrome and anxiety risk factors. In contrast to the DSM-IV's conceptualization of ADN, the rate of ADN did not significantly vary across the three main groups (African American, Caucasian, and Hispanic participants) nor did it vary based on acculturation. More consistent with the DSM-IV, the symptom comparisons indicated some differentiation between ADN and panic attacks. The present report provides data indicating that ADNs, as described by the DSM-IV, are not unique to the Hispanic culture and are experienced by non-Hispanic individuals at similar rates to Hispanic-endorsement.

However, consultancy/employee status was the only COI category statistically associated with publication of positive results (P < 0.001). Self-reported COI are uncommon in plastic surgery research. Our results provide evidence that certain types of financial COI are more likely than others to be associated with the presentation of positive findings.

The study was a cross-sectional survey. The study was conducted in the United States. The study comprised adults aged 18 years or older with chronic disease-related functional limitations. Data were obtained from the 2002 and 2007 U.S. National Health Interview Survey to compare the use of 22 CAM therapies (n=9313 and n=7014, respectively). Estimates were age adjusted to the year 2000 U.S. standard population. The unadjusted and age-standardized prevalence of overall CAM use (22 therapies comparable between both survey years) was higher in 2007 than in 2002 (30.6% versus 26.9%, p<0.001 and 34.4% versus 30.6%, p<0.001, respectively). Adults with functional limitations that included changing and maintaining body position experienced a significant increase in CAM use between 2002 and 2007 (31.1%-35.0%, p<0.01). The use of deep breathing exercises was the most prevalent CAM therapy in both 2002 and 2007 and increased significantly during this period (from 17.9% to 19.9%, p<0.05). The use of meditation, massage, and yoga also increased significantly from 2002 and 2007 (11.0%-13.5%, p<0.01; 7.0%-10.9%, p<0.0001; and 5.1% to 6.6%, p<0.05, respectively), while the use of the Atkins diet decreased (2.2%- 1.4%, p<0.01). Among U.S. adults with chronic disease-related functional limitations, the overall increase in CAM use from 2002 to 2007 was significant, particularly among those with changing and maintaining body position limitations.\n \nThe aim of study was to evaluate the importance of induced abortions for reproduction medicine in Czech Republic. Demographic analysis of data published by EUROSTAT and Czech statistical office. Department of Demography and Geodemography Faculty of Science, Charles University Prague. Widespread use of the liberal abortion law in socialist countries contributed to the decline of fertility rates only to the replacement level. In the Czech Republic total fertility rate dropped below 1.3 in 1995 and it did not increase above 1.5 children per woman till 2007. The increased use of modern contraceptive methods that results in a sharp decline in fertility and in a significant decrease of induced abortions can be documented. The total abortion rate fell from 1.54 abortions per a woman in 1990 to 0.34 in 2007. The proportion of women aged 15-49 years who were prescribed oral contraception increased from 4 percent in 1990 to 48 percent in 2007. An induced abortion is still used largely as a way to avoid birth of additional children by women who already have the number of children they want. This is in sharp contrast with the situation in the majority of Western European countries in which abortion is used mainly by teen-age girls whose attempts to avoid pregnancy have failed. In contrast to other demographic characteristics which classify the Czech Republic to Eastern Europe, the level of induced abortion rate is comparable with the levels observed in some Western European countries.\n"}]}]}}

Prospective, descriptive preliminary study of in vitro fertilization outcome. From July 1998 to July 1999, 224 patients underwent antral follicle assessment (follicle 2-6 mm in diameter) on baseline of the planned, stimulated in vitro fertilization cycle. The outcomes were analyzed with respect to antral follicle assessment (< or = 6 or > 6), basal cycle day 3 follicle stimulated hormone (< or = 10 or > 10 IU/L) and maternal age (< or = 35 or > 35 years). The clinical pregnancy rate was significantly higher in the group with baseline antral follicle > 6 compared to that in the group with antral follicle < or = 6 (51% vs. 19%, respectively). Controlling for patient age, and basal follicle stimulated hormone, the pregnancy rate was significantly higher in the group with antral follicle > 6 compared to that in the group with antral follicle < or = 6. The cancellation rate was significantly increased with advancing maternal age, elevated basal follicle stimulated hormone levels, and baseline antral follicle < or = 6. The cancellation rate was significantly higher in the group with antral follicle < or = 6 compared to that in the group with antral follicle > or = 6 (33% vs. 1%, respectively). In vitro fertilization outcome is strongly correlated with both maternal ages, basal cycle, day 3 follicle, stimulated hormone, and antral follicle assessment. Antral follicle assessment was a better predictor of in vitro fertilization outcome than were age or follicle stimulated hormone. Antral follicle assessment may provide a marker for ovarian age that is distinct from chronological age or hormonal markers.\n \nWe aimed to compare the rates of psychiatric morbidity in patients who had early age and late age MI in patients who have survived acute myocardial infarction? One hundred sixteen patients who were hospitalized in the coronary care unit were included in the study. Psychiatric assessment of the patients was carried out within 1-6months post-MI. Psychiatric interviews were conducted with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-I). Also used were the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and Health Anxiety Inventory (HAI). A total of 116 patients were divided into two groups according to age as an early age myocardial infarction group (EA-MI) and a late age myocardial infarction group (LA-MI). The EA-MI group included 24 patients 45years of age and under. The LA-MI group included 92 patients over 45years of age. Current psychiatric disorders, lifetime psychiatric disorders and lifetime depressive disorders were significantly more frequent in the EA-MI group than in the LA-MI group. EA-MI patients have experienced a depressive episode prior to the onset of the MI, whereas in the LA-MI group, the patients typically experienced depressive episodes after MI. Our findings suggest that depression may increase the risk of MI at an early age.\n"}]}]}}

Haemoglobin, ferritin, anthropometric data, familial and nutritional status were measured. 586 infants were eligible and 463 were included in the study as they had assessment data at 12 months. Children were divided into two groups The prevalence of iron deficiency in the immigrant population is higher than in non-immigrants. Immigration and the category of employment are risk factors for iron deficiency, as starting baby cereals before 9 months is a protective factor. Good socioeconomic conditions in Switzerland, the quality of food for pregnant women and young infants may be the explanation.

In unicompartmental replacement, the other compartments and knee ligaments are largely untouched. Therefore, it was hypothesized that the knee kinematics after unicompartmental replacement may also be unchanged. To test this hypothesis, knee kinematics and quadriceps tension were recorded before and after replacement with a unicompartmental design and then with a tricompartmental design. Six human cadaver knees were tested before implantation, after implantation with a bicruciate-retaining unicompartmental knee prosthesis, and after implantation with a posterior cruciate-retaining tricompartmental knee prosthesis. The unicompartmental prosthesis was initially implanted, and it was then revised to a total condylar knee replacement. The knee kinematics were measured with use of an electromagnetic tracking device while the knee was put through dynamic simulated stair-climbing under peak flexion moments of approximately 40 N-m. Quadriceps tension was also measured for all three conditions. No significant differences in tibial axial rotation were noted between the intact and unicompartmental conditions. However, tricompartmental replacement significantly affected tibial axial rotation (p = 0.001). Femoral rollback was not significantly affected by either unicompartmental or tricompartmental arthroplasty. Quadriceps tension was also similar among all three conditions. In this in vitro cadaver study, the tricompartmental replacement significantly changed knee kinematics while the unicompartmental replacement preserved normal knee kinematics.\n \nThe posterior tibial slope influences both the natural knee stability as well as the stability and kinematics after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Exact definition of the posterior tibial slope (PTS) requires lateral radiographs of the lower limb. Only lateral knee radiographs are routinely obtained after TKA, however. The purpose of the present study therefore was to analyse the relationship between PTS measurement results on short and expanded lateral knee radiographs. The PTS was measured on 100 consecutive lateral radiographs of the lower limb using the mechanical and three diaphyseal axes with various distances below the tibial plateau. Significant differences between PTS results were found for all three diaphyseal axes, with the smallest differences and the strongest correlation for a diaphyseal axis at 16 and 20\u00a0cm below the tibial plateau. Using short distances below the tibial plateau (6 and 10\u00a0cm) resulted in an overestimation of the PTS of 3\u00b0, on average. The PTS measurements in long lateral knee radiographs are more accurate compared to short radiographs. On short lateral knee radiographs, only a estimation of the PTS can be carried out.

There are 71 previously untreated patients with cytological or histological evidence of primary lung cancer who were admitted to the oncology department between November 2013 and August 2014. Forty-five healthy individuals with age, sex and BMI matching the lung cancer patients, were recruited to take part in the study as a control group. Leptin levels were measured quantitatively by using a microELISA kit. The serum leptin levels at diagnosis were significantly lower in lung cancer patients than those in control subjects (4.75\u00b14.91 ng/ml, 9.67\u00b18.02 ng/ml; p<0.001). We did not find any significant difference in leptin values related to clinicopathological parameters such as ECOG PS, weight loss, histological type, disease stage and TNM classification. Nevertheless, we demonstrated a significant correlation between serum leptin levels and BMI in lung cancer patients (correlation coefficient Our results showed that the serum leptin level has no prognostic indications in advanced lung cancer patients. Leptin is decreased in lung cancer, and there is lack of correlation with tumour\u2011related factors including prognosis. Therefore, leptin is not a useful clinical marker in lung cancer (Tab. 2, Fig. 2, Ref. 22).\n \nThe limited information on serum leptin levels in elderly men suggests the occurrence of an age-related decrease, with disruption of the relationship between fat mass and leptin levels. A relative leptin deficiency might thus be implicated in the increase of fat mass and decrease of serum testosterone levels in elderly men. Therefore, we have reevaluated the age-related changes in serum leptin levels and their relationship with adiposity and androgen levels in a large group of community dwelling men. Serum leptin and androgen levels were measured in 271 healthy, ambulatory elderly men (median age 74 years), as well as in 61 middle-aged (median 43 years) and 40 young (median 25.5 years) controls. Adiposity was assessed by anthropometrical measurements (body mass index; BMI) and by estimation of fat mass by the bio-impedance method. Serum leptin levels, whether or not adjusted for BMI, were found to increase with age, the values tending to level off after the age of 45 years, and were strongly correlated to BMI (r = 0.77) and fat mass assessed by the bio-impedance method (r = 0.81). Linear regression analysis showed a similar slope for the relationship between BMI and serum leptin in the three age groups. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated BMI, age and serum insulin, but not serum testosterone, as significant independent correlates of serum leptin. Serum (free) testosterone levels were negatively correlated with age and serum leptin, also after partialization for BMI Ageing in men is accompanied by a rise of serum leptin levels with a maintained strong association between serum leptin and adiposity in elderly men. Testosterone does not appear to be a major determinant of serum leptin in healthy men, while leptin does emerge as a negative correlate of serum testosterone. Increased fat mass and decreased testosterone production in elderly men cannot be attributed to a relative leptin deficiency.\n"}]}]}}

We undertook this study to determine whether pediatric patients or their parents have a preference for physicians of a particular gender. We also tried to determine whether they would be willing to wait longer to be seen to accommodate their choice. A total of 200 children aged between 8 and 13 years presenting to our pediatric emergency department for laceration repair were enrolled. With the knowledge and consent of their parents, the enrolled children were given a short questionnaire. They were asked, if they had a choice, would they prefer to have a male or a female doctor or would they prefer the doctor with the most experience. Their parents were also then given the questionnaire. They were also asked if they would be willing to wait longer to be seen by the doctor of their choice. The study sample comprised 200 children, 139 boys and 61 girls. Among boys, 78% (n = 109) said they would prefer a female physician. Only 21% (n = 30) preferred a male physician. Among girls, 80% (n = 49) reported they would prefer a female physician, 20% (n = 12) preferred a male physician. None of the children surveyed wanted the \"best\" physician. When the parents were surveyed, 60% (n = 120) preferred a male physician as compared with 19% (n = 38) who expressed a preference for female physician. Only 21% (n = 42) of parents desired the most experienced physician of either sex to repair the laceration. All the parents who expressed a preference for the \"most experienced\" physician said they were willing to wait (42/42) until that physician was available as compared with less than a third of parents who were willing to wait for the physician of a specific gender (44/158). Most children (79%) preferred a female physician for their sutures, whereas parents overall (60%) appeared to prefer a male physician. The children did not appear to care if the physician was the \"best.\" Surprisingly, many parents also chose physician gender rather than physician experience. One hundred percent of the parents who chose the most experienced physician were willing to wait longer to be seen as compared with 29% who preferred a physician of a particular gender.\n"}]}]}}

Although AF can have a genetic etiology, links between inherited gene defects and acquired factors such as atrial stretch have not been explored. Mutation screening of the KCNQ1, KCNE1, KCNE2, and KCNE3 genes was performed in 50 families with AF. The effects of mutant protein on cardiac I(Ks) activation were evaluated using electrophysiological studies and human atrial action potential modeling. One missense KCNQ1 mutation, R14C, was identified in 1 family with a high prevalence of hypertension. Atrial fibrillation was present only in older individuals who had developed atrial dilation and who were genotype positive. Patch-clamp studies of wild-type or R14C KCNQ1 expressed with KCNE1 in CHO cells showed no statistically significant differences between wild-type and mutant channel kinetics at baseline, or after activation of adenylate cyclase with forskolin. After exposure to hypotonic solution to elicit cell swelling/stretch, mutant channels showed a marked increase in current, a leftward shift in the voltage dependence of activation, altered channel kinetics, and shortening of the modeled atrial action potential duration. These data suggest that the R14C KCNQ1 mutation alone is insufficient to cause AF. Rather, we suggest a model in which a \"second hit\", such as an environmental factor like hypertension, which promotes atrial stretch and thereby unmasks an inherited defect in ion channel kinetics (the \"first hit\"), is required for AF to be manifested. Such a model would also account for the age-related increase in AF development.\n \nPatients with an accessory pathway (AP) have an increased propensity to develop atrial fibrillation (AF), but the mechanism is unknown. The purpose of this study was to identify crucial risk factors and to test the hypothesis that reflection and/or microreentry of atrial impulses propagating into the AP triggers AF. Five hundred thirty-four patients successfully treated with radiofrequency ablation of AP at two university hospitals were evaluated. Patients were separated into those with concealed vs those with manifest AP in terms of their propensity to develop AF. To investigate AF triggering mechanisms, linear and branched two-dimensional models of atrium-to-ventricle propagation across a heterogeneous 1 x 6 AP using human ionic kinetics were simulated. A history of AF was twice as common in patients with manifest AP vs concealed AP irrespective of AP location. AF was more likely to occur in older males and in patients with larger atria. There was no correlation between AF history and AP refractory measures. However, the electrophysiologic properties of APs seemed to fulfill the prerequisites for reflection and/or microreentry of atrially initiated impulses. In the linear AP model, repetitive atrial stimulation resulted in progressively larger delay of atrium-to-ventricle propagation across the passive segment. Eventually, sufficient time for repolarization of the atrial segment allowed for reflection of an impulse that activated the entire atrium and by wavefront-wavetail interaction with a new atrial stimulus AF reentry was initiated. Simulations using the branched model showed that microreentry at the ventricular insertion of the AP could also initiate AF via retrograde atrial activation as a result of unidirectional block at the AP-ventricle junction. Propensity for AF in patients with an AP is strongly related to preexcitation, larger atria, male gender, and older age. Reflection and microreentry at the AP may be important for AF initiation in patients with manifest (preexcited) Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Similar mechanisms also may trigger AF in patients without an AP.\n"}]}]}}

Electrocardiogram was performed to measure QTcD. LVH was present in 42 patients (42%) of the study group, none among controls. Hypertensive patients had significantly greater indices of LVH and QTcD compared with controls (p <0.001 for all). Similarly, among hypertensive patients, those with LVH had a significantly greater QTcD compared with those without (p <0.001). Pearson's correlation coefficient test demonstrated strongly positive correlations between QTcD and the indices of LVH (p <0.001 for all). Analysis of the receiver operating characteristic curves identified 60 ms as the optimal cut-off value of QTcD that best predicts LVH in hypertensives. Using this value, QTcD was able to predict LVH with a sensitivity of 92.9% and specificity 98.2%. QTcD is significantly increased in hypertensive patients with LVH compared with those without, being strongly correlated with the indices of LVH. A QTcD cut-off value of 60 ms predicted LVH in hypertensive patients with a high sensitivity and specificity.\n \nLeft ventricular hypertrophy is an important predictor of cardiovascular risk and its detection contributes to risk stratification.

The presence of left ventricular hypertrophy was considered if left ventricular mass index was > or = 134 or 110 g/m(2) in men and women, respectively (Devereux criteria). A logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated to left ventricular hypertrophy. The prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy was 23.9% (95% CI:17.9-29.9), 25.6% in men and 22.6% in women. In the low risk group its prevalence was 20.7% and in medium risk group 29.5%.

This is a retrospective study of twenty-two cases treated with TEVAR for TAI in our department from 2009 to 2014. Aortic injury was assessed in accordance with the recommendations of the Society of Vascular Surgery. We measured the aortic arch angle and the aortic arch index, based on the initial angio-CT scan, in each of the analyzed cases. The mean aortic arch index and mean aortic arch angle were 6.8\u00a0cm and 58.3\u00b0, respectively, in the type I injury group; 4.4\u00a0cm and 45.9\u00b0 in the type III group; 3.3\u00a0cm and 37\u00b0 in the type IV group. There were substantial differences in both the aortic arch index and the aortic arch angle of the type III and IV groups. A multivariate analysis confirmed that the aortic arch angle was significantly associated with the occurrence of type III damage (OR 1.5; 95% CI 1.03-2.2). The severity of TAI is influenced by the sharpness of the aortic arch. There is an inverse relationship between the severity of aortic injury and the aortic arch index.\n \nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of our surgical strategy for acute aortic dissection based on the extent of the dissection and the site of the entry, with special emphasis on resection of all dissected aortic segments if technically possible. Between January 1995 and March 2001, 43 consecutive patients underwent operations for acute aortic dissection. In all patients the distal repair was performed under circulatory arrest without the use of an aortic cross-clamp. Fifteen patients underwent aortic arch replacement with additional reconstruction of supra-aortic vessels in 3 patients. Complete replacement of all dissected tissue could be achieved in 21 patients (group 1). Because of the distal extent of the dissection beyond the aortic arch, replacement of all the dissected tissue was not possible in 22 patients (group 2). Early mortality was 4.7% (2 patients), and the incidence of perioperative cerebrovascular events was 7.0% (3 patients). All of these events occurred in group 2 (p < 0.025). During the follow-up period of 6 years or less, 5 patients died, all from causes not related to the aorta or the aortic valve. A persisting patent false lumen was observed in 14 of the 36 surviving patients (39%). Extended replacement of the dissected ascending aorta and aortic arch can be done with good early and midterm results, even though it requires a complex surgical technique. Therefore we advocate complete replacement of the dissected parts of the aorta in all patients in whom this is technically possible.\n"}]}]}}

A retrospective chart review of gynecologic cancer patients admitted with NF from 2007 to 2011 was performed, wherein demographic, oncologic, and NF characteristics (hospitalization length, complications, and death) were collected. The Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) risk index score was calculated; low risk was considered \u2265 21. SAS 9.2 was used for statistical analyses. Eighty-three patients met the study criteria. Most (92%) were Caucasian and had advanced stage disease (71%). Primary tumors were 58% ovary, 35% endometrium, and 6% cervix. All patients were receiving chemotherapy on admission (72% for primary, 28% for recurrent disease). Forty-eight percent had a positive culture, and most (58%) positive cultures were urine. Seventy-six percent of patients were considered low risk. High-risk patients were more likely to have a severe complication (10% versus 50%, p=0.0003), multiple severe complications (3% versus 20%, p=0.0278), ICU admission (2% versus 40%, p<0.0001), overall mortality (2% versus 15%, p=0.0417), and death due to neutropenic fever (0% versus 15%, p=0.0124). MASCC had a positive predictive value of 50% and negative predictive value of 90%. The median MASCC score for all patients was 22 (range, 11-26), but the median MASCC score for those with death or a severe complication was 17 (range, 11-24). Based on this pilot data, MASCC score appears promising in determining suitability for outpatient management of NF in gynecologic oncology patients.

We analyzed microbial contamination records of HPC grafts between 2012 and 2015, retrospectively. Contamination rates of autologous donors were evaluated for at three steps A total of 445 mobilization procedures were carried out on 333 (167 autologous and 166 allogeneic) donors. The microbiological contamination of peripheral blood (323/333 donations) and bone marrow (10/333 donations) products were analyzed. Bacterial contamination was detected in 18 of 1552 (1.15 %) culture bottles of 333 donors. During the study period 248 patients underwent HCT and among these patients microbial contamination rate on sample basis was 1.3 % (16/1212). Microbial contamination detected in nine patients (7 autologous; 2 allogeneic). In 8 of 9 patients, a febrile neutropenic attack was observed. The median day for the neutropenic fever was 4 days (0-9). None of the patients died within the post-transplant 30 days who received contaminated products.

Post-mastectomy radiotherapy should be discussed for a sub-group of node-negative patients with predictors factors of local failure such as age < or = 40 years and larger tumour size.\n \nAxillary dissection is associated with a high incidence of lymphedema, which has been brought down with the introduction of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in patients with early breast cancer. However, sentinel lymph node biopsy is not widely accepted in patients of locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) [T3N1, Any T4, Any N2-3 with no distant metastasis] after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) and these patients routinely undergo axillary lymph node clearance. Axillary reverse mapping (ARM) with blue dye has the potential to differentiate the arm lymphatics from the breast lymphatics and it can be used to decrease lymphedema in patients undergoing ALND by preserving these lymphatics. However, ARM in LABC patients is yet to be accepted as the standard of care. 51 patients of locally advanced breast carcinoma were included in the study from May 2011 to May 2012. All patients received neo-adjuvant chemotherapy followed by modified radical mastectomy. Axillary reverse mapping (ARM) was carried out using blue dye. 2 ml of methylene blue dye was injected intradermal, upper medial aspect of the ipsilateral arm. The number, size and site and distribution of lymph nodes identified were recorded and the nodes were labelled as ARM nodes and complete axillary dissection was carried out. Blue nodes were identified in 45 (88.2%) out of the 51 patients. The average number of ARM nodes identified was 4.03 \u00b1 0.28 [range 1-8]. In majority (77.8%) of the cases, nodes were located in the triangle formed by axillary vein above, below by the first intercostobrachial nerve and medially by the chest wall/serratus anterior. In patients with complete or partial response to NACT, ARM and breast axillary LN were negative in 63.3% patients whereas 36.6% had positive breast but negative ARM nodes. In this study we did not intend to preserve any ARM nodes but in 90% of these cases, at least one ARM node had to be removed or was injured during axillary clearance. ARM nodes could be identified in 15 (83.3%) out of the 18 patients with stable or progressive disease following ARM. 12 (80%) out of these 15 cases demonstrated positive ARM and breast LN whereas 3 (20%) patients had positive breast but negative ARM nodes. Skin tattooing (82.3%) was the most common complication observed in our study. Identification rates of ARM nodes can be improved by injecting the blue dye in the upper medial aspect of the arm at the time of induction. Majority of the arm nodes lie between the axillary vein and the first intercostobrachial nerve. It is difficult to preserve the ARM nodes in patients of LABC, who have had good response to NACT and in patients of LABC with poor response to NACT, the incidence of metastasis in ARM nodes is quite high. Therefore, ARM is not a feasible option in patients with locally advanced breast cancer.\n"}]}]}}

The BMD at both sites decreased precipitously within 24 months of stopping treatment, raising the question as to whether bisphosphonates can be stopped in a growing child with skeletal fragility. At age 23 months, a male toddler sustained a low trauma fracture of his right femur. Skeletal radiographs revealed generalised osteopenia with multiple vertebral body fractures. He was diagnosed with type IV osteogenesis imperfecta; however, no mutations were found in COL1A1 or COL1A2 genes. This case report presents bone densitometry data before, during and after bisphosphonate treatment. Axial QCT was main outcome from 2 years of age; DXA and pQCT were taken after age 5. QCT confirmed that he had low spinal trabecular volumetric BMD (Z-score -2.4). After 4 years of treatment his vertebral fractures had been remodelled and all bone densitometry values (QCT, DXA and pQCT) were within normal range and therefore treatment was discontinued. Shortly after this he suffered stress fractures of his left mid tibia and at the sclerotic metaphyseal line corresponding to his first APD treatment. He had marked reduction in spinal trabecular and distal radial vBMD; change in BMAD was less marked. The patient has been restarted on IV APD therapy. This case has led us to consider whether bisphosphonate therapy can be discontinued in a child with fragility fractures before his/her linear growth has ceased?\n \nThe pathogenesis of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ) is not completely understood. The most popular hypothesis has suggested that the bone turnover (BT) in the jawbone is greater than that in other sites and that this turnover will be overly suppressed by bisphosphonates. Using bone scintigraphy, a simple tool for the quantitative evaluation of bone metabolism and blood flow, the goals of the present study were to determine whether the rate of bone remodeling is greater in the jaw and whether the bone BT in the jaw is differentially altered after bisphosphonate intake compared with that in other skeletal sites. The bone scintigraphies of 90 female patients with breast cancer were retrospectively analyzed (n\u00a0= 45 with bisphosphonate intake; n\u00a0= 45 without bisphosphonate intake [control group]). All patients in the study group had undergone bone scintigraphy before therapy and during the treatment (course after 12 and 24\u00a0months). The data were quantitatively analyzed using 6 predetermined regions of interest. The bone BT of the mandible was similar to that of the femur and significantly reduced compared with that of the maxilla (P < .01). None of the investigated bone regions (including the mandible and maxilla) were significantly altered after bisphosphonate administration (P > .05). The finding that the mandible had significantly lower bone BT than that of the maxilla and that two thirds of BRONJ cases occur in the mandible were inconsistent with the investigated hypothesis. Furthermore, the bone BT in the jawbone was not overly suppressed by bisphosphonates. Thus, it is unlikely that over suppression of bone BT is the exclusive causation playing a role in the pathomechanism of BRONJ.\n"}]}]}}

At our institution, a regional anesthesia program was instituted for patients undergoing surgery for hip fracture. This retrospective cohort review examines the effects of regional anesthesia (from mainly after July 2007) vs general anesthesia (mainly prior to July 2007) on morbidity, mortality and hospitalization costs. This retrospective cohort study involved data collection from electronic and paper charts of 308 patients who underwent surgery for hip fracture from September 2006 to December 2008. Data on postoperative morbidity, in-patient mortality, and cost of hospitalization (as estimated from data on hospital charges) were collected and analyzed. Seventy-three patients received regional anesthesia and 235 patients received general anesthesia. During July 2007, approximately halfway through the study period, a regional anesthesia and analgesia program was introduced. The average cost of hospitalization in patients who received surgery for hip fracture was no different between patients who receive regional or general anesthesia ($16,789 + 631 vs $16,815 + 643, respectively, P = 0.9557). Delay in surgery and intensive care unit (ICU) admission resulted in significantly higher hospitalization costs. Age, male gender, African American race and ICU admission were associated with increased in-hospital mortality. In-hospital mortality and rates of readmission are not statistically different between the two anesthesia groups. There is no difference in postoperative morbidity, rates of rehospitalization, in-patient mortality or hospitalization costs in geriatric patients undergoing regional or general anesthesia for repair of hip fracture. Delay in surgery beyond 3 days and ICU admission both increase cost of hospitalization.\n \nSurgical patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are at increased risk of perioperative complications. In this study, we sought to quantify the benefit of avoiding general anesthesia in this patient population. Data from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database (2005-2010) were used for this review. Patients who met the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program definition for COPD and underwent surgery under general, spinal, epidural, or peripheral nerve block anesthesia were included in this study. For each primary current procedural terminology code with \u2265 1 general and \u2265 1 regional (spinal, epidural, or peripheral nerve block) anesthetic, regional patients were propensity score--matched to general anesthetic patients. Propensity scoring was calculated using all available demographic and comorbidity data. This match yielded 2644 patients who received regional anesthesia and 2644 matched general anesthetic patients. These groups were compared for morbidity and mortality. Groups were well matched on demographics, comorbidities, and type of surgery. Compared with matched patients who received regional anesthesia, patients who received general anesthesia had a higher incidence of postoperative pneumonia (3.3% vs 2.3%, P = 0.0384, absolute difference with 95% confidence interval = 1.0% [0.09, 1.88]), prolonged ventilator dependence (2.1% vs 0.9%, P = 0.0008, difference = 1.2% [0.51, 1.84]), and unplanned postoperative intubation (2.6% vs 1.8%, P = 0.0487, difference = 0.8% [0.04, 1.62]). Composite morbidity was 15.4% in the general group versus 12.6% (P = 0.0038, difference = 2.8% [0.93, 4.67]). Composite morbidity not including pulmonary complications was 13.0% in the general group versus 11.1% (P = 0.0312, difference = 1.9% [0.21, 3.72]). Thirty-day mortality was similar (2.7% vs 3.0%, P = 0.6788, difference = 0.3% [-1.12, 0.67]). As a test for validity, we found a positive association between pulmonary end points because patients with 1 pulmonary complication were significantly more likely to have additional pulmonary complications. The use of regional anesthesia in patients with COPD is associated with lower incidences of composite morbidity, pneumonia, prolonged ventilator dependence, and unplanned postoperative intubation.\n"}]}]}}

When confirmation of maximal effort is needed, the addition of supramaximal testing of children with disability is an easy and well-tolerated method.\n \nTo investigate whether aerobic fitness is associated with skin microvascular function in healthy adults with an increased risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. Twenty-seven healthy normal glucose-tolerant humans with either a previous diagnosis of gestational diabetes or having two parents with Type 2 diabetes and 27 healthy adults who had no history of diabetes were recruited. Maximal oxygen uptake was assessed using an incremental exercise test to exhaustion. Skin microvascular function was assessed using laser Doppler techniques as the maximum skin hyperaemic response to a thermal stimulus (maximum hyperaemia) and the forearm skin blood flow response to the iontophoretic application of acetylcholine (ACh) and sodium nitroprusside. Maximal oxygen uptake was not significantly different in the 'at-risk' group compared with healthy controls. Maximum hyperaemia was reduced in those 'at risk' (1.29 +/- 0.30 vs. 1.46 +/- 0.33 V, P = 0.047); however, the peak response to acetylcholine or sodium nitroprusside did not differ in the two groups. A significant positive correlation was demonstrated between maximal oxygen uptake and maximum hyperaemia (r = 0.52, P = 0.006 l/min and r = 0.60, P = 0.001 ml/kg/min) and peak ACh response (r = 0.40, P = 0.04 l/min and r = 0.47, P = 0.013 ml/kg/min) in the 'at-risk' group when expressed in absolute (l/min) or body mass-related (ml/kg/min) terms. No significant correlations were found in the control group. In this 'at-risk' group with skin microvascular dysfunction maximal oxygen uptake was not reduced compared with healthy controls. However, in the 'at-risk' group alone, individuals with higher levels of aerobic fitness also had better microvascular and endothelial responsiveness.\n"}]}]}}

We conducted this study to analyze the changes in the therapeutic strategy for AC in a surgical center in Tunisia after the Tokyo guidelines were published. Between January, 2005 and January, 2013, 649 patients underwent cholecystectomy for AC at the Department of Surgery, Mohamed Tahar Maamouri Hospital in Nabeul, Tunisia. The study period was subdivided into before (n\u00a0=\u00a0192) and after (n\u00a0=\u00a0457) the publication of the Tokyo guidelines, that is, prior to and including 2007, and from 2008 onward, respectively. We reviewed patient records retrospectively to collect demographic data, biochemical data, radiological findings, and postoperative outcomes. All these factors were compared between the groups. The duration of symptoms before surgery was significantly longer before 2008 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.018). ELC was significantly more frequent after 2008 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). Laparoscopic surgery was converted to open surgery in 16.1\u00a0% of patients before 2008 vs. 7.8\u00a0% of patients after 2008 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). There were no significant differences in bile duct injury or postoperative complications between the groups. The length of preoperative, postoperative, and total hospital stay was longer before 2008. ELC is a safe and effective therapeutic strategy for AC. The Tokyo guidelines resulted in a significant increase in the number of ELCs being performed and significantly reduced preoperative and total hospital stay without increasing intra- and postoperative complications. Importantly, ELC reduced medical costs, which is crucial for a country with limited resources, such as Tunisia.\n"}]}]}}

Perinatal characteristics, major morbidity and case mix adjusted mortality were compared between 1879 rural and 6775 urban infants <32 weeks gestational age, born in 1992-2002 and admitted to all 10 neonatal intensive care units in NSW and ACT. Rural mothers were more likely to be teenaged, indigenous, and to have had a previous premature birth, prolonged ruptured membrane, and antenatal corticosteroid. Urban mothers were more likely to have had assisted conception and a caesarean section. More urban (93% v 83%) infants were born in a tertiary obstetric hospital. Infants of rural residence had a higher mortality (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07 to 1.48, p = 0.005).

Each group was further subdivided into 6 subgroups (EA1, EA2, EA3, EB1, EB2, EB3, LA1, LA2, LA3, LB1, LB2, LB3), each containing 8 rats. Intestinal anastomosis was performed by polyglactin 910 sutures in A subgroups and with ethyl-2-cyanoacrylate in B subgroups. The anastomosis was end to end in A1 and B1, side to side in A2 and B2, and end to side in A3 and B3. Time for anastomosis performance (AT) was recorded. In group E, bursting pressures and hydroxyproline levels were determined on the second postoperative day, whereas in group L, the same measurements were made on the sixth postoperative day. One-way analysis of variance was used for analyses of variance in the groups. Quantitative data were analyzed with Student's t test. P value was considered significant at less than .05. There was no significant difference between bursting pressures of subgroup pairs on both postoperative days 2 and 6. Hydroxyproline levels and AT were significantly better in B subgroups.

No perfect method exists for accurate and reliable avoidance of these catastrophes. This study aimed to study the usefulness of routine intraoperative endoscopy (RIOE) by comparing the surgical outcomes for RIOE patients with those for selective intraoperative endoscopy (SIOE) patients. A retrospective chart review was performed for consecutive patients who underwent elective laparoscopic colorectal resections with distal anastomosis between January 2004 and May 2007. One surgeon performed RIOE, whereas the other three surgeons performed SIOE as necessary. All the abnormalities of IOE patients were managed with a subsequent salvage procedure, and the postoperative outcomes were compared between the RIOE and SIOE groups. The study included 107 patients in the RIOE group and 137 patients in the SIOE group. Abnormalities were detected in 11 RIOE patients (10.3%) (six with staple line bleeding, three with positive air leak test results, and two with additional pathology identified). All but one abnormality was laparoscopically managed without conversion to laparotomy. Whereas one patient experienced postoperative staple line bleeding that required a second operation, the remaining 10 patients recovered uneventfully. The mean hospital stay was 6 days (range, 4-9) days. The RIOE group had overall rates of 0% for anastomotic leakage and 0.9% for staple line bleeding. Intraoperative endoscopies were performed for 30 (21.9%) of the 137 patients in the SIOE group. The postoperative outcomes comparison between the RIOE and SIOE groups showed a tendency toward more overall anastomotic complications (0.9% vs. 5.1%) in the SIOE group, which due to the small sample size did not translate into significant differences in terms of staple line bleeding and anastomotic leakage. There also were no significant differences in other outcomes such as ileus, abdominal or pelvic sepsis, reoperation, positive distal margin, distance from distal margins, length of hospital stay, or mortality. Routine IOE for patients undergoing elective laparoscopic colorectal surgery with distal anastomosis can detect abnormalities at or around the anastomosis. Although the RIOE group had fewer postoperative anastomotic complications, due to the small sample size, the 5.7-fold increase in anastomotic failure did not translate into significantly better postoperative outcomes than the SIOE group experienced. A larger-scale single or multicenter prospective randomized study or a metaanalysis including similar studies is necessary for further investigation of this issue.\n"}]}]}}

Specimens were micro-computed tomography imaged to evaluate trabecular thickness, trabecular number, trabecular separation, bone volume density (BV/TV), BMD, and cortical thickness. Miniscrews 1.4 mm in diameter and 6 mm long were inserted into the bone blocks, and primary stability was evaluated by insertion torque (IT), mini-implant mobility (PTV), and pull-out strength (PS). Intergroup comparison showed lower levels of primary stability when the BMD of trabecular bone was lower and in the absence of cortical bone (P\u2264.05). The Pearson correlation test showed correlation between trabecular number, trabecular thickness, BV/TV, trabecular BMD, total BMD, and IT, PTV, and PS.

Three hundred ninety patients with displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures that were treated with plate osteosynthesis from December 2002 to December 2010 were reviewed. Two hundred two patients (group A) were treated by osteosynthesis with autologous bone grafting, and 188 patients (group B) were treated by osteosynthesis without bone grafting. One hundred eighty-one patients with an AO type 73-C1 fracture (Sanders type II), 182 patients with an AO type 73-C2 fracture (Sanders type III), and 27 patients with an AO type 73-C3 fracture (Sanders type IV) were included in this study.

We therefore sought to perform a population-level assessment for the presence of a July effect in this field. We used the Nationwide Inpatient Sample to abstract data on patients undergoing 1 of 8 major cancer surgeries at academic medical centres between Jan. 1, 1999, and Dec. 30, 2009. The primary outcomes examined were postoperative complications and in-hospital mortality. Univariate analyses and subsequently multivariate analyses, controlling for patient and hospital characteristics, were performed to identify whether the time of surgery was an independent predictor of outcome after major cancer surgery. On univariate analysis, the overall postoperative complication rate, as well as genitourinary and hematologic complications specifically, was higher in July than the rest of the year. However, on multivariate analysis, only hematologic complications were significantly higher in July, with no difference in overall postoperative complication rate or in-hospital mortality for all 8 surgeries considered separately or together.

The endpoints measured were postoperative morbidity, length of stay and readmission rates. Both groups were similar in terms of patient demographics, diagnosis, and nature of surgery performed. In the study group, 61% of patients underwent elective surgery compared with 62% in the control group. The incidence of postoperative morbidity in the study group was 20% compared with 33% in the control group (p = 0.003).

However, actual temperature conditions are not known. We decided to study the temperature levels during preservation with the Biotainer storage can and Vitalpack transport pack.

The probe recorded the temperature level every 10 minutes during four days. We compared the results found with the new storage can with results obtained in the same conditions with the storage can formerly used by our team. We also studied the best position of the probe for temperature monitoring and the influence of the amount of ice within the transport pack on the temperature level. We then monitored the temperature during the conservation of actual human kidney grafts harvested at our institution from August 2007 to May 2008. The temperature levels were the same regardless of the position of the probe within the transport pack. The lowest temperature was maintained during 15 hours, and the temperature level stayed below 5 degrees C for 57 hours with the new storage can. The former storage can maintained the lowest temperature level for 80 minutes, and temperature reached 5 degrees C after 10 hours 40 minutes. Temperature levels were similar when 2 or 4 kg of crushed ice were used. We observed similar results when monitoring the conservation of human grafts. The new storage can affords more stable temperature levels when compared to the formerly used can. Since temperature is stable during conservation, continuous monitoring in everyday practice does not seem warranted.\n \nThe ethics of cold calling-visiting subjects at home without prior appointment agreed-in follow up research studies has received little attention although it is perceived to be quite common. We examined the ethical implications of cold calling in a study of subjects with defined neurotic disorders followed up 12 years after initial assessment carried out to determine outcome in terms of symptoms, social functioning, and contact with health services. The patients concerned were asked at original assessment if they would agree to be followed up subsequently and although they agreed no time limit was put on this. To decide if cold calling was ethically justifiable and, if so, to set guidelines for researchers. The study was a cohort study of patients with neurotic disorder treated initially for 10 weeks in a randomised controlled trial. At follow up by a research medical practitioner 18 of the 210 patients had died and of the remaining 192 patients 186 (97%) were seen or had a telephone interview. Four patients refused and two others did not have interviews but agreed to some data being obtained. However, only 104 patients (54%) responded to letters inviting them to make an appointment or to refuse contact and the remainder were followed up by cold calling, with most patients agreeing readily to the research interview. The findings illustrate the dilemma of the need to get the maximum possible data from such studies to achieve scientific validity (and thereby justify the ethics of the study) and the protection of subjects' privacy and autonomy. More attention needs to be paid to consent procedures if cold calling is to be defended on ethical grounds but it is unreasonable to expect this to be obtained at the beginning of a research study in a way that satisfies the requirements for informed consent. A suggested way forward is to obtain written consent for the research at the time that cold calling takes place before beginning the research.\n"}]}]}}

In fact, data from the era of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) suggest that clinical examination of the axilla is falsely positive in as many as 30% of cases. Here we report the results of SLN biopsy in a selected group of breast cancer patients with palpable axillary nodes classified as either moderately or highly suspicious for metastasis. Among 2,027 consecutive SLN biopsy procedures performed by two experienced surgeons, clinically suspicious axillary nodes were identified in 106, and categorized as group 1 (asymmetric enlargement of the ipsilateral axillary nodes moderately suspicious for metastasis, n = 62) and group 2 (clinically positive axillary nodes highly suspicious for metastasis, n = 44). Clinical examination of the axilla was inaccurate in 41% of patients (43 of 106) overall, and was falsely positive in 53% of patients (33 of 62) with moderately suspicious nodes and 23% of patients (10 of 44) with highly suspicious nodes. False-positive results were less frequent with larger tumor size (p = 0.002) and higher histologic grade (p = 0.002), but were not associated with age, body mass index, or a previous surgical biopsy. Clinical axillary examination in breast cancer is subject to false-positive results, and is by itself insufficient justification for axillary lymph node dissection. If other means of preoperative assessment such as palpation- or image-guided fine needle aspiration are negative or indeterminate, then SLN biopsy deserves wider consideration as an alternative to routine axillary lymph node dissection in the clinically node-positive setting.\n \nAxillary nodal status is one of the most important prognostic factors in breast cancer. In the present study we used it to determine the predictors of axillary lymph node metastases in breast cancer and to determine if there is a group of patients in whom minimal axillary surgery is indicated. This article reports a retrospective study of 953 patients with T1 and T2 invasive breast carcinomas seen in the University Malaya Medical Centre between January 2001 and December 2005, where axillary dissection was done. Of the 953 patients, 283 (29.7%) had breast-conserving surgery, and the rest had mastectomies. In this series, 463 patients (48.6%) were younger than 50 years of age; 365 patients (38.3%) had lymph node involvement. The Malays tend to have more axillary node metastases (45.1%) than the Chinese (36.9%); however, there was no significant relationship between age and race and lymph node involvement. Some 23.9% of grade 1 cancers were node positive, compared to 42.9% of grade 2/3 cancers. Tumor size ranged from 0.2 cm to 5 cm; 55.5% of tumors were T2 (>2-5 cm). There were only 13 (1.4%) T1a tumors (>0.1-0.5 cm). Node involvement was documented in 7.7% of T1a tumors, 12.3% of T1b tumors (>0.5-1 cm), 29.2% of T1c tumors, and 48.2% of T2 tumors. In patients who had no lymphovascular invasion (LVI), 24.4% had axillary node metastases, compared with 52.2% of patients where LVI was reported. On univariate analysis, our study found that tumor diameter>2 cm, presence of lymphovascular invasion, and higher tumor grade (2&3) were factors significantly associated with a higher risk of nodal metastases. On multivariate analysis, however, only lymphovascular invasion and tumor size were independent predictors based on the logistic regression. In T1 tumors, axillary lymph node dissection will overtreat almost 75% of cases; therefore a sentinel lymph node biopsy is justified in these tumors. Sentinel lymph node biopsy has been shown to reduce the complications of formal axillary dissection, such as shoulder stiffness, pain, and lymphedema. In patients with T2 tumors, where almost 45% have lymph node involvement, sentinel node biopsy may not be cost effective.\n"}]}]}}

After a thorough history and physical examination, a retinal examination was performed by an ophthalmologist. If findings were positive, further investigation was undertaken to rule out systemic disorder or child abuse. One child was found with unilateral retinal haemorrhages following an episode of a simple febrile convulsion. A thorough investigation uncovered no other reason for this finding. Retinal haemorrhages following a convulsive episode are rare.

Patients (n = 408) who had previously received both dilated direct ophthalmoscopy by a diabetologist and retinal photography graded by a diabetologist within 3 months of each other were included. The results of the other screening modality were not available to the grader/screener. The first 308 patients were consecutive attendees at the clinic who fulfilled the study criteria and 100 were selected because they were identified as having potential STDED by either one of these modalities. An ophthalmologist using slit lamp biomicroscopy then examined patients identified with potential STDED. In 357 (88%) patients there was agreement between the two modalities about whether referral to an ophthalmologist was required (kappa 0.62). Retinal photography identified 38 patients for referral to ophthalmology which ophthalmoscopy missed. Of these, the ophthalmologist agreed that STDED was present in 32 (84%) and four patients required early laser. Ophthalmoscopy identified 13 patients for referral who were not identified by photography. Of these, the ophthalmologist agreed with the diabetologist that STDED was present in seven (54%) and one patient required early laser. Ophthalmoscopy may identify the occasional patient with diabetes who has STDED which is missed by retinal photography. For a systematic retinal screening programme, adding ophthalmoscopy to retinal photography will increase false-positive referrals and is likely to detect only a few extra patients requiring laser.\n"}]}]}}

We assessed whether the choice of either of these methods to obtain euglycaemia biases subsequent assessment of glucose metabolism and insulin action. We studied seven obese Type 2 diabetic patients twice Basal plasma glucose levels (mean +/- sd) were 5.5 +/- 0.5 and 10.7 +/- 2.9 mmol/l in the + ON and - ON studies, respectively, and were clamped at -5.5 mmol/l. Basal rates of glucose production (GP) were similar in the + ON and - ON studies, 83 +/- 13 vs. 85 +/- 14 mg m-2 min-1 (NS), whereas basal rates of glucose disappearance (Rd) were lower in the + ON than in the - ON study, 84 +/- 8 vs. 91 +/- 11 mg m-2 min-1 (P = 0.02).

Socioeconomic status for each individual patient was derived using Carstairs and Morris Deprivation Category ranging from 1 (least deprived) to 7 (most deprived) on the basis of the postcode sector of their address. In all, 129 lung cancer patients entered into the study. Of these data for 82 patients were complete (at baseline and follow-up). 57% of patients were of lower socioeconomic status and they had more health problems, less functioning, and more symptoms as compared to affluent patients. Of these, physical mobility (P = 0.05), energy (P = 0.01), role functioning (P = 0.04), physical functioning (P = 0.03), and breathlessness (P = 0.02) were significant at baseline. However, at follow-up assessment there was no significant difference between patient groups nor did any consistent pattern emerge. At baseline assessment patients of lower socioeconomic status showed lower health related quality of life.

It is unclear whether HIV-infected individuals receive the same care for lung cancer as immunocompetent patients because of comorbidities, the potential for interaction between antiretroviral agents and cancer chemotherapy, and concerns regarding complications related to treatment or infection. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of HIV infection on receipt of guidance-concordant care, and its impact on overall survival among non-small cell lung cancer Medicare beneficiaries. The study design was a matched case-control design where each HIV patient was matched by age group, sex, race, and lung cancer stage at diagnosis with 20 controls randomly selected among those who were not HIV infected. The patients included in this study were Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer between 1998 and 2007, who qualified for Medicare on the basis of age and were 65 years of age or older at the time of lung cancer diagnosis. HIV infection status was based on Medicare claims data. A total of 174 HIV cases and 3480 controls were included in the analysis. Odds ratios for receiving guidance-concordant care and hazard ratios for overall survival were estimated. HIV infection was not independently associated with the receipt of guidance-concordant care. Among stage I/II patients, median survival times were 26 and 43 months, respectively, for those with and without HIV infection (odds ratio=1.48, P=0.021). HIV infection was not associated with receipt of guidance-concordant care but reduced survival in early-stage patients.\n"}]}]}}

Bone marrow chimeras were generated before inducing liver failure to trace bone marrow-derived cells.

The patients were divided into three groups For all patients, except those with univentricular cardiac defects, early mortality (30 d after surgery) was reduced. Among patients with severe cardiac defects, early mortality was reduced from 18.6% in group 1 to 2.9% in group 2. Among patients with less severe cardiac defects, early mortality was reduced from 6.2% to 1.9%. The improved outcome was maintained during the following 5 y. Overall relative risk of death during follow-up was reduced to 0.31 (95% CI Early mortality has been substantially reduced in congenital heart defect patients, and corresponds with significantly improved long-term survival.\n \nAmong all postoperative complications, cardiac arrest after cardiac surgical operations has the greatest association with mortality. However, hospital variation in the ability to rescue after cardiac arrest is unknown. The purpose of this study was to characterize the impact of cardiac arrest on mortality and determine the relative impact of patient, operative, and hospital factors on failure to rescue (FTR) rates and surgical mortality after cardiac arrest. A total of 79,582 patients underwent operations at 17 different hospitals (2001 through 2011), including 5.2% (n=4,138) with postoperative cardiac arrest. Failure to rescue was defined as mortality after cardiac arrest. Patient risk, operative features, and outcomes were compared among hospitals. Overall FTR rate was 60% with significant variation among hospitals (range, 50% to 83%; p<0.001). Failure-to-rescue patients were slightly older, presented with increased preoperative risk, and underwent more emergent operations (all p<0.05). After risk adjustment, the variable \"individual hospital\" demonstrated the strongest association with likelihood for FTR (likelihood ratio=39.1; p<0.001). Overall risk-adjusted mortality, cardiac arrest, and FTR rates varied across hospitals and did not correlate. High-performing hospitals with lowest FTR rates accrued longer postoperative and intensive care unit stays after the index operation (2 to 3 days; p<0.001). Significant hospital variation exists in cardiac surgical mortality and FTR rates after cardiac arrest. Institutional factors appear to confer the strongest influence on the likelihood for mortality after cardiac arrest compared with patient and operative factors. Identifying best practice patterns at the highest performing centers may serve to improve surgical outcomes after cardiac arrest and improve patient quality.\n"}]}]}}

Childbirth significantly affects puerpera's physical, psychological and social domains of quality of life. Under the circumstance of increasing high caesarean section rate in rural China, the impact of delivery mode on postnatal quality of life remains unclear. Cross-sectional study design. Women residing in rural areas and in their 0-12 months after childbirth from 30 rural townships participated in a household survey. A structured questionnaire was used to evaluate women's socio-demographic characteristics, previous pregnant experiences, foetal characteristics and use of maternal health services. The scale for rural postnatal quality of life was adopted to assess postnatal quality of life from six dimensions The overall caeserean section rate was 70\u00b70% (962/1375), and most of them (59\u00b77%) were selected by maternal request. None of six dimensions and total score of quality of life displayed significant difference between women with normal delivery and cesaerean section. It was found that postnatal home visit related to good postnatal quality of life and lower husband education level, male gender of infant were associated with poor quality of life. Delivery mode did not affect postpartum quality of life in rural China. Socio-cultural determinants may contribute more in influencing postnatal quality of life. Null findings in impact of delivery mode on postpartum quality of life may cause more difficulties in maternal decision-making for vaginal delivery in rural China. The importance of postnatal home visit could justify available and quality postnatal care in improving postpartum quality of life. Further research needs to explore the effective prevention programmes, especially attention for parenting boys.\n \nTo evaluate the construct validity of the Turkish version of the EQ-5D in patients with acute coronary syndrome. The study was conducted as a cross-sectional study at the Trakya University Hospital between February and May 2008. All patients completed the Turkish version of the EQ-5D and MacNew heart-related quality of life scale. Construct validity of the EQ-5D was assessed according to relationships with MacNew subscales by using Spearman rank correlation and multiple linear regression analyses. One hundred and twenty-two patients responded to the instruments. Mean age was 62.9\u00b19.3 years and male gender (88 or 72.1%) was dominant. Mean score of the EQ-5D index was 0.79\u00b10.32, while the global score of MacNew was 5.01\u00b11.16. The correlation coefficients of the EQ-5D index score with the MacNew subscales ranged from 0.557 to 0.721, with EQ-5D VAS score ranging from 0.297 to 0.484 (p<0.001 for all of them). According to the stepwise regression model MacNew global score was found to be significantly effective factor on EQ-5D index score (\u03b2 =0.188; 95% CI The Turkish version of the EQ-5D-based utility score seems to be a valid instrument in the assessment of quality of life studies in patients with acute coronary syndrome.\n"}]}]}}

In most cases no abnormality is found. The main objective of this study was to explore the role of uterine natural killer (uNK) cells and their regulatory cytokine IL-15 in irregular bleeding in HT users. This was a prospective observational study conducted between 2002 and 2004. The study was conducted in a tertiary referral menopause clinic at King Edward Memorial Hospital, Western Australia. Patients included 117 postmenopausal women taking combined HT. Outpatient endometrial biopsies were taken during and outside bleeding episodes. The relationship between endometrial uNK cells (CD56+) and bleeding patterns was measured. We also addressed the impact of HT exposure on uNK cell populations, the relationship between endometrial IL-15 expression and uNK cell populations, and killer Ig like receptor genotype in subjects with irregular bleeding. Endometrial CD56+ uNK cells were significantly increased in biopsies obtained during bleeding episodes (P < 0.001), compared with HT users with no bleeding. The highest level of IL-15 expression was also seen in biopsies taken during bleeding. No clear relationship between killer Ig like receptor genotype and bleeding on HT was observed. Little is known about the mechanisms underlying irregular bleeding in HT users. This is the first report of uNK cells and their association with regulating cytokines in postmenopausal endometrium and demonstrates a possible mechanism by which HT may induce irregular bleeding.\n \nThe reported frequency of malignant or premalignant changes confined to endometrial polyps (EP) is 0.5-6%. The management of atypical endometrial hyperplasia (AEH) confined to EP is not yet established. Recently, an alternative pathological nomenclature has emerged using the term endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia (EIN) instead of atypia. The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety of conservative hysteroscopic resection of endometrial polyps with AEH or EIN. Retrospective cohort study of all cases of hysteroscopic resections of EP was performed at a single center between the years 2000-2011. All patients with a pathologic diagnosis of AEH in EP were included. A post-hoc revision of the pathologic specimens was made according to the EIN classification. Of the 32 patients with AEH in EP, 25 had normal endometrial curetting. Even with AEH confined to EP, 12 cases (48%) showed AEH (11 cases) or carcinoma (1 case) in the hysterectomy specimens. EIN in EP (14 cases) was correlated with 57% of diagnosis of EIN or carcinoma in the uterus; whereas in the absence of EIN in EP only 1 of 9 cases showed EIN in the final pathologic specimen (p=0.002), and none with carcinoma, which yields a PPV of 14% and a NPV of 100%. The diagnosis of EIN in EP may be a better predictor than AEH for endometrial involvement with malignant or pre-malignant neoplasms. The safety of conservative hysteroscopic resection of EP with AEH/EIN is questioned.\n"}]}]}}

We evaluated in both groups the complete disappearance of the cystic portion of the thyroid nodule on follow-up ultrasonography (first follow-up ultrasonography; mean, 4.6 months in group A; mean, 4.4 months in group B) (chi-square test), side effects or complications during and after the procedure (chi-square test), and the total procedure time (Student t test). Most patients showed complete disappearance of the cystic portion of the thyroid nodule (group A, n = 29; group B, n = 28), and they revealed no recurrence on follow-up ultrasonography. There was no statistical difference in the success rates between group A and group B (P > .05). Pain, the most common side effect, and other mild side effects or complications occurred in small numbers of patients in each group, but there was no significant difference in side effects or complications between the 2 groups (P > .05), except for intracystic hemorrhage (P < .05) and the complaint of all group B patients due to a double puncture (P < .001). The total procedure time was nearly double in group B than in group A because of the additional procedures, such as complete evacuation of the ethanol-mixed fluid and the 10-minute compression. Percutaneous ethanol injection without aspiration of ethanol-mixed fluid seems to be the preferable method of treatment of benign cystic thyroid nodules from the perspective of both the physician and the patient.\n \nThyroid nodules are common, and of those biopsied by fine-needle aspiration (FNA), the majority will be benign colloid nodules (BCN). Current guidelines suggest these BCN should be followed by ultrasonographic examination (US) every 3 years, with no endpoint specified. This study evaluated if long-term follow-up of benign thyroid nodules was associated with change in treatment or improvement in diagnosing a missed malignancy compared with short-term follow-up. All patients with FNA-based diagnosis of BCN at our institution from 1998 to 2009 were identified. Patients observed after the diagnosis were divided into short-term follow-up (<3 years) and long-term follow-up (\u22653 years). Rates of repeat FNA, thyroidectomy, and malignancy detection were compared. Of 738 patients with BCN, 92 patients underwent thyroid resection after the initial US. Six hundred forty-six patients were observed, of which 366 returned for 1 or more follow-up US Long-term follow-up of patients with BCN is associated with increased repeat FNA and US without improvement in the malignancy detection rate.

It offers an excellent weight loss and resolution of comorbidities in the short term with a very low incidence of complications. However, the ever present risk of a staple line leak is still a major concern. Since 2005, data from obese patients that undergo bariatric procedures in Germany are prospectively registered in an online database and analyzed at the Institute of Quality Assurance in Surgical Medicine. For the current analysis, all patients that had undergone primary sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity within a 7-year period were considered. Using the GBSR, data from 5.400 LSGs were considered for analysis. Staple line leak rate decreased during the study period from 6.5 to 1.4 %. Male gender, higher BMI, concomitant sleep apnea, conversion to laparotomy, longer operation time, use of both buttresses and oversewing, and the occurrence of intraoperative complications were associated with a significantly higher leakage rate. On multivariate analysis, operation time and year of procedure only had a significant impact on staple line leak rate. The results of the current study demonstrated that there are factors that increase the risk of a leakage which would enable surgeons to define risk groups, to more carefully select patients, and to offer a closer follow-up during the postoperative course with early recognition and adequate treatment. All future efforts should be focused on a further reduction of serious complications to make the LSG a widely accepted and safer procedure.\n \nAnastomotic complications such as leakage and bleeding remain among the most serious complications of laparoscopic colorectal surgery. No perfect method exists for accurate and reliable avoidance of these catastrophes. This study aimed to study the usefulness of routine intraoperative endoscopy (RIOE) by comparing the surgical outcomes for RIOE patients with those for selective intraoperative endoscopy (SIOE) patients. A retrospective chart review was performed for consecutive patients who underwent elective laparoscopic colorectal resections with distal anastomosis between January 2004 and May 2007. One surgeon performed RIOE, whereas the other three surgeons performed SIOE as necessary. All the abnormalities of IOE patients were managed with a subsequent salvage procedure, and the postoperative outcomes were compared between the RIOE and SIOE groups. The study included 107 patients in the RIOE group and 137 patients in the SIOE group. Abnormalities were detected in 11 RIOE patients (10.3%) (six with staple line bleeding, three with positive air leak test results, and two with additional pathology identified). All but one abnormality was laparoscopically managed without conversion to laparotomy. Whereas one patient experienced postoperative staple line bleeding that required a second operation, the remaining 10 patients recovered uneventfully. The mean hospital stay was 6 days (range, 4-9) days. The RIOE group had overall rates of 0% for anastomotic leakage and 0.9% for staple line bleeding. Intraoperative endoscopies were performed for 30 (21.9%) of the 137 patients in the SIOE group. The postoperative outcomes comparison between the RIOE and SIOE groups showed a tendency toward more overall anastomotic complications (0.9% vs. 5.1%) in the SIOE group, which due to the small sample size did not translate into significant differences in terms of staple line bleeding and anastomotic leakage. There also were no significant differences in other outcomes such as ileus, abdominal or pelvic sepsis, reoperation, positive distal margin, distance from distal margins, length of hospital stay, or mortality. Routine IOE for patients undergoing elective laparoscopic colorectal surgery with distal anastomosis can detect abnormalities at or around the anastomosis. Although the RIOE group had fewer postoperative anastomotic complications, due to the small sample size, the 5.7-fold increase in anastomotic failure did not translate into significantly better postoperative outcomes than the SIOE group experienced. A larger-scale single or multicenter prospective randomized study or a metaanalysis including similar studies is necessary for further investigation of this issue.\n"}]}]}}

To identify distinctive features in patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms, and to determine whether these symptoms support the hypothesis of the existence of specific somatic syndromes. Observational study, with a comparison control group. Four primary care practices affiliated with the University of Nijmegen in the Netherlands. One hundred and eighty-two patients diagnosed between 1998 and 2002 as having chronic functional somatic symptoms and 182 controls matched by age, sex, socioeconomic status, and practice were included. Data on comorbidity, referrals, diagnostic tests, and hospital admissions over a period of 10 years prior to the diagnosis were collected. Medication use and number of visits to the general practitioner (GP) were extracted from the moment computerised registration was started. In the 10 years before the diagnosis of chronic functional somatic symptoms, significantly more patients than controls presented functional somatic symptoms in at least two body systems, and used more somatic and psychotropic drugs. They visited the GP twice as much, statistically had significantly more psychiatric morbidity, and were referred more often to mental health workers and somatic specialists. The number of patients undergoing diagnostic tests was higher for patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms than for controls, but hospital admissions rates were equal. Patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms have a great diversity of functional somatic symptoms. They use more somatic and psychotropic drugs than controls in the years before diagnosis. Moreover, they show high rates of referrals and psychiatric morbidity. The diversity of symptoms of patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms supports the concept that symptoms do not cluster in well defined distinct syndromes. Therefore, patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms should preferably not be classified into medical subspecialty syndromes.\n \nTo study the effectiveness of combined integral somatic and psychiatric treatment in a medical-psychiatric unit (MPU). Retrospective case-note study. The case notes of all patients admitted to the MPU at the VU Medical Center, Amsterdam, in 2011 were analysed. Data on reasons for referral and somatic and psychiatric diagnoses were collected. Using a global clinical assessment scale and the Health of the Nations Outcome Scales (HoNOS), data on psychiatric symptomology and limitations, behavioural problems, social problems and limitations associated with physical health problems were collected on both admission and discharge. In this way the effect of the admission period on various problems was determined. In 2011 there were 139 admissions to the MPU with a wide variation of somatic and psychiatric diagnoses. The average admission period was 9 days. Global clinical evaluation of the treatment goals set for somatic and psychiatric conditions showed that more than 90% and 85% of the treatment goals, respectively, were completely achieved. HoNOS scores showed a reduction in severity of both psychiatric and somatic problems. The total HoNOS-core was significantly reduced by nearly 3.5 points - a large effect size. The MPU has succeeded in its goal to deliver integral care to a very diverse group of patients with somatic and psychiatric co-morbidities. It is able to offer care to a vulnerable patient group in which it can be presumed that treatment on a non-integrated unit could not have been delivered or not delivered adequately, due to the complexity of their somatic and behavioural problems.\n"}]}]}}

Incomplete bladder emptying may be related to bladder-sphincter dyssynergia. Ultrasonography and uroflowmetry are used in the initial evaluation of many children with voiding dysfunction. We determine in children with voiding dysfunction whether incomplete bladder emptying has an important role in the pathogenesis of urinary tract infections and whether abnormal ultrasonography or uroflowmetry can predict which children are at increased risk of recurrent UTIs. In this retrospective cohort study charts of 148 consecutive patients diagnosed with voiding dysfunction were reviewed for information regarding residual urine volumes on initial post-void ultrasound and the number of urinary tract infections on followup. Initial uroflowmetry curves were blindly reevaluated for this study. Considerable (greater than 10% predicted) post-void residual urine volumes were seen on 15% of ultrasounds, and 78% of uroflowmetry studies were characterized as abnormal. The volume of residual urine (corrected for age) showed a positive correlation with the number of UTIs occurring after the initial visit (r = 0.3, p <0.002). There was no correlation between an abnormal uroflow pattern and number of subsequent UTIs. Although increased residual urine on post-void ultrasound increases the risk of UTI recurrence in children with voiding dysfunction, it does not allow accurate identification of specific children at risk.\n \nTo determine the relationship between obesity and febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) in young children. We reviewed all medical records of children aged\u00a0<3\u00a0years who visited our institution for febrile\u00a0UTIs and infant national health checkups (controls) between January 2008 and February 2012. All subjects were subcategorized into 3 groups of lean, overweight, and obese using weight-for-length measurements. The effect of obesity on UTI risk was evaluated and odds ratios were calculated. We analyzed 465 patients with UTIs and 812 controls. The proportion of overweight and obese children was higher in patients with UTIs (22.8%) and acute pyelonephritis (APN; 31.1%) compared with those in the control (11.7%; P\u00a0<.05). After adjusting for age and gender, the odds ratio (OR) of UTI in obese relative to lean children was 1.84 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-3.05) and that of APN was 2.43 (95% CI, 1.27-4.62). The OR of APN in overweight relative to lean children was 1.96 (95% CI, 1.11-3.46). After adjusting for age, the OR of APN in obese relative to lean boys was 2.74 (95% CI, 1.11-6.77) and that in overweight to lean girls was 2.48 (95% CI, 1.05-5.83). Within patients with UTIs, compared with lean children, the obese showed a longer duration of fever and a higher frequency of APN and the overweight had a higher incidence of hydronephrosis (P\u00a0<.05). Obesity may be associated with higher odds of a febrile UTI and APN in young children.\n"}]}]}}

The objective of this study was to analyze the change in the health of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Part A (hospital insurance) between 2008 and 2010 by comparing the prevalence of 11 chronic conditions. We conducted descriptive analyses using the 2008 and 2010 Chronic Conditions Public Use Files, which are newly available from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and have administrative (claims) data on 100% of the Medicare fee-for-service population. We examined the data by age, sex, and dual eligibility (eligibility for both Medicare and Medicaid). Medicare Part A beneficiaries had more chronic conditions on average in 2010 than in 2008. The percentage increase in the average number of chronic conditions was larger for dual-eligible beneficiaries (2.8%) than for nondual-eligible beneficiaries (1.2%). The prevalence of some chronic conditions, such as congestive heart failure, ischemic heart disease, and stroke/transient ischemic attack, decreased. The deterioration of average health was due to other chronic conditions Analyzing the prevalence of 11 chronic conditions by using Medicare claims data provides a monitoring tool that can guide health care providers and policy makers in devising strategies to address chronic conditions and rising health care costs.\n \nDiagnostic imaging services have been repeatedly targeted as a source of excess health care expenditure. In particular, MRI is considered a high-tech and high-cost imaging service that saw rapid increases in utilization in the early 2000s. However, the most recent trends in the utilization of MR are not known. The aim of this study was to quantify trends in MR utilization overall and by body system from 1998 to 2010 in the Medicare population. Medicare Part B data sets were obtained for 1998 to 2010 for all MR examinations performed in the Medicare population. Using Current Procedural Terminology codes, the total volume and utilization rates of all MR examinations were tabulated for each year of the study period. MR volume was then categorized by body system. The utilization rate of MR examinations in the Medicare population was 73 per 1,000 beneficiaries in 1998, increased to a peak of 189 in 2008, and decreased to 183 in 2010. The compound annual growth rate from 1998 to 2008 was 10%. The utilization rate in 2010 represents a decrease of 3.1% from the 2009 utilization rate. The most frequently imaged body section in every year was the head, which accounted for 2,404,250 examinations in 2010, 37.3% of all MR examinations in that year. The overall MRI utilization rate sharply increased from 1998 until 2008 but then decreased in each of the next 2 years. A similar trend was noted for MR examinations performed in most body sections. These trends are likely to be the result of a number of possible causative factors.\n"}]}]}}

A 'before-and-after' study design was used to assess any changes in practice, and to monitor whether any changes occurred in the district during the time of the study; data were also collected at the third MOU. Data were collected by scoring of the obstetric files after the patient had delivered. We ascertained whether the obstetric history, syphilis testing, blood group testing, haemoglobin measurement and uterine growth assessment were performed during antenatal care along with whether appropriate action was taken. For intrapartum care, estimation of fetal weight, the performance of pelvimetry, blood pressure monitoring, urine testing, evaluation of head above pelvis, fetal heart rate monitoring, monitoring of contractions and plotting of cervical dilatation, and whether the appropriate actions were taken, were assessed. Eight of the 13 midwives at the two MOUs completed the PEP and all demonstrated an improvement in knowledge. Case notes of 303 patients from the various clinics were studied. There was no change in the referral patterns of any of the clinics during the study period. The obstetric history was well documented, but in no group was there a satisfactory response to a detected problem; appropriate action was taken in between 0% and 12% of cases. Syphilis testing was performed in 56-82% of cases, with no difference between the groups. The haemoglobin level was measured in only 4-15% of patients, with no difference before or after completion of the PEP. Where a problem in uterine growth was detected, an appropriate response occurred in 0-8% of patients and no difference before or after completion of the PEP was ascertained. In all groups, estimation of fetal weight and pelvimetry were seldom performed, the urine and fetal heart rate documentation were moderately well done and the blood pressure monitoring, assessment of head above pelvis, monitoring of contractions and plotting of cervical dilatation were usually performed. No differences before or after the PEP were detected. Where problems were detected, appropriate actions taken during labour improved, but not significantly. Completion of the obstetric manual of the PEP improved the knowledge of the midwives but no alteration in practice was detected.\n \nThe aims of the study were to find out the maternal and perinatal outcome of early onset severe preeclampsia (PE) in a tertiary care center in a developing country like India and to determine whether expectant management in such a setup improves the perinatal outcome. It was a retrospective study. All women with early PE were admitted stabilized and evaluated. Expectant management was given whenever there was no indication for eminent delivery. The perinatal outcome of the expectant group was compared with that of the aggressive group, and appropriate statistical analysis was carried out. A total of 106 women were admitted with severe PE, 61 were treated aggressively, and 45 were stable enough to receive expectant management. The total days gained on expectant management was 7 days. Perinatal mortality was 31.13%. Perinatal outcome of the expectant and aggressive management groups did not differ (P = 0.141); there was no increase in maternal complications on expectant management. There were 2 cases of maternal mortality in the aggressively managed group. Perinatal mortality in severe PE is high. There was no increase in maternal morbidity on expectant management; however, there was no difference in perinatal mortality on expectant management.\n"}]}]}}

A total of 1369 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer underwent radical prostatectomy by a single surgeon between 1991 and 2001. A subset of 203 patients (14.9%), who had undergone at least one prior benign prostate biopsy for a rising prostate-specific antigen and/or abnormal digital rectal examination, constituted our study population. A total of 1115 patients with no prior biopsy represented our control group. After prostatectomy, patients were evaluated at 6-month intervals for biochemical evidence of recurrence, defined as a prostate-specific antigen level of 0.5 ng/mL or greater. Patients with a prior benign biopsy had more favorable pathologic features with more organ-confined (74% versus 64%; P <0.001) and less margin-positive (9.8% versus 18%) disease. Only 24 patients (12%) in the study group (versus 20% in control group; P = 0.01) had eventual evidence of biochemical failure. Kaplan-Meier analyses suggested that patients with prior benign biopsies have improved biochemical disease-free survival, especially for those with more aggressive disease (Gleason sum 7 or greater; P <0.01). Overall, patients in the study group had lower probability (odds ratio 0.57, P <0.001) of biochemical failure compared with those in the control group.

Study 1. We recruited 24 patients awaiting standard 12-core TRUS-guided biopsies of the prostate to undergo PHS immediately beforehand. We compared PHS with the TRUS-guided biopsy results in terms of their ability to detect cancer within the whole prostate and to localize it to the correct side and to the correct region of the prostate. Lesions that were suspicious on PHS were biopsied separately. Study 2. We recruited 57 patients awaiting TTB to have PHS beforehand. We compared PHS with the TTB pathology results in terms of their ability to detect prostate cancer within the whole gland and to localize it to the correct side and to the correct sextant of the prostate. Study 3. We recruited 24 patients awaiting radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer to undergo preoperative PHS. We compared PHS with standardized pathological analysis of the whole-mount prostatectomy specimens in terms of their measurement of total tumour volume within the prostate, tumour volume within prostate sextants and volume of index lesions identified by PHS. The PHS-targeted biopsies had an overall cancer detection rate of 38.1%, compared with 62.5% with standard TRUS-guided biopsies. The sensitivity and specificity of PHS for localizing tumour to the correct prostate sextant, compared with standard TRUS-guided biopsies, were 100 and 5.9%, respectively. The PHS-targeted biopsies had an overall cancer detection rate of 13.4% compared with 54.4% for standard TTB. PHS had a sensitivity and specificity for cancer detection in the posterior gland of 100 and 13%, respectively, and for the anterior gland, 6 and 82%, respectively. We found no correlation between total tumour volume estimates from PHS and radical prostatectomy pathology (Pearson correlation coefficient -0.096). Sensitivity and specificity of PHS for detecting tumour foci \u22650.2\u2009mL in volume were 63 and 53%. These three independent studies in 105 patients suggest that PHS does not reliably identify and characterize prostate cancer in the routine clinical setting.\n"}]}]}}

The purposes of this study were to (1) explore predictive factors of functional level at discharge, (2) evaluate 1-year mortality after hip fracture compared with that of the general population, and (3) evaluate the affect of early functional outcome on 1-year mortality in patients operated on for hip fractures. A total of 228 consecutive patients (average age, 77.6 \u00b1 7.4 years) with hip fractures who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled in an open, prospective, observational cohort study. Functional level at discharge was measured with the motor Functional Independence Measure (FIM) score, which is the most widely accepted functional assessment measure in use in the rehabilitation community. Mortality rates in the study population were calculated in absolute numbers and as the standardized mortality ratio. Multivariate regression analysis was used to explore predictive factors for motor FIM score at discharge and for 1-year mortality adjusted for important baseline variables. Age, health status, cognitive level, preinjury functional level, and pressure sores after hip fracture surgery were independently related to lower discharge motor FIM scores. At 1-year followup, 57 patients (25%; 43 women and 14 men) had died. The 1-year hip fracture mortality rate compared with that of the general population was 31% in our population versus 7% for men and 23% in our population versus 5% for women 65 years or older. The 1-year standardized mortality rate was 341.3 (95% CI, 162.5-520.1) for men and 301.6 (95% CI, 212.4-391.8) for women, respectively. The all-cause mortality rate observed in this group was higher in all age groups and in both sexes when compared with the all-cause age-adjusted mortality of the general population. Motor FIM score at discharge was the only independent predictor of 1-year mortality after hip fracture. Functional level at discharge is the main determinant of long-term mortality in patients with hip fracture. Motor FIM score at discharge is a reliable predictor of mortality and can be recommended for clinical use.\n"}]}]}}

However, stones larger than 100 mm2 were statistically more successfully treated endoscopically, while there was no statistical difference in the treatment success of impacted stones between these two groups. ESWL can by considered as primary first therapeutic approach in treatment of all proximal ureteral stones except for stones larger than 100 mm2 that should primarily be treated endoscopically.\n"}]}]}}

Patients who attended the primary care general medicine and pulmonary subspecialty clinic were also assessed as to their proficiency in the use of metered-dose inhalers. A significant percentage of patients had a poor understanding of the technique used with the metered-dose inhaler. House staff and nursing staff were also less proficient in the proper use of the metered-dose inhaler. The respiratory care practitioners were the most knowledgeable of the health care providers. This study confirms that a large percentage of patients use metered-dose inhalers improperly.

Furthermore, this study supports the use of respiratory care practitioners in the outpatient setting, since they were the most proficient among all the health care providers in the proper use of metered-dose inhalers.\n \nThere is increasing pressure on mental health providers to reduce the duration of treatments, while retaining level of quality and effectiveness. The risk is that the population is underserved and therefore needs new treatment episodes. The primary aim of this study was to investigate whether duration of treatment and return into mental health care were related. This study examined Dutch patients with an initial treatment episode in 2009 or 2010 in specialized mental health settings for depressive disorder (N\u00a0=\u00a085,754). Follow-up data about treatment episodes were available up until 2013.

The majority of patients did not return into mental health care (86\u00a0%). Patients with a shorter duration of treatment (5-250\u00a0min; 251-500\u00a0min and 751-1000\u00a0min) were slightly more likely to return (reference group The results suggest that a longer duration of treatment may prevent return into mental health care in some groups. However, because of the design of the study, no causal inference can be drawn.

One mechanism proposed for this association is that green space provides a venue for, and therefore encourages, physical activity. It has also been suggested that socio-economic health inequalities may be narrower in greener areas because of the equalised opportunity for physical activity green spaces provide. However, research exploring associations between the availability of green space and physical activity has produced mixed results. Limits to the assessment of the type and amount of physical activity which occurs specifically in green space may account for these mixed findings. This observational study was therefore concerned with the extent to which green space is a venue for physical activity and whether this could account for narrower socio-economic health inequalities in greener neighbourhoods. Secondary analysis of cross sectional data on 3679 adults (16+) living in urban areas across Scotland matched with a neighbourhood level measure of green space availability. Associations between green space availability and both total physical activity, and activity specifically within green space, were explored using logistic regression models. Interactions between socio-economic position and physical activity were assessed. All models adjusted for age, sex and household income. The availability of green space in a neighbourhood was not associated with total physical activity or that specifically in green space. There was no evidence that income-related inequalities in physical activity within green space were narrower in greener areas of Scotland. Physical activity may not be the main mechanism explaining the association between green space and health in Scotland. The direct effect of perceiving a natural environment on physiological and psychological health may offer an alternative explanation.\n"}]}]}}

The aim of the present study was to describe the prevalence and severity of FI among nursing home residents, and to investigate factors associated with FI. This was a cross-sectional study conducted in nursing homes in Ostrava, Czech Republic. Demographics and comorbidities were extracted from medical records of nursing homes. Data regarding incontinence were obtained via face-to-face interviews with residents or extracted from registered nurses' accounts (regarding residents with severe cognitive impairment). In total, 588 nursing home residents were enrolled into the study. FI was noted in 336 (57.1%) participating residents. The majority of FI residents (57.8%) reported FI episodes several times a week; daily FI episodes were found in 22.9% of the FI residents. The mean Cleveland Clinic Incontinence Score in FI residents was 17.2\u00b11.8 (mean\u00b1SD). Factors associated with FI (statistically significant) were poor general health status (\u22654 comorbidities), urinary incontinence, cognitive-function impairment (dementia), decreased mobility, and length of nursing home residency. There was no association between FI and age, sex, body mass index, or living with/without a partner. Our data indicate that FI is still a serious health problem-FI currently affects more than half of the nursing home residents in Ostrava, Czech Republic. The study outcomes (revealed high prevalence and seriousness of FI) emphasize the importance of close monitoring and appropriately managing FI in nursing home residents.\n \nThe Tokyo guidelines for diagnostic criteria and severity assessment of acute cholecystitis (AC), published in 2007, recommend early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (ELC) be done as soon as possible after the onset of symptoms. We conducted this study to analyze the changes in the therapeutic strategy for AC in a surgical center in Tunisia after the Tokyo guidelines were published. Between January, 2005 and January, 2013, 649 patients underwent cholecystectomy for AC at the Department of Surgery, Mohamed Tahar Maamouri Hospital in Nabeul, Tunisia. The study period was subdivided into before (n\u00a0=\u00a0192) and after (n\u00a0=\u00a0457) the publication of the Tokyo guidelines, that is, prior to and including 2007, and from 2008 onward, respectively. We reviewed patient records retrospectively to collect demographic data, biochemical data, radiological findings, and postoperative outcomes. All these factors were compared between the groups. The duration of symptoms before surgery was significantly longer before 2008 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.018). ELC was significantly more frequent after 2008 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). Laparoscopic surgery was converted to open surgery in 16.1\u00a0% of patients before 2008 vs. 7.8\u00a0% of patients after 2008 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). There were no significant differences in bile duct injury or postoperative complications between the groups. The length of preoperative, postoperative, and total hospital stay was longer before 2008. ELC is a safe and effective therapeutic strategy for AC. The Tokyo guidelines resulted in a significant increase in the number of ELCs being performed and significantly reduced preoperative and total hospital stay without increasing intra- and postoperative complications. Importantly, ELC reduced medical costs, which is crucial for a country with limited resources, such as Tunisia.\n"}]}]}}

The rate of mild cervical lesions (koilocytosis, warts, CIN I with and without koilocytosis) was compared with the rate of severe cervical lesions (CIN II and III, cervical carcinoma) in patients with mild vaginal lesions (warts and koilocytosis, and low-grade VAIN) and in patients with severe vaginal lesions (high-grade VAIN). Using koilocytosis as a marker, the rate of \"active\" cervical lesions was compared with the rate of \"non active\" cervical lesions in patients with \"active\" versus \"non active\" vaginal lesions. Finally, the rates of mild and severe cervical lesions were compared among each group of VAIN (low-grade, high-grade, with or without koilocytosis). In patients with mild vaginal lesions, mild cervical lesions were significantly more frequent than severe cervical lesions. In patients with \"active\" vaginal lesions the rate of \"active\" cervical lesions was significantly higher than \"non active\" cervical lesions. The differences in rates of mild cervical lesions and severe cervical lesions among patients with high-grade VAIN and low-grade VAIN (with and without koilocytosis) were not significant.

Women undergoing a hysterectomy for the above indication at the Northern Gynaecological Cancer Centre over a period of 10 years (1992-2001) were identified from a prospectively collected database. Case notes were then reviewed and women undergoing hysterectomy for other indications were excluded. Relevant demographic and clinical data were then extracted. 33 patients meeting the above criteria were identified. The overall hysterectomy rate for this indication was 0.73%. 20 out of the 33 women had significant pathology on the hysterectomy specimen. 95% of these had high-grade disease with one having a Stage 1A1 squamous carcinoma. None of the patients required more radical treatment than a simple hysterectomy. There were no major complications following the hysterectomy. Positive endocervical margins on the previous loop specimen (P = 0.05) was an important correlating factor predicting the presence of CIN on the hysterectomy specimen. One out of the thirty hysterectomies (3.3%) performed using the vaginal route had incomplete excision compared to one of three (33%) using the abdominal route. Hysterectomy was successful in treating 85.2% of the women; only 4 women subsequently developed vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia. Simple hysterectomy appears to be a suitable diagnostic and treatment option for women with recurrent high-grade cytological abnormalities where further loop treatment is technically not possible. Incomplete excision at the endocervical margin on the previous loop specimen was the main factor associated with the presence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia at hysterectomy.\n"}]}]}}

Nationwide population-based prospective cohort study in Denmark, based on a random sample of 51 090 women aged 20 years or older from the general population. A web-based questionnaire regarding gynecological alarm symptoms and lifestyle was distributed to the invited individuals.

Conventional screening criteria are too limiting and exclude suitable heart donors. Echocardiography is now widely available and is a reliable tool to assess left ventricular dysfunction in brain-dead donors. Yet few data are available on the degree of left ventricular dysfunction where a transplantation is possible. Fifty-five potential brain-dead heart donors (age 38 +/- 11 years) were prospectively evaluated by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) before harvesting. Fractional area change (FAC) was used to assess left ventricular function in potential brain-dead donors. Transplanted hearts were evaluated on the fifth postoperative day. The transplantation was considered a success if the recipient was alive, not retransplanted, without an assistance device or an epinephrine infusion of more than 1 mg/h and showed an ejection fraction above 40%. Of the 55 potential heart donors, 20 exhibited an FAC of less than 50%. Forty hearts were harvested, 36 of which were successfully transplanted. Nine patients had an FAC below 50% (group H2) and 27 had an FAC over 50% (group H1). Four patients died TEE is useful to assess left ventricular function in potential brain-dead donors. An FAC less than 50% is present in 36% of potential heart donors. Because left ventricular dysfunction is often reversible shortly after transplantation, an FAC below 50% may not necessarily preclude the use of hearts for transplantation.\n \nPatients presenting with stroke or transient cerebral ischemic episodes often undergo transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) as part of their initial evaluation. Previous studies have demonstrated that TEE is superior to transthoracic echocardiography for the detection of potential cardiac sources of embolism. In our institution, this scenario now represents the most frequent reason for requesting TEE. For the most part, these TEE examinations are ordered by a neurologist, and transthoracic echocardiography is not performed beforehand. Over a 2-year period, TEE was requested for 137 patients at our institution for the evaluation of a cerebral ischemic event. The complete hospital chart was available for review in 106 of these patients, and they form the study group. All patients underwent TEE using either a biplane or omniplane transducer, with Doppler color flow imaging and saline contrast administration performed in every case. Studies were reviewed for the presence of possible cardiac or aortic sources of cerebral emboli, and hospital charts were reviewed to collect clinical information. A potential cardiovascular embolic source was detected in 35% of patients. Abnormalities were discovered in 53% (16/30) of patients with atrial fibrillation vs 28% (21/76) of patients in sinus rhythm (P < .001). Both patients who had left atrial thrombus and 12 of 13 with left atrial spontaneous contrast had atrial fibrillation (P < .001). Protruding aortic atherosclerotic debris was the most frequent abnormality among patients in sinus rhythm. It may not be cost-effective to perform TEE as a routine diagnostic procedure in patients presenting with cerebral ischemic events. Most patients with atrial fibrillation are candidates for empiric warfarin sodium therapy, and patients in sinus rhythm usually have findings for which there is no recommended therapy or for which only aspirin is indicated.\n"}]}]}}

Group 2 received a 1 mg/kg dose of 0.9% sodium chloride by the intraperitoneal route for 10 min before pneumoperitoneum. Groups 3 and 4 received 6 and 12 mg/kg edaravone, respectively, by the intraperitoneal route for 10 min before pneumoperitoneum. After 60 min of pneumoperitoneum, the gas was deflated. Immediately after the reperfusion period, both ovaries were excised for histological scoring, caspase-3 immunohistochemistry and biochemical evaluation including glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. Also, total antioxidant capacity (TAC) was measured in plasma samples to evaluate the antioxidant effect of edaravone. Ovarian sections in the saline group revealed higher scores for follicular degeneration and edema (p < 0.0001) when compared with the sham group. Administration of different doses of edaravone in rats significantly prevented degenerative changes in the ovary (p < 0.0001). Caspase-3 expression was only detected in the ovarian surface epithelium in all groups, and there was a significant difference between the treatment groups and the saline group (p < 0.0001). Treatment of rats with edaravone reduced caspase-3 expression in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, biochemical measurements of oxidative stress markers (MDA, GSH and TAC) revealed that prophylactic edaravone treatment attenuated oxidative stress induced by I/R injury.

Groups 1 and 2 served as controls, where the rats in Group 1 did not receive any intervention and Group 2 received intravaginal saline. Groups 3 and 4 received intravaginal or perineal talc application, respectively. Talc was applied for 3 months on a daily basis. Histopathological changes in the peritoneum and female genital system were evaluated. For statistical analyses, Fisher's exact test was carried out using SPSS. In both the groups exposed to talc (Groups 3 and 4), evidence of foreign body reaction and infection, along with an increase in inflammatory cells, were found in all the genital tissues. Genital infection was observed in 12 rats in the study group and 2 rats in the control group. Neoplastic change was not found. However, there was an increase in the number of follicles in animals exposed to talc. No peritoneal change was observed. In the groups not exposed to talc, similar infectious findings were found, but there was a statistically significant difference between the groups (Groups 1 and 2 vs. Groups 3 and 4, P > 0.05). Neoplastic change was also not observed in these groups. Four groups were compared in terms of neoplastic effects and infections. In Groups 1, 5 rats were normal, two developed vulvovaginitis and endometritis with overinfection (in both ovaries), and one developed salpingitis (in both fallopian tubes), that is, infection was found in a total of two rats. In Group 2, only one experimental animal had endometritis. All the animals in Groups 3 and 4 developed infections. Talc has unfavorable effects on the female genital system.

The lace plant (Aponogeton madagascariensis) produces perforations in its leaves through PCD. The leaves of the plant consist of a latticework of longitudinal and transverse veins enclosing areoles. PCD occurs in the cells at the center of these areoles and progresses outwards, stopping approximately five cells from the vasculature. The role of mitochondria during PCD has been recognized in animals; however, it has been less studied during PCD in plants. The following paper elucidates the role of mitochondrial dynamics during developmentally regulated PCD in vivo in A. madagascariensis. A single areole within a window stage leaf (PCD is occurring) was divided into three areas based on the progression of PCD; cells that will not undergo PCD (NPCD), cells in early stages of PCD (EPCD), and cells in late stages of PCD (LPCD). Window stage leaves were stained with the mitochondrial dye MitoTracker Red CMXRos and examined. Mitochondrial dynamics were delineated into four categories (M1-M4) based on characteristics including distribution, motility, and membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m). A TUNEL assay showed fragmented nDNA in a gradient over these mitochondrial stages. Chloroplasts and transvacuolar strands were also examined using live cell imaging. The possible importance of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) formation during PCD was indirectly examined via in vivo cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment. This treatment resulted in lace plant leaves with a significantly lower number of perforations compared to controls, and that displayed mitochondrial dynamics similar to that of non-PCD cells. Results depicted mitochondrial dynamics in vivo as PCD progresses within the lace plant, and highlight the correlation of this organelle with other organelles during developmental PCD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of mitochondria and chloroplasts moving on transvacuolar strands to form a ring structure surrounding the nucleus during developmental PCD. Also, for the first time, we have shown the feasibility for the use of CsA in a whole plant system. Overall, our findings implicate the mitochondria as playing a critical and early role in developmentally regulated PCD in the lace plant.\n \nThe hypothesis was tested that pectin content and methylation degree participate in regulation of cell wall mechanical properties and in this way may affect tissue growth and freezing resistance over the course of plant cold acclimation and de-acclimation. Experiments were carried on the leaves of two double-haploid lines of winter oil-seed rape (Brassica napus subsp. oleifera), differing in winter survival and resistance to blackleg fungus (Leptosphaeria maculans). Plant acclimation in the cold (2 degrees C) brought about retardation of leaf expansion, concomitant with development of freezing resistance. These effects were associated with the increases in leaf tensile stiffness, cell wall and pectin contents, pectin methylesterase (EC 3.1.1.11) activity and the low-methylated pectin content, independently of the genotype studied. However, the cold-induced modifications in the cell wall properties were more pronounced in the leaves of the more pathogen-resistant genotype. De-acclimation promoted leaf expansion and reversed most of the cold-induced effects, with the exception of pectin methylesterase activity.

The ability to recognize different optotypes differs even if their critical details appear under the same visual angle. Since optotypes are evaluated on individuals with good visual acuity and without eye disorders, differences in the lower visual acuity range cannot be excluded. In this study, visual acuity measured with the Snellen E was compared to the Landolt C acuity. 100 patients (age 8 - 90 years, median 60.5 years) with various eye disorders, among them 39 with amblyopia due to strabismus, and 13 healthy volunteers were tested. Charts with the Snellen E and the Landolt C (Precision Vision) which mimic the ETDRS charts were used to assess visual acuity. Three out of 5 optotypes per line had to be correctly identified, while wrong answers were monitored. In the group of patients, the eyes with the lower visual acuity, and the right eyes of the healthy subjects, were evaluated. Differences between Landolt C acuity (LR) and Snellen E acuity (SE) were small. The mean decimal values for LR and SE were 0.25 and 0.29 in the entire group and 0.14 and 0.16 for the eyes with strabismus amblyopia. The mean difference between LR and SE was 0.55 lines in the entire group and 0.55 lines for the eyes with strabismus amblyopia, with higher values of SE in both groups. The results of the other groups were similar with only small differences between LR and SE. Using the charts described, there was only a slight overestimation of visual acuity by the Snellen E compared to the Landolt C, even in strabismus amblyopia. Small differences in the lower visual acuity range have to be considered.\n \nPrevious studies have indicated that propofol anaesthesia may reduce the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting after strabismus surgery in children. This study was designed to investigate the incidence of vomiting after strabismus surgery at two different levels of propofol anaesthesia compared to thiopental/isoflurane anaesthesia. Ninety ASA class I or II children, aged 5-14 yrs were randomly assigned to one of three groups There were no differences between study groups with respect to age, weight, history of previous anaesthesia or emesis after previous anaesthesia, duration of anaesthesia, surgery or sleep after anaesthesia, or number of muscles operated. The incidence of vomiting was 37%, 29% and 28% in groups T/I, P5 and P10, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences between the three groups in the incidence of vomiting. The median age of patients who vomited was 7.5 (range 5.0-13.7) yrs while the median age of the patients who did not vomit was 9.1 (range 5.0-14.0) yrs (P < 0.01). In the present study, propofol anaesthesia compared to thiopental/isoflurane anaesthesia did not reduce the incidence of vomiting following strabismus surgery in children.\n"}]}]}}

However, few data are available to assess the adequacy of the use of drugs and its influence on the control of asthma in 'real life'. The adequacy of the current use of anti-asthmatic medication according to the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines was assessed in a random sample of 400 asthmatics identified in the frame of the Italian Study on Asthma in Young Adults. Asthma severity was assessed using the GINA criteria; accordingly, a patient was classified as receiving inadequate treatment if his/her current use of drugs was lower than that suggested by the guidelines for the corresponding severity level. The absence of asthma attacks in the last 3 months was used as an indicator of the disease control. Fifty-five percent of the patients had persistent asthma. Overall, 48% (95% CI 41.2-54.8) of persistent asthmatics were receiving inadequate treatment, and 66% (95% CI 59.5-72.4) had not used their medication daily over the past 3 months. Persistent asthmatics who were inadequately treated had a significantly greater frequency of asthma attacks (geometric mean ratio 3.7; 95% CI 2.1-6.6) than those using an adequate dose of medication. Mild and moderate persistent asthmatics using an adequate medication regimen reported a low number of asthma attacks (median 0). At the multivariate analysis, a good control of the disease was positively associated with an adequate dose of anti-inflammatory medication (OR = 2.2; 95% CI 1.1-4.5) and was negatively associated with a later onset of asthma (OR = 0.96; 95% CI 0.93-0.99) and severe asthma (OR = 0.37; 95% CI 0.17-0.81). Despite the increase in the use of inhaled corticosteroids, half of the persistent asthmatics from the general population are using a medication regimen below their severity level. When the use of drugs follows the GINA guideline recommendations, a good control of asthma is also achievable in the daily management of the disease, particularly in the case of mild and moderate asthmatics.\n \nPassive smoking is a major cause of respiratory morbidity in children. However, few studies give accurate estimates of the health effects of passive smoking in children with asthma using an objective measure of exposure. The effects of passive smoking using salivary cotinine levels to measure exposure were investigated. A sample of 438 children aged 2-12 years with asthma who had a parent who smoked were recruited in Tayside and Fife, Scotland. Health service contacts for asthma, assessed from GP case records, were used as a proxy for morbidity. A weak U-shaped relationship was found between the salivary cotinine level and health service contacts for asthma High levels of parental smoking in the home are associated with a reduction in health care contacts for asthma. This could be due to a lack of awareness of asthma symptoms among heavy smokers or a reluctance to visit the GP. Children with asthma who have parents who smoke heavily may not be receiving adequate management.\n"}]}]}}

This study examined the long-term outcome of TERPT versus conventional transabdominal (ABD) pull-through for HD. Records of 41 patients more than 3 years old who underwent a pull-through for HD (TERPT, n = 20; ABD, n = 21) were reviewed, and their families were thoroughly interviewed and scored via a 15-item post-pull-through long-term outcome questionnaire. Patients were operated on between the years 1995 and 2003. During this time, our group transitioned from the ABD to the TERPT technique. Total scoring ranged from 0 to 40 Overall scores were similar. However, continence score was significantly better in the ABD group, and the stool pattern score was better in the TERPT group. A significant difference in age at interview between the 2 groups was noted; we therefore reanalyzed the data controlling for age, and this showed that age did not significantly affect the long-term scoring outcome between groups. Our long-term study showed significantly better (2-fold) results regarding the continence score for the abdominal approach compared with the transanal pull-through. The stool pattern and enterocolitis scores were somewhat better for the TERPT group. These findings raise an important issue about the current surgical management of HD; however, more cases will need to be studied before a definitive conclusion can be drawn.\n \nTo examine the progress of the airway obstruction over time in children with cerebral palsy (CP) and the timing of any interventions. The medical notes of patients with CP younger than 16 years admitted with airway obstruction to a tertiary referral Pediatric Otolaryngology Center from 2006 to 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. The gender, age of referral, co-morbidities, type of surgical intervention and age this was performed and the time interval between sequential surgeries were documented. Fifteen children with CP and airway obstruction were admitted, eight boys and seven girls with an average age of referral 8 years (range 3-13.3 years). Adenotonsillectomy was performed in 11/15 patients at a mean age of 9.1 years (range 4.5-14 years). Tracheostomy was performed in 8/15 children at an average age of 11.6 years (range 7.5-15 years). Seven out of 11 patients having undergone adenotonsillectomy, required tracheostomy after an average time interval of 1.9 years (range 0.5-3.5 years). Tracheostomy was performed in 80% of referred patients with CP older than 10 years, while surgical intervention was uncommon in children younger than 5 years. There was a statistically significant correlation between the age of the children and the performance of a tracheostomy (Pearson's correlation coefficient 0.68, p = 0.005). The severity of the airway obstruction in children with CP tends to increase with age. We postulate that this increase results from worsening hypotonia of pharyngeal musculature. Children with CP and severe upper airway obstruction are likely to require tracheostomy as they grow older.\n"}]}]}}

Relatively little attention has been paid to whether the sex of the physician affects the rates of cancer screening among women. We examined differences between male and female physicians in the frequency of screening mammograms and Pap smears among women patients enrolled in a large Midwestern health plan. We identified claims for mammography and Pap tests submitted by primary care physicians for 97,962 women, 18 to 75 years of age, who were enrolled in the health plan in 1990. The sex of the physician was manually coded, and the physician's age was obtained from the state licensing board. After identifying a principal physician for each woman, we calculated the frequency of mammography and Pap smears for each physician, using the number of women in his or her practice during 1990 as the denominator. Using unconditional logistic regression, we also calculated the odds ratio of having a Pap smear or mammogram for women patients with female physicians as compared with those with male physicians, controlling for the physician's and the patient's age. Crude rates for Pap smears and mammography were higher for the patients of female than male physicians in most age groups of physicians. The largest differences between female and male physicians were in the rates of Pap smears among the youngest physicians. For the subgroup of women enrolled in the health plan for a year who saw only one physician, after adjustment for the patient's age and the physician's age and specialty, the odds ratio for having a Pap smear was 1.99 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.72 to 2.30) for the patients of female physicians as compared with those of male physicians. For women 40 years old and older, the odds ratio for having a mammogram was 1.41 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.22 to 1.63). For both Pap smears and mammography, the differences between female and male physicians in screening rates were much more pronounced in internal medicine and family practice than in obstetrics and gynecology. Women are more likely to undergo screening with Pap smears and mammograms if they see female rather than male physicians, particularly if the physician is an internist or family practitioner.\n \nFew studies have explored health care market structure and colorectal cancer (CRC) screening test use, and little is known whether market factors contribute to racial/ethnic screening disparities. We investigated whether HMO market level factors, controlling for individual covariates, differentially impact Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) subjects' access to CRC screening compared with white subjects. We used random intercept hierarchical models to predict CRC test use. Individual-level survey data was linked to market data by metropolitan statistical areas from InterStudy. Insured first-degree relatives, ages 40-80, of a random sample of colorectal cancer cases identified from the California Cancer Registry Dependent variables were receipt of (1) annual fecal occult blood test only; (2) sigmoidoscopy in the past 5 years; (3) colonoscopy in the past 10 years; and (4) any of these tests over the recommended time interval. Market characteristics were HMO penetration, HMO competition, and proportion of staff/group/network HMOs. Market characteristics were as important as individual-level characteristics for AAPI but not for white subjects. Among AAPI subjects, a 10% increase in the percent of group/staff/network model HMO was associated with a reduction in colonoscopy use (28.9% to 20.5%) and in receipt of any of the CRC tests (53.2% to 45.4%). The prevailing organizational structure of a health care market confers a penalty on access to CRC test use among high-risk AAPI subjects but not among high-risk white subjects. Identifying the differential effect of market structure on race/ethnicity can potentially reduce the cancer burden among disadvantaged racial groups.\n"}]}]}}

Indications included evaluation anemia/gastrointestinal bleed, small bowel IBD and dilation of strictures. Video-capsule endoscopy (VCE) was used prior to DBE in 43 of the 66 patients prior to DBE evaluation. The mean age was 62 years. Thirty-two patients were female, 15 were African-American; 44 antegrade and 44 retrograde DBEs were performed.

We hope this will encourage prospective data collection, improvement of care and initiate strategies to establish best practice in this area. This was a retrospective study of patients who underwent emergency laparotomy from June 2010 to May 2012. The primary end point of the study was 30-day mortality, age-related 30-day mortality and 1-year all-cause mortality. 477 laparotomies were performed in 446 patients. 57% were aged <70 and 43% aged >70 years. 30-day mortality was 12, 4% in those aged <70 years and 22% in those >70 years (p < 0.001). 1-year mortality was 25, 15% in those aged under 70 years and 38% in those aged >70 years (p < 0.001). Emergency laparotomy carries a high rate of mortality, especially in those over the age of 70 years, and more needs to be done to improve outcomes, particularly in this group. This could involve increasing acute surgical care manpower, early recognition of patients requiring emergency surgery, development of clear management protocols for such patients or perhaps even considering centralisation of emergency surgical services to specialist centres with multidisciplinary teams involving emergency surgeons and care of the elderly physicians in hospital and related community outreach services for post-discharge care.\n \nHip fractures in the elderly are followed by considerable risk of functional decline and mortality. The purposes of this study were to (1) explore predictive factors of functional level at discharge, (2) evaluate 1-year mortality after hip fracture compared with that of the general population, and (3) evaluate the affect of early functional outcome on 1-year mortality in patients operated on for hip fractures. A total of 228 consecutive patients (average age, 77.6 \u00b1 7.4 years) with hip fractures who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled in an open, prospective, observational cohort study. Functional level at discharge was measured with the motor Functional Independence Measure (FIM) score, which is the most widely accepted functional assessment measure in use in the rehabilitation community. Mortality rates in the study population were calculated in absolute numbers and as the standardized mortality ratio. Multivariate regression analysis was used to explore predictive factors for motor FIM score at discharge and for 1-year mortality adjusted for important baseline variables. Age, health status, cognitive level, preinjury functional level, and pressure sores after hip fracture surgery were independently related to lower discharge motor FIM scores. At 1-year followup, 57 patients (25%; 43 women and 14 men) had died. The 1-year hip fracture mortality rate compared with that of the general population was 31% in our population versus 7% for men and 23% in our population versus 5% for women 65 years or older. The 1-year standardized mortality rate was 341.3 (95% CI, 162.5-520.1) for men and 301.6 (95% CI, 212.4-391.8) for women, respectively. The all-cause mortality rate observed in this group was higher in all age groups and in both sexes when compared with the all-cause age-adjusted mortality of the general population. Motor FIM score at discharge was the only independent predictor of 1-year mortality after hip fracture. Functional level at discharge is the main determinant of long-term mortality in patients with hip fracture. Motor FIM score at discharge is a reliable predictor of mortality and can be recommended for clinical use.\n"}]}]}}

We investigated a dataset of 1002 respondents aged 18 years and over from the Japanese World Health Survey, which collected information through face-to-face interview from 2002 to 2003. The ordered probit model and the Compound Hierarchical Ordered Probit (CHOPIT) model, which incorporated anchoring vignettes, were employed to estimate and compare associations of sleep and energy with socio-demographic and life-style factors before and after adjustment for differences in response category cut-points for each individual. The prevalence of self-reported problems with sleep and energy was 53 %. Without correction of cut-point shifts, age, sex, and the number of comorbidities were significantly associated with a greater severity of sleep-related problems. After correction, age, the number of comorbidities, and regular exercise were significantly associated with a greater severity of sleep-related problems; sex was no longer a significant factor. Compared to the ordered probit model, the CHOPIT model provided two changes with a subtle difference in the magnitude of regression coefficients after correction for reporting heterogeneity. Sleep disorders are common in the general adult population of Japan. Correction for reporting heterogeneity using anchoring vignettes is not a necessary tool for proper management of sleep and energy related problems among Japanese adults. Older age, gender differences in communicating sleep-related problems, the presence of multiple morbidities, and regular exercise should be the focus of policies and clinical practice to improve sleep and energy management in Japan.\n \nThe National Kidney Foundation recommends reporting estimates of glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) rather than timed urine collections. When 2 of the 3 major hospitals in our region began reporting eGFR at different times we recognized a natural experiment. We conducted a retrospective, observational study at the 3 major hospitals in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Data were collected on the frequency of timed urines during a 41/2-year period. Regression analysis was used to study the association of the rate of ordering timed urines adjusted for other factors. There was a marked drop in the rate of ordering of timed urines at all 3 hospitals from a mean of 21.8 per 1000 admissions in the first 4 quarter years of the study to 10.9 in the last 4 (15th-18th) quarter years. The drop began before the reporting of eGFR at any hospital. The reporting of eGFR had a small effect (-1.7 per 1000 hospital admissions) that was not statistically significant (P = 0.15). There has been a marked drop in the ordering of timed urines in our region. The decline began before the reporting of eGFR at 2 of the hospitals and therefore is attributable to other factors.\n"}]}]}}

Multivariate regression analysis showed that oxLDL independently influences IMT in DM1 patients (\u03b2=0.454, R2=0.35). Further, positive correlations between oxLDL value and LDL-C concentration (r=0.585, p<0.05, n=70) and between oxLDL level and apo-B concentration have been established (r=0.610, p<0.05, n=70). Moreover, patients with chronic microvascular complications showed a higher value of IMT in comparison with patients without them (p=0.003). Our results provide the evidence that oxLDL accelerates atherosclerotic plaque formation and may contribute to the development of microvascular complications in DM1.\n"}]}]}}

Three head and neck-specific measures,-including the Head & Neck Survey (H&NS); a brief, multi-item test which generates domain scores; and a general health measure,-were administered. The H&NS was highly reliable and more strongly correlated to the specific measures than to the general measure. Eating/swallowing (ES) and speech/communication (SC) were not well correlated with general health domains. Head and neck pain was highly correlated to general bodily pain (0.88, p < .0001). Despite correlations to some general health domains, appearance (AP) was not fully reflected by any other domain. Head and neck-specific QOL measures are necessary and should include domains that reflect ES, SC, and AP.\n \nWe evaluated the usefulness of a short stay or 23-hour ward in a pediatric unit of a large teaching hospital, Westmead Hospital, and an academic Children's hospital, The New Children's Hospital, to determine if they are a useful addition to the emergency service. This is a descriptive comparison of prospectively collected data on all children admitted to the short stay ward at Westmead Hospital (WH) during 1994 and the short stay ward at the New Children's Hospital (NCH) during 1997-98. These hospitals service an identical demographic area with the latter (NCH) a tertiary referral center. The following outcome measures were used The short stay ward accounted for 10.3% (Westmead Hospital) and 14.7% (New Children's Hospital) of admissions, with 56% medical in nature, 30% surgical, and the remainder procedural or psychological. Admission patterns were similar, with asthma, gastroenteritis, convulsion, pneumonia, and simple surgical conditions accounting for most short stay ward admissions. The short stay ward increased hospital efficiency with an average length of stay of 17.5 hours (Westmead Hospital) compared to 20.5 hours (New Children's Hospital). The users of the short stay ward were children of young age less than 2 years, with stay greater than 23 hours reported in only 1% of all admissions to the short stay ward. The rate of patient admission to an in-hospital bed was low, (4% [Westmead Hospital] compared to 6% [New Children's Hospital]), with the number of unscheduled visits within 72 hours of short stay ward discharge less than 1%. There were no adverse events reported at either short stay ward, with parental satisfaction high. The short stay ward was developed through reallocation of resources from within the hospital to the short stay ward. This resulted in estimated savings of $1/2 million (Westmead Hospital) to $2.3 million (New Children's Hospital) to the hospital, due to more efficient bed usage. This data demonstrates the robust nature of the short stay ward. At these two very different institutions we have shown improved bed efficient and patient care in a cost-effective way. We have also reported on greater parental satisfaction and early return of the child with their family to the community.\n"}]}]}}

Dependent variables were traffic fatality and severe injury rates per population and vehicle fleet. Independent variables were Empirical estimates from instrumental variables suggest that the enactment of the traffic law reform in interaction with number of traffic tickets per police officer is significantly associated with a decrease of 8% in traffic fatalities and 7% in severe injuries. Piecewise regression model results for the 2007-2012 period suggest that police traffic enforcement reduced traffic fatalities by 59% and severe injuries by 37%.

To maintain safe and independent transport, mobility is important for all individuals, but especially for older drivers. The objective of this study was to investigate whether automatic transmission, compared with manual transmission, may improve the driving behavior of older drivers. In total, 31 older drivers (mean age 75.2 years) and 32 younger drivers - used as a control group (mean age 39.2 years) - were assessed twice on the same fixed route; once in a car with manual transmission and once in a car with automatic transmission. The cars were otherwise identical. The driving behavior was assessed with the Ryd On-Road Assessment driving protocol. Time to completion of left turns (right-hand side driving) and the impact of a distraction task were measured. The older group had more driving errors than the younger group, in both the manual and the automatic transmission car. However, and contrary to the younger drivers, automatic transmission improved the older participants' driving behavior as demonstrated by safer speed adjustment in urban areas, greater maneuvering skills, safer lane position and driving in accordance with the speed regulations. Switching to automatic transmission may be recommended for older drivers as a means to maintain safe driving and thereby the quality of their transport mobility.\n"}]}]}}

We performed a 6-year (2006 to 2011) retrospective review of all trauma patients with blunt abdominal solid organ injuries. Patients were matched using propensity score matching in a 2:1:1 (early:intermediate:late) for age, gender, systolic blood pressure, Glasgow Coma Scale, Injury Severity Score, and type and grade of organs injured. Our primary outcome measures were A total of 116 patients (58 early, 29 intermediate, and 29 late) were included. There were no differences in age (P\u00a0=\u00a0.5), Injury Severity Score (P\u00a0=\u00a0.6), type (P\u00a0=\u00a0.1), and grade of injury of the organ (P\u00a0=\u00a0.6) between the 3 groups.

The few available data suggest that tapering or even stopping heparinization is feasible and the HeprAN membrane with grafted heparin was developed to decrease heparin dose. The objective of our study was to evaluate the need for additional anticoagulation in patients on long-term oral anticoagulation, according to the type of membrane used. This is a prospective, randomized, crossover bifactorial trial in haemodialysed patients on oral anticoagulation.

We investigated the role of routine laboratory parameters in distinguishing NASH from ASH. Liver biopsies performed at our hospital over a 10-year period were reviewed, 95 patients with steatohepatitis identified and their data prior to biopsy reevaluated. The diagnosis NASH or ASH was assigned (other liver diseases excluded) on the basis of the biopsy and history of alcohol consumption (< 140 g/week). Logistic regression models were used for analysis. NASH was diagnosed in 58 patients (61%; 30 f) and ASH in 37 (39%; 9 f). High-grade fibrosis (59% vs. 19%, P < 0.0001) and an AST/ALT ratio > 1 (54.1% vs 20.7%, P = 0.0008) were more common in ASH. The MCV was elevated in 53% of ASH patients and normal in all NASH patients (P < 0.0001). Multivariate analysis identified the MCV (P = 0.0013), the AST/ALT ratio (P = 0.011) and sex (P = 0.0029) as relevant regressors (aROC = 0.92). The AST/ALT ratio (P < 0.0001) and age (P = 0.00049) were independent predictors of high-grade fibrosis. Differences in MCV were more marked in high-grade fibrosis. Higher MCVs and AST/ALT ratios in ASH reflect the severity of underlying liver disease and do not differentiate NASH from ASH. Instead, these biomarkers might prove useful in guiding selection of patients for liver biopsy and in targeting therapy.\n \nThyroid hormones play an important role in the regulation of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, both of which are affected in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Anecdotally, we have observed that a number of patients with NASH carried a diagnosis of hypothyroidism. However, it is unknown if thyroid dysfunction plays any role in the pathogenesis of NASH. To further investigate this observation, we conducted a case-control study to determine the association between hypothyroidism and NASH. Cases were defined as patients with well-documented NASH attending hepatology clinics at Indiana University Hospital from January 1, 1995 to December 31, 2000. Age, gender, race, and body-weight matched individuals seen during the same period in the general medical clinics served as controls. Patients with a previous diagnosis of hypothyroidism who are currently on synthetic T4 replacement were considered to be \"hypothyroid\". The strength of association was assessed by logistic regression analysis after controlling for the frequency of diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. One hundred seventy-four patients with NASH (cases) and 442 controls were included. The mean age of cohort was 49 +/- 13 years, 59% were female, and 98% were white. The prevalence of hypothyroidism in patients with NASH was 15% was significantly higher than in the controls (7.2%, P < 0.001). By multivariate analysis, the prevalence of hypothyroidism in the NASH group was significantly higher than in control group (OR These data suggest that hypothyroidism is associated with human NASH. Further research is needed to confirm this finding and to understand its implications.\n"}]}]}}

The health survey 1984-86 addressed all inhabitants > or = 20 years of age in Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag county, Norway; 76,885 (90.3%) of the eligible population participated in answering the question on diabetes. All inhabitants in the municipality answering \"yes\" to the question on diabetes (n = 169) and the persons with the same sex born closest before and after each diabetic patient and answering \"no\" to the diabetes question (n = 338) were included. A very thorough search was made in the medical files of the general practitioners in the municipality for corresponding information. Compared to the files, diabetes was verified in 163 out of the 169. The commonest cause of discrepancy was renal glycosuria. One out of the 338 registered non-diabetic persons was found to have diabetes. Diabetic patients tended to overestimate diabetes duration significantly. Insulin treatment was verified in 19/20 (95%) and treatment with oral hypoglycaemic agents in all 44 with an affirmative questionnaire answer. A negative answer on insulin and oral hypoglycaemic agents was verified in 100% and 99% respectively.

The aim of this study was to compare quality of life related to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in patients who underwent intra-thoracic stomach repair with and without fundoplication. We proposed that the group without a fundoplication would have poorer quality of life due to continued symptoms. All patients undergoing foregut surgery at the Creighton University Esophageal Center are entered in a prospectively maintained database. The database was queried to identify patients who underwent surgery for a near complete (>75\u00a0% of stomach in chest) intra-thoracic stomach with gastric volvulus between 2004 and 2013. A questionnaire was derived from the Quality of Life in Reflux and Dyspepsia and Frequency Scale for Symptoms of GERD questionnaires to assess for symptoms related to reflux, and this questionnaire was administered by phone. A total of 150 patients underwent repair of ITS\u00a0during the study period. A total of 109 patients had ITS repair with fundoplication, while 41 had only ITS repair. Follow-up was available in 54\u00a0% of patients in the fundoplication group (median follow-up of 5.2\u00a0years) and in 49\u00a0% of patients in the non-fundoplication group (median follow-up of 4\u00a0years). Significantly, more patients woke up at night (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and found themselves coughing around mealtime (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) in the fundoplication group. Patients in the non-fundoplication group had significantly more daytime reflux (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). Despite these symptoms, only one patient in the fundoplication group and no patients in the non-fundoplication group admitted that these symptoms were severe enough to severely affect their quality of life. All other patients contacted felt satisfied, and >80\u00a0% rated their quality of life as either good or excellent.

This can be done either (i) acutely during the clamp study using high-dose insulin infusion, or (ii) slowly overnight preceding the clamp study using a low-dose insulin infusion. We assessed whether the choice of either of these methods to obtain euglycaemia biases subsequent assessment of glucose metabolism and insulin action.

Basal rates of glucose production (GP) were similar in the + ON and - ON studies, 83 +/- 13 vs. 85 +/- 14 mg m-2 min-1 (NS), whereas basal rates of glucose disappearance (Rd) were lower in the + ON than in the - ON study, 84 +/- 8 vs. 91 +/- 11 mg m-2 min-1 (P = 0.02). During insulin infusion in the clamp period, rates of GP, 23 +/- 11 vs. 25 +/- 10 mg m-2 min-1, as well as rates of Rd, 133 +/- 32 vs. 139 +/- 37 mg m-2 min-1, were similar in the + ON and - ON studies, respectively (NS). Apart from basal rates of Rd, assessment of glucose turnover rates in euglycaemic clamp studies of Type 2 diabetic patients is not dependent on the method by which plasma glucose levels are lowered.\n"}]}]}}

Most children who do not undergo transplant are reported to have chronic liver disease and its complications. The aim of this single-center study was to identify children with normal laboratory indices and no clinical evidence of chronic liver disease 10 or more years after Kasai portoenterostomy (KP). A retrospective analysis of the medical notes of all children surgically treated at the authors' center between 1979 and 1991 was undertaken. Criteria for inclusion were absence of surgical complications, unremarkable clinical examination, and normal bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, albumin, international normalized prothrombin ratio, and platelet count. Of 244 children surgically treated during the observation period, the authors identified 28 (11%) adolescents (14 male) who fulfilled the entry criteria. Their median age was 13.4 years (range, 10.2-22.2 years). Twenty-six with type 3 EHBA had conventional KP, whereas 2 underwent modified operations. The corrective surgery was performed at a median age of 58 days (range, 20-99 days). Median time of complete clearance of jaundice from the date of KP was 75 days (range, 21-339 days). Twelve (43%) patients had history of cholangitis at a median age of 3.4 years. The liver histologic findings were suggestive of mild to moderate fibrosis in 54.2% and cirrhosis in 40.7% of the patients who underwent biopsy. No child had gastrointestinal bleeding during follow-up. Thirteen (46%) patients had an elective esophagogastroduodenoscopy, which was normal in all. Twenty-six (93%) patients were in mainstream education, whereas the remaining two (7%) attended special school because of reasons unrelated to liver disease. A sizable proportion of children with EHBA avoid significant chronic liver disease and its complications 10 years or more after conventional surgical correction and have an excellent quality of life. Their good outcome is not hampered by isolated episodes of ascending cholangitis. Whether or not the residual histologic damage will become symptomatic during their lifetime remains to be established.\n \nTo assess and compare the value of split-liver transplantation (SLT) and living-related liver transplantation (LRT). The concept of SLT results from the development of reduced-size transplantation. A further development of SLT, the in situ split technique, is derived from LRT, which itself marks the optimized outcome in terms of postoperative graft function and survival. The combination of SLT and LRT has abolished deaths on the waiting list, thus raising the question whether living donor liver transplantation is still necessary. Outcomes and postoperative liver function of 43 primary LRT patients were compared with those of 49 primary SLT patients (14 ex situ, 35 in situ) with known graft weight performed between April 1996 and December 2000. Survival rates were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. After a median follow-up of 35 months, actual patient survival rates were 82% in the SLT group and 88% in the LRT group. Actual graft survival rates were 76% and 81%, respectively. The incidence of primary nonfunction was 12% in the SLT group and 2.3% in the LRT group. Liver function parameters (prothrombin time, factor V, bilirubin clearance) and surgical complication rates did not differ significantly. In the SLT group, mean cold ischemic time was longer than in the LRT group. Serum values of alanine aminotransferase during the first postoperative week were significantly higher in the SLT group. In the LRT group, there were more grafts with signs of fatty degeneration than in the SLT group. The short- and long-term outcomes after LRT and SLT did not differ significantly. To avoid the risk for the donor in LRT, SLT represents the first-line therapy in pediatric liver transplantation in countries where cadaveric organs are available. LRT provides a solution for urgent cases in which a cadaveric graft cannot be found in time or if the choice of the optimal time point for transplantation is vital.\n"}]}]}}

Knowledge of contraceptive methods and attitudes about contraception, pregnancy, childbearing and fertility were assessed among 602 unmarried women aged 18-29 at risk for unintended pregnancy who participated in the 2009 National Survey of Reproductive and Contraceptive Knowledge. The contribution of attitudes to racial and ethnic disparities in effective method use was assessed via mediation analysis, using a series of regression models. Blacks and Latinas were more likely than whites to believe that the government encourages contraceptive use to limit minority populations (odds ratio, 2.5 for each). Compared with white women, Latinas held more favorable attitudes toward pregnancy (2.5) and childbearing (coefficient, 0.3) and were more fatalistic about the timing of pregnancy (odds ratio, 2.3); blacks were more fatalistic about life in general (2.0). Only one attitude, skepticism that the government ensures contraceptive safety, was associated with contraceptive use (0.7), but this belief did not differ by race or ethnicity. Although blacks and Latinas used less effective methods than whites (0.3 and 0.4, respectively), attitudes did not explain disparities. Lower contraceptive knowledge partially explained Latinas' use of less effective methods. Providing basic information about effective methods might help to decrease ethnic disparities in use. Research should examine other variables that might account for these disparities, including health system characteristics and provider behavior.\n"}]}]}}

In the current study we evaluated the association of direct ipsilateral adrenal invasion with outcome to determine if reclassification of these tumors as pT4 would improve the accuracy of the current tumor classification. We studied 424 patients who underwent nephrectomy and adrenalectomy for unilateral, sporadic, pT3 or pT4 RCC between 1970 and 2000 at the Mayo Clinic. Cancer specific survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cancer specific survival for the 22 patients with pT3a or pT3b tumors that directly invaded the ipsilateral adrenal gland was significantly worse compared with that of patients with pT3a (p <0.001) or pT3b (p = 0.011) disease that did not invade the adrenal gland. There was no significant difference in the 5-year cancer specific survival between the patients with pT3a or pT3b tumors that directly invaded the ipsilateral adrenal gland and patients with pT4 tumors (cancer specific survival rates of 20% and 14%, respectively, p = 0.490). Although rare, RCC with direct ipsilateral adrenal invasion behaves more aggressively than tumors involving perinephric or renal sinus fat. We believe that RCC tumors with direct adrenal invasion should be classified as pT4.\n \nTo determine the value of ipsilateral adrenalectomy with radical nephrectomy, by investigating the clinical aspects of adrenal involvement and adrenocortical function in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The demographic, clinical and pathological data of adrenal involvement were reviewed in 247 patients with RCC. To evaluate adrenocortical function, 14 patients (adrenalectomy in eight, adrenal-sparing in six) had a rapid adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test before and 2 weeks after surgery. There was adrenal involvement with RCC in seven of the 247 (2.8%) patients (a solitary adrenal metastatic tumour in four and direct extension into the adrenal gland in three). All adrenal involvement was detectable on abdominal computed tomography before surgery, and these patients had a large primary renal tumour of > pT2 and/or distant metastasis. Plasma cortisol levels declined significantly more in response to the rapid ACTH stimulation test in those treated by adrenalectomy than in those with spared adrenal glands at 2 weeks after surgery (P < 0.05), while there was no significant difference between the groups before surgery. These results suggest that unconditional ipsilateral adrenalectomy with radical nephrectomy for RCC should be avoidable, and thus preserve the reserve of adrenocortical function, as preoperative imaging, especially thin-slice multidetector helical computed tomography, can detect adrenal involvement with RCC in most cases. Unilateral adrenalectomy might cause an irreversible impairment of the reserve of adrenocortical function.\n"}]}]}}

This study aimed to investigate the influence rural placement and rural background had on students' intentions to live and work in a rural or remote location after graduation. Between January 2005 and December 2006, 336 students participated in the placement program. Students were requested to complete a survey at the completion of their placement. A response rate of 239 was achieved (71%). The survey measured students' stated rural career intentions and rural background status according to location of primary and secondary school attendance. A demographic analysis of respondents was undertaken and results cross tabulated according to the rural, remote and metropolitan area (RRMA) classification system. Statistical analyses, including paired t-tests and a Wilcoxon signed rank test, were conducted to compare reported mean intention to practise rurally both prior to and after placement. The results from this survey show that rural placements in the undergraduate health science programs have a predominantly positive influence on students' intention to work in a rural community post-graduation. While these findings were significant for the disciplines of nursing, medicine and allied health, the results were not significant for pharmacy students. Students' average intention to practise rurally significantly increased after the placement for students from RRMA classifications 1 and 3-5. The value of rural placements as a method for increasing health science students' intentionality to take up rural practice as a positive and viable career option is considerable.\n \nThe burden of maternal mortality in sub-Saharan Africa is very high. In Ghana maternal mortality ratio was 380 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2013. Skilled birth attendance has been shown to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity, yet in 2010 only 68 percent of mothers in Ghana gave birth with the assistance of skilled birth attendants. In 2005, the Ghana Health Service piloted a strategy that involved using the integrated Community-based Health Planning and Services (CHPS) program and training Community Health Officers (CHOs) as midwives to address the gap in skilled attendance in rural Upper East Region (UER). The study assesses the feasibility of and extent to which the skilled delivery program has been implemented as an integrated component of the existing CHPS, and documents the benefits and challenges of the integrated program. We employed an intrinsic case study design with a qualitative methodology. We conducted 41 in-depth interviews with health professionals and community stakeholders. We used a purposive sampling technique to identify and interview our respondents. The CHO-midwives provide integrated services that include skilled delivery in CHPS zones. The midwives collaborate with District Assemblies, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and communities to offer skilled delivery services in rural communities. They refer pregnant women with complications to district hospitals and health centers for care, and there has been observed improvement in the referral system. Stakeholders reported community members' access to skilled attendants at birth, health education, antenatal attendance and postnatal care in rural communities. The CHO-midwives are provided with financial and non-financial incentives to motivate them for optimal work performance. The primary challenges that remain include inadequate numbers of CHO-midwives, insufficient transportation, and infrastructure weaknesses. Our study demonstrates that CHOs can successfully be trained as midwives and deployed to provide skilled delivery services at the doorsteps of rural households. The integration of the skilled delivery program with the CHPS program appears to be an effective model for improving access to skilled birth attendance in rural communities of the UER of Ghana.\n"}]}]}}

Half of those casualties are expected to require immediate medical treatment. This study was performed to evaluate the efficacy of the current readiness guidelines based on the epidemiology of encountered HMCIs. A retrospective study of HMCIs was recorded in the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) home front command and the Israeli National Trauma Registry (ITR) between November 2000 and June 2003. An HMCI is defined by the Emergency and Disaster Medicine Division in the Israeli Ministry of Health as >or=10 casualties or >or=4 suffering from injuries with an ISS>or=16 arriving to a single hospital. The study includes a total of 32 attacks, resulting in 62 HMCIs and 1292 casualties. The mean number of arriving casualties to a single hospital was 20.8+/-13.3 (range 4-56, median 16.5). In 95% of the HMCIs the casualty load was <or=52. Based on severity scores and ED discharges 1022 (79.2%) casualties did not necessitate immediate medical treatment. Hospital preparedness can be better defined by a fixed number of casualties rather than a percentile of its bed capacity. Only 20% of the arriving casualties will require immediate medical treatment.

Data were collected as part of The Baby's Breath Project, a hospital-based SHSe intervention trial targeting parents with a high-risk infant in the NICU who reported a smoker in the household (N = 99). Measures of sociodemographics, smoking, home and car smoking bans, and depression were collected. Overall, 26% of all families with a high-risk infant in the NICU reported a household smoker. Almost half of the families with a smoker reported an annual income of less than $25,000. 46.2% of families reported having a total smoking ban in place in both their homes and cars. Only 27.8% families earning less than $25,000 reported having a total smoking ban in place relative to almost 60% of families earning more (p < .01). African American and Caucasian families were less likely to have a smoking ban compared with Hispanics (p < .05). Mothers who reported no smoking ban were more depressed than those who had a household smoking ban (p < .02).

Infants were seen at 18-22 months corrected age for followup.

Logistic regression analyses were used to examine the relationship of race/ethnicity and rehospitalization while controlling for gestational age, gender, center, maternal education, family income, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), necrotizing enterocolitis, ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) prophylaxis, and insurance type. In all, 1405 (88%) infants were evaluated at followup. The racial distribution of infants admitted, discharged, seen at followup, and rehospitalized were similar. Rehospitalization occurred at least once in 49% of the infants. In the logistic regression analyses, race was not a significant predictor for rehospitalization. The odds of rehospitalization were related to low family income, type of insurance, BPD, VP shunt, RSV prophylaxis, and center. Race was not a predominant variable in the risk of rehospitalization in this cohort of ELBW infants. Medical morbidities and low family income appear to be the major risk factors for rehospitalization.\n"}]}]}}

Efficacy was evaluated with serial measurements of treadmill exercise time, responses to the Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire (LWHF), and clinical assessments during a baseline phase and a 16-week treatment period. After 16 weeks, 100 mg flosequinan once daily produced a significant increment in median exercise time (64 seconds at 16 weeks) compared with placebo (5 seconds), whereas the higher-dose flosequinan group did not show a statistically significant increase. Flosequinan (100 mg once daily) also improved the overall LWHF score significantly compared with placebo; both active therapies decreased the physical component, but 75 mg flosequinan twice daily was associated with a trend toward worsening of the emotional component. Most clinical assessments tended to improve on active therapy. These results indicate that additional symptomatic benefit can be attained by adding flosequinan to a therapeutic regimen already including a converting enzyme inhibitor. Because in the future most patients will fall into this category, flosequinan is a potential adjunctive agent in the management of severe congestive heart failure. However, because recent evidence indicates that the flosequinan dose studied in the present trial has an adverse effect on survival, the benefit-to-risk ratio must be assessed in individual patients.\n \n(i) To examine the association between self-reported mechanical factors and chronic oro-facial pain. (ii) To test the hypothesis that this relationship could be explained by A population based cross-sectional study of 4200 randomly selected adults registered with a General Medical Practice in North West, England. The study examined the association of chronic oro-facial pain with a variety of self-reported mechanical factors An adjusted response rate of 72% was achieved. Only two mechanical factors Self-reported mechanical factors associated with chronic oro-facial pain are confounded, in part, by psychological factors and are equally common across other frequently unexplained syndromes. They may represent another feature of somatisation. Therefore the use of extensive invasive therapy such as occlusal adjustments and surgery to change mechanical factors may not be justified in many cases.\n"}]}]}}

The records of 465 patients with an established diagnosis of age related macular degeneration who had attended a specialist macular clinic between 1990 and 1998 were scrutinised. A full clinical examination and standardised refraction had been carried out in 189 of these cases on a minimum of two occasions. Cases were looked for where an improvement of one or more lines of either distance or near acuity was recorded in the eye unaffected by macular disease. In each one of these cases the improvement in visual acuity could not be attributed to treatment of other existing pathology. 12 such cases were detected. In nine of these the eye showing improvement of acuity had a history of amblyopia. The mean improvement in distance and near acuity in amblyopic eyes by 12 months was 3.3 and 1.9 lines logMAR respectively. The improvement in acuity generally occurred between 1 and 12 months from baseline and remained stable over the period of follow up. Older people with a history of amblyopia who develop visual loss in the previously normal eye can experience recovery of visual function in the amblyopic eye over a period of time. This recovery in visual function occurs in the wake of visual loss in the fellow eye and the improvement appears to be sustained.\n \nAssessment of visual acuity depends on the optotypes used for measurement. The ability to recognize different optotypes differs even if their critical details appear under the same visual angle. Since optotypes are evaluated on individuals with good visual acuity and without eye disorders, differences in the lower visual acuity range cannot be excluded. In this study, visual acuity measured with the Snellen E was compared to the Landolt C acuity. 100 patients (age 8 - 90 years, median 60.5 years) with various eye disorders, among them 39 with amblyopia due to strabismus, and 13 healthy volunteers were tested. Charts with the Snellen E and the Landolt C (Precision Vision) which mimic the ETDRS charts were used to assess visual acuity. Three out of 5 optotypes per line had to be correctly identified, while wrong answers were monitored. In the group of patients, the eyes with the lower visual acuity, and the right eyes of the healthy subjects, were evaluated. Differences between Landolt C acuity (LR) and Snellen E acuity (SE) were small. The mean decimal values for LR and SE were 0.25 and 0.29 in the entire group and 0.14 and 0.16 for the eyes with strabismus amblyopia. The mean difference between LR and SE was 0.55 lines in the entire group and 0.55 lines for the eyes with strabismus amblyopia, with higher values of SE in both groups. The results of the other groups were similar with only small differences between LR and SE. Using the charts described, there was only a slight overestimation of visual acuity by the Snellen E compared to the Landolt C, even in strabismus amblyopia. Small differences in the lower visual acuity range have to be considered.\n"}]}]}}

In this prospective randomized controlled trial, 48 superobese patients (body mass index of \u2265 50 kg/m(2)) undergoing open bariatric surgery were randomly allocated to three groups of 16 patients each. Postoperatively, all groups received a continuous epidural morphine infusion of 0.2 mg/h with 0.1 % levobupivacaine via PCEA. Group A did not receive intraoperative epidural morphine loading, while groups B and C received an intraoperative 1- and 2-mg morphine bolus, respectively. Levobupivacaine consumption via PCEA (primary outcome), pain scores at rest and on cough, the time to return of bowel function and ambulation, and arterial blood gas levels (secondary outcomes) were recorded. The increase in perioperative morphine administration (groups B and C) led to a significantly prolonged return to normal bowel function and delayed ambulation (P<0.05 to 0.01, respectively), without an improvement in postoperative analgesia or a reduction in local anesthetic consumption. Although the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was high in all groups, no respiratory depression was observed. Thoracic PCEA with 0.1 % levobupivacaine combined with continuous epidural morphine administration of 0.2 mg/h without morphine loading is an effective postoperative analgesic regimen that provides adequate pain control, early ambulation, and early return of bowel function in superobese patients, particularly those with OSA.\n \nSocial and cultural factors combined with little information may prevent the diffusion of epidural analgesia for pain relief during childbirth.

Satisfaction levels reported by patients and care givers were good. A hierarchical clustering analysis identified two clusters based on VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) time course Present audit shows that the process of implementation of labor analgesia was quick, successful and safe, notwithstanding the identification of one cluster of women with suboptimal response to epidural analgesia that need to be further studies, overall pregnant womens'adhesion to labor analgesia was satisfactory.\n"}]}]}}

The authors evaluated HER2 immunoreactivity using immunohistochemical staining and explored the influence of pathological parameters and HER2 immunoreactivity on progression-free survival (PFS) and disease-specific overall survival (OS) using univariate and multivariate Cox's analyses. Urothelial carcinoma of the bladder had a significantly higher frequency of HER2 immunoreactivity than that of the upper urinary tract (60.7 vs. 20.7%, p < 0.0001). Overall, nodal status was a strong and independent prognostic indicator for clinical outcome. The HER2 immunoreactivity was significantly associated with PFS (p = 0.02) and disease-specific OS (p = 0.005) in advanced urothelial carcinoma patients. As for patients with adjuvant M-VEC, HER2 immunoreactivity was a significant prognostic factor for PFS (p = 0.03) and disease-specific OS (p = 0.02) using univariate analysis, but not multivariate analysis, and not for patients receiving watchful waiting.

Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify prognostic factors associated with survival. The results of univariate analysis for OS were identified as having prognostic significance In conclusion, DM at the time of diagnosis was associated with the negative prognostic importance for PFS and OS in the advanced stage patients who were receiving first-line platinum-based doublets chemotherapy.

We studied the frequencies of TNF-\u03b1-308 gene polymorphism in 90 male subjects (60 subjects with COPD and 30 healthy smokers) in a Caucasian population. There was no significant difference in the frequency of G/G and G/A gene polymorphisms in the COPD group compared with control subjects (p>0.05). We compared COPD patients as G/A gene polymorphism and G/G gene polymorphism; the PFTs and BMI before and after one year were not statistically significant (p>0.05). Also, the exacerbation and hospitalization data of COPD patients were not significant between these groups. In conclusion, there was no difference between smoking-related COPD and the control group according to TNF \u03b1-308 gene polymorphism in a Caucasian population. In addition, it was shown that important determinants of prognosis of COPD such as FEV1, BMI, COPD exacerbation and hospitalization were not associated with TNF-\u03b1-308 gene polymorphism.\n \nCurrent guidelines recommend spirometry to confirm a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). To investigate whether a self-reported diagnosis of COPD is associated with prior spirometry and whether a correct diagnosis of COPD is more likely when spirometry was performed. We used data from the population-based Austrian Burden of Obstructive Lung Disease (BOLD) study. Participants were aged >40 years and completed post-bronchodilator spirometry. Reported COPD diagnosis and reported prior lung function test were based on questionnaire. Persistent airflow limitation was defined as post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second/forced vital capacity ratio <0.7, corresponding with COPD Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) grade I+, and GOLD grade II+ was also investigated. A correct diagnosis of COPD was defined as a reported physician's diagnosis of COPD and the presence of persistent airflow limitation. 68 (5.4%) of 1,258 participants reported a prior physician's diagnosis of COPD. Of these, only 17 (25.0%) reported a lung function test within the past 12 months and 46 (67.6%) at any time in the past. The likelihood for a correct COPD GOLD grade I+ diagnosis was similar among subjects reporting a lung function test during the last 12 months (likelihood ratio 2.07, 95% CI 0.89 to 5.50) and those not reporting a lung function during the last 12 months (likelihood ratio 2.78, 95% CI 1.58 to 4.87). Similar likelihood ratios were seen when GOLD grade II+ was investigated and when lung function was reported at any time in the past. One-third of subjects with a reported diagnosis of COPD never had a lung function test. When spirometry was reported, this did not increase the likelihood of a correct COPD diagnosis.\n"}]}]}}

In order to compare adipocytes resulting from the differentiation of preadipocytes with those of purified adipose tissue, we implanted them in 10 nude mice. The preadipocytes were implanted using a collagen scaffold as intermediary and the adipose tissue following the plastic surgery protocol described by SR Coleman. After 8 weeks, tissue fragments were explanted and analysed after staining with HPS, Oil Red O and labelling with human anti-vimentin antibodies. The scaffold seeded with preadipocytes had the macroscopic appearance of adipose tissue with peripheral neovascularisation. The preadipocytes had been transformed into mature adipocytes. Purified adipose tissue also presented peripheral neovascularisation. Numerous mature adipocytes were found. There was an abundant murine extracellular matrix since anti-vimentin labelling was negative.

The Simplified Acute Physiology Score 3 was calculated using the global equation (customized for South America) and the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score; the scores were calculated within 24 hours of admission. A receiver-operating characteristic curve was generated, and the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve was calculated to identify the patients at the greatest risk of death according to Simplified Acute Physiology Score 3 and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores. The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test was used for statistically significant results and indicated a difference in performance over deciles. The standardized mortality ratio was used to estimate the overall model performance. The ability of both scores to predict hospital mortality was poor in the liver and renal transplant groups and average in the lung transplant group (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve = 0.696 for Simplified Acute Physiology Score 3 and 0.670 for Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II). The calibration of both scores was poor, even after customizing the Simplified Acute Physiology Score 3 score for South America. The low predictive accuracy of the Simplified Acute Physiology Score 3 and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores does not warrant the use of these scores in critically ill transplant patients.\n \nAcute cognitive changes during epileptiform discharges have been studied using computer assisted cognitive tasks. We aimed to demonstrate acute behavioral change (using a simple motor response task MRT) during photoparoxysmal response (PPR) in children below 18 years. Children performed a simple repetitive motor task during intermittent photic stimulation (IPS). All episodes of PPR not associated with obvious clinical change (as observed by the technologist or reported by the patient) were analyzed for this study. The average time interval between two successive motor responses across a PPR (test time) was compared to the average time interval between two successive motor responses during IPS not associated with PPR (control time) using Wilcoxon signed ranks test. 21 children who had PPR successfully completed the MRT. The difference between the mean durations was 0.894 s (p=0.002). More than 50% increase compared to the control time was considered a delay in MRT during PPR. 10 children showed slowing of MRT during PPR. By definition, acute behavioral change during generalized epileptiform discharges represent provoked seizures. Detecting subclinical seizures can have important safety implications in children (skiing, skating and driving) with PPR on EEG, but no clinical seizures. We recommend MRT during IPS.\n"}]}]}}

Patients were classified according to whether they came to the hospital during the first 72 hours after the haemorrhage (Group 1) or later (Group 2). Thirty three patients were included in Group 1 and sixteen patients in Group 2. Thirteen patients (26.5%) had sonographic vasospasm. In eight of these patients (61 %), the vasospasm was symptomatic. The initial mean velocity (MV) for Group 1 was normal. The increase in MV/24h (MV/24h) within the first 72 hours after SAH was higher (p< 0.007), in those whose developed sonographic vasospasm. In Group 2, the initial MV was greater (p< 0.001)) in patients who suffered sonographic vasospasm, with or without symptoms.

There is no study that compares the elderly cases of aSAH who receive the definitive treatment with those who treated conservatively. The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of the definitive surgery for the acute subarachnoid cases aged 80 or older. We reviewed 500 consecutive cases with acute aSAH with surgical indication for aneurysm repair. Inoperable cases such as dead-on-arrival and the cases with both pupils dilated were excluded. We compared the cases aged 80 or older that received clipping or coil embolization with the controls that the family selected conservative treatment. 69 cases were included in this study (ranged 80-98, male:female=9:60). 56 cases (81.2%) had an aneurysm in the anterior circulation. 23 cases received clipping, 20 cases coil embolization and 26 cases treated conservatively. The cases with aneurysm repair showed significantly better clinical outcome than the controls, while World Federation of Neurological Surgeons (WFNS) grade on admission and premorbid modified Rankin Scale showed no difference between them. Better prognosis was obtained when ruptured aneurysm was repaired in the elderly than it was treated conservatively. From the results of this study, we should not hesitate to offer the definitive surgery for the elderly with aSAH.\n"}]}]}}

Primary care providers (PCPs) working in safety-net settings may have less experience treating survivors, and little is known about their knowledge and views on survivorship care. The current study was performed to determine the knowledge, attitudes, and confidence of PCPs in the safety net at delivering care to survivors of breast cancer. A modified version of the National Cancer Institute's Survey of Physician Attitudes Regarding Care of Cancer Survivors was given to providers at 2 county hospitals and 5 associated clinics (59 providers). Focus groups were held to understand barriers to survivorship care. Although the majority of providers believed PCPs have the skills necessary to provide cancer-related follow-up, the vast majority were not comfortable providing these services themselves. Providers were adherent to American Society of Clinical Oncology recommendations for mammography (98%) and physical examination (87%); less than one-third were guideline-concordant for laboratory testing and only 6 providers (10%) met all recommendations. PCPs universally requested additional training on clinical guidelines and the provision of written survivorship care plans before transfer. Concerns voiced in qualitative sessions included unfamiliarity with the management of endocrine therapy and confusion regarding who would be responsible for certain aspects of care. Safety-net providers currently lack knowledge of and confidence in providing survivorship care to patients with breast cancer. Opportunities exist for additional training in evidence-based guidelines and improved coordination of care between PCPs and oncology specialists.\n \nTo assess trends in the involvement of US physicians with managed care. Comparison of data from 2 consecutive rounds of a national survey. Longitudinal data were obtained from the 1996/1997 (n = 12,528) and the 1998/1999 (n = 12,304) rounds of the Community Tracking Study (CTS) Physician Survey, a large, ongoing nationally representative survey of US physicians involved in patient care. Indicators used to assess involvement with managed care included global measures of managed care participation, risk contracting, exposure to financial incentives, and impact of care management tools. Changes in these measures over the 2 study periods are reported. Analyses were conducted for all physicians, as well as for primary care physicians (PCPs) and specialists separately. The percentage of practice revenue derived from managed care increased only modestly over the study period (from 42% to 45%). Mean numbers of managed care contracts per physician increased minimally (from 12 to 13). Trends in acceptance of capitation and exposure to financial incentives remained stable over the study period. Among PCPs, employment in staff/group health maintenance organizations declined slightly, whereas gatekeeping function increased modestly. Among care management tools, only treatment guidelines had a significantly increased impact on medical practice, primarily among PCPs (from 46% to 52%; P < .001). Many aspects of managed care leveled off between 1996 and 1999 in ways not accurately reflected by plan enrollment patterns. This \"flattening of the curve\" trend appears to hold generally across multiple measures. A stalling of the managed care \"revolution,\" if it is sustained, may portend future escalation in healthcare costs.\n"}]}]}}

As in other chronic liver diseases, the presence of hepatocellular carcinoma in a patient with primary sclerosing cholangitis undergoing evaluation for orthotopic liver transplantation would clearly impact on the candidacy, diagnostic evaluation, and alternative treatment options. Thus, the aim of our study was to determine the prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients undergoing liver transplantation for primary sclerosing cholangitis. The records of the 520 patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation at our institution between 1985 and May 1995 were reviewed. Of the 134 patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis, three (2%) had hepatocellular carcinoma. In the 386 patients without primary sclerosing cholangitis undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation, 22 (6%) had hepatocellular carcinoma. Neither the duration of primary sclerosing cholangitis (range 7-23 years) nor the presence of ulcerative colitis (two of three patients) distinguished those patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis plus hepatocellular carcinoma from those with primary sclerosing cholangitis alone. None of the three patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis plus hepatocellular carcinoma had evidence for hepatitis B or C, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, or hemochromatosis. None of the tumors was of the fibrolamellar variety of hepatocellular carcinoma. The prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation is 2%. These data suggest that patients with advanced cirrhotic-stage primary sclerosing cholangitis are at increased risk for developing hepatocellular carcinoma and should be screened for hepatocellular carcinoma as well as for cholangiocarcinoma prior to orthotopic liver transplantation.\n \nThe purpose of this study is to examine whether or not well differentiated (w-d) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is indeed clinically early cancer. Seventy six patients with solitary small HCCs up to 3 cm in diameter, who underwent hepatectomy, were observed for at least 2 years for possible recurrence. These patients were divided into two groups The histological analysis revealed that w-d HCCs had lower incidences of fibrous capsule formation (P<0.01), when compared to l-d HCCs. There were no significant differences in the incidence of intrahepatic metastasis, or portal vein invasion. In a resected specimen of w-d HCC, barium sulfate and gelatin were injected into portal vein and a transparent specimen was made. The transparent specimen showed that the portal vein in the tumor seemed to be intact. Microscopically, cancer cell infiltration into the fibrous frame of the portal tract was present. There were no significant differences in the disease free survival between the two groups. An analysis of tumor volume doubling time in recurrent foci suggested that minute cancerous foci had been present at the time of operation. W-d HCCs were clinically demonstrated not to be early cancer, because there was no significant difference in disease free survival between the patients with w-d and l-d HCCs.\n"}]}]}}

Medical records were located and reviewed for 90 of 107 women referred for colposcopy and 153 of 225 women referred for repeated Pap smears. Routine clinic protocols for follow-up--telephone call, letter, or certified letter--were applied without regard to the type of abnormality seen on a Pap smear or recommended examination. Documented adherence to follow-up within 8 months of an abnormal result. Attempts to contact the patients for follow-up, adherence to follow-up recommendations, and patient characteristics were abstracted from medical records. The probability of adherence to follow-up vs the number of follow-up attempts was modeled with survival analysis. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine multivariate relationships related to adherence. The rate of overall adherence to follow-up recommendations was 56.0% (136/243). Adherence to a second colposcopy was not significantly different from that to a repeated Pap smear (odds ratio, 1.40; 95% confidence interval, 0.80-2.46). The use of as many as 3 patient reminders substantially improved adherence to follow-up. Women without insurance and women attending 1 of the 3 clinics were less likely to adhere to any follow-up recommendation (hazard ratio for no insurance, 0.43 [95% confidence interval, 0.20-0.93], and for clinic, 0.35 [95% confidence interval, 0.15-0.73]). Adherence to follow-up was low in this family planning clinic population, no matter what type of follow-up was advised. Adherence was improved by the use of up to 3 reminders. Allocating resources to effective methods for improving adherence to follow-up of abnormal results may be more important than which follow-up procedure is recommended.\n \nThe 2001 American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology Consensus Guidelines recommend that women who have Papanicolaou (Pap) smears diagnosed as atypical squamous cells (ASC), cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) (ASC-H) should be referred for immediate colposcopic examination. The objective of this pilot study was to evaluate whether reflex human papillomavirus (HPV)-DNA testing performed on smears diagnosed as ASC-H may obviate the need for immediate colposcopic examination. All ThinPrep Pap smears that were diagnosed as ASC-H or atypical squamous metaplastic cells (ASMT) between 2001-2003 and that had HPV-DNA testing and subsequent histologic and/or cytologic follow-up were evaluated. Those smears that were diagnosed as ASMT were reviewed and reclassified under the 2001 Bethesda System as either ASC of undetermined significance (ASCUS) or ASC-H. Smears that were diagnosed as ASCUS were excluded from the study. The study included of 48 smears that were diagnosed as ASC-H. All patients with biopsy-proven HSIL had positive high-risk (HR)-HPV results (100% negative predictive value). Approximately 80% of patients with ASC-H who had biopsy-proven, low-grade intraepithelial lesion on follow-up had positive HR-HPV results. Among the patients who had ASC-H with negative follow-up, 50% had positive HR-HPV results, and 50% had negative HR-HPV results. Among patients with ASC-H, a negative HR-HPV result was found to be an excellent predictor of the absence of HSIL. The results of this pilot study suggested that HPV-DNA testing may serve as a means to better select which patients with ASC-H on Pap smear should undergo colposcopic examination. This approach potentially may reduce medical costs and eliminate the need for routine colposcopic examination among patients with ASC-H Pap smears.\n"}]}]}}

The traditional cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide-based method was modified for DNA isolation from pollen. Taxon-specific DNA sequences were identified via bioinformatics or literature searches and were PCR amplified from the matching allergenic taxa; based on the sequences of PCR products, complementary or degenerate TaqMan probes were developed. The accuracy of the quantitative real-time PCR assay was tested on 3 plant species. The setup of a modified DNA extraction protocol allowed us to achieve good-quality pollen DNA. Taxon-specific nuclear gene fragments were identified and sequenced. Designed primer pairs and probes identified selected pollen taxa, mostly at the required classification level. Pollen was properly identified even when collected on routine aerobiological tape. Preliminary quantification assays on pollen grains were successfully performed on test species and in mixes. The real-time PCR approach revealed promising results in pollen identification and quantification, even when analyzing pollen mixes.

One had been studied in the period of 1975 till 1979, and a second population was evaluated between 1992 and 1995. At both time periods patients with inhalant allergy and visiting our outpatient clinic were included. Quantification of IgE to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, birch, timothy grass, and mugwort was performed via the Phadebas RAST technique (Pharmacia, Brussels, Belgium). In patients suffering from respiratory allergy the frequency of birch pollen sensitisation significantly increased from 13% in the period 1975-1979 to 34% in the period 1992-1995. In contrast, the frequency of house dust mite, timothy grass pollen, and mugwort pollen sensitisation remained almost unchanged. The increase was not associated with an increase in the birch pollen count. Birch pollen hypersensitivity has almost tripled among atopic subjects during the last 2 decades. The exact mechanisms for this increase remain to be evaluated.\n"}]}]}}

Histologic and ultrastructural studies of normal corneas showed significant differences in the direction of collagen fibrils and/or the degree of lamellar interweaving in Bowman's layer, the anterior third of the corneal stroma, the posterior two-thirds of the corneal stroma, and Descemet's membrane. Cohesive tensile strength testing directly supported these morphologic findings as the stronger, more rigid regions of the cornea were located anteriorly and peripherally. This suggests that PRK and ASA, and secondarily SBK, should be biomechanically safer than conventional LASIK with regard to risk for causing keratectasia after surgery. Because adult human corneal stromal wounds heal slowly and incompletely, all excimer laser keratorefractive surgical techniques still have some distinct disadvantages due to inadequate reparative wound healing. Despite reducing some of the risk for corneal haze compared to conventional PRK, ASA cases still can develop corneal haze or breakthrough haze from the hypercellular fibrotic stromal scarring. In contrast, similar to conventional LASIK, SBK still has the short- and long-term potential for interface wound complications from the hypocellular primitive stromal scar. Ophthalmic pathology and basic science research show that SBK and ASA are improvements in excimer laser keratorefractive surgery compared to conventional LASIK or PRK, particularly with regard to maintaining corneal biomechanics and perhaps moderately reducing the risk of corneal haze. However, most of the disadvantages caused by wound healing issues remain.\n \nMicrocirculation and oxygen supply in cervical skin were measured with an optical, noninvasive method in patients with or without radiotherapy before neck dissection. The course of wound healing was monitored after the surgical procedure to identify predictive factors for postoperative wound healing disorders. Tissue spectrophotometry and laser Doppler flowmetry were used to determine capillary oxygen saturation, hemoglobin concentration, blood flow, and blood velocity at 2-mm and 8-mm depths in the cervical skin of 91 patients before neck dissection in a maxillofacial unit of a university hospital in Munich, Germany. Parameters were evaluated for differences between patients with irradiation (24) and without (67) and patients with wound healing disorders (25) and without (66) (univariate or multivariate statistical analyses). Velocity at 2 mm was lower in irradiated skin (P = .016). Flow at 2 mm was higher in patients with wound healing disorders (P = .018).

The main outcomes of interest were resection margins, overall survival, disease-free survival, and surgical morbidities. There were 108 patients, of which 87 were eligible for analysis. Patients who received radiotherapy for their primary rectal cancer (n = 41) required more radical exenterations (68% vs 44%; p = 0.020), had lower rates of clear resection margins (63% vs 87%; p = 0.010), had increased rates of surgical complications per patient (p = 0.014), and had a lower disease-free survival (p = 0.022). Overall survival and disease-free survival in patients with clear margins were also lower in the primary irradiated patients (p = 0.049 and p < 0.0001). This difference in survival persisted in multivariate analysis that corrected for T and N stages of the primary tumor. This study is limited by its retrospective nature and heterogeneous radiotherapy regimes among radiotherapy patients. Patients who previously received radiotherapy for primary rectal cancer treatment have worse oncologic outcomes than those who had not received radiotherapy after pelvic exenteration for locally recurrent rectal cancer.\n \nThe aim of this study was to examine the incidence of coexisting colorectal cancer in ulcerative colitis in a population of patients undergoing ileal pouch anal anastomosis. The frequency of rectal cancer in this population, surgical intervention, general outcomes and cancer recurrence are described. Data on 1850 patients undergoing restorative proctocolectomy from 1983 to 2001 were reviewed. Information was gathered from data in the department's pelvic pouch database, as well as pathology and surgical reports. Follow-up questionnaires routinely sent to patients as part of the database were included in the analysis to determine current functional status. Mean follow-up period was 7.5 years after surgery. Seventy patients had coexisting colorectal cancer at time of IPAA. 7 (10%) of cancers were incidental. Pre-operative duration of disease was 18.6 years. Twenty-six of the cancers were rectal cancers. The most common form of anastomosis in the rectal cancers was mucosectomy, especially in pre-operatively known rectal cancer or low lying dysplasia. Preferred surgical technique for rectal cancer in mucosal ulcerative colitis (UC) included high ligation of mesenteric vessels with radical colectomy and taped occlusion of the rectum with irrigation of the rectal stump with Turnbull solution prior to mucosectomy. Patients with Stage 3 cancers received postoperative chemotherapy. Post-operative radiation therapy was not commonly recommended. Five of 70 patients were deceased from metastatic colon cancer; 55 patients were confirmed alive with good to excellent pouch function with a follow-up range of 1-17 years. Restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis is a successful surgical approach for patients with coexisting colorectal cancer in UC. When the appropriate surgical technique is used in patients with colon or rectal cancer, along with adjuvant chemotherapy when appropriate, prognosis and function is very good.\n"}]}]}}

The aim of this study was to demonstrate the efficacy of 3D ultrasound-validated large-core needle biopsy (LCNB) of the breast. A total of 360 core needle biopsies was obtained from 169 breast lesions in 146 patients. Additional open breast biopsy was performed in 111 women (127/169 breast lesions); the remaining 42 lesions were followed up for at least 24 months. 3D ultrasound visualization of the needle in the postfiring position was used to classify the biopsy as central, marginal or outside the lesion. Based on this classification it was decided whether another sample had to be obtained. A median of two core samples per lesion provided for all the lesions a sensitivity for malignancy of 96.9%, specificity of 100%, false-positive rate of 0% and false-negative rate of 3.1%, and for the excised lesions a sensitivity of 96.5%, specificity of 100%, false-positive rate of 0%, false-negative rate of 3.5% and an underestimation rate of 3.4%. 3D ultrasound validation of the postfiring needle position is an efficient adjunct to ultrasound-guided LCNB. The advantages of 3D ultrasound validation are likely to include a reduction in the number of core samples needed to achieve a reliable histological diagnosis (and a possible reduction in the risk of tumor cell displacement), reduced procedure time and lower costs.\n \nTransapical aortic valve implantation (TAVI) may lead to obstruction of coronary arteries during deployment. To prevent this, it is essential to determine the distance of the coronary ostium to the aortic annulus prior to valve placement. Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) commonly is used to determine these measurements, but even marginal exposure to contrast agents can result in acute kidney injury in this high-risk group of multi-morbid patients. The aim of the study was to determine the feasibility of real-time 3D transesophageal echocardiography (RT 3D TEE) as the first-choice technique for noninvasive evaluation of the coronary ostium during TAVI. Retrospective study. University hospital. Fifty patients underwent MDCT the evening before surgery. RT 3D TEE was performed intraoperatively before valve deployment. The dataset from both of these examinations was digitally stored and evaluated. MDCT was performed in nonanesthetized patients; however, in the RT 3D TEE group, general anesthesia was established. The distances from the right coronary artery and the left coronary artery ostium were measured retrospectively. Bland-Altman Plots and linear regression analysis showed excellent correlation between the 2 methodologies; intraobserver and interobserver variance were calculated using analysis of variance. Krippendorff's \u03b1 indicated excellent agreement between the 2 observers (0.96 and 0.98) as well as between RT 3D TEE and MDCT (0.97 and 0.98). The observations showed that RT 3D TEE reliably can measure the coronary ostium distance from the aortic annulus. It is feasible and an alternative method for evaluating these measurements and thereby preventing contrast exposure during MDCT, which may jeopardize the safety of patients with pre-existing renal disease.\n"}]}]}}

Recurrence of groin metastases in vulvar cancer patients is assumed to be lethal. It is unknown if early detection of relapse and multimodal treatment strategies improve the outcome of patients with groin recurrence. Multicenter retrospective cohort study of patients with recurrent vulvar cancer who presented with groin and/or pelvic lymph node metastases between 2000 and 2014 at 3 tertiary referral hospitals. Our primary outcome was to assess survival after groin recurrence of vulvar cancer and the influence of multimodal treatment. All analyses were done using Stata 12 (Stata Corporation, College Station, Tex). Hazard ratios (HRs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals were calculated using a Cox proportional hazards model. We identified 30 patients with a median time from diagnosis to groin recurrence of 10 months. The median follow-up of patients who were alive at the time of analysis was 22 months (range, 9-123 months). A Kaplan-Meier estimate showed an overall survival rate of 50% after 7 years. Patients with multimodal groin relapse treatment performed better than those with single-mode treatment (HR, 0.25; P = 0.037). Lymph node metastases at diagnosis were also associated with lower survival (HR, 6.11; P = 0.020). We observed a trend toward lower survival with a tumor size greater than T1 (HR, 2.55; P = 0.111). The time from diagnosis to groin recurrence had no influence on survival (HR, 0.99; P = 0.561). Close follow-up visits for at least 2 years are important to detect recurrent disease in groin and pelvic lymph nodes. Treatment of recurrent groin metastases should no longer be considered as a palliative situation--given that one half of the patients will have long-term survival after multimodal treatment strategies.\n \nSynchronous liver metastases (SLM) occur in 20% of colorectal cancers (CRC). Resection of SLM and CLC can be undertaken at different centres (separate management, SM) or at the same centre (global management, GM). Retrospective study of SLM and CRC resections carried out during 01/2000 - 12/2006 by SM or GM, using a combined or delayed strategy. Morphologic characteristics and type of CRC and SLM resection were similar for the GM (n = 45) or SM (n = 66) groups. In patients with delayed liver resection (62 SM, 17 GM), chemotherapy prior to liver surgery was used in 92% and 38% of SM and GM patients (P < 0.0001) and the median delay between procedures was 212 and 182 days, respectively (P = 0.04). First step of liver resection was more often performed during colorectal surgery in the GM group (62 vs. 6% for SM, P < 0.0001) and the mean number of procedures (CRC+SLM) was lower (1.6 vs. 2.3, P = 0.003). Three-month mortality was 3% for GM and 0% for SM (n.s.). Overall survival rates were 67% and 51% for SM and GM at 3 years (n.s.), and 35 and 31% at 5 years (n.s.). Disease-free survival to 5 years was higher in SM patients (14% vs. 11%, P = 0.009). GM of CRC and SLM was associated with fewer procedures but did not influence overall survival. SM was associated with a longer delay and increased use of chemotherapy between procedures, suggesting that more rigorous selection of SM patients for surgery may explain the higher disease-free survival after SLM resection.\n"}]}]}}

However, eye movement closely interacts with motion perception. The known eye-tracking difficulties in schizophrenia patients may interact with their motion perception. Two speed discrimination experiments were conducted in a within-subject design. In experiment 1, the stimulus duration was 150 msec to minimize the chance of eye-tracking occurrence. In experiment 2, the duration was increased to 300 msec, increasing the possibility of eye movement intrusion. Regular eye-tracking performance was evaluated in a third experiment. At 150 msec, speed discrimination thresholds did not differ between schizophrenia patients (n = 38) and control subjects (n = 33). At 300 msec, patients had significantly higher thresholds than control subjects (p = .03). Furthermore, frequencies of eye tracking during the 300 msec stimulus were significantly correlated with speed discrimination in control subjects (p = .01) but not in patients, suggesting that eye-tracking initiation may benefit control subjects but not patients. The frequency of eye tracking during speed discrimination was not significantly related to regular eye-tracking performance. Speed discrimination, per se, is not impaired in schizophrenia patients. The observed abnormality appears to be a consequence of impairment in generating or integrating the feedback information from eye movements. This study introduces a novel approach to motion perception studies and highlights the importance of concurrently measuring eye movements to understand interactions between these two systems; the results argue for a conceptual revision regarding motion perception abnormality in schizophrenia.\n \nEpisodic memory is significantly impaired in people with schizophrenia. The precise cause of this impairment has yet to be determined, as the formation of episodic memories is dependent on other processes, some of which also show impairment in schizophrenia. One such process is closure, that is, the filling-in of missing information. Failure to close adequately incomplete stimuli may cause people with schizophrenia to store inadequate or piecemeal representations in memory. Forty people with schizophrenia and 21 healthy comparison subjects participated in the study. The experiment was divided into six blocks, each of which involved both an encoding and a recognition phase. During the encoding phase, 20 figures were presented sequentially and participants had to determine whether each was symmetric or asymmetric. These figures were either complete or fragmented at three different levels. In subsequent recognition phase, 40 abstract figures (20 new and 20 old) were presented. All figures were complete in this phase. Memory performance of both groups was affected similarly by fragmentation, with an additional increase in performance afforded by a slight fragmentation for participants with schizophrenia. Slight fragmentation may have induced a perceptual difficulty that was mild enough to increase visual processing without compromising it. Closure was thus not involved in the episodic memory deficit of people with schizophrenia.\n"}]}]}}

We present results of per-oral transgastric splenectomy in a porcine model. The goal of this study was to determine the technical feasibility of per-oral transgastric splenectomy using a flexible endoscope. We performed acute experiments on 50-kg pigs. All animals were fed liquids for 3 days prior to procedure. The procedures were performed under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation. The flexible endoscope was passed per orally into the stomach and puncture of the gastric wall was performed with a needle knife. The puncture was extended to create a 1.5-cm incision using a pull-type sphincterotome, and a double-channel endoscope was advanced into the peritoneal cavity. The peritoneal cavity was insufflated with air through the endoscope. The spleen was visualized. The splenic vessels were ligated with endoscopic loops and clips, and then mesentery was dissected using electrocautery. Endoscopic splenectomy was performed on six pigs. There were no complications during gastric incision and entrance into the peritoneal cavity. Visualization of the spleen and other intraperitoneal organs was very good. Ligation of the splenic vessels and mobilization of the spleen were achieved using commercially available devices and endoscopic accessories. Transgastric endoscopic splenectomy in a porcine model appears technically feasible. Additional long-term survival experiments are planned.\n \nThe British Committee for Standards in Haematology currently recommends concomitant splenectomy in children with mild hereditary spherocytosis (HS) undergoing cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstones. However, splenectomy is associated with a risk of life-threatening infection, particularly in young children. The aim of this study was to audit the outcome of the practice of uncoupling splenectomy and cholecystectomy in such patients. Children referred with symptomatic gallstones complicating HS between April 1999 and April 2009 were prospectively identified and reviewed retrospectively. During this period, the policy was to undertake concomitant splenectomy only if indicated for haematological reasons and not simply because of planned cholecystectomy. A total of 16 patients (mean age 10.4, range 3.7 to 16 years, 11 women) with HS and symptomatic gallstones underwent cholecystectomy. Three patients subsequently required a splenectomy for haematological reasons 0.8-2.5 years after cholecystectomy; all three splenectomies were performed laparoscopically. There were no postoperative complications in the 16 patients; postoperative hospital stay was 1-3 days after either cholecystectomy or splenectomy. The 13 children with a retained spleen remain under regular review by a haematologist (median follow-up 4.6, range 0.5 to 10.6 years) and are well and transfusion independent. The advice to perform a concomitant splenectomy in children with mild HS undergoing cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstones needs revisiting. In the era of minimal access surgery, the need for splenectomy in such children should be judged on its own merits.\n"}]}]}}

We highlighted the majority of the plants commonly involved with the female reproductive system including This study is a narrative review of studies of plants that are possible alternative treatments for FSD. The species described have clinical and popular uses in different cultures as well as medical indications for female reproductive disturbances, mainly in climacteric women. We have also analyzed the evidence level of clinical studies. The main outcome assessed is the efficacy of plants in improving the symptoms of FSD. There is little evidence from the literature to recommend the use of medicinal plants when treating FSD. The majority of studies with a strong level of evidence are associated with the treatment of the vasomotor symptoms of menopause. Ferula hermonis, Angelica sinensis, and Gingko biloba may be suggested for arousal disorder studies. Cimicifuga racemosa, Trifolium pratense, and Vitex agnus-castus may be recommended for several FSD. Humulus lupulus and Tribulus terrestris may help with desire disorder studies. Lepidium meyenii should be studied further. Studies of these plants indicate that they may be useful as a possible alternative and/or complementary approach for studies aimed at the treatment of FSD. At this time, however, this review cannot recommend a plant that has a strong enough level of evidence for treatment of FSD. Thus, there is a need for clinical (double-blinded and randomized) studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of several plants that can exert a positive effect on the management of FSD.\n \nThe prospective memory (PM) construct is aimed at capturing cognitive operations involved in the successful accomplishment of delayed intentions. It is generally agreed that PM impairment occurs in patients with prefrontal lobes damage. To evaluate if there is a causal role of a deficit of executive abilities (failures of planning, set-shifting, selective attention, or working memory) over the PM impairment. We report a detailed investigation of PM and executive abilities in two patients with posttraumatic damage to prefrontal lobes who complained from a reduced compliance with appointments and daily routines. Laboratory tests confirmed a difficulty in fulfilling delayed intentions in response to the occurrence of critical events and elapsed time. In one patient, PM impairment was associated with poor performance on tests investigating planning, working memory, and mental shifting. The other patient performed in the normal range on all executive tests. Despite the frequent claim of a dependence of PM deficits from executive dysfunction, the reported cases demonstrate that this is not necessarily the case. The results are discussed in the light of current hypotheses relating PM impairment to other deficits that commonly occur as a result of damage to the prefrontal lobes.\n"}]}]}}

In addition, coinfection of CMV and IE has not been reported. Therefore, the current study was initiated to determine whether CMV infection is a risk factor for developing of IE after kidney transplantation. In a retrospectively study, we analyzed the medical records of 3700 kidney recipients at two transplant centers in Iran, between January 2000 and June 2008 for infective endocarditis. During the study, 15 patients with IE hospitalized in our centers were included. The predominant causative microorganisms (60%) were group D non-enterococcal streptococci and enterococci. Patient survival rate in all recipients was 66% at 6 months. Data analysis showed no significant differences in 6 months patient survival from hospitalization between both groups with and without CMV infection (P=0.2). The presentation time of infective endocarditis in recipients with CMV coinfection was more likely to be early when compared to CMV negative coinfection patients (P=0.03). The present study indicates that CMV infection may lead to predispose to infective endocarditis after kidney transplantation. Rapid diagnosis, effective treatment, and prompt recognition of complications in kidney transplant recipients are essential to good patient outcome.\n"}]}]}}

Skilled birth attendance has been shown to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity, yet in 2010 only 68 percent of mothers in Ghana gave birth with the assistance of skilled birth attendants. In 2005, the Ghana Health Service piloted a strategy that involved using the integrated Community-based Health Planning and Services (CHPS) program and training Community Health Officers (CHOs) as midwives to address the gap in skilled attendance in rural Upper East Region (UER). The study assesses the feasibility of and extent to which the skilled delivery program has been implemented as an integrated component of the existing CHPS, and documents the benefits and challenges of the integrated program. We employed an intrinsic case study design with a qualitative methodology. We conducted 41 in-depth interviews with health professionals and community stakeholders. We used a purposive sampling technique to identify and interview our respondents. The CHO-midwives provide integrated services that include skilled delivery in CHPS zones. The midwives collaborate with District Assemblies, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and communities to offer skilled delivery services in rural communities. They refer pregnant women with complications to district hospitals and health centers for care, and there has been observed improvement in the referral system. Stakeholders reported community members' access to skilled attendants at birth, health education, antenatal attendance and postnatal care in rural communities. The CHO-midwives are provided with financial and non-financial incentives to motivate them for optimal work performance. The primary challenges that remain include inadequate numbers of CHO-midwives, insufficient transportation, and infrastructure weaknesses. Our study demonstrates that CHOs can successfully be trained as midwives and deployed to provide skilled delivery services at the doorsteps of rural households. The integration of the skilled delivery program with the CHPS program appears to be an effective model for improving access to skilled birth attendance in rural communities of the UER of Ghana.\n \nTo determine the impact of Florida's Medicaid Demonstration 4 years post-implementation on per member per month (PMPM) Medicaid expenditures and whether receiving care through HMOs versus provider service networks (PSNs) in the Demonstration was associated with PMPM expenditures. Florida Medicaid claims from two fiscal years prior to implementation of the Demonstration (FY0405, FY0506) and the first four fiscal years after implementation (FY0607-FY0910) from two urban Demonstration counties and two urban non-Demonstration counties. A difference-in-difference approach was used to compare changes in enrollee expenditures before and after implementation of the Demonstration overall and specifically for HMOs and PSNs. Claims data were extracted for enrollees in the Demonstration and non-Demonstration counties and collapsed into monthly amounts (N = 26,819,987 person-months). Among SSI enrollees, the Demonstration resulted in lower increases in PMPM expenditures over time ($40) compared with the non-Demonstration counties ($186), with Demonstration PSNs lowering PMPM expenditures by $7 more than HMOs. Savings were also seen among TANF enrollees but to a lesser extent. The Medicaid Demonstration in Florida appears to result in lower PMPM expenditures. Demonstration PSNs generated slightly greater reductions in expenditures compared to Demonstration HMOs. PSNs appear to be a promising model for delivering care to Medicaid enrollees.\n"}]}]}}

Carotid stenosis was a risk factor for stroke (P=0.03). Prevalence of carotid stenosis was higher in the high-risk group (9.1%) than the low-risk group (1.2%) (P<0.05). All concomitant or staged carotid endarterectomies/CAB (5/205) and all patients who had perioperative strokes (5/205) were in the high-risk group (P=0.01). In our cohort, selective screening of patients aged >70 years, with carotid bruit, a history of cerebrovascular disease, diabetes mellitus or PVD would have reduced the screening load by 40%, with trivial impact on surgical management or neurological outcomes.\n \nTo compare hospital outcomes of on-pump and off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery. From 1997 to 2000, primary coronary artery bypass grafting was performed in 481 patients off pump and in 3231 patients on pump. Hospital outcomes were compared between propensity-matched pairs of 406 on-pump and 406 off-pump patients. The 2 groups were similar in age (P =.9), left ventricular function (P =.7), extent of coronary artery disease (P =.5), carotid artery disease (P =.4), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P =.5). However, off-pump patients had more previous strokes (P =.05) and peripheral vascular disease (P =.02); on-pump patients had a higher preoperative New York Heart Association class (P =.01). In the matched pairs the mean number of bypass grafts was 2.8 +/- 1.0 in off-pump patients and 3.5 +/- 1.1 in on-pump patients (P <.001). Fewer grafts were performed to the circumflex (P <.001) and right coronary (P =.006) artery systems in the off-pump patients. Postoperative mortality, stroke, myocardial infarction, and reoperation for bleeding were similar in the 2 groups. There was more encephalopathy (P =.02), sternal wound infection (P =.04), red blood cell use (P =.002), and renal failure requiring dialysis (P =.03) in the on-pump patients. Both off- and on-pump procedures produced excellent early clinical results with low mortality. An advantage of an off-pump operation was less postoperative morbidity; however, less complete revascularization introduced uncertainty about late results. A disadvantage of on-pump bypass was higher morbidity that seemed attributable to cardiopulmonary bypass.\n"}]}]}}

The purpose of this study was to characterize and classify mesocolon invasion from gastric cancer. We examined 806 patients who underwent surgery for advanced gastric carcinoma from 1992 to 2007 at the Department of Surgery, Gangnam Severance Hospital, Korea. Among these, patients who showed macroscopically direct invasion into the mesocolon were compared to other patients with advanced gastric cancer. The curability, number and extent of nodal metastasis, and the survival of the mesocolon invasion group were significantly worse than these factors in the T3 group. However, the survival of the mesocolon invasion group after curative resection was much better than that of patients who had incurable factors. Mesocolon invasion should be included in T4 for the staging of gastric cancer.\n \nDickkopf-3 (DKK3) may act as a tumor suppressor as it is down-regulated in various types of cancer. This study assessed the DKK3 protein expression in gastric cancer and its potential value as a prognostic marker. DKK3 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 158 gastric cancer samples from patients who underwent gastrectomy from 2002 to 2008. Clinicopathological parameters and survival data were analyzed. Loss of DKK3 expression was found in 64 of 158 (40.5%) samples, and it was associated with advanced T stage (p < 0.001), lymph node metastasis (p < 0.001), UICC TNM stage (p < 0.001), tumor location (p = 0.029), lymphovascular invasion (p = 0.035), and perineural invasion (p = 0.032). Patients without DKK3 expression in tumor cells had a significantly worse disease-free and overall survival than those with DKK3 expression (p < 0.001, and p = 0.001, respectively). TNM stage (p = 0.028 and p < 0.001, respectively) and residual tumor (p < 0.001 and p = 0.003, respectively) were independent predictors of disease-free and overall survival. Based on the preoperative clinical stage assessed by computed tomography (CT), loss of DKK3 expression was predominantly associated with worse prognosis in patients with clinically node-negative advanced gastric cancer (AGC). The combination of DKK3 expression status and CT increased the accuracy of CT staging for predicting lymph node involvement from 71.5 to 80.0% in AGC patients. Loss of DKK3 protein expression was significantly associated with poor survival in patients with gastric cancer and was strongly correlated with the TNM stage. DKK3 might be a potential biomarker of lymph node involvement that can improve the predictive power of CT.\n"}]}]}}

This study showed no significant correlation between early anticoagulation and development of bleeding complications.\n \nPrior studies have demonstrated that transfusion of older stored blood is associated with an increased risk of multiple organ failure, infection, and death. These reports were primarily comprised of severely injured patients, and it remains unknown whether this phenomenon is observed in relatively less injured patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between the age of stored blood and the morbidity and mortality in a mild to moderately injured patient cohort. Blunt trauma patients with Injury Severity Score <25 admitted to a Trauma Intensive Care Unit during 7.5 years who received no blood during the first 48 hours of hospitalization were selected for inclusion. Patients who died within 48 hours of admission were excluded from analysis. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for the association between morbidity or mortality and the age and amount of blood transfused (>48 hours postadmission), adjusted for age, sex, injury severity, thoracic injury, mechanical ventilation, and transfusion volume. During 7.5 years, 1,624 patients met the study criteria. The mean Injury Severity Score was 14.4. Receipt of blood stored beyond 2 weeks was associated with mortality (OR 1.12 [CI 1.02-1.23]), renal failure (OR 1.18 [CI 1.07-1.29]), and pneumonia (OR 1.10 [CI 1.04-1.17]). No such associations were identified, however, concerning the transfusion of blood with a lesser storage age. In a mild to moderately injured intensive care unit patient cohort, the receipt of blood stored beyond 2 weeks was independently associated with mortality, renal failure, and pneumonia. The deleterious effect of older blood on patient outcome does not appear to be limited to the severely injured.\n"}]}]}}

We conducted a population-based case-referent study of 25- to 74-year-old stroke patients with, for each case of a patient who was on statin treatment at the onset of stroke (n=125), 2 referent patients who were not treated with statins but were matched for age, gender, year of onset, and stroke subtype (n=250). The unadjusted odds ratio for early discharge to home (versus late discharge or death) was 1.41 (95% CI 0.91 to 2.17) when patients on statin treatment were compared with referent stroke patients not on statins.

Negative binomial and logit models were fitted given that count and categorical variables were employed as outcome measures, respectively. Regardless of socio-economic and demographic factors, women enrolled in the NHIS make more antenatal visits compared with those not enrolled; however, there was no statistical association with the timing of the crucial first visit.

Earlier studies reported a higher incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) associated with cemented prostheses in elective total hip or knee arthroplasty. In addition, the hypercoagulable state after a traumatic femoral neck fracture and possible thrombogenic properties of bone cement could put these patients at greater risk for thromboembolism. We aimed to compare the incidence of DVT and progression to pulmonary embolism (PE) or mortality in cemented and uncemented hemiarthroplasty. The data of 271 patients treated with cemented or uncemented hemiarthroplasty after a traumatic displaced femoral neck fracture was retrospectively analysed for the incidence of DVT. The level of thrombosis, progression to PE and mortality were compared. There were 133 (49.1%) patients with cemented hemiarthroplasty, while 138 (50.9%) had uncemented hemiarthroplasty. The patients had an average age of 76.6 (range 53-99) years and 11 (4.1%) patients had DVT. There were no significant differences in development of DVT, level of thrombosis, PE and mortality regardless of whether a cemented or an uncemented prosthesis was used. Cemented hemiarthroplasty is not associated with higher risks of DVT, PE or mortality in patients with traumatic displaced femoral neck fracture.

The aim of this study was to investigate a possible correlation between serum levels of androgens and sexual desire in women and whether the level of ADT-G is better correlated than the level of circulating androgens with sexual desire. This was a cross-sectional study including 560 healthy women aged 19-65 years divided into three age groups. Correlations were considered to be statistically significant at P<0.05. Sexual desire was determined as the total score of the sexual desire domain of the Female Sexual Function Index. Total testosterone (TT), calculated free testosterone (FT), androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), and ADT-G were analyzed using mass spectrometry. Sexual desire correlated overall with FT and androstenedione in the total cohort of women. In a subgroup of women aged 25-44 years with no use of systemic hormonal contraception, sexual desire correlated with TT, FT, androstenedione, and DHEAS. In women aged 45-65 years, androstenedione correlated with sexual desire. No correlations between ADT-G and sexual desire were identified. In the present study, FT and androstenedione were statistically significantly correlated with sexual desire in the total cohort of women. ADT-G did not correlate more strongly than circulating androgens with sexual desire and is therefore not superior to measuring circulating androgens by mass spectrometry.\n \nScreening mammogram can decrease the mortality of breast cancer. Studies show that women avoid mammogram because of fear of pain, diagnosis, and radiation. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a radiolucent pad (MammoPad; Hologic Inc, Bedford [MA], US) during screening mammogram to reduce pain in Chinese patients and the possibility of glandular dose reduction. This case series was conducted in a private hospital in Hong Kong. Between November 2011 and January 2012, a total of 100 Chinese patients were recruited to our study. Left mammogram was performed without MammoPad and served as a control. Right mammogram was performed with the radiolucent MammoPad. All patients were then requested to complete a simple questionnaire. The degree of pain and discomfort was rated on a 0-10 numeric analogue scale. Significant reduction in discomfort was defined as a decrease of 10% or more. Of the 100 patients enrolled in this study, 66.3% of women reported at least a 10% reduction in the level of discomfort with the use of MammoPad. No statistical differences between age, breast size, and the level of discomfort were found. The use of MammoPad significantly reduced the level of discomfort experienced during mammography.

The authors analyzed the survival experience of 834 women who developed recurrent breast cancer between November 1974 and December 2000. All patients had been treated previously with adjuvant anthracycline-based protocols. Patients were divided into five consecutive groups based on year of breast cancer recurrence, and survival was compared across the five groups. Because some prognostic variables were divided unevenly divided among the cohorts, a multivariate model was created to determine the association of year of recurrence and survival after accounting for other prognostic factors. In the unadjusted analysis, there was a statistically significant improvement in survival across the five groups, and the more recent cohorts had longer survival (P < 0.001). Other variables that predicted longer survival after breast cancer recurrence included smaller initial tumor size, lower stage of disease, fewer lymph nodes involved, longer disease-free interval, estrogen receptor-positive tumors, and nonvisceral dominant site of disease recurrence. In the multivariate analysis, which adjusted for these prognostic factors, year of recurrence was associated with a trend toward improved survival, with a 1% reduction in risk for each increasing year. For these cohorts of patients, the authors present data suggesting that the prognosis for patients with recurrent breast cancer improved between 1974 and 2000.\n"}]}]}}

Thirty-four patients with atrial septal defect (ASD), 37 with ventricular septal defect, and 46 with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) were included in the analysis. No differences were found in preoperative and intraoperative data between caudal and noncaudal group for each disorder. There was no difference between caudal and noncaudal groups in PICU and hospital stay. A statistically significant difference was found in the postoperative ventilatory time in patients with ASD and TOF between caudal and noncaudal groups. The early extubation rate was higher in the TOF caudal group compared with the noncaudal group. This retrospective study demonstrated that postinduction placement of caudal anesthesia does not affect PICU or hospital length of stay.

Very few of the available hospital-based studies of the implications of cannabis usage have involved psychiatric intensive care units (PICU); but PICU receive many of the most challenging and resource-hungry-and incompletely understood-patients in the mental health system. To study the clinical impact of cannabis abuse in a PICU, and to compare the use of atypical and typical antipsychotics in this setting. 115 patients admitted to a PICU consented to take part in an open label naturalistic study. BPRS, TCI-240, weight, length of admission and routine bloods were evaluated in all participants. There was a high rate of cannabis abuse (71.3%) in the PICU population. Patients who abused cannabis spent longer in PICU because their psychoses were more severe. They were younger at first hospital admission. Cannabis also had metabolic implications, with higher blood glucose levels at admission and greater weight increase. Atypical antipsychotics were effective in treating psychosis inpatients positive to cannabis at admission. Our findings suggest that cannabis abusers had a more severe psychotic illness, especially in schizophrenia. There are additional complications in terms of weight gain for cannabis users.\n"}]}]}}

There were no significant differences between the groups regarding early hemodynamic results or complication rates. TAVI can be performed safely without balloon predilatation and with the same early results as achieved with the standard procedure including balloon predilatation.

There is evidence that patients in remote and rural areas with certain diseases have worse outcomes and present to specialist services later than their urban counterparts. It is not known whether patients with aortic stenosis follow a similar pattern. The aim of this study was to investigate whether increasing rurality was associated with later presentation to healthcare services at a more advanced stage of aortic stenosis. This was a retrospective cohort study. Using ICD-10 discharge codes and local databases, 605 patients with aortic stenosis who presented between 31 November 1999 and 1 December 2008 were identified. Aortic stenosis was defined as a pressure gradient across the aortic valve of 25 mmHg or more. Patients with prior aortic valve replacement were excluded. Clinical notes were reviewed for all patients. Gender, age and pressure gradient across the aortic valve at presentation and patient GP-practice location were recorded. Patients were then assigned a Clinical Peripherality Index score based on the postcode of their GP's practice to define rurality. Patient data were compared across the six defined levels of clinical peripherality by ANOVA. Mean patient age was 73 \u00b1 13 years, and 336 (54%) were male. The peak gradient across the valve was 41.1 \u00b1 26.7 mmHg. There was no association between the level of clinical peripherality and the stage of aortic stenosis at presentation, age or gender (all  >0.05). There was no urban-rural gradient in the severity of aortic stenosis at presentation in this remote Scottish cohort. This suggests that patients with this condition in remote areas do not present later in their disease trajectory.\n"}]}]}}

Patients completed 3 different questionnaires Forty-eight patients had a diagnosis of primary or secondary cardiomyopathy, and 56 patients, with conditions predisposing to cardiomyopathy. Eighty-five percent of the considered population is surfing the Internet to obtain nonspecific information about health in general, and the 65% use it to look specifically for heart disease. For both groups of patients with cardiomyopathy and at risk for cardiomyopathy, online health information seeking behavior is associated with substantially lower state anxiety levels (P = .041). Web use, as a source of health information, has been shown to be associated with anxiety reduction in patients with or at risk for cardiomyopathy, suggesting that Internet technology can be a useful instrument due to its informational power and its potentially therapeutic value.\n \nTreatment of rectal cancer in North America has been associated with lower rates of sphincter-preserving surgery in comparison with other regions. It is unclear if these lower rates are due to patient, tumor, or treatment factors; thus, the potential to increase the use of sphincter-preserving surgery is unknown. The aim of this study is to identify the factors associated with the use of sphincter-preserving surgery and to quantify the potential for an increase in sphincter preservation. This population-based retrospective cohort study used patient-level data collected through a comprehensive, standardized review of hospital inpatient and outpatient medical records and cancer center charts. This study was conducted in all hospitals providing rectal cancer surgery in a Canadian province. All patients with a new diagnosis of rectal cancer from July 1, 2002 to June 30, 2006 who underwent potentially curative radical surgery were included. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with receiving a permanent colostomy. Patients were categorized as having received an appropriate or potentially inappropriate colostomy based on a priori determined patient, tumor, operative, and pathologic criteria. Of 466 patients who underwent radical surgery, 48% received a permanent colostomy. There was significant variation in the rate of sphincter-preserving surgery among the 10 hospitals that provided rectal cancer care (12%-73%, p = 0.0001). On multivariate analysis, male sex, low tumor height, and increasing tumor stage were associated with the receipt of a permanent colostomy. Among patients who received a permanent stoma, 65 of 224 (29%) patients received a potentially inappropriate stoma. On multivariate analysis, male sex and treatment in a medium- or low-volume hospital was associated with the receipt of a potentially inappropriate colostomy. This study was limited by its retrospective design. These data suggest that the receipt of a permanent colostomy by many patients with rectal cancer may be inappropriate, and there is potential to increase the use of sphincter-preserving surgery in patients with rectal cancer.\n"}]}]}}

We obtained data from the first two waves on 1261 Dutch adolescents who participated in TRAILS (TRacking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey) at ages 10-14 years and from the PCH records regarding ages 4-10 years. Early adolescence alcohol use (age 10-14 years) was defined as alcohol use at least once at ages 10-12 years (wave 1) and at least once in the previous 4 weeks at ages 12-14 years (wave 2). Predictors of early alcohol use concerned parent and teacher reports at wave 1 and PCH registrations, regarding the child's psychosocial functioning, and parental and socio-demographic characteristics. A total of 17.2% of the adolescents reported early alcohol use. Predictors of early alcohol use were teacher-reported aggressive behaviour [odds ratios (OR); 95% confidence interval (CI) A limited set of factors was predictive for early alcohol use. Use of this set may improve the detection of early adolescence alcohol use in PCH.\n \nComorbid major depression (MD) and alcohol use disorder (AUD), particularly in adolescents, have been shown to be associated with poorer subsequent MD outcomes. Longitudinal data were used to model associations between a four-level classification of MD/AUD during the period 15-18 years (neither; MD-only; AUD-only; comorbid MD/AUD) and MD over the period 18-35 years. These associations were then adjusted for confounding by a series of factors measured in childhood. The three disorder groups had rates of adult MD during the period 18-35 years that were significantly (p<.05) higher than that of the group with no disorder. Furthermore, those in the comorbid MD/AUD group had significantly (p <.05) higher rates of adult MD than those in the AUD-only group, and marginally (p <.10) higher rates of adult MD than those in the MD-only group. After adjustment for confounding, the difference in rates of adult MD between the MD-only group and the MD/AUD group were no longer statistically significant. The factors that explained the associations were gender, childhood behavior problems, and exposure to physical and sexual abuse. The data were obtained by self-report, and may have been subject to biases. The results of these analyses suggest that marginally higher rates of depression to age 35 amongst the comorbid MD/AUD group were explained by increased exposure to adverse childhood circumstances amongst members of the comorbid group. Adolescent MD/AUD comorbidity is likely to be a risk marker, rather than a causal factor in subsequent MD.\n"}]}]}}

A retrospective chart review was performed on 600 consecutive patients at a single institution from 2000 to 2010. Patients were mailed The Breast Q questionnaire to complete. Demographic, surgical, and clinical data were collected and entered into a database. Descriptive statistical analyses were conducted using SAS Software version 9.1.3 with statistical significance determined at P<0.05. A total of 178 surveys were returned and included in our study (a response rate of 29.6%). Patient data included a mean BMI of 28.3 (4.6) kg/m, and mean total amount of breast tissue removed of 1220.9 (665.4) g. The primary indications for patients having breast surgery were for symptomatic macromastia (85%), asymmetry (5.6%), and for cosmesis (2.5%). The Breast Q questionnaire demonstrated patients overwhelmingly agreed that they were satisfied with their breast surgery. The mean response was 2.8 with a standard deviation (SD) of 0.47 (where 1, disagree; 2, somewhat agree; and 3, definitely agree). Patient BMI and total amount of breast tissue removed had a statistically significant positive correlation (0.479; P<0.0001). There was no statistically significant difference between the amount of total breast tissue removed and patient response (P=0.57). The study supports a positive outcome after breast reduction surgery. Over 95% of the patients surveyed were satisfied and would do it again. It demonstrates the improvement of the patient's quality of life regardless of the amount of breast tissue removed. Furthermore, it suggests that the size and weight of the patient has no impact on this outcome. As we face new government and insurance restrictions for surgeries that have both cosmetic and reconstructive value, patient reported outcome studies may have an influence on future third-party payer.\n \nThe aim of study was to evaluate the importance of induced abortions for reproduction medicine in Czech Republic. Demographic analysis of data published by EUROSTAT and Czech statistical office. Department of Demography and Geodemography Faculty of Science, Charles University Prague. Widespread use of the liberal abortion law in socialist countries contributed to the decline of fertility rates only to the replacement level. In the Czech Republic total fertility rate dropped below 1.3 in 1995 and it did not increase above 1.5 children per woman till 2007. The increased use of modern contraceptive methods that results in a sharp decline in fertility and in a significant decrease of induced abortions can be documented. The total abortion rate fell from 1.54 abortions per a woman in 1990 to 0.34 in 2007. The proportion of women aged 15-49 years who were prescribed oral contraception increased from 4 percent in 1990 to 48 percent in 2007. An induced abortion is still used largely as a way to avoid birth of additional children by women who already have the number of children they want. This is in sharp contrast with the situation in the majority of Western European countries in which abortion is used mainly by teen-age girls whose attempts to avoid pregnancy have failed. In contrast to other demographic characteristics which classify the Czech Republic to Eastern Europe, the level of induced abortion rate is comparable with the levels observed in some Western European countries.\n"}]}]}}

Previous studies have demonstrated the ability of inexperienced persons to operate SADs after brief instruction. The aim of this pilot study was to determine whether an instruction manual consisting of four diagrams enables laypersons to operate a Laryngeal Mask Supreme\u00ae (LMAS) in the manikin. An instruction manual of four illustrations with speech bubbles displaying the correct use of the LMAS was designed. Laypersons were handed a bag containing a LMAS, a bag mask valve device (BMV), a syringe prefilled with air and the instruction sheet, and were asked to perform and ventilate the manikin as displayed. Time to ventilation was recorded and degree of success evaluated. A total of 150 laypersons took part. Overall 145 participants (96.7%) inserted the LMAS in the manikin in the right direction. The device was inserted inverted or twisted in 13 (8.7%) attempts. Eight (5.3%) individuals recognized this and corrected the position. Within the first 2 minutes 119 (79.3%) applicants were able to insert the LMAS and provide tidal volumes greater than 150 ml (estimated dead space).

No significant difference related to previous BLS training (P = 0.85), technical education (P = 0.07) or gender could be demonstrated (P = 0.25). In manikin laypersons could insert LMAS in the correct direction after onsite instruction by a simple manual with a high success rate. This indicates some basic procedural understanding and intellectual transfer in principle. Operating errors (n = 91) were frequently not recognized and corrected (n = 77). Improvements in labeling and the quality of instructional photographs may reduce individual error and may optimize understanding.\n \nPropofol has been found to depress the laryngeal reflexes. We studied whether this property could be utilized to relieve laryngeal spasm. This study was conducted over a period of 3 years, and included children aged 3-10 years, ASA status I and II. Most of the children were undergoing minor surgical procedures, under general anaesthesia with Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA trade mark ) and caudal epidural analgesia. During this period, 20 patients developed laryngeal spasm on removal of the LMA at the end of surgery. Initially, they all were treated with 100% O2, with gentle positive pressure ventilation. Out of 20 patients, seven responded well with 100% O2 and gentle positive pressure ventilation. The remaining 13 were treated with a small dose of propofol (0.8 mg.kg-1 body weight). Laryngeal spasm was relieved successfully in 10 patients and three patients required intubation to improve their oxygenation. Propofol in a small dose (0.8 mg.kg-1 body weight) was a useful drug to relieve laryngeal spasm in most children (76.9%) following the removal of the LMA. Because it was not found to be effective in all patients, succinylcholine still has a role to play in critical conditions. However, we recommend propofol as a suitable alternative for relieving laryngeal spasm in situations where succinylcholine is contraindicated.\n"}]}]}}

The patients were divided into two groups (\u226450 years and >50 years) based on their age. Patients' characteristics, clinical and surgical data were recorded and analyzed. Overall, 636 patients were included in the database, including 177 (27.8%) in the younger group and 459 in the elder group. There were no significant differences between the groups in disease complexity, peritonitis, laboratory work-up, vital signs on presentation, bowel obstruction or the presence of fistula and abscess in need of drainage. Younger patients had more free extra-luminal air on computed tomography (CT) scan (P\u2009=\u20090.03). Surgical data, including the intra-operative modified Hinchey score and the need for emergency and additional surgery did not significantly differ between the two groups. Young patients had more readmissions (P\u2009=\u20090.01) due to acute diverticulitis, diverticular complications and elective surgery. Length of hospital stay (P\u2009=\u20090.0001) was longer and postoperative complications were more common in the elder patients. The clinical presentation of acute diverticulitis does not seem to be worse in the young population. Younger patients tend to have a more severe presentation on CT scan and more readmissions, but this did not translate to a more severe disease course.\n"}]}]}}

Five hundred thirty-one participants had baseline and 1-year follow-up assessments; 69 (13.0%) of these had developed dementia at 1-year follow-up. At 2-year follow-up, 481 participants were seen, of whom 100 (20.8%) had developed dementia.

Though there is evidence of improved quality of patient care and outcomes with well-established models of care, we do not know if the functional recovery in activities of daily living among this group of patients is also dependant on age. We hypothesize that there will be a difference in Modified Barthel Index (MBI) scores between the 'older old' (>85 years) and the 'younger old' (<85 years). Hip fracture patients (>60 years) treated surgically were divided into Group A (below 85 years) and Group B (above 85 years). Demographic data, Charlson's Comorbidity Index (CCI) score, time to surgery and length of stay (LOS) were recorded. To assess the recovery in activities of daily living, the MBI scores were measured for the following intervals; pre-fall, at discharge, at 6-month and at 1-year follow-up. The mean age for Group A (n = 120) was 77 years (60-85) and the mean age for Group B (n = 59) was 91.8 years (86-108). There was no significant difference in the mean CCI (A We conclude that age is not a factor in determining functional recovery with regard to activities of daily living in an integrated model of care for geriatric hip fracture patients.\n"}]}]}}

A sub-analysis pairing the groups by age and sex in a 1:1 ratio was carried out to reduce bias. A total of 336 patients infected with Helicobacter pylori were compared with 242 non-infected patients. The prevalence of infection in the patients with dyspeptic symptoms and no endoscopically detectable lesions was 58%. The initial analysis showed that the cases with dyspepsia and Helicobacter pylori infection were more frequently associated with overweight, obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, and metabolic syndrome, but the paired analysis nullified all these differences.

Data were obtained from the 2002 and 2007 U.S. National Health Interview Survey to compare the use of 22 CAM therapies (n=9313 and n=7014, respectively). Estimates were age adjusted to the year 2000 U.S. standard population.

We administered a structured questionnaire of body size perception using a descriptive Likert scale keyed to body image figures to children ages 12 to 18 years.

The sample consisted of 91 children and their parents being seen in the Pediatric Gastroenterology Clinic for concerns unrelated to overweight. Weight and height of the children were measured, and body mass index (BMI) was calculated. The children's BMI percentiles were categorized as underweight (<15th), normal (15th-85th), overweight (85th-95th), and obese (95th and above). The attending physician independently completed the body image and description scale and indicated the figure that most accurately represented the patient without reference to BMI standards. Accuracy of the patients', parents', and doctors' estimates were statistically compared. The sample population consisted of 6.4% underweight, 70.5% normal weight, 7.7% overweight, and 15.4% obese. Forty-four percent of parents underestimated children's body size using word descriptions and 47% underestimated using figures. Forty percent of the children underestimated their own body size using descriptions and 43% underestimated using figures. The physicians in this study had a higher percentage of correct estimates; however, they underestimated 33% of the patients using both word descriptions and figures. Some obese children were not recognized, and several average children were perceived as underweight. Many children underestimated their degree of overweight. Their parents and even their attending physicians shared this misperception. This study demonstrates the need to further educate physicians to recognize obesity and overweight so that they can counsel children and their families.\n"}]}]}}

We have studied 14 patients with CNFPAs. The response of alpha-SU to the administration of TRH was studied in each patient before the surgery. alpha-SU blood serum level increase over 50% of the baseline level after TRH treatment was considered to be significant. The patients were divided into 2 groups, each including 7 subjects. The first group included the patients with gonadotropinomas (tumors immunopositive for FSH and/or LH or their free subunits). The second group included the patients with adenomas immunonegative for gonadotropins and alpha-SU. The basal level of alpha-SU was elevated over the upper limit of normal range in two patients of the first group (gonadotroph adenomas) and in one in the second group.

We investigated for the first time whether in vitro combinations of 2ME with various chemotherapeutic compounds may result in an additive inhibitory effect on the proliferation of human ovary cancer cells. As a model two different human ovary cancer cell lines were used. All cell lines were incubated with equimolar concentrations of 2ME (0.8-25 microM) and the chemotherapeutics epirubicine, doxorubicine, paclitaxel, docetaxel, carboplatin, vinorelbine, 5-fluorouracil and mafosfamide. Proliferation was measured after four days using the ATP-chemosensitivity test. For both ovary cancer cell lines a significant additive effect of 2ME with epirubicine and carboplatin was observed at the lower concentration range of these chemotherapeutic substances. 2ME is able to enhance the antiproliferative activity of certain chemotherapeutics at pharmacological relevant concentrations. This estradiol metabolite is currently in a phase II trial in patients with refractary metastatic breast cancer and the tolerability has been shown to be very good. The combination of 2ME with chemotherapeutics may therefore offer a new clinically relevant treatment regimen for hormone-dependent cancer.\n \nSurgical excision of ovarian endometriomas in patients desiring pregnancy has recently been criticized because of the risk of damage to healthy ovarian tissue and consequent reduction of ovarian reserve.

Serums CA125 and CA72-4 were measured in 72 patients with ovarian endometriomas and 55 patients with ovarian cancer. High CA125 concentrations were observed in patients with ovarian endometriosis and in those with ovarian cancer. A marked difference in CA72-4 values was observed between women with ovarian cancer (71.0%) and patients with endometriosis (13.8%) (P < 0.0001).

Assessing joint lines (JLs) by means of bony landmarks is inadvisable because of large variations in human anatomy. Because of the inherent symmetry of the human body, we hypothesised that JLs may be directly assessed by measuring the distances from the bony landmarks to the JL of the contralateral knee by means of radiographic images. Using scaled weight-bearing radiographs in anteroposterior view of both knees, two independent observers measured the distances from the fibular head, the medial and lateral epicondyle, and the adductor tubercle to the JL. A two-sided p value of \u22640.05 was considered statistically significant. Two hundred knees of 100 patients (50 men and 50 women) were examined. For the fibular head, the mean difference between the treated and the control knee was 0.0 mm with narrow confidence limits ranging from -1.1 to 1.1. As a new assessment method, we have suggested to assess the JL by means of radiographs of the contralateral knee. The most precise parameter was found to be the distance between the fibular head and the JL. The level of arthritis, age, gender, visibility of the landmarks, and misalignment did not influence measurement accuracy. This parameter is the first tibia-related landmark for assessing the JL, which advantageously corresponds to the tibia-first technique in revision surgery.

Prospectively, 50 knees were operated by total knee arthroplasty using a navigation-assisted gap-balancing technique. The offset-type-force-controlled-spreader-system was used for gap measurements. This commercially available instrument allows controllable tension in patella-reduced position. The mediolateral gaps of knee extension (0\u00b0) and flexion (90\u00b0) angle were recorded in three different patella positions; reduced, subluxated and everted. Any gap differences of more than 3 mm were considered as a meaningful difference. Correlation between the difference with the demographic data, preoperative radiologic alignment and intraoperative data was analysed. For statistical analysis, ANOVA and Pearson's correlation test were used. The gaps in patella eversion demonstrated smaller gaps both in knee extension and flexion position compared to the gaps of patella reduction position. The amount of decreased gaps was more definite in knee flexion position. Statistically significant difference was observed for the lateral gap of patella eversion compared to gap of patella reduction in knee flexion position (p < 0.05). There were notable cases of variability in knee flexion position. Significant portion of 12 (24 %) knees of patella subluxation and 33 (66 %) knees of patella evertion demonstrated either increased or decreased gaps in knee flexion position compared to the gaps of patella reduction position. The gaps in patella eversion demonstrated smaller gaps both in knee extension and flexion position compared to the gaps of patella reduction position. The amount of decreased gaps was more definite in knee flexion position. Therefore, the intraoperative patellar positioning has influence on the measurement of the joint gap. Keeping the patella in reduced position is important during gap balancing. I.\n"}]}]}}

Patients were divided into two groups, according to whether they had received an all-polyethylene inlay component (Inlay group) or a metal-backed onlay component (Onlay group). We explored the magnitude of mechanical alignment correction obtained in both groups. Mean postoperative mechanical alignment was significantly closer to neutral in the Onlay group (mean=2.8\u00b0; 95% CI=2.4\u00b0, 3.2\u00b0) compared to the Inlay group (mean=3.9\u00b0; 95% CI=3.4\u00b0, 4.4\u00b0) (R2=0.65; P=0.003), adjusting for gender, BMI, age, side and preoperative mechanical alignment (Fig. 2). Further exploration revealed that the thickness of the tibial polyethyelene insert had a significant effect on postoperative alignment when added to the model (R2=0.68; P=0.01). Patients who received a metal-backed Onlay tibial component obtained better postoperative mechanical alignment compared to those who received all-polyethylene Inlay prostheses.

Exact definition of the posterior tibial slope (PTS) requires lateral radiographs of the lower limb. Only lateral knee radiographs are routinely obtained after TKA, however. The purpose of the present study therefore was to analyse the relationship between PTS measurement results on short and expanded lateral knee radiographs. The PTS was measured on 100 consecutive lateral radiographs of the lower limb using the mechanical and three diaphyseal axes with various distances below the tibial plateau. Significant differences between PTS results were found for all three diaphyseal axes, with the smallest differences and the strongest correlation for a diaphyseal axis at 16 and 20\u00a0cm below the tibial plateau. Using short distances below the tibial plateau (6 and 10\u00a0cm) resulted in an overestimation of the PTS of 3\u00b0, on average.

All these variables were submitted to univariate and multivariate analysis to establish their impact on survival. Only tumour size appeared to be significantly different between the 3 groups. On univariate analysis, invasion of the perirenal fat, lymph node involvement, distant metastases and VEGF expression were significantly associated with survival (p < 0.01). On multivariate analysis, lymph node involvement, distant metastases and VEGF expression (OR 6.07) were identified as independent predictive factors of survival. Progression of a pT3 tumour into the renal vein and vena cava is not associated with increased tumour expression of VEGF. However, VEGF is an independent prognostic factor in this group of poor prognosis renal tumours.\n \nThe 2002 primary tumor classification for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) does not distinguish between patients with tumor thrombus involving the renal vein only and those with inferior vena cava tumor thrombus below the diaphragm. We evaluated the association of tumor thrombus level and fat invasion with outcome to determine if further subclassification would improve the prognostic accuracy of the current classification. We studied 675 patients treated with radical nephrectomy or nephron sparing surgery for pT3a (206, 30.5%), pT3b (422, 62.5%), pT3c (19, 2.8%) or pT4 (28, 4.2%) RCC at the Mayo Clinic between 1970 and 2000. Associations with outcome were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression. There were 531 deaths from RCC at a median of 1.5 years following nephrectomy. Patients with pT3b RCC and level I, II or III tumor thrombus were significantly more likely to die of RCC compared to patients with pT3b RCC and level 0 tumor thrombus (risk ratio 1.62, p <0.001). Patients with peripheral perinephric or renal sinus fat invasion were also more likely to die of RCC compared to patients without fat invasion (risk ratio 1.87, p <0.001). Therefore, patients with pT3 RCC were reclassified into 4 groups as thrombus level 0 without fat invasion, fat invasion only, thrombus level 0 with fat invasion or thrombus level I, II or III without fat invasion, and thrombus level I, II or III with fat invasion or thrombus level IV. This reclassification significantly improved prediction of death from RCC compared with the current classification (c indexes of 0.61 versus 0.55, respectively). Further subclassification of the primary tumor classification for patients with pT3 RCC improved prognostic accuracy.\n"}]}]}}

To describe common characteristics among young men who die from injury and poisoning. We employed a retrospective survey methodology to investigate factors associated with deaths by injury and poisoning among young men aged 15-39 years (n = 268) in Merseyside and Cheshire during 1995. Data were collected from Coroner's inquest notes and General Practitioner records. The most common cause of death was poisoning by alcohol and drugs (29.1%, n = 78). A high proportion of cases were unemployed (39.4%, n = 106). Cases were also more likely to be single compared to the general population (74.2% vs 55.5%). Self-destructive behaviour was evident in 77% of deaths (n = 206). Alcohol and drug use are important contributory factors to injury and poisoning deaths. More research is needed into the effects of unemployment and being single on the health of young men, and to investigate the motivations behind risk taking and self-destructive behaviour.\n \nThe incidence of HIV and STIs increased among men who have sex with men (MSM) visiting our STI clinic in Amsterdam. Interestingly, HIV increased mainly among older (> or =35 years) MSM, whereas infection rates of rectal gonorrhoea increased mainly in younger men. To explore this discrepancy we compared trends in STIs and HIV in a cohort of young HIV negative homosexual men from 1984 until 2002. The study population included 863 men enrolled at < or =30 years of age from 1984 onward in the Amsterdam Cohort Studies (ACS). They had attended at least one of the 6 monthly follow up ACS visits at which they completed a questionnaire (including self reported gonorrhoea and syphilis episodes) and were tested for syphilis and HIV. Yearly trends in HIV and STI incidence and risk factors were analysed using Poisson regression. Mean age at enrollment was 25 years. The median follow up time was 4 years. Until 1995 trends in HIV and STI incidence were concurrent, however since 1995 there was a significant (p<0.05) increase in syphilis (0 to 1.4/100 person years (PY)) and gonorrhoea incidence (1.1 to 6.0/100 PY), but no change in HIV incidence (1.1 and 1.3/100 PY). The incidence of syphilis and gonorrhoea has increased among young homosexual men since 1995, while HIV incidence has remained stable. Increasing STI incidence underscores the potential for HIV spread among young homosexual men. However, several years of increasing STIs without HIV, makes the relation between STI incidence and HIV transmission a subject for debate.\n"}]}]}}

This approach is controversial, with critics highlighting the temporary nature of remissions and the potential for adverse effects. There have been few reports of the long-term outcome of those patients who do respond. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical outcome of all patients treated with cyclosporin at our institution over the past five years. We conducted a retrospective study of 46 patients who presented to a tertiary referral center. Initial responders were those who avoided colectomy; a sustained response was defined as a remission that lasted while the patient was taking oral cyclosporin and for three months after this therapy was discontinued. Thirty-two (69 percent) of 46 patients had an initial response to therapy, and 50 percent met criteria for a sustained response. Eleven of 23 sustained responders subsequently relapsed. At a mean of 22 months' follow-up, 26 percent of patients remain well and have never relapsed. Serious infective complications occurred in two patients, possibly attributable to therapy. No factors predictive of a likely response were identifiable on retrospective analysis. This study confirms the efficacy of cyclosporin in the management of severe ulcerative colitis. Although many initial responders subsequently relapse, such patients may benefit from having even a short time to adjust to the need for surgery. A substantial minority (26 percent) of all patients treated remain in long-term remission.\n \nTo determine whether successful completion of the Perinatal Education Programme (PEP) improves obstetric practice. The three midwife obstetric units (MOUs) in a health district of Mpumalanga were included in the study. Two MOUs enrolled in the PEP and the third did not. A 'before-and-after' study design was used to assess any changes in practice, and to monitor whether any changes occurred in the district during the time of the study; data were also collected at the third MOU. Data were collected by scoring of the obstetric files after the patient had delivered. We ascertained whether the obstetric history, syphilis testing, blood group testing, haemoglobin measurement and uterine growth assessment were performed during antenatal care along with whether appropriate action was taken. For intrapartum care, estimation of fetal weight, the performance of pelvimetry, blood pressure monitoring, urine testing, evaluation of head above pelvis, fetal heart rate monitoring, monitoring of contractions and plotting of cervical dilatation, and whether the appropriate actions were taken, were assessed. Eight of the 13 midwives at the two MOUs completed the PEP and all demonstrated an improvement in knowledge. Case notes of 303 patients from the various clinics were studied. There was no change in the referral patterns of any of the clinics during the study period. The obstetric history was well documented, but in no group was there a satisfactory response to a detected problem; appropriate action was taken in between 0% and 12% of cases. Syphilis testing was performed in 56-82% of cases, with no difference between the groups. The haemoglobin level was measured in only 4-15% of patients, with no difference before or after completion of the PEP. Where a problem in uterine growth was detected, an appropriate response occurred in 0-8% of patients and no difference before or after completion of the PEP was ascertained. In all groups, estimation of fetal weight and pelvimetry were seldom performed, the urine and fetal heart rate documentation were moderately well done and the blood pressure monitoring, assessment of head above pelvis, monitoring of contractions and plotting of cervical dilatation were usually performed. No differences before or after the PEP were detected. Where problems were detected, appropriate actions taken during labour improved, but not significantly. Completion of the obstetric manual of the PEP improved the knowledge of the midwives but no alteration in practice was detected.\n"}]}]}}

In earlier work from this unit, we used correlations between autoCPAP pressure and both OSA severity and obesity, to construct an algorithm to estimate the fixed CPAP pressure a patient required for subsequent clinical use. We wished to discover if these relationships could be reliably extended to a much more obese group. We performed a prospective cohort study in an obese population. Measurements of obesity were made, OSA severity was recorded, and the 95th centile autoCPAP pressure was recorded during 1\u00a0week of autoCPAP. Spearman's rank correlation was performed between measurements of obesity and autoCPAP pressure, and between OSA severity and autoCPAP pressure. Fifty-four obese individuals (median body mass index (BMI) 43.0\u00a0kg/m(2)), 52\u00a0% of whom had OSA (apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI)\u2009\u2265\u200915), had a median 95th centile autoCPAP pressure of 11.8\u2009cmH2O. We found no significant correlation between autoCPAP pressure and neck circumference, waist circumference or BMI. There was a moderate correlation between autoCPAP pressure and OSA severity (AHI r\u2009=\u20090.34, p\u2009=\u20090.02; oxygen desaturation index (ODI) r\u2009=\u20090.48, p\u2009<\u20090.001). In this population, neither BMI nor neck circumference nor waist circumference is predictive of autoCPAP pressure. Therefore, the previously derived algorithm does not adequately predict the fixed CPAP pressure for subsequent clinical use in these obese individuals. In addition, some subjects without OSA generated high autoCPAP pressures, and thus, the correlation between OSA severity and autoCPAP pressure was only moderate.\n \nTo investigate polysomnographic and anthropomorphic factors predicting need of high optimal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Retrospective data analysis. Three hundred fifty-three consecutive obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients who had a successful manual CPAP titration in our sleep disorders unit. The mean optimal CPAP was 9.5 +/- 2.4 cm H2O. The optimal CPAP pressure increases with an increase in OSA severity from 7.79 +/- 2.2 in the mild, to 8.7 +/- 1.8 in the moderate, and to 10.1 +/- 2.3 cm H2O in the severe OSA group. A high CPAP was defined as the mean + 1 standard deviation (SD; > or =12 cm H2O). The predictor variables included apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), age, sex, body mass index (BMI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT). High CPAP was required in 2 (6.9%), 6 (5.8%), and 63 (28.6%) patients with mild, moderate, and severe OSA, respectively. On univariate analysis, AHI, BMI, ESS score, and the proportion of males were significantly higher in those needing high CPAP. They also have a lower MSLT mean. On logistic regression, the use of high CPAP was 5.90 times more frequent (95% confidence interval 2.67-13.1) in severe OSA patients after adjustment for the other variables. The area under the receiver operator curve was 72.4%, showing that the model was adequate. Severe OSA patients are much more likely to need high CPAP levels. However, because of the low positive predictive value (only 28.6%), the clinical value of such information is limited. ESS and MSLT did not increase the predictive value for the need for high CPAP.\n"}]}]}}

Risks for sonographic short cervical length and recurrent SPTB were compared between women based on the clinical presentation of their prior preterm birth. Log-linear regression was used to control for confounders. Of 522 patients included in this study, 96 (18.4%) had prior ACD, 246 (47.1%) had prior PPROM, and 180 (34.5%) had prior PTL. Recurrent PTB occurred in 55.2% of patients with a history of ACD compared with 27.2% of those with PPROM and 32.2% with PTL (P = .001).

The odds ratio of preterm birth among bacterial vaginosis-positive versus bacterial vaginosis-negative women ranged from 1.1 to 1.6 and did not vary significantly according to the gestational age at which bacterial vaginosis was screened. The odds ratio for preterm birth did not vary significantly by gestational age at diagnosis when bacterial vaginosis was subdivided into Gram stain score 7 to 8 or 9 to 10.

Because lysosomotropic amines can suppress major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigen presentation, their mechanism of action is potentially different from current immune suppressant drugs used to control GVHD such as cyclosporine. We investigated the use of cyclosporine and the lysosomotropic amines chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in combination for additive or synergistic immunosuppression on T-cell responses in vitro to MiHC and MHC in mice. We found that similar concentrations of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine suppress the T-cell response to MiHC in mice (C57BL/6 anti-BALB.B) and that lysosomotropic amines in combination with cyclosporine result in synergistic suppression of a proliferative response to MiHC. Similar suppression and synergy appear to be present in an alloreactive response (C57BL/6 anti-BALB/c). Direct inhibition by chloroquine of T-cell proliferative responses induced by anti-CD3epsilon in the absence of antigen-presenting cells is present at higher concentrations than that required to suppress responses to MiHC or MHC. Chloroquine appears to induce decreased T-cell viability at high concentrations. This effect does not appear to be due to decreased T-cell production of interleukin-2 or interferon-gamma. At lower concentrations (<25 microg/ml), chloroquine can also decrease the ability of antigen-presenting cells to stimulate an a C57BL/6 anti-BALB/c T-cell response and can inhibit MHC class II expression after activation with lipopolysaccharide. Lysosomotropic amines in combination with cyclosporine appear to be synergistic in the suppression of T-cell proliferation to MiHC and MHC. Use of chloroquine in combination with cyclosporine may result in improved control of GVHD.\n \nAn association between posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) and cyclosporine A (CsA) and OKT3 has often been postulated on the basis of retrospective studies, although a randomized study with PTLD as the endpoint will probably never be performed. Because focus on PTLD coincided with the use of these drugs, a bias could be suspected. In a retrospective, nonrandomized study, we reevaluated all lymphoma-like lesions arising in kidney-transplant patients grafted at our center during 1969 to 1998 and observed up to 2002. Case pathology was reviewed, and an association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection (and latency pattern) was assessed. We did not find any significant difference in the incidence of PTLDs when comparing the prednisolone/azathioprine, and CsA eras (P=0.89), the periods before or after OKT3 (P=0.61), and those before or after antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) (P=0.22). Occurrence time was shorter in the CsA (P=0.059), OKT3 (P=0.007), and ALG (P=0.007) eras. In the OKT3 era, 182 patients received, and 224 did not receive, OKT3; after the same observation time, there had been eight and five PTLDs, respectively (P=0.34). The use of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) was associated with a reduction in the number of PTLDs (P=0.01). EBV was detected in 16 of 21 (76%) cases. We found no evidence to implicate any one drug regime preferentially in the development of PTLDs. The risk of developing PTLD seems to be a result of the whole transplantation process, which includes the antigenicity of the foreign graft, the immunosuppression resulting in inadequate cytotoxic T-cell activity, and the result of EBV infection. An important minority of cases are EBV negative.\n"}]}]}}

The analysis is based on 122 of 143 previously untreated patients with NPC treated with radiation therapy at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center between 1983 and 1992. Excluded were 4 patients treated with palliative intent, 4 children, 12 patients not staged with CT, and 1 patient who died of a cerebrovascular accident prior to completion of treatment. The stage distribution was as follows The overall actuarial 2- and 5-year survival rates were 78 and 68%, respectively. Forty-nine patients (40%) had disease recurrence. Thirty-three (27%) had local regional failures; 19 at the primary site only, 8 in the neck and 6 in both. Local failure occurred in 31% of patients staged T4 compared to 13% of T1-T3 (p = 0.007). Sixteen patients failed at distant sites alone. Among Stage IV patients the 5-year actuarial rates for patients who did and did not receive induction chemotherapy were as follows While not providing conclusive evidence, this single institution experience suggests that neoadjuvant chemotherapy for Stage IV NPC patients improves both survival and disease control. Recurrence within the irradiated volume was the most prevalent mode of failure and future studies will evaluate regimens to enhance local regional control.\n \nPatients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) eligible for extrapleural pneumonectomy (EPP) may benefit from induction chemotherapy (CT) as historically described, or from induction-accelerated hemithoracic intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) as a potential alternative. However, the impact of the type of induction therapy on postoperative morbidity and mortality remains unknown. We performed a retrospective study including every patient who underwent EPP for MPM in our institution between January 2001 and December 2014. Patients without induction treatment (n = 7) or undergoing both induction CT and IMRT (n = 2) were then excluded. The remaining patients (study group) were divided according to the type of induction treatment in Group 1-CT and Group 2-IMRT. Major complications were defined by complications of Grade 3 or higher according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 4.0 guidelines. Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion was analysed as a number of packs, and dichotomized as <3 vs \u22653 packs. Plasma and platelet transfusion were analysed as a number of units, and dichotomized as no transfusion versus any plasma or platelet transfusion. Altogether, 126 patients (mean age 61.3 \u00b1 8.1 years, males 82.5%, right side 60.3%, 90-day mortality rate 4.8%) accounted for the study group. Sixty-four patients were included in Group 1-CT and 62 patients were included in Group 2-IMRT. When compared with Group 1-CT, Group 2-IMRT was characterized by older patients (59.3 \u00b1 9.2 vs 63.3 \u00b1 8.3 years, P = 0.012), more right-sided resections (46.8 vs 74.1%, P = 0.003), more advanced disease (pathological stage IV In this large single-centre series of EPP for MPM, the implementation of induction IMRT was not associated with any significant increase in the surgical risks above and beyond induction CT.

Age at presentation, physical examination, ultrasonographic and intraoperative findings were recorded. Patients were followed after initial surgical intervention to determine the likelihood of developing a subsequent hydrocele or hernia. Thirty-seven patients were identified as presenting with neonatal torsion. Age of presentation averaged 3.5 days (range 1-14 days). Left-sided pathology was seen more commonly than the right, with a 25:12 distribution. All torsed testicles were nonviable. Twenty-two patients were noted to have a contralateral hydrocele at presentation. All hydroceles were opened through a scrotal approach at the time of contralateral scrotal fixation. No patient underwent an inguinal exploration to examine for a patent process vaginalis. None of the patients who presented with a hydrocele have developed a clinical hydrocele or hernia after an average 7.5 years (range 4.3-11.2) follow-up. We have demonstrated that approaching a contralateral hydrocele in cases of neonatal testicular torsion solely through a scrotal incision is safe and effective. Inguinal exploration was not performed in our study and our long-term results demonstrate that such an approach would have brought no additional benefit. In avoiding an inguinal approach we did not subject our patients to unnecessary risk of testicular or vasal injury. Contralateral hydrocele is commonly seen in cases of neonatal testicular torsion. In our experience this is a condition of minimal clinical significance and does not warrant formal inguinal exploration for treatment. This conservative management strategy minimizes the potential of contralateral spermatic cord injury in the neonate. The aims of the study were met.\n \nThe absence of a testis occurs for various reasons in children, but testicular prosthesis implantation in children is uncommon. The optimal time for prosthesis placement is still unclear, and its complication rate has been poorly studied in children. The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors of complications in cases of testicular prosthesis implantation in children. A monocentric, retrospective review was performed of children implanted with a testicular prosthesis between 2008 and 2014. All implantations were performed through an inguinal incision with a standardized procedure. Children were divided into two groups depending on the interval after orchiectomy Twenty-six patients (A, 15; B, 11) had a total of 38 testicular prostheses placements. Mean follow-up was 36.2 months. First surgery was performed at the mean age of 11.8 years (range 0-17.9) (A, 14.1; B, 8.1; P\u00a0=\u00a00.01) and testicular prosthesis implantation at the mean age of 14.7 years (range 9-18) (A, 14.3; B, 14.6) with a mean delay of 36.1 months (A, 1.3; B, 80.3). Indications were mainly spermatic cord torsion (27%), bilateral anorchia (27%), and testicular atrophy after cryptorchidism surgery (19.2%). Complications (10.5%) included two cases of extrusion, one infection and one migration. Patient 1 had a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia with testicle relapse 2 years after induction therapy. High-dose chemotherapy, total body irradiation and bilateral orchiectomies were performed, and bilateral prostheses were implanted 12 years after the end of chemotherapy. Complications happened 85 days after surgery. Patient 2 was followed-up for a proximal hypospadias. The tunica vaginalis flap, which was used during a redo urethroplasty, lead to testicular atrophy. Thirteen years after the last penile surgery, a testicular prosthesis was placed through an inguinal incision, and extrusion occurred 203 days after surgery. Bacterial cultures of the prostheses were sterile and histological review showed no sign of granuloma or graft rejection. The complication rate was significantly higher if the delay between the two surgeries exceeded 1 year (P\u00a0=\u00a00.01). Indications of orchiectomy, prior scrotal incision, and prosthesis size were not risk factors. Testicular prosthesis implantation was relatively safe in a pediatric cohort. The complication rate was significantly higher if the delay between the orchiectomy and the prosthetic placement exceeded 1 year. These results suggest that reducing the delay between orchiectomy and prosthesis implantation may lead to fewer complications.\n"}]}]}}

We examined the proportion of correct answers pre- and post-intervention, direction of change in answers, and differences between professional groups. System use resulted in a 21% improvement in clinicians' answers, from 29% (95% confidence interval [CI] 25.4-32.6) correct pre- to 50% (95% CI 46.0-54.0) post-system use.

Adult patients with chronic anal fissure were randomly assigned to undergo lateral internal sphincterotomy to the level of the dentate line or to the level of the fissure apex. The patients were reexamined on postoperative Days 1, 7, 14, 28, and then at 2 and 12 months. The time required for relief of pain postoperatively was 2.08 +/- 1.44 days in the dentate line group, which was significantly shorter than that for the fissure apex group (4.72 +/- 4.86 days; P = 0.002). Objective healing was achieved in 23.7 percent and 17.6 percent at 14 days, 97.4 percent and 88.2 percent at 28 days, and 100 percent and 97.7 percent at 2 months in the dentate line and fissure apex groups, respectively (P > 0.05 for all comparisons).

A prospective study conducted in the department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh in which all the cases presenting with the features of allergic fungal sinusitis (AFS) between January 2000 and January 2005 were enrolled. These cases were divided into two groups, group 1 comprised of cases with age less than 15 years and group 2 with age more than 15 years. Detailed history, physical examination and nasal endoscopic examination and computed tomography (CT) scan of the paranasal sinuses was done in all the cases. The cases with prior history of sinonasal surgery were excluded from the study. All patients refractory to medical management were subjected to endoscopic sinus surgery. All the cases were followed up for a period ranging from 6 to 39 months to see for the recurrence. The data of both the groups was analysed statistically using chi square test. The study population comprised of 200 cases, with 68 cases in group 1 and 132 cases in group 2. The most common symptom in both the groups was presence of nasal obstruction. The children had higher incidence of having unilateral disease (46 out of 68) compared with adults, where it was 38 out of 132. The bony erosion was seen more often in group 1. Surgery was done endoscopically in all the cases. The intra orbital or intra cranial extension was seen in 58 cases of group 1 and 47 cases of group 2 (p<0.001). Recurrence was seen in 18 (15 with intraorbital and 3 with intracranial extension) cases in group 1 and 13 cases (11 with intraorbital and 2 with intracranial extension) in group 2 (p<0.005). In our study, we found a higher incidence of facial deformities, proptosis, intraorbital/intracranial extension and a higher rate of recurrence in group 1, therefore, suggesting a more aggressive nature of AFS in children than adults mandating an early diagnosis, proper management and regular follow up in these cases.\n"}]}]}}

In general, serum BMP-7 values of patients were higher than those of controls (p = 0.001). Serum BMP-7 values of patients with liver fibrosis of stages 1, 2, 3, or 4 were higher than control values (all p values = 0.01), but the serum BMP-7 levels of patients with stage 5 fibrosis were similar to that of controls. Associations between fibrosis stage and the serum levels of BMP-7, ALT, HBVDNA, platelets, and albumin were all statistically significant (p = 0.001). The AUROC for the BMP-7 level in advanced stage fibrosis was found to be 0.23. The data were analyzed using the binary logistic regression analysis (backward stepwise method) and BMP-7, HBVDNA, and platelet levels were found to be risk factors associated with fibrosis (p values 0.031, 0.040, and 0.001, respectively).

To investigate the effect of a multimodal cervical physical therapy treatment on tinnitus complaints in patients with CST. Randomized controlled trial.

NCT02016313.\n \nTraditionally, tinnitus accompanied by hemifacial spasm has been considered a type of hyperactive neurovascular compression syndrome that is similar to hemifacial spasm alone because of the anatomically close relationship between the facial nerve and cochlear nerve as well as the hyperactive clinical nature. Participants were 29 subjects who presented with hemifacial spasm and neuroradiological evidence of vascular compression of the cranial (facial/cochlear) nerve. We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to estimate the activity of the cochlear nerve in patients with and without tinnitus on the ipsilateral side. We compared the difference in the latency and the ratio of the equivalent current dipole (ECD) strength between the ipsilateral and contralateral sides of the spasm and tinnitus. Cochlear nerve activity in patients with tinnitus was increased with a shorter latency (p\u2009=\u20090.016) and stronger ECD strength (p\u2009=\u20090.028) compared with patients without tinnitus. The MEG results from normal-hearing patients who had tinnitus accompanied by hemifacial spasm suggest that the hyperactivity of the auditory central nervous system may be a crucial pathophysiological factor in the generation of tinnitus in these patients. The neurovascular compression that causes sensory input from the pathologic facial nerve activity may contribute to this hyperactivity of the central auditory nervous system.\n"}]}]}}

There are very few studies which looked at detailed sputum and blood cell counts in a large cohort of asthmatics divided into inflammatory phenotypes. The purpose of this study was to analyze sputum cell counts, blood leukocytes and systemic inflammatory markers in these phenotypes, and investigate how those groups compared with healthy subjects. We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study on 833 asthmatics recruited from the University Asthma Clinic of Liege and compared them with 194 healthy subjects. Asthmatics were classified into inflammatory phenotypes. The total non-squamous cell count per gram of sputum was greater in mixed granulocytic and neutrophilic phenotypes as compared to eosinophilic, paucigranulocytic asthma and healthy subjects (p\u2009<\u20090.005). Sputum eosinophils (in absolute values and percentages) were increased in all asthma phenotypes including paucigranulocytic asthma, compared to healthy subjects (p\u2009<\u20090.005). Eosinophilic asthma showed higher absolute sputum neutrophil and lymphocyte counts than healthy subjects (p\u2009<\u20090.005), while neutrophilic asthmatics had a particularly low number of sputum macrophages and epithelial cells. All asthma phenotypes showed an increased blood leukocyte count compared to healthy subjects (p\u2009<\u20090.005), with paucigranulocytic asthmatics having also increased absolute blood eosinophils compared to healthy subjects (p\u2009<\u20090.005). Neutrophilic asthma had raised CRP and fibrinogen while eosinophilic asthma only showed raised fibrinogen compared to healthy subjects (p\u2009<\u20090.005). This study demonstrates that a significant eosinophilic inflammation is present across all categories of asthma, and that paucigranulocytic asthma may be seen as a low grade inflammatory disease.\n \nThe guidelines for asthma recommend that the use of anti-inflammatory therapy should be adapted to the severity of the disease. However, few data are available to assess the adequacy of the use of drugs and its influence on the control of asthma in 'real life'. The adequacy of the current use of anti-asthmatic medication according to the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines was assessed in a random sample of 400 asthmatics identified in the frame of the Italian Study on Asthma in Young Adults. Asthma severity was assessed using the GINA criteria; accordingly, a patient was classified as receiving inadequate treatment if his/her current use of drugs was lower than that suggested by the guidelines for the corresponding severity level. The absence of asthma attacks in the last 3 months was used as an indicator of the disease control. Fifty-five percent of the patients had persistent asthma. Overall, 48% (95% CI 41.2-54.8) of persistent asthmatics were receiving inadequate treatment, and 66% (95% CI 59.5-72.4) had not used their medication daily over the past 3 months. Persistent asthmatics who were inadequately treated had a significantly greater frequency of asthma attacks (geometric mean ratio 3.7; 95% CI 2.1-6.6) than those using an adequate dose of medication. Mild and moderate persistent asthmatics using an adequate medication regimen reported a low number of asthma attacks (median 0). At the multivariate analysis, a good control of the disease was positively associated with an adequate dose of anti-inflammatory medication (OR = 2.2; 95% CI 1.1-4.5) and was negatively associated with a later onset of asthma (OR = 0.96; 95% CI 0.93-0.99) and severe asthma (OR = 0.37; 95% CI 0.17-0.81). Despite the increase in the use of inhaled corticosteroids, half of the persistent asthmatics from the general population are using a medication regimen below their severity level. When the use of drugs follows the GINA guideline recommendations, a good control of asthma is also achievable in the daily management of the disease, particularly in the case of mild and moderate asthmatics.\n"}]}]}}

The SG included 15 men and 15 women (mean age There was a statistically significant differ - ence in the characterization of RC FI between the sagittal and coronal planes in the setting of a large or massive tear, likely related to incomplete visualization of the musculature on sagittal imaging secondary to muscle and tendon retrac - tion and more complete visualization on coronal imaging. Awareness of this difference may allow for a more accurate characterization of the degree of fatty infiltration.\n"}]}]}}

Samples were obtained from 133 individuals, 18 men and 115 women, using imprints of each hand on blood agar and a swab from the nose. S. aureus isolates were identified by standard methods and typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. S. aureus was found on the hands of 16.7% of the men and 9.6% of the women, and in the noses of 33.3% of the men and 17.4% of the women. The risk ratio for S. aureus carriage on the hands with nasal carriage was 7.4 (95% confidence interval, 2.7 to 20.2; P < .001). Among the 14 HCWs carrying S. aureus on their hands, strain likeness to the nasal isolate was documented for 7 (50%). Half of the HCWs acquired S. aureus on the hands from patients or the environment and half did so by apparent self-inoculation from the nose. Regardless of the source of contamination, good compliance with hand hygiene is needed from all HCWs to protect patients from nosocomial infections. The moderate rate of S. aureus carriage on hands in this setting could be the result of the routine use of alcoholic hand antisepsis.\n"}]}]}}

The median follow-up was 2.67 years in patients exposed to insulin glargine. Absolute event rates for all cancer in patients exposed to glargine versus other basal insulin users were 1,622 and 1,643 per 100,000 person-years, respectively. No significant association was observed between glargine exposure and overall cancer incidence after adjustment for sex, with a hazard ratio of 0.97 (95% CI 0.87-1.07), or after additional adjustment for any other hypoglycemic agent use and duration of diabetes. No increased risk of breast cancer was observed for glargine users compared with other basal insulins users, with a fully adjusted hazard ratio of 1.08 (0.72-1.62). In a large cohort of patients newly treated by basal insulin, no increased risk of any cancer was observed in insulin glargine users compared with other basal insulin users.

This study therefore prospectively assesses the impact of position emission tomography scanning on the management of primary rectal cancer. Forty-six patients with advanced primary rectal cancer referred for consideration of adjuvant preoperative therapy underwent position emission tomography scanning. The referring physicians prospectively recorded each patient's stage following conventional imaging and the proposed treatment plan prior to position emission tomography scanning. This was then compared with subsequent stage and actual management implemented, and the appropriateness of position emission tomography-induced changes was noted by subsequent clinical follow-up. The surgical management of 36 of 46 patients (78 percent) was unchanged as a result of position emission tomography, even though position emission tomography upstaged disease in 3 of 36 cases (8 percent) and downstaged disease in 5 of 36 cases (14 percent). In 8 of 46 cases (17 percent), management was altered because of the position emission tomography scan findings, including 6 cases (13 percent) in which surgery was cancelled and 2 other cases (4 percent) in which the radiotherapy field was changed. Where available, follow-up confirmed the appropriateness of position emission tomography-induced management change in each case. Two patients had a change in therapy independent of the position emission tomography scan due to clinical circumstances. Overall tumor stage was changed following position emission tomography in 18 of 46 patients (39 percent). Position emission tomography scanning appears to accurately change the stage or appropriately alter the therapy of almost a third of patients with advanced primary rectal cancer. In view of this, we suggest that position emission tomography scanning be considered part of standard workup for such patients, particularly if neoadjuvant chemoradiation is being considered as part of primary management.\n \nCompared with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) may have additional value in the assessment of primary and recurrent cervical cancer.

The method used for estimating the FiN2O is based on one employed to calculate the FiO2 obtained with a nasal cannula. We assume a tidal volume of 500 ml, a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, an inspiratory time of 1 second, an expiratory time of 2 seconds, and an anatomic reservoir volume of 50 ml. The reservoir consists of the nose, the nasopharynx, and the oropharynx. Its volume is assumed to be one-third of the anatomic dead space. It is also assumed that during the last 0.5 second of expiration, there is negligible flow of expired respiratory gases. A 6 L/min flow from the cannula will completely fill the reservoir. The FiO2 or FiN2O is then calculated by assuming that during the 1 second inspiratory time period, the gases in the anatomic reservoir that are provided by the nasal cannula and a volume of air such that the sum of the components of the tidal volume equals 500 ml are inspired. Research laboratory of a university-affiliated metropolitan medical center. The calculated FiO2 values for 100% oxygen delivered by nasal cannula agree with those determined by others. The FiN2Os estimated were directly proportional to the cannula flow rate and the fraction of N2O delivered. At the maximum total flow rate considered, 6L/min flow, with 70% N2O (remainder O2) delivered to the nasal cannula, an FiN2O of only 0.21 was estimated due to the large volume of air inspired. The FiO2 under these conditions would only be 0.23. Our analysis shows that the maximum FiN2O achievable by using a nasal cannula is limited to 0.21 even with a 6 L/min flow of 70% N2O for the defined respiratory parameters.\n"}]}]}}

Published government tobacco tax documentation and statistics published by the Chinese STMA are used to analyse the interrelations among industry profits, taxes and retail price of cigarettes in China. The 2009 excise tax increase on cigarettes in China has not translated into higher retail prices because the Chinese STMA used its policy authority to ensure that retail cigarette prices did not change. The government tax increase is being collected at both the producer and wholesale levels. As a result, the 2009 excise tax increase in China has resulted in higher tax revenue for the government and lower profits for the tobacco industry, with no increase in the retail price of cigarettes for consumers. Numerous studies have found that taxation is one of the most effective policy instruments for tobacco control. However, these findings come from countries that have market economies where market forces determine prices and influence how cigarette taxes are passed to the consumers in retail prices. China's tobacco industry is not a market economy; therefore, non-market forces and the current Chinese tobacco monopoly system determine cigarette prices. The result is that tax increases do not necessarily get passed on to the retail price.\n \nThe tobacco industry claims that illicit cigarette trade in South Africa is high and rising. This is often used as an argument not to increase the tobacco excise tax or to regulate tobacco products. To determine how the tobacco industry's estimates of the size of the illicit cigarette market have changed over time. Published media articles were obtained from South African Press Cuttings; published articles and press releases were sourced from the internet. The period of interest is 1990-2012. Between 1990 and 2012 we found 90 newspaper articles and press statements that emphasised the tobacco industry's view on illicit trade. Articles that reported on action taken against illicit trade were excluded. Between 2006 and early 2011 the Tobacco Institute of Southern Africa, a body representing the interests of large cigarette companies, reported that South Africa's illicit cigarette market share was 20%. This share increased to 25% in late 2011 and 30% in 2012. In a 2012 presentation by Tobacco Institute of Southern Africa to National Treasury the illicit market share in 2008 was indicated as 7.9%, compared with claims in that year that the illicit market share was 20%. Industry findings that the illicit market decreased in 2007 and 2008 were not reported in the press. The tobacco industry has adjusted previous estimates of the illicit trade share downwards to create the impression that illicit trade is high and rising. If previous estimates by the tobacco industry were incorrect the credibility of current estimates should be questioned.\n"}]}]}}

We termed this finding \"vertical lines in esophageal mucosa\" (VLEM). We examined the relationship between the presence of VLEM and significant histologic changes in esophageal mucosal biopsies. Between January 1, 1992, and August 31, 1994, the senior author (JFF) performed 255 esophageal biopsies. The procedure reports, available endoscopic photographs, and histology reports were reviewed to establish the endoscopic and histologic appearance of the esophageal mucosa. Intraepithelial cells were counted in a blind review of 42 randomly selected biopsies. The esophageal mucosa had a normal appearance on 160 endoscopic studies (Group 1) and VLEM were the only mucosal abnormalities in 41 endoscopies (Group 2). Histology was normal in 92 of 160 biopsies (57.5%) from Group 1, and 1 of 41 biopsies (2.4%) from Group 2. Most patients in Group 2 had eosinophilic esophagitis (34 of 41, 83%, specificity 0.85, sensitivity 0.5, p > 0.001) which was of moderate to severe intensity (31 of 34, 91.2%, specificity 0.88, sensitivity 0.73, p < 0.001). Histology usually demonstrated moderate to severe inflammation when VLEM were present. VLEM may be a highly specific endoscopic feature of esophagitis in children.\n \nMucosal breaks induced by gastroesophageal reflux of gastric contents were more frequently found on the right anterior wall of the lower esophagus. Bleeding from esophageal varices may be also derived from gastroesophageal reflux. The circumferential location of the ruptured esophageal varices was evaluated to elucidate the relationship between gastroesophageal reflux and variceal rupture. Between January 2004 and December 2006, 26 patients who had primary bleeding from esophageal varices and 74 patients without evidence of bleeding with positive red color signs on varices were enrolled in this study retrospectively. Locations of bleeding spots and nonbleeding red color signs of esophageal varices were retrospectively evaluated by endoscopic photographs, and the relationship between the location of red color signs and the risk of bleeding was evaluated. Other possible predictors for bleeding were also investigated by multivariate regression analysis. Red color signs were frequently found in the right posterior wall of the lower esophagus. However, bleeding spots of esophageal varices were more frequently seen in the right anterior side (64.0%) than in others. The positive predictor for bleeding from esophageal varices was the presence of red color sign in the right anterior wall of the esophagus, and the administration of proton pomp inhibitor was the negative predictor. Gastroesophageal acid reflex may be a risk factor of bleeding from esophageal varices. Attention should be paid to the circumferential location of red color signs in endoscopic screening of patients with esophageal varices to predict future bleeding.\n"}]}]}}

Although most published evidence has failed to support this hypothesis, this concept remains firmly embedded in clinical practice and often prevents patients and professionals from optimizing overnight insulin. Previous observational data found lower fasting glucose was associated with nocturnal hypoglycaemia, but did not assess the probability of infrequent individual episodes of rebound hypoglycaemia. We analysed continuous glucose monitoring data to explore its prevalence. We analysed data from 89 patients with Type 1 diabetes who participated in the UK Hypoglycaemia study. We compared fasting capillary glucose following nights with and without nocturnal hypoglycaemia (sensor glucose < 3.5 mmol/l). Fasting capillary blood glucose was lower after nights with hypoglycaemia than without [5.5 (3.0) vs. 14.5 (4.5) mmol/l, P < 0.0001], and was lower on nights with more severe nocturnal hypoglycaemia [5.5 (3.0) vs. 8.2 (2.3) mmol/l; P = 0.018 on nights with nadir sensor glucose of < 2.2 mmol/l vs. 3.5 mmol/l]. There were only two instances of fasting capillary blood glucose > 10 mmol/l after nocturnal hypoglycaemia, both after likely treatment of the episode. When fasting capillary blood glucose is < 5 mmol/l, there was evidence of nocturnal hypoglycaemia on 94% of nights. Our data indicate that, in clinical practice, the Somogyi effect is rare. Fasting capillary blood glucose \u2264 5 mmol/l appears an important indicator of preceding silent nocturnal hypoglycaemia.\n \nExtracranial internal carotid artery stenosis is a risk factor for perioperative stroke in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery (CAB). Although selective and non-selective methods of preoperative carotid screening have been advocated, it remains unclear if this screening is clinically relevant. To test whether selective carotid screening is as effective as non-selective screening in detecting significant carotid disease. The case records of patients consecutively undergoing CAB were reviewed. Patients were stratified retrospectively into high- or low-risk groups according to risk factors for significant carotid stenosis and perioperative stroke Overall, 205 consecutive patients underwent preoperative carotid screening. The prevalence of significant carotid stenosis was 5.8%. Univariate analysis confirmed that PVD (P=0.005), carotid bruit (P=0.003) and diabetes mellitus (P=0.05) were significant risk factors for stenosis. Carotid stenosis was a risk factor for stroke (P=0.03). Prevalence of carotid stenosis was higher in the high-risk group (9.1%) than the low-risk group (1.2%) (P<0.05). All concomitant or staged carotid endarterectomies/CAB (5/205) and all patients who had perioperative strokes (5/205) were in the high-risk group (P=0.01). In our cohort, selective screening of patients aged >70 years, with carotid bruit, a history of cerebrovascular disease, diabetes mellitus or PVD would have reduced the screening load by 40%, with trivial impact on surgical management or neurological outcomes.\n"}]}]}}

All available preoperative contrast enemas (n = 61) had been single blind reviewed by the same radiologist who defined the radiographic transition zone when present in vertebral level. Four groups were determined (rectal, rectosigmoid, long segment, and absence of transition zone) and by Kappa coefficient of agreement correlated to the length of aganglionosis in the pathological report. Radiological findings were concordant with the specimen in pathology in 8 cases of 19 in rectal form (42 %), in 20 cases of 35 in rectosigmoid form (57 %), in all 6 cases of long-segment form (100 %), in the 2 cases of total colonic form (100 %) with a global agreement of 58.1 %, \u03ba = 0.39 CI [0.24; 0.57].

We investigated the incidence of subtrochanteric fracture in a consecutive series of 304 patients and its association with screw entry point in the lateral femoral cortex. A retrospective consecutive case series of patients treated with internal fixation for intracapsular hip fracture by our unit between January 2003 and January 2010 were included. Two authors reviewed radiographs independently to determine distal screw entry point in the lateral femoral cortex. Hickey zone 1 was an entry point above the level of the upper border of the lesser trochanter. Hickey zone 2 was defined as an entry point between the upper and lower borders of the lesser trochanter. Hickey zone 3 was an entry point below the lower border of the lesser trochanter. Clinical notes were reviewed for subsequent subtrochanteric fracture. Association between subtrochanteric fracture and distal screw entry point in the lateral femoral cortex in relation to the upper border of the lesser trochanter was determined. Two hundred and fifty-six post-operative radiographs were available for analysis. Mean patient age was 73 years (30\u201398), 75% were women. There were 24 patients with screw entry point in Hickey zone 1, 225 in Hickey zone 2, and 7 in Hickey zone 3. Two patients sustained subtrochanteric fracture. No subtrochanteric fractures occurred in patients with Hickey zone two-screw entry. Subtrochanteric fracture is rare following cannulated screw fixation of intracapsular neck of femur fracture (0.78%). In this retrospective consecutive case series, no subtrochanteric fractures occurred when the entry point of the lowest screw in the lateral femoral cortex is between the levels of the upper and lower borders of the lesser trochanter.\n"}]}]}}

Although a 5-day course of oral prednisone or prednisolone has become the most commonly used regimen, dexamethasone has also been used for a shorter duration (1-2 days) with potential for improvement in compliance and palatability. We reviewed the literature to determine if there is sufficient evidence that dexamethasone can be used as an effective alternative in the treatment of pediatric asthma exacerbations in the inpatient setting. A Medline search was conducted on the use of dexamethasone in the treatment of asthma exacerbations in children. The studies selected were clinical trials comparing the efficacy of dexamethasone with prednisone. Meta-analysis was performed examining physician revisitation rates and symptomatic return to baseline. Six completed pediatric clinical trials met the inclusion criteria. All of the pediatric trials found that prednisone is not superior to dexamethasone in treating mild to moderate asthma exacerbations. Meta-analysis demonstrated homogeneity between the dexamethasone and prednisone groups when examining symptomatic return to baseline and unplanned physician revisits after the initial emergency department encounter. Some studies found potential additional benefits of dexamethasone, including improved compliance and less vomiting. The current literature suggests that dexamethasone can be used as an effective alternative to prednisone in the treatment of mild to moderate acute asthma exacerbations in children, with the added benefits of improved compliance, palatability, and cost. However, more research is needed to examine the role of dexamethasone in hospitalized children.\n \nConcern over the safety of influenza vaccination in individuals with obstructive airways disease has contributed to suboptimal rates of vaccine uptake in this group. We investigated the safety of influenza vaccine in older people with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in a cohort from the UK General Practice Research Database (GPRD). A population based cohort study of 12,000 individuals with asthma or COPD from 432 general practices was conducted. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) were calculated for asthma or COPD diagnoses, prescriptions for oral corticosteroids, and acute exacerbations on the day of vaccination and on days 1-2 and 3-14 after vaccination compared with other time periods in the influenza season. The IRRs for asthma or COPD diagnoses and oral corticosteroid prescriptions were increased on the day of vaccination (for example, the IRR for oral corticosteroid prescriptions for subjects with asthma during the 1992-3 influenza season was 8.24 (95% confidence interval 5.54 to 12.26)). However, there was no consistent increase in the IRR of any of the outcomes on days 1-2 or 3-14 after vaccination, and most of these IRRs were close to 1. Rates of exacerbation were low and showed no consistent statistically significant increase during any risk periods. Older people with asthma or COPD commonly have diagnoses recorded or prescriptions for oral corticosteroids given on the day of influenza vaccination, but there is no increased risk of adverse acute outcomes in the first 2 weeks after vaccination. Our findings strongly suggest that influenza vaccination is safe in this population.\n"}]}]}}

A retrospective registry-based study. The 8 municipalities included in the administration area of the Sami language law (Sami) were matched with a control group of 11 municipalities (non-Sami). Population data were accessed from Statistics Norway. Data regarding invitations and outcome in the NBCSP during the period 2001-2010 was derived from the Cancer Registry of Norway (CRN). The NBCSP targets women aged 50-69 years. Rates and percentages were compared using chi-square test with a p-value<0.05 as statistical significant. The attendance rate in the NBCSP was 78% in the Sami and 75% in the non-Sami population (p< 0.01). The recall rates were 2.4 and 3.3% in the Sami and non-Sami population, respectively (p<0.01). The rate of invasive screen detected cancer was not significantly lower in the Sami group (p=0.14). The percentage of all breast cancers detected in the NBCSP among the Sami (67%) was lower compared with the non-Sami population (86%, p=0.06). Despite a lower risk of breast cancer, the Sami attended the NBCSP more frequently than the control group. The recall and cancer detection rate was lower among the Sami compared with the non-Sami group.\n \nThe aim was to determine what effect the offer of a cervical smear test when attending for breast screening has on the uptake of cervical and breast screening. The study involved randomisation to compare uptake in those women invited for cervical screening in advance with their breast screening invitation (group 1) with those invited for breast screening only and then offered a smear test upon arrival for breast screening (group 2). The main outcome measure was improvement in the uptake of cervical screening among older women without detriment to the breast screening service. The study took place at the Northern Hospital in North Manchester. Participants were 2131 women aged 50-64 years invited for breast screening at the Northern Hospital in the summer of 1990. Overall, 54% of the women who were eligible attended for breast screening, 52% attended from group 1 and 55% from group 2. Of those attending for breast screening, 957 were eligible for cervical screening and 193 (20%) had a smear test. There was a difference in the proportion tested from each group (p < 0.001), 28% had a smear test from group 1 and 13% from group 2. Forty five percent of the 193 had not had a cervical smear for at least five years. The cervical screening facility did attract some women who were overdue for a smear test and who might not normally have attended for cervical screening, and there was no evidence to suggest that it had a detrimental effect on the breast screening uptake. An advanced cervical screening invitation seemed preferable to an invitation upon arrival at the breast screening unit.\n"}]}]}}

This can be done either (i) acutely during the clamp study using high-dose insulin infusion, or (ii) slowly overnight preceding the clamp study using a low-dose insulin infusion. We assessed whether the choice of either of these methods to obtain euglycaemia biases subsequent assessment of glucose metabolism and insulin action. We studied seven obese Type 2 diabetic patients twice Basal plasma glucose levels (mean +/- sd) were 5.5 +/- 0.5 and 10.7 +/- 2.9 mmol/l in the + ON and - ON studies, respectively, and were clamped at -5.5 mmol/l. Basal rates of glucose production (GP) were similar in the + ON and - ON studies, 83 +/- 13 vs. 85 +/- 14 mg m-2 min-1 (NS), whereas basal rates of glucose disappearance (Rd) were lower in the + ON than in the - ON study, 84 +/- 8 vs. 91 +/- 11 mg m-2 min-1 (P = 0.02). During insulin infusion in the clamp period, rates of GP, 23 +/- 11 vs. 25 +/- 10 mg m-2 min-1, as well as rates of Rd, 133 +/- 32 vs. 139 +/- 37 mg m-2 min-1, were similar in the + ON and - ON studies, respectively (NS). Apart from basal rates of Rd, assessment of glucose turnover rates in euglycaemic clamp studies of Type 2 diabetic patients is not dependent on the method by which plasma glucose levels are lowered.\n"}]}]}}

To explore the predictive accuracy of these instruments. The design was interviews of patients, audio recordings of the consultation and interviews of the doctors, in varied primary care practices in England. Participants were patients who were likely to discuss a medication issue. The outcome measures were judgements of appropriateness made by the researchers and by two instruments From 35 cases there was agreement between the judges and the instruments in 22 cases, 16 were appropriate and 6 inappropriate. Of 10 cases classified as inappropriate by the instruments the judges thought four were appropriate. Of 18 cases classified as appropriate by the instruments, two were considered inappropriate by the judges. In seven cases the prescribing decisions could not be classified by the instruments because the decision was to not prescribe. Current measures of appropriateness of prescribing depend predominantly on pharmacological criteria, and so do not represent cases that would be judged appropriate when including the patient's views and contextual factors. If most prescribing is appropriate then use of these measures may lead to more false negatives than real negatives. The instruments should be renamed as measures of 'pharmacological appropriateness' and are useful where the incidence of this type of inappropriate prescribing is relatively high.\n \nLittle is known about the validity and reliability of expert assessments of the quality of antimicrobial prescribing, despite their importance in antimicrobial stewardship. We investigated how infectious disease doctors' assessments compared with a reference standard (modal expert opinion) and with the assessments of their colleagues. Twenty-four doctors specialized in infectious diseases or clinical microbiology (16 specialists and 8 residents) from five hospitals were asked to assess the appropriateness of antimicrobial agents prescribed for a broad spectrum of indications in 56 paper cases. They were instructed how to handle guideline applicability and deviations. We created a reference standard of antimicrobial appropriateness using the modal assessment of 16 specialists. We calculated criterion validity and interrater and intrarater overall and specific agreement with an index expert (senior infectious disease physician) and analysed the influence of doctor characteristics on validity. Specialists agreed with the reference standard in 80% of cases (range 75%-86%), with a sensitivity and specificity of 75% and 84%, respectively. This did not differ by clinical specialty, hospital or years of experience, and residents had similar results. Specialists agreed with the index expert in 76% of cases and the index expert agreed with his previous assessments in 71% of cases. Doctors specialized in infectious diseases and clinical microbiology assess the appropriateness of antimicrobials prescribed for a broad spectrum of indications with acceptable agreement and validity, regardless of their experience or hospital of employment.

The preoperative clinical parameters of these patients were collected, and they were followed up regularly with PSA monitored. Biochemical recurrence was defined as two or more consecutive PSA levels >0.4 ng/mL after radical resection of prostate or secondary cancer treatment. The overall observed 5-year and 10-year biochemical recurrence-free survival rates were 68.3% and 59.8%, which was similar to the predicted values by the Kattan and Stephenson nomograms, respectively.

A total of 1369 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer underwent radical prostatectomy by a single surgeon between 1991 and 2001. A subset of 203 patients (14.9%), who had undergone at least one prior benign prostate biopsy for a rising prostate-specific antigen and/or abnormal digital rectal examination, constituted our study population. A total of 1115 patients with no prior biopsy represented our control group. After prostatectomy, patients were evaluated at 6-month intervals for biochemical evidence of recurrence, defined as a prostate-specific antigen level of 0.5 ng/mL or greater. Patients with a prior benign biopsy had more favorable pathologic features with more organ-confined (74% versus 64%; P <0.001) and less margin-positive (9.8% versus 18%) disease. Only 24 patients (12%) in the study group (versus 20% in control group; P = 0.01) had eventual evidence of biochemical failure. Kaplan-Meier analyses suggested that patients with prior benign biopsies have improved biochemical disease-free survival, especially for those with more aggressive disease (Gleason sum 7 or greater; P <0.01). Overall, patients in the study group had lower probability (odds ratio 0.57, P <0.001) of biochemical failure compared with those in the control group.

Cycloplegic refraction (from 3 to 4 drops of 1% cyclopentolate to ensure abolition of the light reflex) was measured by both autorefraction and retinoscopy. Refractive errors were defined as followed The mean spherical equivalent refractive error was at least +1.22 D for all ages and both genders. The prevalence of myopia for any definition at any age was at most 2.5%, and lower in most cases. In contrast, the prevalence of hyperopia was generally over 20%, and declined slightly with age. The prevalence of astigmatism was between 6% and 11%. There was very little change in refractive error with age over this age range. Previous reports of less hyperopic mean spherical equivalent refractive error, and more myopia and less hyperopia in children of this age may be due to problems with achieving adequate cycloplegia in children with dark irises. Using up to 4 drops of 1% cyclopentolate may be necessary to accurately measure refractive error in paediatric studies of such children. Our results suggest that children from all ethnic groups may follow a similar pattern of early refractive development, with little myopia and a hyperopic mean spherical equivalent over +1.00 D up to the age of 5-6 years in most conditions.\n \nThe objective of this randomized prospective study was to determine whether a urinary catheter is necessary for all patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia. Consecutive patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia were randomized to treatment with or without insertion of an indwelling urinary catheter. All patients received spinal anesthesia with 15 to 30 mg of 0.5% bupivacaine. The catheter group was subjected to a standard postoperative protocol, with removal of the indwelling catheter within forty-eight hours postoperatively. The experimental group was monitored for urinary retention and, if necessary, had straight catheterization up to two times prior to the placement of an indwelling catheter. Two hundred patients were included in the study. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the prevalence of urinary retention, the prevalence of urinary tract infection, or the length of stay. Nine patients in the no-catheter group and three patients in the catheter group (following removal of the catheter) required straight catheterization because of urinary retention. Three patients in the catheter group and no patient in the no-catheter group had development of urinary tract infection. Patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia appear to be at low risk for urinary retention. Thus, a routine indwelling catheter is not required for such patients.\n"}]}]}}

The outcomes of screened/unscreened and sur veillance/nonsur veillance were compared with the use of the logistic regression model. The adjusted odds ratios for the screened group versus the unscreened group, with 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival time being used as outcomes, were 0.33 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21-0.52), 0.33 (95% CI, 0.21-0.53), and 0.37 (95% CI, 0.23-0.61), respectively. The adjusted odds ratios for surveillance versus nonsurveillance were 0.58 (95% CI, 0.35-0.97), 0.45 (95% CI, 0.27-0.74), and 0.44 (95% CI, 0.26-0.73). The odds ratios were even smaller when tumor morphology or T stage was taken as the main outcome. All these results were statistically significant.

As in other chronic liver diseases, the presence of hepatocellular carcinoma in a patient with primary sclerosing cholangitis undergoing evaluation for orthotopic liver transplantation would clearly impact on the candidacy, diagnostic evaluation, and alternative treatment options. Thus, the aim of our study was to determine the prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients undergoing liver transplantation for primary sclerosing cholangitis. The records of the 520 patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation at our institution between 1985 and May 1995 were reviewed. Of the 134 patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis, three (2%) had hepatocellular carcinoma. In the 386 patients without primary sclerosing cholangitis undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation, 22 (6%) had hepatocellular carcinoma. Neither the duration of primary sclerosing cholangitis (range 7-23 years) nor the presence of ulcerative colitis (two of three patients) distinguished those patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis plus hepatocellular carcinoma from those with primary sclerosing cholangitis alone. None of the three patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis plus hepatocellular carcinoma had evidence for hepatitis B or C, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, or hemochromatosis. None of the tumors was of the fibrolamellar variety of hepatocellular carcinoma. The prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation is 2%. These data suggest that patients with advanced cirrhotic-stage primary sclerosing cholangitis are at increased risk for developing hepatocellular carcinoma and should be screened for hepatocellular carcinoma as well as for cholangiocarcinoma prior to orthotopic liver transplantation.\n"}]}]}}

We compared government records and self-reports of motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions in a sample of stroke survivors. The 56 participants were originally recruited for a prospective study on driving and community re-integration post-stroke; the study population consisted of moderately impaired stroke survivors without severe communication disorders who had been referred for a driving assessment. The driving records of the 56 participants for the 5 years before study entry and the 1-year study period were acquired with written consent from the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO), Canada. Self-reports of collisions and convictions were acquired via a semistructured interview and then compared with the MTO records. Forty-three participants completed the study. For 7 (13.5%) the MTO records did not match the self-reports regarding collision involvement, and for 9 (17.3%) the MTO records did not match self-reports regarding driving convictions. The kappa coefficient for the correlation between MTO records and self-reports was 0.52 for collisions and 0.47 for convictions (both in the moderate range of agreement). When both sources of data were consulted, up to 56 percent more accidents and up to 46 percent more convictions were identified in the study population in the 5 years before study entry compared to when either source was used alone. In our population of stroke survivors, self-reports of motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions differed from government records. In future studies, the use of both government and self-reported data would ensure a more accurate picture of driving safety post-stroke.\n \nESC (Electronic Stability Control) is a crash avoidance technology that reduces the likelihood of collisions involving loss of control. Although past and emerging research indicates that ESC is effective in reducing collision rates and saving lives, and its inclusion in all vehicle platforms is encouraged, drivers may demonstrate behavioral adaptation or an overreliance on ESC that could offset or reduce its overall effectiveness. The main objective of the present study was to determine whether behavioral adaptation to ESC is likely to occur upon the widespread introduction of ESC into the Canadian vehicle fleet. Secondary objectives were to confirm the results of a previous ESC public survey and to generate a baseline measure for the future assessment of planned and ongoing ESC promotional activities in Canada. Two separate telephone surveys evaluated drivers' perceptions and awareness of ESC. The first surveyed 500 randomly selected owners/drivers of passenger vehicles. The second surveyed 1017 owners/drivers of 2006-2008 ESC-equipped passenger vehicles from the provinces of Quebec and British Columbia, Canada. Though ESC drivers were much more likely than drivers of other vehicles to be aware of ESC (77% vs. 39%) and that their own vehicle was equipped with it (63% vs. 8%), 23 percent had never heard of it. Ninety percent of drivers who knew that their vehicle was equipped with ESC believed that ESC had made it safer to drive and reported being confident that ESC would work in an emergency. Twenty-three percent of ESC owners who knew their vehicle had ESC reported noticing long-lasting changes in their driving behavior since they began driving the vehicle. Collectively, results suggest that behavioral adaptation to ESC is likely in certain drivers; however, its proven effectiveness in reducing the likelihood of being involved in a serious crash probably outweighs any potential increases in unsafe driving. To fully benefit from ESC, vehicle manufacturers are encouraged to market ESC-equipped vehicles in a realistic, safe manner. Driver training and safety organizations are also encouraged to provide balanced educational information about ESC to their members.\n"}]}]}}

Data were collected prospectively in a pelvic floor database. Patients received pelvic floor retraining either individually or in a small group setting and completed baseline and follow-up questionnaires. Two hundred and fifteen patients were treated, 119 individually and 96 in a small group setting. Scores before and after treatment for the two settings were compared for the Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index, the Fecal Incontinence Severity Index and the Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptoms. Additionally patients receiving group treatment completed a short questionnaire on their experience. The median change in Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index score was 5 (range -62 to 73) for individual treatment and 4 (range -41 to 47) for group treatment, both showing statistically significant improvement. However, there was no significant difference between the settings.

All patients were immunocompetent with a preceding history of trauma in three. Four patients presented with unilateral, small, persisting deep stromal infiltrates, of uncertain etiology, in the cornea, which were not responding to conventional antimicrobial treatment and required penetrating keratoplasty in three. Fifth case was unsuspected and underwent keratoplasty for post-traumatic scar. Three of five cases were diagnosed on corneal scrapings, prior to keratoplasty, while two were diagnosed only on histology.

Nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR), which play a central role in lipid and glucose metabolism, had been hypothesized as being involved in colon cancerogenesis. In animal studies the lipid-lowering PPAR ligand bezafibrate suppressed colonic tumors. However, the effect of bezafibrate on colon cancer development in humans is unknown. Therefore, we proposed to investigate a possible preventive effect of bezafibrate on the development of colon cancer in patients with coronary artery disease during a 6-year follow-up. Our population included 3011 patients without any cancer diagnosis who were enrolled in the randomized, double blind Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention (BIP) Study. The patients received either 400 mg of bezafibrate retard (1506 patients) or placebo (1505 patients) once a day. Cancer incidence data were obtained by matching a subject's identification numbers with the National Cancer Registry. Each matched record was checked for correct identification.

The polymorphic N-acetyltransferase 2 enzyme (NAT2, E.C. 2.3.1.5) plays a key role in the transformation of HAAs to ultimate carcinogens. NAT2 enzyme activity is expressed in a genotype-dependent manner in colon epithelium. Therefore local activation of HAAs in colon, and hence increased risk to develop colon cancer, is likely to be related to high NAT2 enzyme activity. This study is aimed at analysing the association between genotypes leading to high NAT2 activity and colorectal cancer risk. Genomic DNA from 120 colorectal cancer patients and 258 healthy individuals were analysed for enzyme-inactivating mutations at the coding region of the NAT2 gene by means of a mutation-specific polymerase chain reaction. Among patients with sigmoid colon cancer, a significant excess of individuals with genotypes leading to high NAT2 activity was observed as compared both to controls and to the rest of patients with colorectal cancer (P < 0.05). Our findings, which require independent confirmation, suggest that the NAT2 genotype constitutes a secondary risk factor to develop sigmoid colon cancer.\n"}]}]}}

Specific measures of well-being such as sleep quality have not been used, despite its association with working conditions. A longitudinal design was used to collect data from Danish healthcare workers at time 1 in 2005 (n = 447) and 18 months later at time 2 in 2007 (n = 274). Structural equation modelling was used to investigate the relationships between transformational leadership, self-efficacy and sleep quality at both time points independently (cross-sectionally) and longitudinally. For all constructs, time 2 measures were influenced by the baseline level. Direct relationships between transformational leadership and sleep quality were found. This relationship was negative cross-sectionally at both time points, but positive between baseline and follow-up. The relationship between leadership and employees' sleep quality was not mediated by employees' self-efficacy. Our results indicate that training managers in transformational leadership behaviours may have a positive impact on healthcare workers' health over time.

A strong positive association between changes in sleepiness and RLS symptom severity was found (P=.006). The results of this study suggest that the use of 800 mg of valerian for 8 weeks improves symptoms of RLS and decreases daytime sleepiness in patients that report an Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score of 10 or greater.

Eight patients discontinued therapy because of adverse events. With a median follow-up of 3.6 years (range, 4 months to 8.7 years), the 5-year relapse-free survival rate was 61%. All 3 patients who developed a relapse underwent successful salvage treatment and remained disease-free. The 5-year overall survival rate was 78%. Maintenance TKI therapy after transplantation is feasible and might reduce the incidence of relapses and improve outcomes after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for patients with high-risk Ph(+) leukemia.\n"}]}]}}

Cystic neoplasms of the pancreas present a significant diagnostic dilemma in differentiating benign from premalignant or malignant variants. Since the first description of lymphoepithelial cysts in 1985, 109 cases have been reported in the literature. We describe 6 cases of this rare tumor, the preoperative imaging results, and a review the literature. Five males and one female ranging in age from 47 to 76 years underwent resection for lymphoepithelial cysts. Five patients presented with abdominal pain related to the lesion and in one patient the lesion was discovered incidentally. Four patients had elevated serum CA 19-9 levels. Pre-operative imaging with a CT scan and MRI of the abdomen typically revealed a well defined hypodense mass with Hounsfield units (HU) in the range of 15 to 20. One patient had papillary projections into the lesion. The mean size was 3.3 cm (ranging from 1.8 cm to 4 cm). All lesions were exophytic off the pancreatic parenchyma (1 cyst was located in the head of the pancreas, 2 were in the body, and 3 were in the tail region). Pre-operative EUS-guided/CT-guided needle aspiration, when performed, was not diagnostic. All patients underwent resection (one pancreaticoduodenectomy, five left pancreatectomies) to remove these cystic neoplasms. Pathology revealed a cyst lined by non-dysplastic squamous cells surrounded by sheets of benign lymphocytes. No evidence of malignancy was found. Lymphoepithelial cysts of the pancreas are rare and are characteristically seen in men. While a hypodense mass (less than 20 HU) with papillary projections should be considered suspicious for lymphoepithelial cyst, a definitive diagnosis cannot be made solely based on preoperative imaging. EUS-guided biopsy coupled with biochemical/tumor marker studies are increasingly being used as a diagnostic tool to help differentiate between the various types of cystic pancreatic neoplasms. Imaging findings of lymphoepithelial cysts are non-specific and hence surgical resection is often required to rule out the presence of a malignant or pre-malignant cystic pancreatic lesion. In true lymphoepithelial cysts, malignant transformation is not seen and patients who have these cysts are not at increased risk of developing a pancreatic malignancy.\n"}]}]}}

The study compared the postoperative Ca/PTH kinetics between different preoperative 25-OHD levels. A total of 281 patients who underwent a total thyroidectomy were analyzed. Serum Ca was measured preoperatively within 1 h after surgery (Ca-D0) and on the following morning (Ca-D1). Preoperative 25-OHD was also measured after overnight fasting while postoperative PTH was checked at skin closure on day 0 (PTH-D0) and on the following morning on day 1 (PTH-D1).

The aim of the study was to estimate the effectiveness of a nurse-led preoperative education on anxiety and postoperative outcomes. A randomised controlled study was designed.

The aim of this survey was to evaluate the implementation rate of the new ESC/ESH recommendations by primary care physicians and to assess the effectiveness of antihypertensive therapy. Data concerning pharmacotherapy, blood pressure (BP) measurements, and compliance with the guidelines were collected in 10,880 hypertensive patients during 3 subsequent follow-up visits. Combined antihypertensive treatment (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors with \u03b2-blocker, diuretic, or calcium-channel blocker) was used in 69.2% of the patients at baseline. A combination of \u03b2-blocker with diuretic was prescribed in 7.4% of the patients. In 71% of these patients no history of cardiovascular events was reported (myocardial infarction, revascularization, or heart failure). Diuretics were not used in 20.7% of the patients receiving a 3-drug regimen and in 6.7% of those receiving a 4-drug regimen. BP target levels set by individual physicians were frequently lower than those recommended by the guidelines. The percentage of patients who reached the recommended BP target increased during the survey to 25.3%. A combination of \u03b2-blocker and diuretic is still commonly used in the treatment of hypertension in patients without coronary artery disease and heart failure. Despite the use of combination treatment in about 90% of hypertensive patients and attempts at reaching lower target BP values than those recommended by the guidelines, treatment targets were achieved only in one-fourth of the patients.\n \nInstitutional and physician-related factors can influence the way in which physicians interpret research results. The aim of this study was to determine what physicians know about, and their opinions of, hormone treatment in breast cancer patients, and the factors comprising their medical decision-making. A questionnaire was mailed to a random sample of physicians inquiring as to their preferences with respect to adjuvant tamoxifen, and the usual duration of the treatment applied in various clinical scenarios (according to a woman's menopausal status, the oestrogen receptor status and the stage of disease). Of 500 physicians identified, 38% returned the questionnaire. Of the non-responders, a random sample of 60 physicians was interviewed by phone. The total number of available questionnaires was 250 (50%). About 3/4 of the doctors would prescribe tamoxifen in older ER+ women and 30%-40% in post-menopausal ER-patients, but only 2/5 would do so in younger ER+ women. The vast majority of physicians considered five years as standard for ER+ patients. Nevertheless, about 1/4 of the doctors chose a shorter treatment duration for node-negative, pre-menopausal patients. A minority of physicians used tamoxifen for longer than five years. Older clinicians were less likely to prescribe tamoxifen, particularly for low-risk patients. According to the data of the recent EBCTG overview, an additional 20,000 lives could be saved worldwide each year if tamoxifen were given to all early breast cancer patients with hormone-sensitive disease, irrespective of age and disease stage, and for a minimum of five years. Our study, involving a representative sample of physicians practicing in Italy, shows that tamoxifen is not used optimally, with a substantial under-use in younger women and women with node-negative disease.\n"}]}]}}

Appropriate care requires accurate physician estimates of severity. It is unknown if accuracy of physician estimates differs between black and white patients, and how this relates to asthma care disparities. We hypothesized that We conducted a cross-sectional survey among adult patients with asthma cared for in 15 managed care organizations in the United States. We collected physicians' estimates of their patients' asthma severity. Physicians' estimates of patients' asthma as being less severe than patient-reported symptoms were classified as underestimates of severity. Frequency of underestimation, asthma care, and communication. Three thousand four hundred and ninety-four patients participated (13% were black). Blacks were significantly more likely than white patients to have their asthma severity underestimated (OR = 1.39, 95% CI 1.08-1.79). Among black patients, underestimation was associated with less use of daily inhaled corticosteroids (13% vs 20%, p < .05), less physician instruction on management of asthma flare-ups (33% vs 41%, p < .0001), and lower ratings of asthma care (p = .01) and physician communication (p = .04). Biased estimates of asthma severity may contribute to racially disparate asthma care. Interventions to improve physicians' assessments of asthma severity and patient-physician communication may minimize racial disparities in asthma care.\n \nThe guidelines for asthma recommend that the use of anti-inflammatory therapy should be adapted to the severity of the disease. However, few data are available to assess the adequacy of the use of drugs and its influence on the control of asthma in 'real life'. The adequacy of the current use of anti-asthmatic medication according to the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines was assessed in a random sample of 400 asthmatics identified in the frame of the Italian Study on Asthma in Young Adults. Asthma severity was assessed using the GINA criteria; accordingly, a patient was classified as receiving inadequate treatment if his/her current use of drugs was lower than that suggested by the guidelines for the corresponding severity level. The absence of asthma attacks in the last 3 months was used as an indicator of the disease control. Fifty-five percent of the patients had persistent asthma. Overall, 48% (95% CI 41.2-54.8) of persistent asthmatics were receiving inadequate treatment, and 66% (95% CI 59.5-72.4) had not used their medication daily over the past 3 months. Persistent asthmatics who were inadequately treated had a significantly greater frequency of asthma attacks (geometric mean ratio 3.7; 95% CI 2.1-6.6) than those using an adequate dose of medication. Mild and moderate persistent asthmatics using an adequate medication regimen reported a low number of asthma attacks (median 0). At the multivariate analysis, a good control of the disease was positively associated with an adequate dose of anti-inflammatory medication (OR = 2.2; 95% CI 1.1-4.5) and was negatively associated with a later onset of asthma (OR = 0.96; 95% CI 0.93-0.99) and severe asthma (OR = 0.37; 95% CI 0.17-0.81). Despite the increase in the use of inhaled corticosteroids, half of the persistent asthmatics from the general population are using a medication regimen below their severity level. When the use of drugs follows the GINA guideline recommendations, a good control of asthma is also achievable in the daily management of the disease, particularly in the case of mild and moderate asthmatics.\n"}]}]}}

Minimally invasive techniques in foregut surgery have been suggested to cause less tissue trauma. We examined the factors associated with new-onset atrial fibrillation after foregut surgery at our institution. We retrospectively examined the records of 154 adult patients who underwent major foregut surgery which included esophagectomy, partial or total gastrectomy, redo Heller myotomy, redo or transthoracic fundoplications. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis with standard modeling techniques were performed to determine risk factors for new-onset atrial fibrillation. Of the 154 patients, 14 patients developed new-onset atrial fibrillation with a higher mean age of 67.1 years (+/-8.8 years) versus 56.4 years (+/-14.1 years) (p = 0.006). Laparoscopic (p = 0.004) and nonthoracic surgeries (p = 0.01) were associated with lower risk of atrial fibrillation. Patients with atrial fibrillation had received more fluid (6.5 +/- 2.8 liters versus 5.3 +/- 2.0 liters) and had longer operations (370 +/- 103 min versus 362 +/- 142 min), none of which were statistically significant. The average intensive care length of stay of patients was longer Laparoscopic surgery is associated with lower risk of atrial fibrillation in foregut surgery. Development of atrial fibrillation is associated with increased length of intensive care stay. We recommend a prospective trial to confirm our findings.\n \nLaparoscopic surgery is associated with well-known benefits, one of which is earlier return of bowel function. Since the laparoscopic approach to colon resections was introduced in the early 1990s, it has become the standard of care. Hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery (HALS) is a surgical approach in which dissection is facilitated by the surgeon's hand within the abdominal cavity during laparoscopy. The purpose of this study was to compare the incidence of postoperative ileus and the need for nasogastric tube (NGT) decompression in patients undergoing elective colon resections. Following institutional review board approval, we performed a retrospective review of a prospectively collected database. Included were patients who underwent elective left-sided large bowel resections between 2009 and 2012. Exclusion criteria were urgent operation, stoma creation, ASA IV classification, NGT left in place at the end of surgery, and postoperative anastomotic leakage. Patients were divided into three groups A total of 243 patients were included in this study; 73 patients underwent open surgery, 89 patients underwent HALS, and 81 patients underwent laparoscopic surgery. The proportion of patients who needed postoperative nasogastric decompression was significantly reduced in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery (3.7%) or HALS (4.5%) compared with those who underwent open resection (17.8%). The time from surgery to first flatus and first bowel movement, the time to tolerate solid diet, and the total length of postoperative hospital stay also were all significantly reduced in the laparoscopic and HALS groups compared with the open surgery group. There were no significant differences in any of these measures between the laparoscopic group and the hand-assisted group. Like laparoscopy, HALS is associated with less postoperative ileus and necessitates less NGT decompression than does open surgery.\n"}]}]}}

However, it is not known whether even occasional victimization has similar negative consequences and whether protective factors such as social support may prevent those harmful developments. The present study therefore focuses on the nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) and suicidal behavior (SB) in victims of bullying and the potentially moderating effect of parental monitoring. In all, a cross-sectional sample of 647 adolescents (mean age 12.8 years) were surveyed concerning bullying experiences, NSSI and SB, and parental monitoring. A total of 14.4% of respondents reported being a victim of frequent bullying in the past few months (with verbal and social bullying playing the most important role), which increased the risks of both NSSI (OR\u2009=\u200911.75) and SB (OR\u2009=\u20096.08). This relationship could also be shown for occasional victims of bullying (35.6%), although to a lesser extent. Parental monitoring had a significant protective effect on SB in victims of occasional bullying. However, parental monitoring did not show any protective effect in victims of repetitive bullying. Victims of bullying show a substantial risk for engaging in self-harm behavior. Therefore, the dissemination of anti-bullying programs in schools would probably also prevent such disorders. Parental participation in school-based prevention may increase its effect; this also matches the results of the present study, showing that parental monitoring may be able to buffer the negative effects of bullying victimization, at least to a certain degree.\n"}]}]}}

Folic acid (FA) is often given as an adjunct to methotrexate therapy, but there is no conclusive proof that it decreases the toxicity of methotrexate and there is a theoretical risk that it may decrease the efficacy of methotrexate. To look at the effect of stopping FA supplementation in UK rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients established on methotrexate <20 mg weekly and FA 5 mg daily, to report all toxicity (including absolute changes in haematological and liver enzyme indices) and to report changes in the efficacy of methotrexate. In a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 75 patients who were established on methotrexate <20 mg weekly and FA 5 mg daily were asked to stop their FA and were randomized to one of two groups Overall, 25 (33%) patients concluded the study early, eight (21%) in the group remaining on FA and 17 (46%) in the placebo group (P = 0.02). Two patients in the placebo group discontinued because of neutropenia. At 9 months there was an increased incidence of nausea in the placebo group (45 vs. 7%, P = 0.001). The placebo group had significantly lower disease activity on a few of the variables measured, but these were probably not of clinical significance. It is important to continue FA supplementation over the long term in patients on methotrexate and FA in order to prevent them discontinuing treatment because of mouth ulcers or nausea and vomiting. Our data suggest that FA supplementation is also helpful in preventing neutropenia, with very little loss of efficacy of methotrexate.\n \nThe aim of this study was to investigate lifestyle habits and lifestyle adjustments among subfertile women trying to conceive. Women (n = 747) were recruited consecutively at their first visit to fertility clinics in mid-Sweden. Participants completed a questionnaire. Data were analyzed using logistic regression, t tests, and chi-square tests. The response rate was 62% (n\u2009=\u2009466). Mean duration of infertility was 1.9 years. During this time 13.2% used tobacco daily, 13.6% drank more than three cups of coffee per day, and 11.6% consumed more than two glasses of alcohol weekly. In this sample, 23.9% of the women were overweight (body mass index, BMI 25-29.9\u2009kg/m(2)), and 12.5% were obese (BMI \u226530\u2009kg/m(2)). Obese women exercised more and changed to healthy diets more frequently than normal-weight women (odds ratio 7.43; 95% confidence interval 3.7-14.9). Six out of ten women (n = 266) took folic acid when they started trying to conceive, but 11% stopped taking folic acid after some time. Taking folic acid was associated with a higher level of education (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Among subfertile women, one-third were overweight or obese, and some had other lifestyle factors with known adverse effects on fertility such as use of tobacco. Overweight and obese women adjusted their habits but did not reduce their body mass index. Women of fertile age would benefit from preconception counseling, and the treatment of infertility should routinely offer interventions for lifestyle changes.\n"}]}]}}

All these patients were followed up to evaluate the immediate and long-term success of the procedure. The incidence and nature of complications were also noted. During retrograde ureteroscopy, complete stone clearance was achieved in 11 patients (55%), while pushback of the whole or fragmented calculus was seen in the rest. These patients with residual calculi were later treated by extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (SWL). The stone-free rate at the end of 3 months was 85%. Three patients developed minor ureteroscopy-related complications. Complete stone clearance was achieved in all patients with antegrade ureteroscopy.

To determine the hemodynamic effect due to lung IR injury, we performed a quantitative coronary blood-flow analysis in a swine model of in situ lung ischemia and reperfusion. In 14 healthy pigs, blood flow was measured in the ascending aorta, left anterior descending (LAD), circumflex (Cx), right coronary artery (RCA), right common carotid artery (RCCA), and left internal mammary artery (LIMA), along with left-and right-ventricular pressures (LVP and RVP), aortic pressure (AoP), and pulmonary artery pressure (PAP). Cardiac Troponin (cTn), interleukin 6 and 10 (IL-6 and IL-10), and tumor necrosis factor A (TNF-A) were measured in coronary sinus blood samples. The experimental (IR) group (n=10) underwent 60 min of lung ischemia followed by 60 min of reperfusion by clamping and releasing the left pulmonary hilum. Simultaneous measurements of all parameters were made at baseline and during IR. The control group (n=4) had similar measurements without lung IR. In the IR group, total coronary flow (TCF=LAD+Cx+RCA blood-flow) decreased precipitously and significantly from baseline (113\u00b141 ml min\"1) during IR (p<0.05), with the lowest value observed at 60 min of reperfusion (-37.1%, p<0.003). Baseline cTn (0.08\u00b10.02 ng ml(-1)) increased during IR and peaked at 45 min of reperfusion (+138%, p<0.001). Baseline IL-6 (9.2\u00b12.17 pg ml(-1)) increased during IR and peaked at 60 min of reperfusion (+228%, p<0.0001). Significant LVP drop at 5 min of ischemia (p<0.05) was followed by a slow return to baseline at 45 min of ischemia. A second LVP drop occurred at reperfusion (p<0.05) and persisted. Conversely, RVP increased throughout ischemia (p<0.05) and returned toward baseline during reperfusion. Coronary blood flow and hemodynamic profile remained unchanged in the control group. IL-10 and TNF-A remained below the measurable range for both the groups. In situ lung IR has a marked negative impact on coronary blood flow, hemodynamics, and inflammatory profile. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study where coronary blood flow is directly measured during lung IR, revealing the associated increased cardiac risk.\n \nBeta-adrenergic blocking agents are the cornerstone in the treatment of coronary artery disease (CAD). The exact pathophysiologic mechanism is not clear but depends largely on the oxygen-sparing effect of the drug. Thus, the effect of metoprolol on coronary flow reserve and coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR) was determined in patients with CAD. Coronary blood flow velocity was measured with the Doppler flow wire in 23 patients (age Rate-pressure product decreased after metoprolol from 9.1 to 8.0 x 10(3) mm Hg/min (p < 0.001). Pharmacologic CFVR was 2.1 at rest and increased after metoprolol to 2.7 (p = 0.002). Likewise, postischemic CFVR increased from 2.6 to 3.3 (p < 0.001). Postischemic CFVR was significantly higher than pharmacologic CFVR before as well as after metoprolol. Coronary vascular resistance decreased after metoprolol from 3.4 +/- 2.0 to 2.3 +/- 0.7 mm Hg x s/cm (p < 0.02). The following conclusions were drawn from this study. Metoprolol is associated with a significant increase in postischemic and pharmacologic CFVR. However, postischemic CFVR is significantly higher than pharmacologic CFVR. The increase in CFVR by metoprolol can be explained by a reduction in vascular resistance. The increase in CFVR (= increased supply) and the reduction in oxygen consumption (= decreased demand) after metoprolol explain the beneficial effect of this beta-blocker in patients with CAD.\n"}]}]}}

We examined the ethical implications of cold calling in a study of subjects with defined neurotic disorders followed up 12 years after initial assessment carried out to determine outcome in terms of symptoms, social functioning, and contact with health services. The patients concerned were asked at original assessment if they would agree to be followed up subsequently and although they agreed no time limit was put on this. To decide if cold calling was ethically justifiable and, if so, to set guidelines for researchers. The study was a cohort study of patients with neurotic disorder treated initially for 10 weeks in a randomised controlled trial. At follow up by a research medical practitioner 18 of the 210 patients had died and of the remaining 192 patients 186 (97%) were seen or had a telephone interview. Four patients refused and two others did not have interviews but agreed to some data being obtained. However, only 104 patients (54%) responded to letters inviting them to make an appointment or to refuse contact and the remainder were followed up by cold calling, with most patients agreeing readily to the research interview. The findings illustrate the dilemma of the need to get the maximum possible data from such studies to achieve scientific validity (and thereby justify the ethics of the study) and the protection of subjects' privacy and autonomy. More attention needs to be paid to consent procedures if cold calling is to be defended on ethical grounds but it is unreasonable to expect this to be obtained at the beginning of a research study in a way that satisfies the requirements for informed consent. A suggested way forward is to obtain written consent for the research at the time that cold calling takes place before beginning the research.\n \nThe aim of the study was to investigate trends in cancer prognosis by examining the relationship between period of diagnosis and probability of death from cancer in a population-based cohort. Within a cohort of Japanese men and women aged 40-69 years and free of prior diagnosis of cancer and cardiovascular disease at baseline, data from 4403 patients diagnosed with cancer between 1990 and 2006 and followed up until 2012 were analyzed using survival regression models to assess the presence of an effect of the period of diagnosis (before 1998 versus after 1998) on the risk of dying from cancer. We noted a significant decrease in risk of dying from cancer among individuals diagnosed after 1998 with lung cancer (hazard ratio [HR]=0.676 [0.571-0.800]) or colorectal cancer (HR=0.801 [0.661-0.970]). A decrease in the estimated five-year probability of death from cancer was also noted between the first (before 1998) and the second (after 1998) period of diagnosis for lung and colorectal cancers (e.g., 85.4% vs. 73.3% for lung cancer and 44.6% vs. 37.7% for colorectal cancer, respectively, for stage III in men aged 60 at diagnosis). This study presented the first scientific evidence of improvement in prognosis for lung and colorectal cancer patients in a population-based cohort in Japan.

DNA was collected for genotyping from 73 term newborns suffering from TTN and 55 healthy controls from a Caucasian cohort. TTN infants were more likely to be male (70% vs. 49%; p < 0.05), had a lower mean birthweight (3120 +/- 450 vs. 3396 +/- 504 g; p < 0.001) and gestational age (GA) (38.4 +/- 1.2 vs. 39.4 +/- 1.3 weeks; p < 0.001) and were more often delivered by caesarean section (CS) (71% vs. 26%; p < 0.001).

The coding region and adjacent stretches of the B3AR gene was sequenced in 91 patients. In total, 1015 patients from a single academic hospital were genotyped for the presence of two single nucleotide polymorphisms. Symptom scores and parameters from pressure-flow studies were analyzed relative to genotype in the B3AR gene. No frequent novel polymorphisms were detected in the coding region. Five polymorphisms were found in the non-coding region of the gene but were in complete linkage with the 64Arg allele. Out of 32 parameters including bladder compliance, only prostate size was weakly (44 vs. 39\u2009mL) but significantly associated with the 64Arg allele, but was not mirrored by an association with prostate-specific antigen levels.

The optimal time for prosthesis placement is still unclear, and its complication rate has been poorly studied in children. The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors of complications in cases of testicular prosthesis implantation in children. A monocentric, retrospective review was performed of children implanted with a testicular prosthesis between 2008 and 2014. All implantations were performed through an inguinal incision with a standardized procedure. Children were divided into two groups depending on the interval after orchiectomy Twenty-six patients (A, 15; B, 11) had a total of 38 testicular prostheses placements. Mean follow-up was 36.2 months. First surgery was performed at the mean age of 11.8 years (range 0-17.9) (A, 14.1; B, 8.1; P\u00a0=\u00a00.01) and testicular prosthesis implantation at the mean age of 14.7 years (range 9-18) (A, 14.3; B, 14.6) with a mean delay of 36.1 months (A, 1.3; B, 80.3). Indications were mainly spermatic cord torsion (27%), bilateral anorchia (27%), and testicular atrophy after cryptorchidism surgery (19.2%). Complications (10.5%) included two cases of extrusion, one infection and one migration. Patient 1 had a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia with testicle relapse 2 years after induction therapy. High-dose chemotherapy, total body irradiation and bilateral orchiectomies were performed, and bilateral prostheses were implanted 12 years after the end of chemotherapy. Complications happened 85 days after surgery. Patient 2 was followed-up for a proximal hypospadias. The tunica vaginalis flap, which was used during a redo urethroplasty, lead to testicular atrophy. Thirteen years after the last penile surgery, a testicular prosthesis was placed through an inguinal incision, and extrusion occurred 203 days after surgery. Bacterial cultures of the prostheses were sterile and histological review showed no sign of granuloma or graft rejection. The complication rate was significantly higher if the delay between the two surgeries exceeded 1 year (P\u00a0=\u00a00.01). Indications of orchiectomy, prior scrotal incision, and prosthesis size were not risk factors. Testicular prosthesis implantation was relatively safe in a pediatric cohort. The complication rate was significantly higher if the delay between the orchiectomy and the prosthetic placement exceeded 1 year. These results suggest that reducing the delay between orchiectomy and prosthesis implantation may lead to fewer complications.\n"}]}]}}

Approval of the institutional ethical review committee was not required. This was a retrospective review of 322 computed tomographic angiographic studies that were performed in patients before they underwent elective EVAR for infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. Morphologic parameters evaluated were IMA patency, origin of the IMA in relation to the aneurysm sac, diameter of the IMA, the cross-sectional area of the contrast material-enhanced aortic lumen at the level of the IMA ostium, and the number of additional patent aortic side branches from the aneurysm sac. The association of IMA type II endoleaks with each variable was analyzed by using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models. The diameter of the IMA did not influence the development of IMA type II endoleaks (P = .51). The incidence of these endoleaks was significantly higher in patients with greater cross-sectional area of the aortic lumen at the IMA ostium (P < .001). Patients with an IMA type II endoleak had significantly more patent aortic side branches before EVAR than did patients without an endoleak (3.6 \u00b1 1.7 vs 2.2 \u00b1 1.4; P < .001). According to the final logistic regression model that included cross-sectional area of the aortic lumen at the IMA and the number of aortic side branches as independent predictors, risk for IMA type II endoleaks was determined with a sensitivity of 78% (39 of 50) and a specificity of 79% (92 of 116).

According to the literature, contradictory results concerning the relationship between atmospheric pressure and aneurysm size have been reported. In this paper, we assessed the influence of changes in atmospheric pressure on abdominal aneurysm ruptures in relationship to the aneurysm's size. The records of 223 patients with ruptured abdominal aneurysms were evaluated. All of the patients had been admitted to the department in the period 1997-2007 from the Silesia region. The atmospheric pressures on the day of the rupture and on the days both before the rupture and between the rupture events were compared. The size of the aneurysm was also considered in the analysis. There were no statistically significant differences in pressure between the days of rupture and the remainder of the days within an analysed period. The highest frequency of the admission of patients with a ruptured aortic aneurysm was observed during periods of winter and spring, when the highest mean values of atmospheric pressure were observed; however, this observation was not statistically confirmed. A statistically non-significant trend towards the higher rupture of large aneurysms (> 7 cm) was observed in the cases where the pressure increased between the day before the rupture and the day of the rupture. This trend was particularly pronounced in patients suffering from hypertension (p = 0.1). The results of this study do not support the hypothesis that there is a direct link between atmospheric pressure values and abdominal aortic aneurysm ruptures.\n"}]}]}}

The scenarios were all possible combinations of five factors The concept of breaching confidentiality to protect a wife from her husband's STD was favoured much more by lay people and psychologists than by physicians (mean ratings 11.76, 9.28 and 2.90, respectively, on a scale of 0-22). The patient's stated intentions to protect his wife and to inform her of the disease had the greatest impact on acceptability. A cluster analysis showed groups of lay participants who found breaching confidentiality \"always acceptable\" (n = 14), \"depending on the many circumstances\" (n = 87), requiring \"consultation with an expert\" (n = 30) and \"never acceptable (n = 13)\".

Patient care-seeking patterns over a 6-year timeframe in Minnesota, where care systems have a significant portion of their revenue generated by shared-saving contracts with public and private payers. Weibull duration and probit models were used to examine patterns of patient attribution to a care system and the continuity of patient affiliation with a care system. Clustering of errors within family unit was used to account for within-family correlation in unobserved characteristics that affect patient loyalty. The payer provided data from health plan administrative files, matched to U.S. Census-based characteristics of the patient's neighborhood. Patients were retrospectively attributed to health care systems based on patterns of primary care. I find significant patient loyalty, with past loyalty a very strong predictor of future relationship. Relationships were shorter when the patient's health status was complex and when the patient's care system was smaller. Population health management can be beneficial to the care system making this investment, particularly for patients exhibiting prior continuity in care system choice. The results suggest that co-located primary and specialty services are important in maintaining primary care loyalty.\n"}]}]}}

One hundred and eighty-two patients diagnosed between 1998 and 2002 as having chronic functional somatic symptoms and 182 controls matched by age, sex, socioeconomic status, and practice were included. Data on comorbidity, referrals, diagnostic tests, and hospital admissions over a period of 10 years prior to the diagnosis were collected. Medication use and number of visits to the general practitioner (GP) were extracted from the moment computerised registration was started. In the 10 years before the diagnosis of chronic functional somatic symptoms, significantly more patients than controls presented functional somatic symptoms in at least two body systems, and used more somatic and psychotropic drugs. They visited the GP twice as much, statistically had significantly more psychiatric morbidity, and were referred more often to mental health workers and somatic specialists. The number of patients undergoing diagnostic tests was higher for patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms than for controls, but hospital admissions rates were equal. Patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms have a great diversity of functional somatic symptoms. They use more somatic and psychotropic drugs than controls in the years before diagnosis. Moreover, they show high rates of referrals and psychiatric morbidity. The diversity of symptoms of patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms supports the concept that symptoms do not cluster in well defined distinct syndromes. Therefore, patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms should preferably not be classified into medical subspecialty syndromes.\n \nTinnitus can be related to many different aetiologies such as hearing loss or a noise trauma, but it can also be related to the somatosensory system of the cervical spine, called cervicogenic somatic tinnitus (CST). Case studies suggest a positive effect of cervical spine treatment on tinnitus complaints in patients with CST, but no experimental studies are available. To investigate the effect of a multimodal cervical physical therapy treatment on tinnitus complaints in patients with CST. Randomized controlled trial. Patients with a combination of severe subjective tinnitus (Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) All patients received cervical physical therapy for 6 weeks (12 sessions). Patients were randomized in an immediate-start therapy group (n\u00a0=\u00a019) and a 6-week delayed-start therapy group (n\u00a0=\u00a019). TFI and NBQ-scores were documented at baseline, after the wait-and-see period in the delayed-start group, after treatment and after 6 weeks follow-up. The Global Perceived Effect (GPE) was documented at all measuring moments, except at baseline. In all patients (n\u00a0=\u00a038) TFI and NBQ-scores decreased significantly after treatment (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04 and p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). NBQ-scores remained significantly lower after follow-up (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). Immediately after treatment, 53% (n\u00a0=\u00a038) experienced substantial improvement of tinnitus. This effect was maintained in 24% of patients after follow-up at six weeks. Cervical physical therapy can have a positive effect on subjective tinnitus complaints in patients with a combination of tinnitus and neck complaints. Larger studies, using more responsive outcome measures, are however necessary to prove this effect. NCT02016313.\n"}]}]}}

In order for meaningful results to be extrapolated to specific populations, the limitations of the data and linkage methodology need to be investigated and clarified. It is the objective of this study to investigate the differences in ascertainment which may arise between a hospital admission dataset and a dispensing claims dataset, using major depression in pregnancy as an example. The safe use of antidepressants in pregnancy is an ongoing issue for clinicians with around 10% of pregnant women suffer from depression. As the birth admission will be the first admission to hospital during their pregnancy for most women, their use of antidepressants, or their depressive condition, may not be revealed to the attending hospital clinicians. This may result in adverse outcomes for the mother and infant. Population-based de-identified data were provided from the Western Australian Data Linkage System linking the administrative health records of women with a delivery to related records from the Midwives' Notification System, the Hospital Morbidity Data System and the national Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme dataset. The women with depression during their pregnancy were ascertained in two ways From 2002 to 2005, there were 96698 births in WA. At least one antidepressant was dispensed to 4485 (4.6%) pregnant women. There were 3010 (3.1%) women with a comorbidity related to depression recorded on their delivery admission, or other admission to hospital during pregnancy. There were a total of 7495 pregnancies identified by either set of records. Using data linkage, we determined that these records represented 6596 individual pregnancies. Only 899 pregnancies were found in both groups (13.6% of all cases). 80% of women dispensed an antidepressant did not have depression recorded as a comorbidity on their hospital records. A simple capture-recapture calculation suggests the prevalence of depression in this population of pregnant women to be around 16%. No single data source is likely to provide a complete health profile for an individual. For women with depression in pregnancy and dispensed antidepressants, the hospital admission data do not adequately capture all cases.\n \nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) and sociodemographic parameters on depression during pregnancy. Between September 2010 and September 2011, 200 consecutive women with HG were defined as the study group and 200 consecutive pregnant women without any signs and symptoms of HG, and matched for age, parity, and gestational age were defined as the control group. The Beck depression inventory-II (BDI-II) questionnaire and sociodemographic questionnaire evaluating educational level, occupation, economic status, and obstetric history were given to all participants for self-completion. The forms were collected within 6 h of hospital admission. Groups were compared according to the presence of depression and predictors of depression were analyzed by regression analysis. Median BDI-II scores in study and control groups were 15 and 5, respectively. The difference was statistically significant (p < 0.001). In the HG group, 35.1% of patients had mild depression, 26.0% moderate, and 17.8% had severe depression, while only 5% of patients in the control group had mild depression and 95% had no depression. Multivariate analysis showed that HG, age and family relationship were related to depression during pregnancy. Moreover, depression risk was increased 76-fold in patients with HG (odds ratio = 76.000; 95% confidence interval Depression risk is increased in patients with HG, therefore not only medical therapy of HG, but also psychiatric evaluation should be considered for these patients.\n"}]}]}}

Any recurrence of PAF or atrial fibrillation with bradycardia was assessed at the time of stroke onset. Logistic regression analysis showed that the absence of warfarin therapy constituted a risk factor for post-CABG stroke associated with PAF (Odds 13.04, p = 0.027). Warfarin therapy administered concomitantly with an antiplatelet agent dramatically reduced the incidence of ischemic stroke associated with postoperative PAF.\n \nThe study was done to determine whether eptifibatide, a platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa antagonist, prevents ischemic complications following percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) in women as well as in men.

This is a cost-utility study from a health care system's perspective comparing coformulated fixed dose (FXD) strategy versus multiple free dose combination (FRC) in antiretroviral therapy. The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) was used to identify HIV/AIDS patients with \u22652 active antiretroviral medications. Patients on FXD were matched in 1:1 ratio with the FRC group using propensity scores. All medical costs excluding those paid by patients and families were included. Utility was measured using SF-6D scores from the SF-12 questionnaire. Incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs) were calculated using the mean annual estimates. A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve was determined using a Monte Carlo probabilistic simulation technique. Nine FXD antiretroviral formulations approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by 2005 was included in this study. One hundred seventy HIV/AIDS patients with \u22652 antiretroviral agents were identified from the MEPS database, of which 53% (n=92) were on FXD formulation. On matching, 70 patients from FXD had a match from the FRC group. No differences in sociodemographic and health status variables were observed between the matched groups. The mean annual cost was $15,766.15 for FXD patients and $11,875.21 for FRC patients. The mean utility gained by using FXD over FRC was 0.085; however, this difference was not statistically significant. The ICUR for the FXD treatment over FRC treatment was $45,540.49/quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed FXD to dominate FRC (>50% probability of being cost-effective) above the $40,000 threshold. Although the cost-effectiveness of a single-pill strategy was within the acceptable willingness-to-pay threshold, the QALY difference were minimal. Further research is recommended to explore the long-term impact of the strategy.\n \nPatient reported outcome studies are extremely valuable. We hypothesize that breast reduction surgery has a high satisfaction rate, and that body mass index (BMI), and the amount of breast tissue removed would not alter this outcome. The purpose of this study was to determine if there is an improvement in the quality of life in patients undergoing breast reduction surgery, and whether breast volume or patient size influences this outcome. A retrospective chart review was performed on 600 consecutive patients at a single institution from 2000 to 2010. Patients were mailed The Breast Q questionnaire to complete. Demographic, surgical, and clinical data were collected and entered into a database. Descriptive statistical analyses were conducted using SAS Software version 9.1.3 with statistical significance determined at P<0.05. A total of 178 surveys were returned and included in our study (a response rate of 29.6%). Patient data included a mean BMI of 28.3 (4.6) kg/m, and mean total amount of breast tissue removed of 1220.9 (665.4) g. The primary indications for patients having breast surgery were for symptomatic macromastia (85%), asymmetry (5.6%), and for cosmesis (2.5%). The Breast Q questionnaire demonstrated patients overwhelmingly agreed that they were satisfied with their breast surgery. The mean response was 2.8 with a standard deviation (SD) of 0.47 (where 1, disagree; 2, somewhat agree; and 3, definitely agree). Patient BMI and total amount of breast tissue removed had a statistically significant positive correlation (0.479; P<0.0001). There was no statistically significant difference between the amount of total breast tissue removed and patient response (P=0.57). The study supports a positive outcome after breast reduction surgery. Over 95% of the patients surveyed were satisfied and would do it again. It demonstrates the improvement of the patient's quality of life regardless of the amount of breast tissue removed. Furthermore, it suggests that the size and weight of the patient has no impact on this outcome. As we face new government and insurance restrictions for surgeries that have both cosmetic and reconstructive value, patient reported outcome studies may have an influence on future third-party payer.\n"}]}]}}

Fourteen reviews were identified; 147 of the 156 primary studies included in these reviews were obtained and assessed. We extracted data on whether the dimensions place of residence, race/ethnicity/culture, occupation, gender, religion, education, socioeconomic status, and social capital and networks (PROGRESS) were reported or analyzed, and whether any interventions were aimed at disadvantaged or low- and middle-income country populations. Among the dimensions of PROGRESS reported at baseline in 147 primary studies, gender (89%) was the most commonly reported, followed by education (25%) and race/ethnicity (18%). Less than 50% of the systematic reviews reported dimensions of PROGRESS even when they had been reported in the primary study. Of 147 primary studies, 6 (5%) were aimed specifically at disadvantaged populations; another 6 reported on effectiveness by at least 1 dimension of PROGRESS. Primary studies of interventions for rheumatoid arthritis generally reported few variables necessary to answer questions about health inequalities. Most CMSG systematic reviews failed to assess those variables even when described in the primary studies.

Baseline electrophysiological evaluation evidenced, in comparison to HC, a partial preservation of cortical effective connectivity and excitability in clinically defined MCS, whereas these components were absent in clinically defined UWS. Then, we applied an anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (a-tDCS) protocol over the orbitofrontal cortex. a-tDCS was able to boost cortical connectivity and excitability in all HC, MCS, and to unmask such excitability/connectivity in some UWS patients. a-tDCS could be useful in identifying residual connectivity markers in clinically-defined UWS, who may lack of purposeful behavior as a result of a motor-output failure.\n \nTo determine the potential prognostic value of using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify patients with disorders of consciousness, who show potential for recovery. Observational study. Unit for acute rehabilitation care. Patients (N=22) in a vegetative state (VS; n=10) and minimally conscious state (MCS; n=12) during the first 200 days after the initial incident. Not applicable. Further course on the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised. Participants performed a mental imagery fMRI paradigm. They were asked to alternately imagine playing tennis and navigating through their home. In 14 of the 22 examined patients (VS, n=5; MCS, n=9), a significant activation of the regions of interest (ROIs) of the mental imagery paradigm could be found. All 5 patients with activation of a significant blood oxygen level dependent signal, who were in a VS at the time of the fMRI examination, reached at least an MCS at the end of the observation period. In contrast, 5 participants in a VS who failed to show activation in ROIs, did not (sensitivity 100%, specificity 100%). Six of 9 patients in an MCS with activation in ROIs emerged from an MCS. Of 3 patients in an MCS who did not show activation, 2 patients stayed in an MCS and 1 patient emerged from the MCS (sensitivity 85%, specificity 40%). The fMRI paradigm mental imagery displays a high concordance with the further clinical course of patients in a VS. All 5 patients in a VS who showed significant activation of ROIs had a favorable further course until the end of the observation period. We therefore propose the term \"functional minimally conscious state\" for these patients. They may benefit from rehabilitation treatment. In cases where no significant activation was seen, the method has no prognostic value. Prediction of the clinical course of patients in an MCS by fMRI was considerably less accurate than in patients in a VS.\n"}]}]}}

However, patients receiving AIs report a higher incidence of musculoskeletal symptoms and bone fractures; the mechanism and risk factors for this correlation are not well studied. The aim of this study was to correlate these musculoskeletal symptoms and bone fractures in patients receiving AIs with bone mineral density (BMD), previous tamoxifen use, and administration of calcium/bisphosphonate (Ca/Bis). We reviewed charts of 856 patients with hormone receptor-positive nonmetastatic breast cancer seen at our institution between January 1999 and October 2007. A total of 316 patients met the inclusion criteria of treatment with one of the AIs for > or = 3 months and availability of a dualenergy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) during this treatment. Arthralgia, generalized bone pain and/or myalgia, bone fracture after beginning AIs, any tamoxifen treatment, and Ca/Bis therapy were recorded. Our study demonstrates a significant association between symptoms and DEXA-BMD results (P < .001). Similarly, the group receiving tamoxifen before AIs had fewer patients with arthralgia or generalized bone pain/myalgia or bone fracture (P < .001). Furthermore, the group receiving AIs plus Ca/Bis had more patients without musculoskeletal symptoms and had fewer fractures. Finally, the group receiving steroidal AIs compared with nonsteroidal AIs had more patients with arthralgia or generalized bone pain and/or myalgia, and bone fractures (P < .001). Patients on AIs who develop osteoporosis are at increased risk of musculoskeletal symptoms and bone fracture. Comedication with Ca/Bis reduces the likelihood for osteoporosis and musculoskeletal symptoms. Patients who received tamoxifen before AIs were less likely to develop AI-related musculoskeletal symptoms. We recommend that patients on AIs should be offered Ca/Bis to reduce the incidence of musculoskeletal symptoms and fracture, especially if patients are receiving steroidal AI and/or did not receive tamoxifen before AIs.\n \nThe aim of the present study was to provide a description of the impact of setting on the diagnostic case mix that is identified in consecutive patients presenting with chest pain. A cross-sectional study was carried out of patients presenting with chest pain according to setting Gastrointestinal disorders, musculoskeletal problems and psychopathology are identified more frequently in general practice; and serious lung diseases and cardiovascular diseases in the hospital ED. Within the hospital, there is a strong trend towards increasing frequency of serious cardiovascular diseases including unstable angina (P = 0.01) from self-referred to referred patients and those rushed in by ambulance. The opposite trend was identified for respiratory (P = 0.02) and musculoskeletal (P = 0.07) diseases. The diagnostic case mix in self-referred patients tends to be more similar to the other groups of hospital patients than to patients in general practice. There is a large difference between the diagnostic case mix presented in general practice compared with the ED and among referral-related subgroups within the hospital emergency department.\n"}]}]}}

To discuss whether such procedures are feasible and effective to identify asymptomatic recurrences and describe the pattern of relapse detected by procedures. The records of 282 consecutive women with recurrent endometrial cancer treated from 1986 to 2005 were retrospectively collected in 8 Italian institutions. Primary disease, clinical history, and recurrence features and data were analyzed. Thirty-five (12.4%) of 282 patients had recurrence in vaginal vault, 51 patients (18.0%) had recurrence in central pelvis, 14 patients (4.9%) had recurrence in pelvic wall, and 39 patients (13.8%) had recurrence in lymph nodes. One-hundred twenty-eight patients (45.3%) showed a distant relapse, whereas 15 patients (5.3%) developed both distant relapse and local relapse. The site of relapse influenced survival because the patients with vaginal vault recurrences lived significantly longer than the patients with recurrences in other sites. Eighty (28.4%) of the 282 patients became symptomatic and anticipated the scheduled visit, 37 (13.1 %) of the patients reported their symptoms during the follow-up meeting, and 165 (58.5 %) of the patients were asymptomatic and the diagnostic path was introduced by a planned visit or examination. Among the asymptomatic patients, the first procedure that led to further examinations was clinical visit alone for 60 (36.4%) of 165 patients, imaging for 103 patients (62.4%), and cytologic examination for 2 patients (1.2%). Symptoms at recurrence can predict survival Follow-up after endometrial cancer treatment varies in Italy. In this retrospective study, women with asymptomatic recurrence have shown a better clinical outcome compared with those with symptomatic relapse. The optimal approach is actually unknown, and guidelines comparing follow-up protocols have not been established. Prospective cost-effectiveness studies are needed.\n \nGranulosa cell tumors (GCTs) are the most common estrogen-secreting ovarian tumors; perhaps due to the persistent hyperestrogenism, a wide spectrum of associated endometrial pathologies ranging from endometrial hyperplasia to carcinoma has been documented in patients with GCTs. The aim of this study is to evaluate the incidence of endometrial pathologies in a large series of GCT patients treated in MITO centers. A retrospective multi-institutional review of patients with granulosa cell tumors of the ovary treated or referred to MITO centers was conducted. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the patient population and to assess the association of GCT and endometrial abnormalities at the time of diagnosis; multivariate regression analysis was also performed to identify independent predictors of endometrial abnormalities. A total of 150 patients with primary adult GCT was identified. During the preoperative assessment, endometrial pathology was found in 35.9% of symptomatic patients and in 90.9% of asymptomatic women with endometrial thickening at transvaginal ultrasound. At the time of surgery, hyperplasia was documented in 29.2% of patients, whereas endometrial cancer occurred in 7.5% of patients. Almost all of the patients (97.6%) with endometrial hyperplasia were older than 40years. All patients with endometrial cancer were older than 40years and postmenopausal. Endometrial carcinoma/atypical hyperplasia were commonly observed in GCT patients >40years; based on these data, endometrial sampling should be performed in symptomatic women at least 40years of age. In asymptomatic women <40years, endometrial sampling is of low yield.\n"}]}]}}

CD Fischer rats were subject to LITT of the left forebrain. Disruption of the BBB was analyzed using Evans blue and immunohistochemistry (IH). Animals were perfused with paclitaxel, and high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) was employed to analyze the content of paclitaxel in brain and plasma samples.

Only patients with isolated nasal fractures were included in the study. Patients with additional maxillofacial fractures and patients whose application time to our clinic was more than 10 days after the trauma were excluded. Patients were classified into 5 types according to their fracture. All patients underwent closed reduction and external fixation under local anesthesia. Patients were asked about their satisfaction in a survey at 28th day and sixth month after the surgery. Patients were divided into groups according to fracture type and intervention time, and the results of the survey were evaluated. Of the 43 patients included in the study, 38 were male, 5 were female, and the average age was 24.9. The average intervention time of the patients was 5.44 days. Twenty-eight (65%) of 43 patients were satisfied with the result, whereas 15 (35%) patients were not happy with their operation. In a comparison of patient satisfaction rates according to fracture type, the mild fracture group had a higher satisfaction rate compared to the severe fracture group. Closed reduction is an easy and sufficient treatment for nasal fractures, especially for mild nasal fractures. Early intervention raises the patient satisfaction rate.\n"}]}]}}

In the period ranging from 1997 to 2003, 62 patients with EA underwent preoperative TBS. The procedure was carried out with flexible bronchoscope maintaining spontaneous breathing. When a wide carinal fistula was found, this was mechanically occluded by Fogarty catheter and cannulated with rigid bronchoscopy.

Between February 1991 and February 2006, a consecutive series of 142 patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma (EADC) underwent esophageal resection. To reconstruct the upper gastrointestinal tract, all patients had a narrow gastric tube (greater curvature of stomach based on the right gastroepiploic artery) transposed through the posterior mediastinum to the left neck where an anastomosis to the cervical esophagus was performed. From a prospective database, 15 patients were identified to have undergone an 'open' fundoplication (transabdominal Nissen, n=11; transthoracic Belsey, n=4) from 12 to 23 years earlier. Outcomes were compared between patients with EADC who had undergone previous fundoplication, and patients with EADC who never had antireflux surgery. Gastric transposition and cervical esophagogastrostomy were technically feasible in all patients. No significant differences in outcome were found between patient groups. Gastric necrosis developed in only one patient, who had not undergone previous fundoplication. Anastomotic leak rates after esophageal resection and reconstruction were not statistically different based on whether patients had undergone previous fundoplication (2/15, 13.3%) or not (16/127, 12.6%; p=0.99). With careful attention to surgical technique, previous fundoplication does not preclude the use of stomach to reconstruct the foregut after esophageal resection, refuting the notion that previous antireflux surgery is a relative contraindication to, or alters the approach to esophageal cancer surgery.\n"}]}]}}

Sixty females had their Q angles measured in bilateral and unilateral stance. Linear regressions showed predictive equations and positive correlations for unilateral and bilateral stance Q angles (r=0.81-0.89, p<0.001). The equations generated were used to predict unilateral Q angle from bilateral Q angle measurements in 12 patients with patellofemoral joint pain. The actual unilateral Q angle measurement of the symptomatic knee was significantly greater than that predicted for each individual (p=0.01), whilst the asymptomatic knee showed no significant difference (p=0.16). This study showed a strong positive relationship between bilateral and unilateral stance Q angles which could be represented in a positive linear regression equation. The linear regression equation was then used to predict the effect on the Q angle of moving from a bilateral to a unilateral stance. It has been found previously that patients with patellofemoral joint pain on loading the limb in unilateral stance in activities such as walking and stair descent have increased knee valgus angle. The current study supports those findings indicating that when taking up unilateral stance patients with patellofemoral joint pain demonstrate greater than expected increase in Q angle which could increase loading on the patellofemoral joint.\n \nTo determine whether audiologic characteristics of unilateral hearing loss in children were associated with language, cognitive, or achievement scores. Case-control study Pediatric otolaryngology ambulatory practice Cases (n = 109) were children aged 6 to 12 years with permanent unilateral hearing loss; controls (n = 95) were siblings with normal bilateral hearing. Audiologic characteristics measured included side and severity of hearing loss and word recognition scores in quiet and in noise. Cognitive abilities were measured using the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence; reading, math, and writing achievement was measured with the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test - Second Edition - Abbreviated; and oral language skills were measured with the Oral Written and Language Scales. Children with unilateral hearing loss had worse verbal cognitive and oral language scores than children with normal hearing, but there were no differences in achievement scores. Children with profound unilateral hearing loss tended to have worse cognitive scores and had significantly lower oral language scores. Higher word recognition scores of the normal hearing ear in quiet were associated with higher cognitive, oral language, and reading achievement scores. Higher word recognition scores in noise were slightly correlated with higher oral language scores. As expected, children with unilateral hearing loss had worse language scores than their siblings with normal hearing, with trends toward worse cognitive scores. Children with profound unilateral hearing loss tended to have worse outcomes than children with normal hearing or less severe unilateral loss.

Appropriate citations were also extracted from a manual search of the bibliographies of selected papers. Twenty-three articles were retrieved. Only 4 presented original data including comparisons to a nonexposed control group and they form the basis for this study. Because the raw data or specific techniques of data analysis were not always explicitly described, indices of risk for exposure were extracted from the data as presented and were analysed without attempting to convert them to a common measure. Articles were assessed according to the criteria of the Evidence-Based Medicine Working Group for evaluating articles on harm. Review of the literature yielded estimates of the risk of adverse fertility outcomes ranging from 1.6 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1 to 2.5) for ectopic pregnancy after an appendectomy to 4.8 (95% CI 1.5 to 14.9) for tubal infertility from perforation of the appendix. Recall bias, and poor adjustment for confounding variables in some reports, weakened the validity of the studies. The methodologic weaknesses of the studies do not permit acceptance of increased risk of tubal pregnancy or infertility as a consequence of perforation of the appendix, so a causal relationship cannot be supported by the data currently available.

All patients underwent myringoplasty using temporalis fascia in an underlay technique. Comparison of the preoperative and postoperative hearing results in patients undergoing myringoplasty for chronic otitis media simplex. The mean postoperative air-bone gap (ABG) was 8.2 dB for the frequencies 0.5 to 4 kHz. Eighty-three patients (78%) showed postoperatively a mean ABG of 10 dB or lower. The ABG difference (improvement) was statistically significant for each single frequency (0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 4 kHz) (p < 0.0001). There is a linear correlation between the preoperative tympanic membrane perforation size and the postoperative ABG (p = 0.0017) for the frequencies 0.5 to 4 kHz. No statistical significant correlation was seen between the state of the middle-ear mucosa, temporal bone pneumatization, tympanometric middle-ear/mastoid volume, and the postoperative ABG. Complete ABG closure by myringoplasty could be achieved in only approximately 20% of the cases. 80% respectively presented with a mean residual ABG of 8 dB. We found a significant linear correlation between the preoperative size of the tympanic membrane perforation and the postoperative ABG, whereas mastoid volume, temporal bone pneumatization, and the condition of the mucosa did not affect the outcome.\n"}]}]}}

We developed a remote examiner OSCE (reOSCE) that was integrated into a traditional OSCE to establish whether remote examination technology may be used to bridge this gap. The purpose of this study was to explore whether remote physician-examiners can replace on-site physician-examiners in an OSCE, and to determine the feasibility of this new examination method. Forty Year 3 medical students were randomised into six reOSCE stations that were incorporated into two tracks of a 10-station traditional OSCE. For the reOSCE stations, student performance was assessed by both a local examiner (LE) in the room and a remote examiner (RE) who viewed the OSCE encounters from a distance. The primary endpoint was the correlation of scores between LEs and REs across all reOSCE stations. The secondary endpoint was a post-OSCE survey of both REs and students. Statistically significant correlations were found between LE and RE checklist scores for history taking (r = 0.64-r = 0.80), physical examination (r = 0.41-r = 0.54), and management stations (r = 0.78). Correlations between LE and RE global ratings were more varied (r = 0.21-r = 0.77). Correlations on three of the six stations reached significance. Qualitative analysis of feedback from REs and students showed high acceptance of the reOSCE despite technological issues. This preliminary study demonstrated that OSCE ratings by LEs and REs were reasonably comparable when using checklists.

These syndromes are proposed to be bound to certain cultures and distinct from other psychological disorders. Included among the syndromes are ataques de nervios (ADN), which are reported to be bound to the Hispanic culture and closely resemble panic attacks. However, the cultural distinctiveness and phenomenology of ADN has not been adequately investigated. The current study employed an ethnically diverse study sample (N=342) of undergraduates. Participants completed a number of measures that assessed acculturation, syndrome and anxiety risk factors. In contrast to the DSM-IV's conceptualization of ADN, the rate of ADN did not significantly vary across the three main groups (African American, Caucasian, and Hispanic participants) nor did it vary based on acculturation. More consistent with the DSM-IV, the symptom comparisons indicated some differentiation between ADN and panic attacks. The present report provides data indicating that ADNs, as described by the DSM-IV, are not unique to the Hispanic culture and are experienced by non-Hispanic individuals at similar rates to Hispanic-endorsement. The findings are consistent with the DSM-IV assertion that ADNs and PAs are distinct syndromes.\n \nRecently, several studies have demonstrated that articles that disclose conflicts of interests (COI) are associated with publication of positive results. The purpose of this study was to learn more about the different types of COI as they relate to the general topic of COI in plastic surgery. Specifically, we aimed to examine whether different types of COI are more likely than others to be associated with the presentation of positive findings. We reviewed all original articles in Annals of Plastic Surgery, Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive, and Aesthetic Surgery, and Plastic & Reconstructive Surgery from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2013. All scientific articles were analyzed, and several article characteristics were extracted. Disclosed COI were categorized into the following categories A total of 3124 articles were identified of which 1185 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Financial COI were reported in 153 studies (12.9%). The most common type of COI was \"research support\" (7.3%), whereas the least common was \"royalties/stock options\" (1.2%). Rates of different types of COI varied significantly by plastic surgery subspecialty field (P < 0.001). In the multivariable analysis, authors who disclosed COI related to research support, consultant/employee, and royalties/stock options were 1.31, 6.62, and 8.72 times more likely, respectively, to publish positive findings when compared with authors that disclosed no COI after correcting for potential confounding factors. However, consultancy/employee status was the only COI category statistically associated with publication of positive results (P < 0.001). Self-reported COI are uncommon in plastic surgery research. Our results provide evidence that certain types of financial COI are more likely than others to be associated with the presentation of positive findings. This analysis suggests that certain investigators may be more biased, consciously or unconsciously, by the type of financial benefit offered by industry.\n"}]}]}}

Data were obtained from the 2002 and 2007 U.S. National Health Interview Survey to compare the use of 22 CAM therapies (n=9313 and n=7014, respectively). Estimates were age adjusted to the year 2000 U.S. standard population. The unadjusted and age-standardized prevalence of overall CAM use (22 therapies comparable between both survey years) was higher in 2007 than in 2002 (30.6% versus 26.9%, p<0.001 and 34.4% versus 30.6%, p<0.001, respectively).

Demographic analysis of data published by EUROSTAT and Czech statistical office. Department of Demography and Geodemography Faculty of Science, Charles University Prague. Widespread use of the liberal abortion law in socialist countries contributed to the decline of fertility rates only to the replacement level. In the Czech Republic total fertility rate dropped below 1.3 in 1995 and it did not increase above 1.5 children per woman till 2007. The increased use of modern contraceptive methods that results in a sharp decline in fertility and in a significant decrease of induced abortions can be documented. The total abortion rate fell from 1.54 abortions per a woman in 1990 to 0.34 in 2007. The proportion of women aged 15-49 years who were prescribed oral contraception increased from 4 percent in 1990 to 48 percent in 2007. An induced abortion is still used largely as a way to avoid birth of additional children by women who already have the number of children they want. This is in sharp contrast with the situation in the majority of Western European countries in which abortion is used mainly by teen-age girls whose attempts to avoid pregnancy have failed. In contrast to other demographic characteristics which classify the Czech Republic to Eastern Europe, the level of induced abortion rate is comparable with the levels observed in some Western European countries.\n"}]}]}}

Prospective, descriptive preliminary study of in vitro fertilization outcome.

The outcomes were analyzed with respect to antral follicle assessment (< or = 6 or > 6), basal cycle day 3 follicle stimulated hormone (< or = 10 or > 10 IU/L) and maternal age (< or = 35 or > 35 years). The clinical pregnancy rate was significantly higher in the group with baseline antral follicle > 6 compared to that in the group with antral follicle < or = 6 (51% vs. 19%, respectively). Controlling for patient age, and basal follicle stimulated hormone, the pregnancy rate was significantly higher in the group with antral follicle > 6 compared to that in the group with antral follicle < or = 6. The cancellation rate was significantly increased with advancing maternal age, elevated basal follicle stimulated hormone levels, and baseline antral follicle < or = 6. The cancellation rate was significantly higher in the group with antral follicle < or = 6 compared to that in the group with antral follicle > or = 6 (33% vs. 1%, respectively). In vitro fertilization outcome is strongly correlated with both maternal ages, basal cycle, day 3 follicle, stimulated hormone, and antral follicle assessment. Antral follicle assessment was a better predictor of in vitro fertilization outcome than were age or follicle stimulated hormone.

One hundred sixteen patients who were hospitalized in the coronary care unit were included in the study. Psychiatric assessment of the patients was carried out within 1-6months post-MI. Psychiatric interviews were conducted with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-I). Also used were the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and Health Anxiety Inventory (HAI). A total of 116 patients were divided into two groups according to age as an early age myocardial infarction group (EA-MI) and a late age myocardial infarction group (LA-MI). The EA-MI group included 24 patients 45years of age and under. The LA-MI group included 92 patients over 45years of age. Current psychiatric disorders, lifetime psychiatric disorders and lifetime depressive disorders were significantly more frequent in the EA-MI group than in the LA-MI group. EA-MI patients have experienced a depressive episode prior to the onset of the MI, whereas in the LA-MI group, the patients typically experienced depressive episodes after MI. Our findings suggest that depression may increase the risk of MI at an early age.\n"}]}]}}

Immigration and the category of employment are risk factors for iron deficiency, as starting baby cereals before 9 months is a protective factor.

In unicompartmental replacement, the other compartments and knee ligaments are largely untouched. Therefore, it was hypothesized that the knee kinematics after unicompartmental replacement may also be unchanged. To test this hypothesis, knee kinematics and quadriceps tension were recorded before and after replacement with a unicompartmental design and then with a tricompartmental design. Six human cadaver knees were tested before implantation, after implantation with a bicruciate-retaining unicompartmental knee prosthesis, and after implantation with a posterior cruciate-retaining tricompartmental knee prosthesis. The unicompartmental prosthesis was initially implanted, and it was then revised to a total condylar knee replacement. The knee kinematics were measured with use of an electromagnetic tracking device while the knee was put through dynamic simulated stair-climbing under peak flexion moments of approximately 40 N-m. Quadriceps tension was also measured for all three conditions. No significant differences in tibial axial rotation were noted between the intact and unicompartmental conditions. However, tricompartmental replacement significantly affected tibial axial rotation (p = 0.001). Femoral rollback was not significantly affected by either unicompartmental or tricompartmental arthroplasty. Quadriceps tension was also similar among all three conditions. In this in vitro cadaver study, the tricompartmental replacement significantly changed knee kinematics while the unicompartmental replacement preserved normal knee kinematics.\n \nThe posterior tibial slope influences both the natural knee stability as well as the stability and kinematics after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Exact definition of the posterior tibial slope (PTS) requires lateral radiographs of the lower limb. Only lateral knee radiographs are routinely obtained after TKA, however. The purpose of the present study therefore was to analyse the relationship between PTS measurement results on short and expanded lateral knee radiographs. The PTS was measured on 100 consecutive lateral radiographs of the lower limb using the mechanical and three diaphyseal axes with various distances below the tibial plateau. Significant differences between PTS results were found for all three diaphyseal axes, with the smallest differences and the strongest correlation for a diaphyseal axis at 16 and 20\u00a0cm below the tibial plateau. Using short distances below the tibial plateau (6 and 10\u00a0cm) resulted in an overestimation of the PTS of 3\u00b0, on average. The PTS measurements in long lateral knee radiographs are more accurate compared to short radiographs. On short lateral knee radiographs, only a estimation of the PTS can be carried out.

There are 71 previously untreated patients with cytological or histological evidence of primary lung cancer who were admitted to the oncology department between November 2013 and August 2014. Forty-five healthy individuals with age, sex and BMI matching the lung cancer patients, were recruited to take part in the study as a control group. Leptin levels were measured quantitatively by using a microELISA kit. The serum leptin levels at diagnosis were significantly lower in lung cancer patients than those in control subjects (4.75\u00b14.91 ng/ml, 9.67\u00b18.02 ng/ml; p<0.001). We did not find any significant difference in leptin values related to clinicopathological parameters such as ECOG PS, weight loss, histological type, disease stage and TNM classification. Nevertheless, we demonstrated a significant correlation between serum leptin levels and BMI in lung cancer patients (correlation coefficient Our results showed that the serum leptin level has no prognostic indications in advanced lung cancer patients. Leptin is decreased in lung cancer, and there is lack of correlation with tumour\u2011related factors including prognosis. Therefore, leptin is not a useful clinical marker in lung cancer (Tab. 2, Fig. 2, Ref. 22).\n \nThe limited information on serum leptin levels in elderly men suggests the occurrence of an age-related decrease, with disruption of the relationship between fat mass and leptin levels. A relative leptin deficiency might thus be implicated in the increase of fat mass and decrease of serum testosterone levels in elderly men. Therefore, we have reevaluated the age-related changes in serum leptin levels and their relationship with adiposity and androgen levels in a large group of community dwelling men. Serum leptin and androgen levels were measured in 271 healthy, ambulatory elderly men (median age 74 years), as well as in 61 middle-aged (median 43 years) and 40 young (median 25.5 years) controls. Adiposity was assessed by anthropometrical measurements (body mass index; BMI) and by estimation of fat mass by the bio-impedance method. Serum leptin levels, whether or not adjusted for BMI, were found to increase with age, the values tending to level off after the age of 45 years, and were strongly correlated to BMI (r = 0.77) and fat mass assessed by the bio-impedance method (r = 0.81). Linear regression analysis showed a similar slope for the relationship between BMI and serum leptin in the three age groups. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated BMI, age and serum insulin, but not serum testosterone, as significant independent correlates of serum leptin. Serum (free) testosterone levels were negatively correlated with age and serum leptin, also after partialization for BMI Ageing in men is accompanied by a rise of serum leptin levels with a maintained strong association between serum leptin and adiposity in elderly men. Testosterone does not appear to be a major determinant of serum leptin in healthy men, while leptin does emerge as a negative correlate of serum testosterone. Increased fat mass and decreased testosterone production in elderly men cannot be attributed to a relative leptin deficiency.\n"}]}]}}

This study attempted to find gender preferences of children and parents for the physician in the emergency department. We undertook this study to determine whether pediatric patients or their parents have a preference for physicians of a particular gender. We also tried to determine whether they would be willing to wait longer to be seen to accommodate their choice. A total of 200 children aged between 8 and 13 years presenting to our pediatric emergency department for laceration repair were enrolled. With the knowledge and consent of their parents, the enrolled children were given a short questionnaire. They were asked, if they had a choice, would they prefer to have a male or a female doctor or would they prefer the doctor with the most experience. Their parents were also then given the questionnaire. They were also asked if they would be willing to wait longer to be seen by the doctor of their choice. The study sample comprised 200 children, 139 boys and 61 girls. Among boys, 78% (n = 109) said they would prefer a female physician. Only 21% (n = 30) preferred a male physician. Among girls, 80% (n = 49) reported they would prefer a female physician, 20% (n = 12) preferred a male physician. None of the children surveyed wanted the \"best\" physician. When the parents were surveyed, 60% (n = 120) preferred a male physician as compared with 19% (n = 38) who expressed a preference for female physician. Only 21% (n = 42) of parents desired the most experienced physician of either sex to repair the laceration. All the parents who expressed a preference for the \"most experienced\" physician said they were willing to wait (42/42) until that physician was available as compared with less than a third of parents who were willing to wait for the physician of a specific gender (44/158). Most children (79%) preferred a female physician for their sutures, whereas parents overall (60%) appeared to prefer a male physician. The children did not appear to care if the physician was the \"best.\" Surprisingly, many parents also chose physician gender rather than physician experience. One hundred percent of the parents who chose the most experienced physician were willing to wait longer to be seen as compared with 29% who preferred a physician of a particular gender.\n"}]}]}}

Although AF can have a genetic etiology, links between inherited gene defects and acquired factors such as atrial stretch have not been explored. Mutation screening of the KCNQ1, KCNE1, KCNE2, and KCNE3 genes was performed in 50 families with AF. The effects of mutant protein on cardiac I(Ks) activation were evaluated using electrophysiological studies and human atrial action potential modeling. One missense KCNQ1 mutation, R14C, was identified in 1 family with a high prevalence of hypertension. Atrial fibrillation was present only in older individuals who had developed atrial dilation and who were genotype positive. Patch-clamp studies of wild-type or R14C KCNQ1 expressed with KCNE1 in CHO cells showed no statistically significant differences between wild-type and mutant channel kinetics at baseline, or after activation of adenylate cyclase with forskolin. After exposure to hypotonic solution to elicit cell swelling/stretch, mutant channels showed a marked increase in current, a leftward shift in the voltage dependence of activation, altered channel kinetics, and shortening of the modeled atrial action potential duration. These data suggest that the R14C KCNQ1 mutation alone is insufficient to cause AF. Rather, we suggest a model in which a \"second hit\", such as an environmental factor like hypertension, which promotes atrial stretch and thereby unmasks an inherited defect in ion channel kinetics (the \"first hit\"), is required for AF to be manifested. Such a model would also account for the age-related increase in AF development.\n \nPatients with an accessory pathway (AP) have an increased propensity to develop atrial fibrillation (AF), but the mechanism is unknown. The purpose of this study was to identify crucial risk factors and to test the hypothesis that reflection and/or microreentry of atrial impulses propagating into the AP triggers AF. Five hundred thirty-four patients successfully treated with radiofrequency ablation of AP at two university hospitals were evaluated. Patients were separated into those with concealed vs those with manifest AP in terms of their propensity to develop AF. To investigate AF triggering mechanisms, linear and branched two-dimensional models of atrium-to-ventricle propagation across a heterogeneous 1 x 6 AP using human ionic kinetics were simulated. A history of AF was twice as common in patients with manifest AP vs concealed AP irrespective of AP location. AF was more likely to occur in older males and in patients with larger atria. There was no correlation between AF history and AP refractory measures. However, the electrophysiologic properties of APs seemed to fulfill the prerequisites for reflection and/or microreentry of atrially initiated impulses. In the linear AP model, repetitive atrial stimulation resulted in progressively larger delay of atrium-to-ventricle propagation across the passive segment. Eventually, sufficient time for repolarization of the atrial segment allowed for reflection of an impulse that activated the entire atrium and by wavefront-wavetail interaction with a new atrial stimulus AF reentry was initiated. Simulations using the branched model showed that microreentry at the ventricular insertion of the AP could also initiate AF via retrograde atrial activation as a result of unidirectional block at the AP-ventricle junction. Propensity for AF in patients with an AP is strongly related to preexcitation, larger atria, male gender, and older age. Reflection and microreentry at the AP may be important for AF initiation in patients with manifest (preexcited) Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.

Sensitivity and specificity of several different criteria for detecting lymphedema were compared using the academic trial as the standard. Thirty-nine cases of lymphedema were identified by the academic trial. Using a 10% increase in circumference at two sites as the criterion, half the lymphedema cases were detected (sensitivity 37%). When using a 10% increase in circumference at any site, 74.4% of cases were detected (sensitivity 49%). Detection by a 5% increase in circumference at any site was 91% sensitive.

Longitudinal observational study of 36 months duration. A stratified random sample of 2,032 Chinese subjects (990 male, 1,033 female) mean age (s.d.) 80.1 (7.5), interviewed and examined at baseline and after 36 months. Deaths and presence of diabetes mellitus and hypertension were documented. A younger data set of 1,010 subjects (500 male, 510 female), mean age (s.d.) 45.5 (11.6), was used for comparison of the BMI-WC relationship between younger and older subjects. In predicting outcomes using different values of BMI, WC and WHR, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to derive cut-off values with optimal sensitivity and specificity, and the likelihood ratios for mortality, diabetes and hypertension for different anthropometric values were plotted. The waist circumference values corresponding to BMI values of 25 and 30 kg/m(2) were higher in elderly (92 and 103 cm for men; 88 and 99 cm for women) compared with younger subjects (85 and 97 cm for men; 78 and 88 cm for women). BMI and WC are inversely associated with mortality, in both men and women, positively associated with diabetes in men but not in women. WC was positively associated with hypertension in men and women. WHR was not associated with any outcome measures. The anthropometric measurement at the point of intersection of the likelihood curves for mortality and diabetes may be considered the optimum value, being BMI=21 kg/m(2) for men and 25 kg/m(2) for women, WC between 80 and 85 cm, and WHR 0.88-0.90. Waist measurement values for predicting health outcomes in elderly people aged 70 y and over are different compared with younger subjects, and have similar predictive accuracy compared with body mass index.

Aortic injury was assessed in accordance with the recommendations of the Society of Vascular Surgery. We measured the aortic arch angle and the aortic arch index, based on the initial angio-CT scan, in each of the analyzed cases. The mean aortic arch index and mean aortic arch angle were 6.8\u00a0cm and 58.3\u00b0, respectively, in the type I injury group; 4.4\u00a0cm and 45.9\u00b0 in the type III group; 3.3\u00a0cm and 37\u00b0 in the type IV group. There were substantial differences in both the aortic arch index and the aortic arch angle of the type III and IV groups. A multivariate analysis confirmed that the aortic arch angle was significantly associated with the occurrence of type III damage (OR 1.5; 95% CI 1.03-2.2). The severity of TAI is influenced by the sharpness of the aortic arch. There is an inverse relationship between the severity of aortic injury and the aortic arch index.\n \nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of our surgical strategy for acute aortic dissection based on the extent of the dissection and the site of the entry, with special emphasis on resection of all dissected aortic segments if technically possible. Between January 1995 and March 2001, 43 consecutive patients underwent operations for acute aortic dissection. In all patients the distal repair was performed under circulatory arrest without the use of an aortic cross-clamp. Fifteen patients underwent aortic arch replacement with additional reconstruction of supra-aortic vessels in 3 patients. Complete replacement of all dissected tissue could be achieved in 21 patients (group 1). Because of the distal extent of the dissection beyond the aortic arch, replacement of all the dissected tissue was not possible in 22 patients (group 2). Early mortality was 4.7% (2 patients), and the incidence of perioperative cerebrovascular events was 7.0% (3 patients). All of these events occurred in group 2 (p < 0.025). During the follow-up period of 6 years or less, 5 patients died, all from causes not related to the aorta or the aortic valve. A persisting patent false lumen was observed in 14 of the 36 surviving patients (39%). Extended replacement of the dissected ascending aorta and aortic arch can be done with good early and midterm results, even though it requires a complex surgical technique. Therefore we advocate complete replacement of the dissected parts of the aorta in all patients in whom this is technically possible.\n"}]}]}}

A retrospective chart review of gynecologic cancer patients admitted with NF from 2007 to 2011 was performed, wherein demographic, oncologic, and NF characteristics (hospitalization length, complications, and death) were collected. The Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) risk index score was calculated; low risk was considered \u2265 21. SAS 9.2 was used for statistical analyses. Eighty-three patients met the study criteria. Most (92%) were Caucasian and had advanced stage disease (71%). Primary tumors were 58% ovary, 35% endometrium, and 6% cervix. All patients were receiving chemotherapy on admission (72% for primary, 28% for recurrent disease). Forty-eight percent had a positive culture, and most (58%) positive cultures were urine. Seventy-six percent of patients were considered low risk. High-risk patients were more likely to have a severe complication (10% versus 50%, p=0.0003), multiple severe complications (3% versus 20%, p=0.0278), ICU admission (2% versus 40%, p<0.0001), overall mortality (2% versus 15%, p=0.0417), and death due to neutropenic fever (0% versus 15%, p=0.0124). MASCC had a positive predictive value of 50% and negative predictive value of 90%. The median MASCC score for all patients was 22 (range, 11-26), but the median MASCC score for those with death or a severe complication was 17 (range, 11-24). Based on this pilot data, MASCC score appears promising in determining suitability for outpatient management of NF in gynecologic oncology patients.

We analyzed microbial contamination records of HPC grafts between 2012 and 2015, retrospectively. Contamination rates of autologous donors were evaluated for at three steps A total of 445 mobilization procedures were carried out on 333 (167 autologous and 166 allogeneic) donors. The microbiological contamination of peripheral blood (323/333 donations) and bone marrow (10/333 donations) products were analyzed. Bacterial contamination was detected in 18 of 1552 (1.15 %) culture bottles of 333 donors. During the study period 248 patients underwent HCT and among these patients microbial contamination rate on sample basis was 1.3 % (16/1212). Microbial contamination detected in nine patients (7 autologous; 2 allogeneic). In 8 of 9 patients, a febrile neutropenic attack was observed. The median day for the neutropenic fever was 4 days (0-9). None of the patients died within the post-transplant 30 days who received contaminated products. The use of contaminated products with antibiotic prophylaxis may be safe in terms of the first day of fever, duration of fever, neutrophil, platelet engraftment and duration of hospitalization.\n"}]}]}}

However, sentinel lymph node biopsy is not widely accepted in patients of locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) [T3N1, Any T4, Any N2-3 with no distant metastasis] after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) and these patients routinely undergo axillary lymph node clearance. Axillary reverse mapping (ARM) with blue dye has the potential to differentiate the arm lymphatics from the breast lymphatics and it can be used to decrease lymphedema in patients undergoing ALND by preserving these lymphatics. However, ARM in LABC patients is yet to be accepted as the standard of care. 51 patients of locally advanced breast carcinoma were included in the study from May 2011 to May 2012. All patients received neo-adjuvant chemotherapy followed by modified radical mastectomy. Axillary reverse mapping (ARM) was carried out using blue dye. 2 ml of methylene blue dye was injected intradermal, upper medial aspect of the ipsilateral arm. The number, size and site and distribution of lymph nodes identified were recorded and the nodes were labelled as ARM nodes and complete axillary dissection was carried out. Blue nodes were identified in 45 (88.2%) out of the 51 patients. The average number of ARM nodes identified was 4.03 \u00b1 0.28 [range 1-8]. In majority (77.8%) of the cases, nodes were located in the triangle formed by axillary vein above, below by the first intercostobrachial nerve and medially by the chest wall/serratus anterior. In patients with complete or partial response to NACT, ARM and breast axillary LN were negative in 63.3% patients whereas 36.6% had positive breast but negative ARM nodes. In this study we did not intend to preserve any ARM nodes but in 90% of these cases, at least one ARM node had to be removed or was injured during axillary clearance. ARM nodes could be identified in 15 (83.3%) out of the 18 patients with stable or progressive disease following ARM. 12 (80%) out of these 15 cases demonstrated positive ARM and breast LN whereas 3 (20%) patients had positive breast but negative ARM nodes. Skin tattooing (82.3%) was the most common complication observed in our study. Identification rates of ARM nodes can be improved by injecting the blue dye in the upper medial aspect of the arm at the time of induction. Majority of the arm nodes lie between the axillary vein and the first intercostobrachial nerve. It is difficult to preserve the ARM nodes in patients of LABC, who have had good response to NACT and in patients of LABC with poor response to NACT, the incidence of metastasis in ARM nodes is quite high. Therefore, ARM is not a feasible option in patients with locally advanced breast cancer.\n"}]}]}}

The BMD at both sites decreased precipitously within 24 months of stopping treatment, raising the question as to whether bisphosphonates can be stopped in a growing child with skeletal fragility. At age 23 months, a male toddler sustained a low trauma fracture of his right femur. Skeletal radiographs revealed generalised osteopenia with multiple vertebral body fractures. He was diagnosed with type IV osteogenesis imperfecta; however, no mutations were found in COL1A1 or COL1A2 genes. This case report presents bone densitometry data before, during and after bisphosphonate treatment. Axial QCT was main outcome from 2 years of age; DXA and pQCT were taken after age 5. QCT confirmed that he had low spinal trabecular volumetric BMD (Z-score -2.4). After 4 years of treatment his vertebral fractures had been remodelled and all bone densitometry values (QCT, DXA and pQCT) were within normal range and therefore treatment was discontinued. Shortly after this he suffered stress fractures of his left mid tibia and at the sclerotic metaphyseal line corresponding to his first APD treatment. He had marked reduction in spinal trabecular and distal radial vBMD; change in BMAD was less marked. The patient has been restarted on IV APD therapy. This case has led us to consider whether bisphosphonate therapy can be discontinued in a child with fragility fractures before his/her linear growth has ceased?\n \nThe pathogenesis of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ) is not completely understood. The most popular hypothesis has suggested that the bone turnover (BT) in the jawbone is greater than that in other sites and that this turnover will be overly suppressed by bisphosphonates. Using bone scintigraphy, a simple tool for the quantitative evaluation of bone metabolism and blood flow, the goals of the present study were to determine whether the rate of bone remodeling is greater in the jaw and whether the bone BT in the jaw is differentially altered after bisphosphonate intake compared with that in other skeletal sites. The bone scintigraphies of 90 female patients with breast cancer were retrospectively analyzed (n\u00a0= 45 with bisphosphonate intake; n\u00a0= 45 without bisphosphonate intake [control group]). All patients in the study group had undergone bone scintigraphy before therapy and during the treatment (course after 12 and 24\u00a0months). The data were quantitatively analyzed using 6 predetermined regions of interest. The bone BT of the mandible was similar to that of the femur and significantly reduced compared with that of the maxilla (P < .01). None of the investigated bone regions (including the mandible and maxilla) were significantly altered after bisphosphonate administration (P > .05). The finding that the mandible had significantly lower bone BT than that of the maxilla and that two thirds of BRONJ cases occur in the mandible were inconsistent with the investigated hypothesis. Furthermore, the bone BT in the jawbone was not overly suppressed by bisphosphonates. Thus, it is unlikely that over suppression of bone BT is the exclusive causation playing a role in the pathomechanism of BRONJ.\n"}]}]}}

At our institution, a regional anesthesia program was instituted for patients undergoing surgery for hip fracture. This retrospective cohort review examines the effects of regional anesthesia (from mainly after July 2007) vs general anesthesia (mainly prior to July 2007) on morbidity, mortality and hospitalization costs. This retrospective cohort study involved data collection from electronic and paper charts of 308 patients who underwent surgery for hip fracture from September 2006 to December 2008. Data on postoperative morbidity, in-patient mortality, and cost of hospitalization (as estimated from data on hospital charges) were collected and analyzed. Seventy-three patients received regional anesthesia and 235 patients received general anesthesia. During July 2007, approximately halfway through the study period, a regional anesthesia and analgesia program was introduced. The average cost of hospitalization in patients who received surgery for hip fracture was no different between patients who receive regional or general anesthesia ($16,789 + 631 vs $16,815 + 643, respectively, P = 0.9557). Delay in surgery and intensive care unit (ICU) admission resulted in significantly higher hospitalization costs. Age, male gender, African American race and ICU admission were associated with increased in-hospital mortality. In-hospital mortality and rates of readmission are not statistically different between the two anesthesia groups. There is no difference in postoperative morbidity, rates of rehospitalization, in-patient mortality or hospitalization costs in geriatric patients undergoing regional or general anesthesia for repair of hip fracture. Delay in surgery beyond 3 days and ICU admission both increase cost of hospitalization.\n \nSurgical patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are at increased risk of perioperative complications. In this study, we sought to quantify the benefit of avoiding general anesthesia in this patient population. Data from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database (2005-2010) were used for this review. Patients who met the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program definition for COPD and underwent surgery under general, spinal, epidural, or peripheral nerve block anesthesia were included in this study. For each primary current procedural terminology code with \u2265 1 general and \u2265 1 regional (spinal, epidural, or peripheral nerve block) anesthetic, regional patients were propensity score--matched to general anesthetic patients. Propensity scoring was calculated using all available demographic and comorbidity data. This match yielded 2644 patients who received regional anesthesia and 2644 matched general anesthetic patients. These groups were compared for morbidity and mortality. Groups were well matched on demographics, comorbidities, and type of surgery. Compared with matched patients who received regional anesthesia, patients who received general anesthesia had a higher incidence of postoperative pneumonia (3.3% vs 2.3%, P = 0.0384, absolute difference with 95% confidence interval = 1.0% [0.09, 1.88]), prolonged ventilator dependence (2.1% vs 0.9%, P = 0.0008, difference = 1.2% [0.51, 1.84]), and unplanned postoperative intubation (2.6% vs 1.8%, P = 0.0487, difference = 0.8% [0.04, 1.62]). Composite morbidity was 15.4% in the general group versus 12.6% (P = 0.0038, difference = 2.8% [0.93, 4.67]). Composite morbidity not including pulmonary complications was 13.0% in the general group versus 11.1% (P = 0.0312, difference = 1.9% [0.21, 3.72]). Thirty-day mortality was similar (2.7% vs 3.0%, P = 0.6788, difference = 0.3% [-1.12, 0.67]). As a test for validity, we found a positive association between pulmonary end points because patients with 1 pulmonary complication were significantly more likely to have additional pulmonary complications. The use of regional anesthesia in patients with COPD is associated with lower incidences of composite morbidity, pneumonia, prolonged ventilator dependence, and unplanned postoperative intubation.\n"}]}]}}

The study period was subdivided into before (n\u00a0=\u00a0192) and after (n\u00a0=\u00a0457) the publication of the Tokyo guidelines, that is, prior to and including 2007, and from 2008 onward, respectively. We reviewed patient records retrospectively to collect demographic data, biochemical data, radiological findings, and postoperative outcomes. All these factors were compared between the groups. The duration of symptoms before surgery was significantly longer before 2008 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.018). ELC was significantly more frequent after 2008 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). Laparoscopic surgery was converted to open surgery in 16.1\u00a0% of patients before 2008 vs. 7.8\u00a0% of patients after 2008 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). There were no significant differences in bile duct injury or postoperative complications between the groups. The length of preoperative, postoperative, and total hospital stay was longer before 2008. ELC is a safe and effective therapeutic strategy for AC. The Tokyo guidelines resulted in a significant increase in the number of ELCs being performed and significantly reduced preoperative and total hospital stay without increasing intra- and postoperative complications. Importantly, ELC reduced medical costs, which is crucial for a country with limited resources, such as Tunisia.\n"}]}]}}

The aim of this study was to determine whether the Vo(2)peak measured during an incremental treadmill test is a true reflection of the maximum oxygen uptake ((.)Vo(2)max) in children who have spina bifida and are ambulatory. A cross-sectional design was used for this study. Twenty children who had spina bifida and were ambulatory participated. The (.)Vo(2)peak was measured during a graded treadmill exercise test. The validity of (.)Vo(2)peak measurements was evaluated by use of previously described guidelines for maximum exercise testing in children who are healthy, as well as differences between Vo(2)peak and (.)Vo(2) during a supramaximal protocol ((.)Vo(2)supramaximal). The average values for (.)Vo(2)peak and normalized (.)Vo(2)peak were, respectively, 1.23 L/min (SD=0.6) and 34.1 mL/kg/min (SD=8.3). Fifteen children met at least 2 of the 3 previously described criteria; one child failed to meet any criteria. Although there were no significant differences between (.)Vo(2)peak and Vo(2)supramaximal, 5 children did show improvement during supramaximal testing. These results apply to children who have spina bifida and are at least community ambulatory. The (.)Vo(2)peak measured during an incremental treadmill test seems to reflect the true (.)Vo(2)max in children who have spina bifida and are ambulatory, validating the use of a treadmill test for these children.

Twenty-seven healthy normal glucose-tolerant humans with either a previous diagnosis of gestational diabetes or having two parents with Type 2 diabetes and 27 healthy adults who had no history of diabetes were recruited. Maximal oxygen uptake was assessed using an incremental exercise test to exhaustion. Skin microvascular function was assessed using laser Doppler techniques as the maximum skin hyperaemic response to a thermal stimulus (maximum hyperaemia) and the forearm skin blood flow response to the iontophoretic application of acetylcholine (ACh) and sodium nitroprusside. Maximal oxygen uptake was not significantly different in the 'at-risk' group compared with healthy controls. Maximum hyperaemia was reduced in those 'at risk' (1.29 +/- 0.30 vs. 1.46 +/- 0.33 V, P = 0.047); however, the peak response to acetylcholine or sodium nitroprusside did not differ in the two groups. A significant positive correlation was demonstrated between maximal oxygen uptake and maximum hyperaemia (r = 0.52, P = 0.006 l/min and r = 0.60, P = 0.001 ml/kg/min) and peak ACh response (r = 0.40, P = 0.04 l/min and r = 0.47, P = 0.013 ml/kg/min) in the 'at-risk' group when expressed in absolute (l/min) or body mass-related (ml/kg/min) terms. No significant correlations were found in the control group. In this 'at-risk' group with skin microvascular dysfunction maximal oxygen uptake was not reduced compared with healthy controls. However, in the 'at-risk' group alone, individuals with higher levels of aerobic fitness also had better microvascular and endothelial responsiveness.\n"}]}]}}

Perinatal characteristics, major morbidity and case mix adjusted mortality were compared between 1879 rural and 6775 urban infants <32 weeks gestational age, born in 1992-2002 and admitted to all 10 neonatal intensive care units in NSW and ACT. Rural mothers were more likely to be teenaged, indigenous, and to have had a previous premature birth, prolonged ruptured membrane, and antenatal corticosteroid. Urban mothers were more likely to have had assisted conception and a caesarean section. More urban (93% v 83%) infants were born in a tertiary obstetric hospital. Infants of rural residence had a higher mortality (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07 to 1.48, p = 0.005).

Each group was further subdivided into 6 subgroups (EA1, EA2, EA3, EB1, EB2, EB3, LA1, LA2, LA3, LB1, LB2, LB3), each containing 8 rats. Intestinal anastomosis was performed by polyglactin 910 sutures in A subgroups and with ethyl-2-cyanoacrylate in B subgroups. The anastomosis was end to end in A1 and B1, side to side in A2 and B2, and end to side in A3 and B3. Time for anastomosis performance (AT) was recorded. In group E, bursting pressures and hydroxyproline levels were determined on the second postoperative day, whereas in group L, the same measurements were made on the sixth postoperative day.

No perfect method exists for accurate and reliable avoidance of these catastrophes. This study aimed to study the usefulness of routine intraoperative endoscopy (RIOE) by comparing the surgical outcomes for RIOE patients with those for selective intraoperative endoscopy (SIOE) patients. A retrospective chart review was performed for consecutive patients who underwent elective laparoscopic colorectal resections with distal anastomosis between January 2004 and May 2007. One surgeon performed RIOE, whereas the other three surgeons performed SIOE as necessary. All the abnormalities of IOE patients were managed with a subsequent salvage procedure, and the postoperative outcomes were compared between the RIOE and SIOE groups. The study included 107 patients in the RIOE group and 137 patients in the SIOE group. Abnormalities were detected in 11 RIOE patients (10.3%) (six with staple line bleeding, three with positive air leak test results, and two with additional pathology identified). All but one abnormality was laparoscopically managed without conversion to laparotomy. Whereas one patient experienced postoperative staple line bleeding that required a second operation, the remaining 10 patients recovered uneventfully. The mean hospital stay was 6 days (range, 4-9) days. The RIOE group had overall rates of 0% for anastomotic leakage and 0.9% for staple line bleeding. Intraoperative endoscopies were performed for 30 (21.9%) of the 137 patients in the SIOE group. The postoperative outcomes comparison between the RIOE and SIOE groups showed a tendency toward more overall anastomotic complications (0.9% vs. 5.1%) in the SIOE group, which due to the small sample size did not translate into significant differences in terms of staple line bleeding and anastomotic leakage. There also were no significant differences in other outcomes such as ileus, abdominal or pelvic sepsis, reoperation, positive distal margin, distance from distal margins, length of hospital stay, or mortality. Routine IOE for patients undergoing elective laparoscopic colorectal surgery with distal anastomosis can detect abnormalities at or around the anastomosis. Although the RIOE group had fewer postoperative anastomotic complications, due to the small sample size, the 5.7-fold increase in anastomotic failure did not translate into significantly better postoperative outcomes than the SIOE group experienced. A larger-scale single or multicenter prospective randomized study or a metaanalysis including similar studies is necessary for further investigation of this issue.\n"}]}]}}

Specimens were micro-computed tomography imaged to evaluate trabecular thickness, trabecular number, trabecular separation, bone volume density (BV/TV), BMD, and cortical thickness. Miniscrews 1.4 mm in diameter and 6 mm long were inserted into the bone blocks, and primary stability was evaluated by insertion torque (IT), mini-implant mobility (PTV), and pull-out strength (PS). Intergroup comparison showed lower levels of primary stability when the BMD of trabecular bone was lower and in the absence of cortical bone (P\u2264.05). The Pearson correlation test showed correlation between trabecular number, trabecular thickness, BV/TV, trabecular BMD, total BMD, and IT, PTV, and PS.

Three hundred ninety patients with displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures that were treated with plate osteosynthesis from December 2002 to December 2010 were reviewed. Two hundred two patients (group A) were treated by osteosynthesis with autologous bone grafting, and 188 patients (group B) were treated by osteosynthesis without bone grafting. One hundred eighty-one patients with an AO type 73-C1 fracture (Sanders type II), 182 patients with an AO type 73-C2 fracture (Sanders type III), and 27 patients with an AO type 73-C3 fracture (Sanders type IV) were included in this study.

Uniformity of care, regardless of time of year, is required for patients undergoing major cancer surgery. We therefore sought to perform a population-level assessment for the presence of a July effect in this field. We used the Nationwide Inpatient Sample to abstract data on patients undergoing 1 of 8 major cancer surgeries at academic medical centres between Jan. 1, 1999, and Dec. 30, 2009. The primary outcomes examined were postoperative complications and in-hospital mortality. Univariate analyses and subsequently multivariate analyses, controlling for patient and hospital characteristics, were performed to identify whether the time of surgery was an independent predictor of outcome after major cancer surgery. On univariate analysis, the overall postoperative complication rate, as well as genitourinary and hematologic complications specifically, was higher in July than the rest of the year. However, on multivariate analysis, only hematologic complications were significantly higher in July, with no difference in overall postoperative complication rate or in-hospital mortality for all 8 surgeries considered separately or together.

In March 2001, our unit implemented a pathway for patients undergoing major colorectal surgery. The aim of this study was to assess its impact on the quality of patient care. We reviewed 204 patients managed using this pathway in 2001, and compared their outcomes with those of a control group of 204 patients who had undergone similar procedures the year before. The endpoints measured were postoperative morbidity, length of stay and readmission rates. Both groups were similar in terms of patient demographics, diagnosis, and nature of surgery performed. In the study group, 61% of patients underwent elective surgery compared with 62% in the control group. The incidence of postoperative morbidity in the study group was 20% compared with 33% in the control group (p = 0.003).

The aim of this study was to investigate the need for ENBD on the clinical outcomes of patients with acute cholangitis undergoing endoscopic clearance of common bile duct (CBD) stones. Prospective, randomized study. Tertiary referral center. A total of 104 patients with choledocholithiasis-induced acute cholangitis who underwent primary endoscopic treatment were compared according to insertion of an ENBD tube (51 in the ENBD group and 53 in the no-ENBD group). Insertion of an ENBD tube after clearance of CBD stones. Recurrence of cholangitis and length of hospital stay after clearance of CBD stones. Baseline clinical characteristics were similar between both groups. There were no significant differences in the recurrence rate of cholangitis at 24 weeks (3.9% for the ENBD group vs 3.8% for the no-ENBD group at 24 weeks; P = .99) and length of hospital stay (7.9 days [standard error = 1.2] for the ENBD group vs 7.9 days [standard error = 0.7] for the no-ENBD group; P = .98). However, procedure time was longer (26.2 [SE = 1.8] minutes vs 22.7 [SE = 1.0] minutes, respectively; P = .01) and the discomfort score was higher (4.9 [SE = 0.4] vs 2.8 [SE = 0.3], respectively; P = .02) in the ENBD group than in the no-ENBD group. Single-center study. A routinely inserted ENBD tube did not improve the clinical course, despite patients having to endure increased procedure time and discomfort, and the insertion would therefore be unnecessary.\n \nTo clarify whether or not use of an endoscopic biliary stenting (EBS) is superior to endoscopic nasobiliary drainage (ENBD) in cases of acute cholangitis due to choledocholithiasis. Of 447 patients with choledocholithiasis who were treated in the Department of Gastroenterology, Fukuoka University Chikushi Hospital between January 1994 and September 2006, the subjects were 99 moderate acute cholangitis patients who underwent endoscopic drainage as initial treatment. Clinical efficacy, complications and patient satisfaction (meal intake rete) were investigated in the EBS group (67 patients) and the ENBD group (32 patients). There were no significant differences in the improvement in inflammation, total bilirubin, or biliary enzymes between the EBS and ENBD groups. Catheter occlusion was seen in three patients (4%) in the EBS group, and the catheter was self-extracted by three patients (10%) in the ENBD group. In moderate acute cholangitis due to choledocholithisis, the treatment efficacy and safety of EBS are equal to those of ENBD, and EBS appears to be a better choice in elderly patients in particular.\n"}]}]}}

However, actual temperature conditions are not known. We decided to study the temperature levels during preservation with the Biotainer storage can and Vitalpack transport pack. Temperature was monitored using the Thermobouton probe during preservation of pig kidneys, in the same conditions used with human grafts. The probe recorded the temperature level every 10 minutes during four days. We compared the results found with the new storage can with results obtained in the same conditions with the storage can formerly used by our team. We also studied the best position of the probe for temperature monitoring and the influence of the amount of ice within the transport pack on the temperature level. We then monitored the temperature during the conservation of actual human kidney grafts harvested at our institution from August 2007 to May 2008. The temperature levels were the same regardless of the position of the probe within the transport pack. The lowest temperature was maintained during 15 hours, and the temperature level stayed below 5 degrees C for 57 hours with the new storage can. The former storage can maintained the lowest temperature level for 80 minutes, and temperature reached 5 degrees C after 10 hours 40 minutes. Temperature levels were similar when 2 or 4 kg of crushed ice were used. We observed similar results when monitoring the conservation of human grafts. The new storage can affords more stable temperature levels when compared to the formerly used can. Since temperature is stable during conservation, continuous monitoring in everyday practice does not seem warranted.\n \nThe ethics of cold calling-visiting subjects at home without prior appointment agreed-in follow up research studies has received little attention although it is perceived to be quite common. We examined the ethical implications of cold calling in a study of subjects with defined neurotic disorders followed up 12 years after initial assessment carried out to determine outcome in terms of symptoms, social functioning, and contact with health services. The patients concerned were asked at original assessment if they would agree to be followed up subsequently and although they agreed no time limit was put on this. To decide if cold calling was ethically justifiable and, if so, to set guidelines for researchers. The study was a cohort study of patients with neurotic disorder treated initially for 10 weeks in a randomised controlled trial. At follow up by a research medical practitioner 18 of the 210 patients had died and of the remaining 192 patients 186 (97%) were seen or had a telephone interview. Four patients refused and two others did not have interviews but agreed to some data being obtained. However, only 104 patients (54%) responded to letters inviting them to make an appointment or to refuse contact and the remainder were followed up by cold calling, with most patients agreeing readily to the research interview. The findings illustrate the dilemma of the need to get the maximum possible data from such studies to achieve scientific validity (and thereby justify the ethics of the study) and the protection of subjects' privacy and autonomy. More attention needs to be paid to consent procedures if cold calling is to be defended on ethical grounds but it is unreasonable to expect this to be obtained at the beginning of a research study in a way that satisfies the requirements for informed consent. A suggested way forward is to obtain written consent for the research at the time that cold calling takes place before beginning the research.\n"}]}]}}

In fact, data from the era of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) suggest that clinical examination of the axilla is falsely positive in as many as 30% of cases. Here we report the results of SLN biopsy in a selected group of breast cancer patients with palpable axillary nodes classified as either moderately or highly suspicious for metastasis. Among 2,027 consecutive SLN biopsy procedures performed by two experienced surgeons, clinically suspicious axillary nodes were identified in 106, and categorized as group 1 (asymmetric enlargement of the ipsilateral axillary nodes moderately suspicious for metastasis, n = 62) and group 2 (clinically positive axillary nodes highly suspicious for metastasis, n = 44). Clinical examination of the axilla was inaccurate in 41% of patients (43 of 106) overall, and was falsely positive in 53% of patients (33 of 62) with moderately suspicious nodes and 23% of patients (10 of 44) with highly suspicious nodes. False-positive results were less frequent with larger tumor size (p = 0.002) and higher histologic grade (p = 0.002), but were not associated with age, body mass index, or a previous surgical biopsy. Clinical axillary examination in breast cancer is subject to false-positive results, and is by itself insufficient justification for axillary lymph node dissection. If other means of preoperative assessment such as palpation- or image-guided fine needle aspiration are negative or indeterminate, then SLN biopsy deserves wider consideration as an alternative to routine axillary lymph node dissection in the clinically node-positive setting.\n \nAxillary nodal status is one of the most important prognostic factors in breast cancer. In the present study we used it to determine the predictors of axillary lymph node metastases in breast cancer and to determine if there is a group of patients in whom minimal axillary surgery is indicated. This article reports a retrospective study of 953 patients with T1 and T2 invasive breast carcinomas seen in the University Malaya Medical Centre between January 2001 and December 2005, where axillary dissection was done. Of the 953 patients, 283 (29.7%) had breast-conserving surgery, and the rest had mastectomies. In this series, 463 patients (48.6%) were younger than 50 years of age; 365 patients (38.3%) had lymph node involvement. The Malays tend to have more axillary node metastases (45.1%) than the Chinese (36.9%); however, there was no significant relationship between age and race and lymph node involvement. Some 23.9% of grade 1 cancers were node positive, compared to 42.9% of grade 2/3 cancers. Tumor size ranged from 0.2 cm to 5 cm; 55.5% of tumors were T2 (>2-5 cm). There were only 13 (1.4%) T1a tumors (>0.1-0.5 cm). Node involvement was documented in 7.7% of T1a tumors, 12.3% of T1b tumors (>0.5-1 cm), 29.2% of T1c tumors, and 48.2% of T2 tumors. In patients who had no lymphovascular invasion (LVI), 24.4% had axillary node metastases, compared with 52.2% of patients where LVI was reported. On univariate analysis, our study found that tumor diameter>2 cm, presence of lymphovascular invasion, and higher tumor grade (2&3) were factors significantly associated with a higher risk of nodal metastases. On multivariate analysis, however, only lymphovascular invasion and tumor size were independent predictors based on the logistic regression. In T1 tumors, axillary lymph node dissection will overtreat almost 75% of cases; therefore a sentinel lymph node biopsy is justified in these tumors. Sentinel lymph node biopsy has been shown to reduce the complications of formal axillary dissection, such as shoulder stiffness, pain, and lymphedema. In patients with T2 tumors, where almost 45% have lymph node involvement, sentinel node biopsy may not be cost effective.\n"}]}]}}

As these haemorrhages are considered characteristic of child abuse, we investigated their occurrence after convulsive episodes to see whether the finding of haemorrhage should prompt further investigation. Prospective study of 153 children (aged 2 months to 2 years), seen in the emergency department after a convulsive episode. After a thorough history and physical examination, a retinal examination was performed by an ophthalmologist. If findings were positive, further investigation was undertaken to rule out systemic disorder or child abuse. One child was found with unilateral retinal haemorrhages following an episode of a simple febrile convulsion. A thorough investigation uncovered no other reason for this finding. Retinal haemorrhages following a convulsive episode are rare. Such a finding should trigger an extensive search for other reasons, including child abuse.\n \nTo identify whether after performing retinal photography, direct ophthalmoscopy can improve the yield of screening for the detection of sight-threatening diabetic eye disease (STDED). Patients (n = 408) who had previously received both dilated direct ophthalmoscopy by a diabetologist and retinal photography graded by a diabetologist within 3 months of each other were included. The results of the other screening modality were not available to the grader/screener. The first 308 patients were consecutive attendees at the clinic who fulfilled the study criteria and 100 were selected because they were identified as having potential STDED by either one of these modalities. An ophthalmologist using slit lamp biomicroscopy then examined patients identified with potential STDED. In 357 (88%) patients there was agreement between the two modalities about whether referral to an ophthalmologist was required (kappa 0.62). Retinal photography identified 38 patients for referral to ophthalmology which ophthalmoscopy missed. Of these, the ophthalmologist agreed that STDED was present in 32 (84%) and four patients required early laser. Ophthalmoscopy identified 13 patients for referral who were not identified by photography. Of these, the ophthalmologist agreed with the diabetologist that STDED was present in seven (54%) and one patient required early laser. Ophthalmoscopy may identify the occasional patient with diabetes who has STDED which is missed by retinal photography. For a systematic retinal screening programme, adding ophthalmoscopy to retinal photography will increase false-positive referrals and is likely to detect only a few extra patients requiring laser.\n"}]}]}}

We assessed whether the choice of either of these methods to obtain euglycaemia biases subsequent assessment of glucose metabolism and insulin action. We studied seven obese Type 2 diabetic patients twice Basal plasma glucose levels (mean +/- sd) were 5.5 +/- 0.5 and 10.7 +/- 2.9 mmol/l in the + ON and - ON studies, respectively, and were clamped at -5.5 mmol/l. Basal rates of glucose production (GP) were similar in the + ON and - ON studies, 83 +/- 13 vs. 85 +/- 14 mg m-2 min-1 (NS), whereas basal rates of glucose disappearance (Rd) were lower in the + ON than in the - ON study, 84 +/- 8 vs. 91 +/- 11 mg m-2 min-1 (P = 0.02).

Quality of life was measured at two points in time (baseline and three months after initial treatment) using three standard instruments; the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), the European Organization for Research and Cancer Treatment Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and its lung cancer supplement (QLQ-LC13). Socioeconomic status for each individual patient was derived using Carstairs and Morris Deprivation Category ranging from 1 (least deprived) to 7 (most deprived) on the basis of the postcode sector of their address. In all, 129 lung cancer patients entered into the study. Of these data for 82 patients were complete (at baseline and follow-up). 57% of patients were of lower socioeconomic status and they had more health problems, less functioning, and more symptoms as compared to affluent patients. Of these, physical mobility (P = 0.05), energy (P = 0.01), role functioning (P = 0.04), physical functioning (P = 0.03), and breathlessness (P = 0.02) were significant at baseline. However, at follow-up assessment there was no significant difference between patient groups nor did any consistent pattern emerge. At baseline assessment patients of lower socioeconomic status showed lower health related quality of life.

It is unclear whether HIV-infected individuals receive the same care for lung cancer as immunocompetent patients because of comorbidities, the potential for interaction between antiretroviral agents and cancer chemotherapy, and concerns regarding complications related to treatment or infection. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of HIV infection on receipt of guidance-concordant care, and its impact on overall survival among non-small cell lung cancer Medicare beneficiaries. The study design was a matched case-control design where each HIV patient was matched by age group, sex, race, and lung cancer stage at diagnosis with 20 controls randomly selected among those who were not HIV infected. The patients included in this study were Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer between 1998 and 2007, who qualified for Medicare on the basis of age and were 65 years of age or older at the time of lung cancer diagnosis. HIV infection status was based on Medicare claims data. A total of 174 HIV cases and 3480 controls were included in the analysis. Odds ratios for receiving guidance-concordant care and hazard ratios for overall survival were estimated. HIV infection was not independently associated with the receipt of guidance-concordant care. Among stage I/II patients, median survival times were 26 and 43 months, respectively, for those with and without HIV infection (odds ratio=1.48, P=0.021).

Bone marrow outside the RT field showed slight increase in precontrast SI and steady and moderate decrease in CE to a lesser degree without early increase as seen in bone marrow inside the RT field. RT causes an increase in precontrast SI predominantly in bone marrow inside the RT field. However, a decrease in CE is seen in bone marrow not only inside but also outside the RT field.\n \nAdult bone marrow contains progenitors capable of generating hepatocytes. Here a new liver failure model is introduced to assess whether bone marrow-derived progeny contribute to liver regeneration after acute hepatotoxic liver failure. Retrorsine was used to inhibit endogenous hepatocyte proliferation, before inducing acute liver failure by carbon tetrachloride. Bone marrow chimeras were generated before inducing liver failure to trace bone marrow-derived cells. Therefore, CD45 and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I dimorphic rat models were applied. Early after acute liver failure a multilineage inflammatory infiltrate was observed, mainly consisting of granulocytes. In long-term experiments small numbers of CD90+/CD45- cells of donor origin occurred in clusters associated with portal triads. Bone marrow cell infusion was not able to enhance liver regeneration. Cellular hypertrophy was the predominant way of liver mass regeneration in models applying retrorsine. Retrorsine pretreatment did not affect sensitivity for carbon tetrachloride. A multilineage inflammatory infiltrate was observed in rats whether pretreated with retrorsine or not. Few donor cells co-expressing CD90 (THY 1) were present in recipient livers, which may resemble donor-derived hematopoietic progenitors or oval cells. No other donor cells within liver parenchyma were detected. This is in contrast to other cell infusion models of acute cell death.\n"}]}]}}

The patients were divided into three groups For all patients, except those with univentricular cardiac defects, early mortality (30 d after surgery) was reduced. Among patients with severe cardiac defects, early mortality was reduced from 18.6% in group 1 to 2.9% in group 2. Among patients with less severe cardiac defects, early mortality was reduced from 6.2% to 1.9%. The improved outcome was maintained during the following 5 y. Overall relative risk of death during follow-up was reduced to 0.31 (95% CI Early mortality has been substantially reduced in congenital heart defect patients, and corresponds with significantly improved long-term survival.\n \nAmong all postoperative complications, cardiac arrest after cardiac surgical operations has the greatest association with mortality. However, hospital variation in the ability to rescue after cardiac arrest is unknown. The purpose of this study was to characterize the impact of cardiac arrest on mortality and determine the relative impact of patient, operative, and hospital factors on failure to rescue (FTR) rates and surgical mortality after cardiac arrest. A total of 79,582 patients underwent operations at 17 different hospitals (2001 through 2011), including 5.2% (n=4,138) with postoperative cardiac arrest. Failure to rescue was defined as mortality after cardiac arrest. Patient risk, operative features, and outcomes were compared among hospitals. Overall FTR rate was 60% with significant variation among hospitals (range, 50% to 83%; p<0.001). Failure-to-rescue patients were slightly older, presented with increased preoperative risk, and underwent more emergent operations (all p<0.05). After risk adjustment, the variable \"individual hospital\" demonstrated the strongest association with likelihood for FTR (likelihood ratio=39.1; p<0.001). Overall risk-adjusted mortality, cardiac arrest, and FTR rates varied across hospitals and did not correlate. High-performing hospitals with lowest FTR rates accrued longer postoperative and intensive care unit stays after the index operation (2 to 3 days; p<0.001). Significant hospital variation exists in cardiac surgical mortality and FTR rates after cardiac arrest. Institutional factors appear to confer the strongest influence on the likelihood for mortality after cardiac arrest compared with patient and operative factors. Identifying best practice patterns at the highest performing centers may serve to improve surgical outcomes after cardiac arrest and improve patient quality.\n"}]}]}}

Childbirth significantly affects puerpera's physical, psychological and social domains of quality of life. Under the circumstance of increasing high caesarean section rate in rural China, the impact of delivery mode on postnatal quality of life remains unclear. Cross-sectional study design. Women residing in rural areas and in their 0-12 months after childbirth from 30 rural townships participated in a household survey. A structured questionnaire was used to evaluate women's socio-demographic characteristics, previous pregnant experiences, foetal characteristics and use of maternal health services. The scale for rural postnatal quality of life was adopted to assess postnatal quality of life from six dimensions The overall caeserean section rate was 70\u00b70% (962/1375), and most of them (59\u00b77%) were selected by maternal request. None of six dimensions and total score of quality of life displayed significant difference between women with normal delivery and cesaerean section. It was found that postnatal home visit related to good postnatal quality of life and lower husband education level, male gender of infant were associated with poor quality of life. Delivery mode did not affect postpartum quality of life in rural China. Socio-cultural determinants may contribute more in influencing postnatal quality of life. Null findings in impact of delivery mode on postpartum quality of life may cause more difficulties in maternal decision-making for vaginal delivery in rural China. The importance of postnatal home visit could justify available and quality postnatal care in improving postpartum quality of life. Further research needs to explore the effective prevention programmes, especially attention for parenting boys.\n \nTo evaluate the construct validity of the Turkish version of the EQ-5D in patients with acute coronary syndrome. The study was conducted as a cross-sectional study at the Trakya University Hospital between February and May 2008. All patients completed the Turkish version of the EQ-5D and MacNew heart-related quality of life scale. Construct validity of the EQ-5D was assessed according to relationships with MacNew subscales by using Spearman rank correlation and multiple linear regression analyses. One hundred and twenty-two patients responded to the instruments. Mean age was 62.9\u00b19.3 years and male gender (88 or 72.1%) was dominant. Mean score of the EQ-5D index was 0.79\u00b10.32, while the global score of MacNew was 5.01\u00b11.16. The correlation coefficients of the EQ-5D index score with the MacNew subscales ranged from 0.557 to 0.721, with EQ-5D VAS score ranging from 0.297 to 0.484 (p<0.001 for all of them). According to the stepwise regression model MacNew global score was found to be significantly effective factor on EQ-5D index score (\u03b2 =0.188; 95% CI The Turkish version of the EQ-5D-based utility score seems to be a valid instrument in the assessment of quality of life studies in patients with acute coronary syndrome.\n"}]}]}}

In most cases no abnormality is found. The main objective of this study was to explore the role of uterine natural killer (uNK) cells and their regulatory cytokine IL-15 in irregular bleeding in HT users. This was a prospective observational study conducted between 2002 and 2004. The study was conducted in a tertiary referral menopause clinic at King Edward Memorial Hospital, Western Australia. Patients included 117 postmenopausal women taking combined HT. Outpatient endometrial biopsies were taken during and outside bleeding episodes. The relationship between endometrial uNK cells (CD56+) and bleeding patterns was measured. We also addressed the impact of HT exposure on uNK cell populations, the relationship between endometrial IL-15 expression and uNK cell populations, and killer Ig like receptor genotype in subjects with irregular bleeding. Endometrial CD56+ uNK cells were significantly increased in biopsies obtained during bleeding episodes (P < 0.001), compared with HT users with no bleeding. The highest level of IL-15 expression was also seen in biopsies taken during bleeding. No clear relationship between killer Ig like receptor genotype and bleeding on HT was observed. Little is known about the mechanisms underlying irregular bleeding in HT users. This is the first report of uNK cells and their association with regulating cytokines in postmenopausal endometrium and demonstrates a possible mechanism by which HT may induce irregular bleeding.\n \nThe reported frequency of malignant or premalignant changes confined to endometrial polyps (EP) is 0.5-6%. The management of atypical endometrial hyperplasia (AEH) confined to EP is not yet established. Recently, an alternative pathological nomenclature has emerged using the term endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia (EIN) instead of atypia. The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety of conservative hysteroscopic resection of endometrial polyps with AEH or EIN. Retrospective cohort study of all cases of hysteroscopic resections of EP was performed at a single center between the years 2000-2011. All patients with a pathologic diagnosis of AEH in EP were included. A post-hoc revision of the pathologic specimens was made according to the EIN classification. Of the 32 patients with AEH in EP, 25 had normal endometrial curetting. Even with AEH confined to EP, 12 cases (48%) showed AEH (11 cases) or carcinoma (1 case) in the hysterectomy specimens. EIN in EP (14 cases) was correlated with 57% of diagnosis of EIN or carcinoma in the uterus; whereas in the absence of EIN in EP only 1 of 9 cases showed EIN in the final pathologic specimen (p=0.002), and none with carcinoma, which yields a PPV of 14% and a NPV of 100%. The diagnosis of EIN in EP may be a better predictor than AEH for endometrial involvement with malignant or pre-malignant neoplasms. The safety of conservative hysteroscopic resection of EP with AEH/EIN is questioned.\n"}]}]}}

We evaluated in both groups the complete disappearance of the cystic portion of the thyroid nodule on follow-up ultrasonography (first follow-up ultrasonography; mean, 4.6 months in group A; mean, 4.4 months in group B) (chi-square test), side effects or complications during and after the procedure (chi-square test), and the total procedure time (Student t test). Most patients showed complete disappearance of the cystic portion of the thyroid nodule (group A, n = 29; group B, n = 28), and they revealed no recurrence on follow-up ultrasonography. There was no statistical difference in the success rates between group A and group B (P > .05). Pain, the most common side effect, and other mild side effects or complications occurred in small numbers of patients in each group, but there was no significant difference in side effects or complications between the 2 groups (P > .05), except for intracystic hemorrhage (P < .05) and the complaint of all group B patients due to a double puncture (P < .001).

Current guidelines suggest these BCN should be followed by ultrasonographic examination (US) every 3 years, with no endpoint specified. This study evaluated if long-term follow-up of benign thyroid nodules was associated with change in treatment or improvement in diagnosing a missed malignancy compared with short-term follow-up. All patients with FNA-based diagnosis of BCN at our institution from 1998 to 2009 were identified. Patients observed after the diagnosis were divided into short-term follow-up (<3 years) and long-term follow-up (\u22653 years). Rates of repeat FNA, thyroidectomy, and malignancy detection were compared. Of 738 patients with BCN, 92 patients underwent thyroid resection after the initial US. Six hundred forty-six patients were observed, of which 366 returned for 1 or more follow-up US Long-term follow-up of patients with BCN is associated with increased repeat FNA and US without improvement in the malignancy detection rate.

It offers an excellent weight loss and resolution of comorbidities in the short term with a very low incidence of complications. However, the ever present risk of a staple line leak is still a major concern. Since 2005, data from obese patients that undergo bariatric procedures in Germany are prospectively registered in an online database and analyzed at the Institute of Quality Assurance in Surgical Medicine. For the current analysis, all patients that had undergone primary sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity within a 7-year period were considered. Using the GBSR, data from 5.400 LSGs were considered for analysis. Staple line leak rate decreased during the study period from 6.5 to 1.4 %. Male gender, higher BMI, concomitant sleep apnea, conversion to laparotomy, longer operation time, use of both buttresses and oversewing, and the occurrence of intraoperative complications were associated with a significantly higher leakage rate. On multivariate analysis, operation time and year of procedure only had a significant impact on staple line leak rate. The results of the current study demonstrated that there are factors that increase the risk of a leakage which would enable surgeons to define risk groups, to more carefully select patients, and to offer a closer follow-up during the postoperative course with early recognition and adequate treatment. All future efforts should be focused on a further reduction of serious complications to make the LSG a widely accepted and safer procedure.\n \nAnastomotic complications such as leakage and bleeding remain among the most serious complications of laparoscopic colorectal surgery. No perfect method exists for accurate and reliable avoidance of these catastrophes. This study aimed to study the usefulness of routine intraoperative endoscopy (RIOE) by comparing the surgical outcomes for RIOE patients with those for selective intraoperative endoscopy (SIOE) patients. A retrospective chart review was performed for consecutive patients who underwent elective laparoscopic colorectal resections with distal anastomosis between January 2004 and May 2007. One surgeon performed RIOE, whereas the other three surgeons performed SIOE as necessary. All the abnormalities of IOE patients were managed with a subsequent salvage procedure, and the postoperative outcomes were compared between the RIOE and SIOE groups. The study included 107 patients in the RIOE group and 137 patients in the SIOE group. Abnormalities were detected in 11 RIOE patients (10.3%) (six with staple line bleeding, three with positive air leak test results, and two with additional pathology identified). All but one abnormality was laparoscopically managed without conversion to laparotomy. Whereas one patient experienced postoperative staple line bleeding that required a second operation, the remaining 10 patients recovered uneventfully. The mean hospital stay was 6 days (range, 4-9) days. The RIOE group had overall rates of 0% for anastomotic leakage and 0.9% for staple line bleeding. Intraoperative endoscopies were performed for 30 (21.9%) of the 137 patients in the SIOE group. The postoperative outcomes comparison between the RIOE and SIOE groups showed a tendency toward more overall anastomotic complications (0.9% vs. 5.1%) in the SIOE group, which due to the small sample size did not translate into significant differences in terms of staple line bleeding and anastomotic leakage. There also were no significant differences in other outcomes such as ileus, abdominal or pelvic sepsis, reoperation, positive distal margin, distance from distal margins, length of hospital stay, or mortality. Routine IOE for patients undergoing elective laparoscopic colorectal surgery with distal anastomosis can detect abnormalities at or around the anastomosis. Although the RIOE group had fewer postoperative anastomotic complications, due to the small sample size, the 5.7-fold increase in anastomotic failure did not translate into significantly better postoperative outcomes than the SIOE group experienced. A larger-scale single or multicenter prospective randomized study or a metaanalysis including similar studies is necessary for further investigation of this issue.\n"}]}]}}

To identify distinctive features in patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms, and to determine whether these symptoms support the hypothesis of the existence of specific somatic syndromes. Observational study, with a comparison control group. Four primary care practices affiliated with the University of Nijmegen in the Netherlands. One hundred and eighty-two patients diagnosed between 1998 and 2002 as having chronic functional somatic symptoms and 182 controls matched by age, sex, socioeconomic status, and practice were included. Data on comorbidity, referrals, diagnostic tests, and hospital admissions over a period of 10 years prior to the diagnosis were collected. Medication use and number of visits to the general practitioner (GP) were extracted from the moment computerised registration was started. In the 10 years before the diagnosis of chronic functional somatic symptoms, significantly more patients than controls presented functional somatic symptoms in at least two body systems, and used more somatic and psychotropic drugs. They visited the GP twice as much, statistically had significantly more psychiatric morbidity, and were referred more often to mental health workers and somatic specialists. The number of patients undergoing diagnostic tests was higher for patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms than for controls, but hospital admissions rates were equal. Patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms have a great diversity of functional somatic symptoms. They use more somatic and psychotropic drugs than controls in the years before diagnosis. Moreover, they show high rates of referrals and psychiatric morbidity. The diversity of symptoms of patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms supports the concept that symptoms do not cluster in well defined distinct syndromes. Therefore, patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms should preferably not be classified into medical subspecialty syndromes.\n \nTo study the effectiveness of combined integral somatic and psychiatric treatment in a medical-psychiatric unit (MPU). Retrospective case-note study. The case notes of all patients admitted to the MPU at the VU Medical Center, Amsterdam, in 2011 were analysed. Data on reasons for referral and somatic and psychiatric diagnoses were collected. Using a global clinical assessment scale and the Health of the Nations Outcome Scales (HoNOS), data on psychiatric symptomology and limitations, behavioural problems, social problems and limitations associated with physical health problems were collected on both admission and discharge. In this way the effect of the admission period on various problems was determined. In 2011 there were 139 admissions to the MPU with a wide variation of somatic and psychiatric diagnoses. The average admission period was 9 days. Global clinical evaluation of the treatment goals set for somatic and psychiatric conditions showed that more than 90% and 85% of the treatment goals, respectively, were completely achieved. HoNOS scores showed a reduction in severity of both psychiatric and somatic problems. The total HoNOS-core was significantly reduced by nearly 3.5 points - a large effect size. The MPU has succeeded in its goal to deliver integral care to a very diverse group of patients with somatic and psychiatric co-morbidities. It is able to offer care to a vulnerable patient group in which it can be presumed that treatment on a non-integrated unit could not have been delivered or not delivered adequately, due to the complexity of their somatic and behavioural problems.\n"}]}]}}

Incomplete bladder emptying may be related to bladder-sphincter dyssynergia. Ultrasonography and uroflowmetry are used in the initial evaluation of many children with voiding dysfunction. We determine in children with voiding dysfunction whether incomplete bladder emptying has an important role in the pathogenesis of urinary tract infections and whether abnormal ultrasonography or uroflowmetry can predict which children are at increased risk of recurrent UTIs. In this retrospective cohort study charts of 148 consecutive patients diagnosed with voiding dysfunction were reviewed for information regarding residual urine volumes on initial post-void ultrasound and the number of urinary tract infections on followup. Initial uroflowmetry curves were blindly reevaluated for this study. Considerable (greater than 10% predicted) post-void residual urine volumes were seen on 15% of ultrasounds, and 78% of uroflowmetry studies were characterized as abnormal. The volume of residual urine (corrected for age) showed a positive correlation with the number of UTIs occurring after the initial visit (r = 0.3, p <0.002). There was no correlation between an abnormal uroflow pattern and number of subsequent UTIs. Although increased residual urine on post-void ultrasound increases the risk of UTI recurrence in children with voiding dysfunction, it does not allow accurate identification of specific children at risk.\n \nTo determine the relationship between obesity and febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) in young children. We reviewed all medical records of children aged\u00a0<3\u00a0years who visited our institution for febrile\u00a0UTIs and infant national health checkups (controls) between January 2008 and February 2012. All subjects were subcategorized into 3 groups of lean, overweight, and obese using weight-for-length measurements. The effect of obesity on UTI risk was evaluated and odds ratios were calculated. We analyzed 465 patients with UTIs and 812 controls. The proportion of overweight and obese children was higher in patients with UTIs (22.8%) and acute pyelonephritis (APN; 31.1%) compared with those in the control (11.7%; P\u00a0<.05). After adjusting for age and gender, the odds ratio (OR) of UTI in obese relative to lean children was 1.84 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-3.05) and that of APN was 2.43 (95% CI, 1.27-4.62). The OR of APN in overweight relative to lean children was 1.96 (95% CI, 1.11-3.46). After adjusting for age, the OR of APN in obese relative to lean boys was 2.74 (95% CI, 1.11-6.77) and that in overweight to lean girls was 2.48 (95% CI, 1.05-5.83). Within patients with UTIs, compared with lean children, the obese showed a longer duration of fever and a higher frequency of APN and the overweight had a higher incidence of hydronephrosis (P\u00a0<.05). Obesity may be associated with higher odds of a febrile UTI and APN in young children.\n"}]}]}}

The objective of this study was to analyze the change in the health of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Part A (hospital insurance) between 2008 and 2010 by comparing the prevalence of 11 chronic conditions. We conducted descriptive analyses using the 2008 and 2010 Chronic Conditions Public Use Files, which are newly available from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and have administrative (claims) data on 100% of the Medicare fee-for-service population. We examined the data by age, sex, and dual eligibility (eligibility for both Medicare and Medicaid). Medicare Part A beneficiaries had more chronic conditions on average in 2010 than in 2008. The percentage increase in the average number of chronic conditions was larger for dual-eligible beneficiaries (2.8%) than for nondual-eligible beneficiaries (1.2%). The prevalence of some chronic conditions, such as congestive heart failure, ischemic heart disease, and stroke/transient ischemic attack, decreased. The deterioration of average health was due to other chronic conditions Analyzing the prevalence of 11 chronic conditions by using Medicare claims data provides a monitoring tool that can guide health care providers and policy makers in devising strategies to address chronic conditions and rising health care costs.\n \nDiagnostic imaging services have been repeatedly targeted as a source of excess health care expenditure. In particular, MRI is considered a high-tech and high-cost imaging service that saw rapid increases in utilization in the early 2000s. However, the most recent trends in the utilization of MR are not known. The aim of this study was to quantify trends in MR utilization overall and by body system from 1998 to 2010 in the Medicare population. Medicare Part B data sets were obtained for 1998 to 2010 for all MR examinations performed in the Medicare population. Using Current Procedural Terminology codes, the total volume and utilization rates of all MR examinations were tabulated for each year of the study period. MR volume was then categorized by body system. The utilization rate of MR examinations in the Medicare population was 73 per 1,000 beneficiaries in 1998, increased to a peak of 189 in 2008, and decreased to 183 in 2010. The compound annual growth rate from 1998 to 2008 was 10%. The utilization rate in 2010 represents a decrease of 3.1% from the 2009 utilization rate. The most frequently imaged body section in every year was the head, which accounted for 2,404,250 examinations in 2010, 37.3% of all MR examinations in that year. The overall MRI utilization rate sharply increased from 1998 until 2008 but then decreased in each of the next 2 years. A similar trend was noted for MR examinations performed in most body sections. These trends are likely to be the result of a number of possible causative factors.\n"}]}]}}

The three midwife obstetric units (MOUs) in a health district of Mpumalanga were included in the study. Two MOUs enrolled in the PEP and the third did not. A 'before-and-after' study design was used to assess any changes in practice, and to monitor whether any changes occurred in the district during the time of the study; data were also collected at the third MOU. Data were collected by scoring of the obstetric files after the patient had delivered. We ascertained whether the obstetric history, syphilis testing, blood group testing, haemoglobin measurement and uterine growth assessment were performed during antenatal care along with whether appropriate action was taken. For intrapartum care, estimation of fetal weight, the performance of pelvimetry, blood pressure monitoring, urine testing, evaluation of head above pelvis, fetal heart rate monitoring, monitoring of contractions and plotting of cervical dilatation, and whether the appropriate actions were taken, were assessed. Eight of the 13 midwives at the two MOUs completed the PEP and all demonstrated an improvement in knowledge. Case notes of 303 patients from the various clinics were studied. There was no change in the referral patterns of any of the clinics during the study period. The obstetric history was well documented, but in no group was there a satisfactory response to a detected problem; appropriate action was taken in between 0% and 12% of cases. Syphilis testing was performed in 56-82% of cases, with no difference between the groups. The haemoglobin level was measured in only 4-15% of patients, with no difference before or after completion of the PEP. Where a problem in uterine growth was detected, an appropriate response occurred in 0-8% of patients and no difference before or after completion of the PEP was ascertained. In all groups, estimation of fetal weight and pelvimetry were seldom performed, the urine and fetal heart rate documentation were moderately well done and the blood pressure monitoring, assessment of head above pelvis, monitoring of contractions and plotting of cervical dilatation were usually performed. No differences before or after the PEP were detected. Where problems were detected, appropriate actions taken during labour improved, but not significantly. Completion of the obstetric manual of the PEP improved the knowledge of the midwives but no alteration in practice was detected.\n \nThe aims of the study were to find out the maternal and perinatal outcome of early onset severe preeclampsia (PE) in a tertiary care center in a developing country like India and to determine whether expectant management in such a setup improves the perinatal outcome. It was a retrospective study. All women with early PE were admitted stabilized and evaluated. Expectant management was given whenever there was no indication for eminent delivery. The perinatal outcome of the expectant group was compared with that of the aggressive group, and appropriate statistical analysis was carried out. A total of 106 women were admitted with severe PE, 61 were treated aggressively, and 45 were stable enough to receive expectant management. The total days gained on expectant management was 7 days. Perinatal mortality was 31.13%. Perinatal outcome of the expectant and aggressive management groups did not differ (P = 0.141); there was no increase in maternal complications on expectant management. There were 2 cases of maternal mortality in the aggressively managed group. Perinatal mortality in severe PE is high. There was no increase in maternal morbidity on expectant management; however, there was no difference in perinatal mortality on expectant management.\n"}]}]}}

A subset of 203 patients (14.9%), who had undergone at least one prior benign prostate biopsy for a rising prostate-specific antigen and/or abnormal digital rectal examination, constituted our study population. A total of 1115 patients with no prior biopsy represented our control group. After prostatectomy, patients were evaluated at 6-month intervals for biochemical evidence of recurrence, defined as a prostate-specific antigen level of 0.5 ng/mL or greater. Patients with a prior benign biopsy had more favorable pathologic features with more organ-confined (74% versus 64%; P <0.001) and less margin-positive (9.8% versus 18%) disease. Only 24 patients (12%) in the study group (versus 20% in control group; P = 0.01) had eventual evidence of biochemical failure. Kaplan-Meier analyses suggested that patients with prior benign biopsies have improved biochemical disease-free survival, especially for those with more aggressive disease (Gleason sum 7 or greater; P <0.01).

Study 1. We recruited 24 patients awaiting standard 12-core TRUS-guided biopsies of the prostate to undergo PHS immediately beforehand. We compared PHS with the TRUS-guided biopsy results in terms of their ability to detect cancer within the whole prostate and to localize it to the correct side and to the correct region of the prostate. Lesions that were suspicious on PHS were biopsied separately. Study 2. We recruited 57 patients awaiting TTB to have PHS beforehand. We compared PHS with the TTB pathology results in terms of their ability to detect prostate cancer within the whole gland and to localize it to the correct side and to the correct sextant of the prostate. Study 3. We recruited 24 patients awaiting radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer to undergo preoperative PHS. We compared PHS with standardized pathological analysis of the whole-mount prostatectomy specimens in terms of their measurement of total tumour volume within the prostate, tumour volume within prostate sextants and volume of index lesions identified by PHS. The PHS-targeted biopsies had an overall cancer detection rate of 38.1%, compared with 62.5% with standard TRUS-guided biopsies. The sensitivity and specificity of PHS for localizing tumour to the correct prostate sextant, compared with standard TRUS-guided biopsies, were 100 and 5.9%, respectively. The PHS-targeted biopsies had an overall cancer detection rate of 13.4% compared with 54.4% for standard TTB. PHS had a sensitivity and specificity for cancer detection in the posterior gland of 100 and 13%, respectively, and for the anterior gland, 6 and 82%, respectively. We found no correlation between total tumour volume estimates from PHS and radical prostatectomy pathology (Pearson correlation coefficient -0.096). Sensitivity and specificity of PHS for detecting tumour foci \u22650.2\u2009mL in volume were 63 and 53%.

Age, health status, cognitive level, preinjury functional level, and pressure sores after hip fracture surgery were independently related to lower discharge motor FIM scores. At 1-year followup, 57 patients (25%; 43 women and 14 men) had died. The 1-year hip fracture mortality rate compared with that of the general population was 31% in our population versus 7% for men and 23% in our population versus 5% for women 65 years or older. The 1-year standardized mortality rate was 341.3 (95% CI, 162.5-520.1) for men and 301.6 (95% CI, 212.4-391.8) for women, respectively. The all-cause mortality rate observed in this group was higher in all age groups and in both sexes when compared with the all-cause age-adjusted mortality of the general population. Motor FIM score at discharge was the only independent predictor of 1-year mortality after hip fracture. Functional level at discharge is the main determinant of long-term mortality in patients with hip fracture. Motor FIM score at discharge is a reliable predictor of mortality and can be recommended for clinical use.\n"}]}]}}

A series of 188 patients with 208 ureteral stones were treated with semirigid ureteroscopy and holmium:YAG laser lithotripsy from January 2003 to December 2005. Of the stones, 116 were lower ureteral, 37 middle ureteral, and 55 upper ureteral. The success rate was 92.7% at the time of ureteroscopy and 96.7% at 3 months. The failures were secondary to retropulsion of the stones (3.3%). There were no perforations and one stricture. Stenting was done in 90% of patients. The Holmium:YAG laser is an ideal intracorporeal lithotripter for ureteral calculi, with a high success rate and low morbidity.\n \nPrimary therapeutic approach to lumbar ureteral stones is still contraversial. The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of stone impaction and size on the effectiveness of proximal ureteral stone lithotripsy. A total of 123 patients with proximal ureteral stones were investigated in this prospective study performed in a 10-month period. The patients were divided into the group I--86 patients treated with extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) and the group II--37 patients treated with \"Swiss\" Lithoclast. In the group I, 49 stones (57%) were classified as impacted, while 20 stones (23.3%) were larger than 100 mm2. In the group II, 26 stones (70.3%) were impacted, and 11 stones (29.7%) were larger than 100 mm2. Stones were defined as impacted by the radiographic, echosonographic as well as endoscopic findings in the group II of patients. Stone size was presented in mm2. Chemical composition of stones were almost the same in both groups of the patients. Generally, there was no statistically significant difference in the treatment success between the groups. However, stones larger than 100 mm2 were statistically more successfully treated endoscopically, while there was no statistical difference in the treatment success of impacted stones between these two groups. ESWL can by considered as primary first therapeutic approach in treatment of all proximal ureteral stones except for stones larger than 100 mm2 that should primarily be treated endoscopically.\n"}]}]}}

Patients who attended the primary care general medicine and pulmonary subspecialty clinic were also assessed as to their proficiency in the use of metered-dose inhalers. A significant percentage of patients had a poor understanding of the technique used with the metered-dose inhaler. House staff and nursing staff were also less proficient in the proper use of the metered-dose inhaler. The respiratory care practitioners were the most knowledgeable of the health care providers. This study confirms that a large percentage of patients use metered-dose inhalers improperly. It also demonstrates a significant lack of understanding by health care providers of the proper use of metered-dose inhalers. Furthermore, this study supports the use of respiratory care practitioners in the outpatient setting, since they were the most proficient among all the health care providers in the proper use of metered-dose inhalers.\n \nThere is increasing pressure on mental health providers to reduce the duration of treatments, while retaining level of quality and effectiveness.

One mechanism proposed for this association is that green space provides a venue for, and therefore encourages, physical activity. It has also been suggested that socio-economic health inequalities may be narrower in greener areas because of the equalised opportunity for physical activity green spaces provide. However, research exploring associations between the availability of green space and physical activity has produced mixed results. Limits to the assessment of the type and amount of physical activity which occurs specifically in green space may account for these mixed findings. This observational study was therefore concerned with the extent to which green space is a venue for physical activity and whether this could account for narrower socio-economic health inequalities in greener neighbourhoods. Secondary analysis of cross sectional data on 3679 adults (16+) living in urban areas across Scotland matched with a neighbourhood level measure of green space availability. Associations between green space availability and both total physical activity, and activity specifically within green space, were explored using logistic regression models. Interactions between socio-economic position and physical activity were assessed. All models adjusted for age, sex and household income. The availability of green space in a neighbourhood was not associated with total physical activity or that specifically in green space. There was no evidence that income-related inequalities in physical activity within green space were narrower in greener areas of Scotland. Physical activity may not be the main mechanism explaining the association between green space and health in Scotland. The direct effect of perceiving a natural environment on physiological and psychological health may offer an alternative explanation.\n"}]}]}}

The aim of the present study was to describe the prevalence and severity of FI among nursing home residents, and to investigate factors associated with FI. This was a cross-sectional study conducted in nursing homes in Ostrava, Czech Republic. Demographics and comorbidities were extracted from medical records of nursing homes. Data regarding incontinence were obtained via face-to-face interviews with residents or extracted from registered nurses' accounts (regarding residents with severe cognitive impairment). In total, 588 nursing home residents were enrolled into the study. FI was noted in 336 (57.1%) participating residents. The majority of FI residents (57.8%) reported FI episodes several times a week; daily FI episodes were found in 22.9% of the FI residents. The mean Cleveland Clinic Incontinence Score in FI residents was 17.2\u00b11.8 (mean\u00b1SD). Factors associated with FI (statistically significant) were poor general health status (\u22654 comorbidities), urinary incontinence, cognitive-function impairment (dementia), decreased mobility, and length of nursing home residency. There was no association between FI and age, sex, body mass index, or living with/without a partner. Our data indicate that FI is still a serious health problem-FI currently affects more than half of the nursing home residents in Ostrava, Czech Republic. The study outcomes (revealed high prevalence and seriousness of FI) emphasize the importance of close monitoring and appropriately managing FI in nursing home residents.\n \nThe Tokyo guidelines for diagnostic criteria and severity assessment of acute cholecystitis (AC), published in 2007, recommend early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (ELC) be done as soon as possible after the onset of symptoms. We conducted this study to analyze the changes in the therapeutic strategy for AC in a surgical center in Tunisia after the Tokyo guidelines were published. Between January, 2005 and January, 2013, 649 patients underwent cholecystectomy for AC at the Department of Surgery, Mohamed Tahar Maamouri Hospital in Nabeul, Tunisia. The study period was subdivided into before (n\u00a0=\u00a0192) and after (n\u00a0=\u00a0457) the publication of the Tokyo guidelines, that is, prior to and including 2007, and from 2008 onward, respectively. We reviewed patient records retrospectively to collect demographic data, biochemical data, radiological findings, and postoperative outcomes. All these factors were compared between the groups. The duration of symptoms before surgery was significantly longer before 2008 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.018). ELC was significantly more frequent after 2008 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). Laparoscopic surgery was converted to open surgery in 16.1\u00a0% of patients before 2008 vs. 7.8\u00a0% of patients after 2008 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). There were no significant differences in bile duct injury or postoperative complications between the groups. The length of preoperative, postoperative, and total hospital stay was longer before 2008. ELC is a safe and effective therapeutic strategy for AC. The Tokyo guidelines resulted in a significant increase in the number of ELCs being performed and significantly reduced preoperative and total hospital stay without increasing intra- and postoperative complications. Importantly, ELC reduced medical costs, which is crucial for a country with limited resources, such as Tunisia.\n"}]}]}}

The rate of mild cervical lesions (koilocytosis, warts, CIN I with and without koilocytosis) was compared with the rate of severe cervical lesions (CIN II and III, cervical carcinoma) in patients with mild vaginal lesions (warts and koilocytosis, and low-grade VAIN) and in patients with severe vaginal lesions (high-grade VAIN). Using koilocytosis as a marker, the rate of \"active\" cervical lesions was compared with the rate of \"non active\" cervical lesions in patients with \"active\" versus \"non active\" vaginal lesions. Finally, the rates of mild and severe cervical lesions were compared among each group of VAIN (low-grade, high-grade, with or without koilocytosis). In patients with mild vaginal lesions, mild cervical lesions were significantly more frequent than severe cervical lesions. In patients with \"active\" vaginal lesions the rate of \"active\" cervical lesions was significantly higher than \"non active\" cervical lesions. The differences in rates of mild cervical lesions and severe cervical lesions among patients with high-grade VAIN and low-grade VAIN (with and without koilocytosis) were not significant.

Women undergoing a hysterectomy for the above indication at the Northern Gynaecological Cancer Centre over a period of 10 years (1992-2001) were identified from a prospectively collected database. Case notes were then reviewed and women undergoing hysterectomy for other indications were excluded. Relevant demographic and clinical data were then extracted. 33 patients meeting the above criteria were identified. The overall hysterectomy rate for this indication was 0.73%. 20 out of the 33 women had significant pathology on the hysterectomy specimen. 95% of these had high-grade disease with one having a Stage 1A1 squamous carcinoma. None of the patients required more radical treatment than a simple hysterectomy. There were no major complications following the hysterectomy. Positive endocervical margins on the previous loop specimen (P = 0.05) was an important correlating factor predicting the presence of CIN on the hysterectomy specimen. One out of the thirty hysterectomies (3.3%) performed using the vaginal route had incomplete excision compared to one of three (33%) using the abdominal route. Hysterectomy was successful in treating 85.2% of the women; only 4 women subsequently developed vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia. Simple hysterectomy appears to be a suitable diagnostic and treatment option for women with recurrent high-grade cytological abnormalities where further loop treatment is technically not possible. Incomplete excision at the endocervical margin on the previous loop specimen was the main factor associated with the presence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia at hysterectomy.\n"}]}]}}

Conventional screening criteria are too limiting and exclude suitable heart donors. Echocardiography is now widely available and is a reliable tool to assess left ventricular dysfunction in brain-dead donors. Yet few data are available on the degree of left ventricular dysfunction where a transplantation is possible. Fifty-five potential brain-dead heart donors (age 38 +/- 11 years) were prospectively evaluated by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) before harvesting. Fractional area change (FAC) was used to assess left ventricular function in potential brain-dead donors. Transplanted hearts were evaluated on the fifth postoperative day. The transplantation was considered a success if the recipient was alive, not retransplanted, without an assistance device or an epinephrine infusion of more than 1 mg/h and showed an ejection fraction above 40%. Of the 55 potential heart donors, 20 exhibited an FAC of less than 50%. Forty hearts were harvested, 36 of which were successfully transplanted. Nine patients had an FAC below 50% (group H2) and 27 had an FAC over 50% (group H1). Four patients died TEE is useful to assess left ventricular function in potential brain-dead donors. An FAC less than 50% is present in 36% of potential heart donors. Because left ventricular dysfunction is often reversible shortly after transplantation, an FAC below 50% may not necessarily preclude the use of hearts for transplantation.\n \nPatients presenting with stroke or transient cerebral ischemic episodes often undergo transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) as part of their initial evaluation. Previous studies have demonstrated that TEE is superior to transthoracic echocardiography for the detection of potential cardiac sources of embolism. In our institution, this scenario now represents the most frequent reason for requesting TEE. For the most part, these TEE examinations are ordered by a neurologist, and transthoracic echocardiography is not performed beforehand. Over a 2-year period, TEE was requested for 137 patients at our institution for the evaluation of a cerebral ischemic event. The complete hospital chart was available for review in 106 of these patients, and they form the study group. All patients underwent TEE using either a biplane or omniplane transducer, with Doppler color flow imaging and saline contrast administration performed in every case. Studies were reviewed for the presence of possible cardiac or aortic sources of cerebral emboli, and hospital charts were reviewed to collect clinical information. A potential cardiovascular embolic source was detected in 35% of patients. Abnormalities were discovered in 53% (16/30) of patients with atrial fibrillation vs 28% (21/76) of patients in sinus rhythm (P < .001).

Protruding aortic atherosclerotic debris was the most frequent abnormality among patients in sinus rhythm. It may not be cost-effective to perform TEE as a routine diagnostic procedure in patients presenting with cerebral ischemic events. Most patients with atrial fibrillation are candidates for empiric warfarin sodium therapy, and patients in sinus rhythm usually have findings for which there is no recommended therapy or for which only aspirin is indicated.\n"}]}]}}

Group 2 received a 1 mg/kg dose of 0.9% sodium chloride by the intraperitoneal route for 10 min before pneumoperitoneum. Groups 3 and 4 received 6 and 12 mg/kg edaravone, respectively, by the intraperitoneal route for 10 min before pneumoperitoneum. After 60 min of pneumoperitoneum, the gas was deflated. Immediately after the reperfusion period, both ovaries were excised for histological scoring, caspase-3 immunohistochemistry and biochemical evaluation including glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. Also, total antioxidant capacity (TAC) was measured in plasma samples to evaluate the antioxidant effect of edaravone. Ovarian sections in the saline group revealed higher scores for follicular degeneration and edema (p < 0.0001) when compared with the sham group. Administration of different doses of edaravone in rats significantly prevented degenerative changes in the ovary (p < 0.0001). Caspase-3 expression was only detected in the ovarian surface epithelium in all groups, and there was a significant difference between the treatment groups and the saline group (p < 0.0001). Treatment of rats with edaravone reduced caspase-3 expression in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, biochemical measurements of oxidative stress markers (MDA, GSH and TAC) revealed that prophylactic edaravone treatment attenuated oxidative stress induced by I/R injury. These results indicate that prophylactic treatment with edaravone prevents I/R-induced ovarian damage during pneumoperitoneum in an experimental rat model.\n \nIn several studies, the prolonged exposure to talc has been associated with development of ovarian cancer.

The experimental animals were allocated into four groups having seven rats each. Groups 1 and 2 served as controls, where the rats in Group 1 did not receive any intervention and Group 2 received intravaginal saline. Groups 3 and 4 received intravaginal or perineal talc application, respectively. Talc was applied for 3 months on a daily basis. Histopathological changes in the peritoneum and female genital system were evaluated. For statistical analyses, Fisher's exact test was carried out using SPSS. In both the groups exposed to talc (Groups 3 and 4), evidence of foreign body reaction and infection, along with an increase in inflammatory cells, were found in all the genital tissues. Genital infection was observed in 12 rats in the study group and 2 rats in the control group. Neoplastic change was not found. However, there was an increase in the number of follicles in animals exposed to talc. No peritoneal change was observed. In the groups not exposed to talc, similar infectious findings were found, but there was a statistically significant difference between the groups (Groups 1 and 2 vs. Groups 3 and 4, P > 0.05). Neoplastic change was also not observed in these groups. Four groups were compared in terms of neoplastic effects and infections. In Groups 1, 5 rats were normal, two developed vulvovaginitis and endometritis with overinfection (in both ovaries), and one developed salpingitis (in both fallopian tubes), that is, infection was found in a total of two rats. In Group 2, only one experimental animal had endometritis. All the animals in Groups 3 and 4 developed infections. Talc has unfavorable effects on the female genital system.
